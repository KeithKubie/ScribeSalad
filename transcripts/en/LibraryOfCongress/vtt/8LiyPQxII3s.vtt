00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.450
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good
evening, I'm Ann McLean

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.270
from the Library's
Music division.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.630
We are very delighted to
give our warmest welcome

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.480
to an early music luminary
and legend, Jordi Savall.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.150
So delighted to have you here.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.330
And we want to say that
this is a rare opportunity

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.160
to have a chance
to hear all three

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.690
of your incredible ensembles.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.690
Do you travel with them
as a trio very often?

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.600
Is this unusual to
have all three?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.330
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: No, for
some big programs we can

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.810
combine both.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.110
All three, yes.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.690
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And this is a
remarkable program that we have

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.340
with the, with the music
from so many cultures

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.820
and Venice the focus.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.060
Like so many of your projects
you bring together kingdoms,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.500
eras, cultures, religions
and everything.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.820
And you also have
a remarkable group

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.620
of friends that you travel with.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.290
I was thinking about Andrew
Lawrence King's comment

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.220
that you have to,
that it's like surfing

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.400
in big waves to, to
perform with you.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.440
You have to have the skills
of a virtuoso musician,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.370
you have to have the
improvisational abilities

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.000
of a jazz artist and also
to be a great accompanist.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.300
How do you manage

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.760
to get together people
like this everywhere?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:54.600
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: Well, you know
I'm in this job mostly 50 years.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.730
And in experience
you meet people.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.820
And when you meet people
and the teams goes well,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.850
in both sides you are happy.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.030
You have a good relation.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.870
And my principle always
philosophy is you can only make

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.770
nice music if you have
nice human relations

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.360
with the musicians.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.350
It's so essential.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.330
Because making music is
very intimacy experience.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.370
When you make music you are,
you are only with your heart

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.390
and you have to share
everything.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.740
The most essential emotions
and you have to do this

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.270
with people do you trust.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.840
People you feel really
close and mostly,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.860
well all the musicians
they have tonight

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.220
in the concert are good friends.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.240
Some of them, not for long time
like the group from [inaudible].

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.280
I know them only from the,
from the spring of last year.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.190
But still we have make
so nice experience

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.340
and now they are really
like friends also.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.640
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Can you say

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.280
for you this is the happiest
experience to be on stage,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.500
performing and gives
you a tremendous energy.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.800
And you'll hear this
tonight and amazingly so.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.270
I wanted to ask you
about the Byzantine music

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.010
that is the thread
woven throughout this

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.360
and you have a remarkable
ensemble here tonight.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.040
How did you meet Mr. ?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.010
? How did this come about?

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.310
[audience applauds]

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.800
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: Well
when I have a start to,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.810
to have the conception
of this program,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.880
the first difficult
question was how

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.100
to found very precise
the music from 1828,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.810
28 when the supposed
[inaudible] arrived to Venice ,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:07.620
it was necessary to have a vocal
piece exactly from this period.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.430
And so the next different
moments,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.370
the whole thousand years.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.060
I have listened through
my friends from Greek

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.250
and from Turkey (Turkey?)

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.900
different vocal ensembles
from different,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.660
mostly orthodox singers.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.310
And finally I choice [inaudible]

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.640
because I found him
really the best.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.200
And them I visit
him in Salonique.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.360
And was very simple, I have
been invited in his place

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.930
where they rehearsal and
say to them, [inaudible],

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.440
I need from them a piece
from 8 hundred, 828.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.280
Oh, no problem we
have [inaudible],

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.580
this is exactly the same time.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.030
Sounds like this,
[singing], [audience laughs].

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.000
I was like, my God.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.860
I was, we have spent the whole
day to listen pieces then I had

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.420
to make a choice of the
music for the whole concert.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.970
I have to say the first choice

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.570
from all the music
for the program.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.860
The result was program
for four hours music.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.310
[audience laughs]

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.750
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: It's
not tonight like this.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.300
But at the beginning,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.360
it was really chose-ing
the most important dates,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.430
most important moments
and chose-ing the music.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.030
But I have to say the first
concert we do in France

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.250
and in Utrecht, the
program was the first have

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.850
of the program was one
hour and 30 minutes.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.580
And the second part
a little more.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.750
Now we have to do a little,
now I think the first part is

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.540
about fifty fifth minutes
and the second part, one hour

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.690
and five minutes [inaudible].

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.980
It's difficult to, to make
a thousand years of history

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.010
and music in less
time [inaudible].

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.310
[audience laughs]

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.750
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: If you
start the piece you have

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.050
to have the time to develop
the piece otherwise it makes no

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.850
sense, you know.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:35.680
But I think what, what, it's the
difficult this concert, we have,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.190
I need people that can
play medieval music,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.210
early renaissance
music, renaissance music,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.020
early baroque music, baroque
music and still classical music

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.870
because we finish in
1797 and the last piece

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.390
of the concert it's already
more 19th century piece

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.970
as baroque music, no.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.160
Then I need really
very good musicians,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.150
they can play medieval harp,
renaissance harp, baroque harp,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.780
they play then different
type of instruments.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.120
[Inaudible] some of the
winds they play [inaudible],

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.290
they play [inaudible], they play
flutes, they play baroque flutes

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.420
and this is I think the
quality of our group.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.930
And then I have a very nice
group of oriental musicians.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.600
We have a great player
from [inaudible],

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.340
from Greece, [inaudible].

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:41.040
We have a fantastic player
of [inaudible] and, and,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.380
and Armenian [inaudible].

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.680
[Inaudible].

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.940
And then I have two great
musicians from Istanbul.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.020
[musician name] who
plays, is one of the best ?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.120
players in the world and
[musician name] is one

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.340
of the best also, oud
player, Turkish oud.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.600
This makes, allow me to play
some of the oriental music

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.400
like a Turkish mass
representing the,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.860
the attack of the Turkish
Ottoman troops to Constantinople

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.810
and other play sometimes
a Persian music.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.510
There were different
moments of the concert.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.940
And the [Inaudible] of both
arrive at certain moments

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:37.470
like nine, 1791,
a great composer,

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:43.040
Amadeus Mozart is visiting
Venice and of course,

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.370
I have choice "Alla
turca", [audience laughs]

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:52.050
which is a beautiful piece
that we normally listen

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.940
with the piano [inaudible].

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.650
But I'm sure the
Mozart was inspired

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.910
with the real Turkish musician.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.590
And you'll hear how the,
the Turkish musicians,

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.520
especially the [inaudible] are
improvising before this using

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.830
the material from Mozart.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.580
It sounds like [inaudible]
happens,

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.270
like Mozart is taking the
ideas from the [inaudible]

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.900
to build this "Alla
turca" march, no.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.600
And then we use of
course the orchestra

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.630
to play this [inaudible].

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:32.890
This my idea, in fact music
it's the only time machine

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.870
that we have today.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.010
we can travel to the
time with the music.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.710
And when you will listen this

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.940
"Alla turca" you can very
easy imagine to be in Venice

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.540
in the time of Mozart was there.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:53.110
With musicians taking the
pleasure to preform this

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.900
"Alla turca" was the Turkish
music was very a la mode.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.320
And with this music you
can feel the same emotion,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.790
theres the people from the
time [inaudible] they to have.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:12.190
As always when the history
finish from a civilization,

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.490
from a culture, sometimes the
last year the people are crazy

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.180
and makes really
absolutely crazy things.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.740
And the history says that
the last carnival before the,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.920
the troops [inaudible] arrive
here, it's arriving was one

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.790
of the most absolutely
special carnival.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.200
Everybody was like crazy and
I have choice for this moment

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.480
to represent the special moment
two beautiful [inaudible],

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.440
the songs, the gondolas,
they were singing.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.500
And from a collection from
exactly the same time,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.990
collected by Adolph[inaudible],
the master,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.100
the opera [inaudible]
in this time.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.830
And this is again you will
feel, you will hear music

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.800
which has a little
bit Mozart, popular.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.810
It's a very nice
mixed of, of styles.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.910
And you will have very, the
impression to be in the center

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.800
of Venice with the, with
the, gondolas moving

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.250
through the small canals.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.220
And after this, it's the end.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.510
And the end was the most
difficult thing to found.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.270
I have to say they
have spend a lot,

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.690
a long time to see how
can I finish this program.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.010
It's a tragedy at the end.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:52.300
It's, Venice lost his freedom
and with will be attached

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.660
to the Italy for a long time.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.300
And I found by a [inaudible]
thing, I found in Paris,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:06.100
a manuscript who was performed
in Paris, a little later

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:12.690
but represented this ideal
from tragedy revolution

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.730
and all the mystery
of this time.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.140
And this is song in
four parts, compose,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.740
arranged by Luigi [inaudible]
and Italian composer was

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.040
in Paris in this time.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.020
He has takes two
moments of two symphonies

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.010
by Beethoven and
you'll hear this.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.160
I don't tell anymore.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.580
[audience laughs] It's
really a surprise.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:41.420
It's, the music by Beethoven is
one of the most beautiful music

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:50.320
but listen this music
with singers.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.800
It's really incredible
because when it's [sings].

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.700
It is, it is really
a every time,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.390
every time my skin it becomes

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:11.020
like a. Anyway, ideas
always music.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:19.070
It's the really living
human history

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.800
because the music it takes
always about the emotion.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:30.170
And then with, when we listen
the emotion in twelve hundred

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:37.520
by the Crusades song
[inaudible] or when we listen

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.730
to the lamentation
of Constantinople

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.000
by the [inaudible] or when
we listen to the battle

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.330
of Marianne by [inaudible].

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:51.510
Every time you will feel
a very special emotion.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.120
And this is the power
of the music.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.930
We can feel today the same
emotions the people they,

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:07.260
they have a thousand years
ago, five hundred years ago,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.560
three hundred years ago.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.250
And this is the great
power of the music.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.780
And this is why I do music.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.830
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And you've said
that for you there are two types

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.510
of music, sleeping music
and and contemporary music.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.070
[audience laughs]

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.150
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: Yes,
this is a [inaudible].

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:34.080
Many times they tell me,
playing ancient music.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:41.120
And my answer is always
there's no ancient music.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.790
Somebody will have the idea

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:50.090
to say the Shakespeare is
ancient, ancient theater.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:55.000
Nobody will think the, the plays

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.060
from [inaudible]
this old theater.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.300
This is contemporary
theater always.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.520
And with the music I think the
same, we have old manuscripts,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:12.860
ancient manuscripts,
ancient printings

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:18.770
but when you play the music,
when you sing the music,

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.520
the music becomes
your contemporary.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.590
Because the music
it's only finished,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.470
it's only well not
finished, it's never finished.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.480
The musicians part is beautiful.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:38.040
But music becomes a new
life every time the singer

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.200
and musician plays.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.990
And this, it's long and
we are singing and playing

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.410
and when we stop, music stop.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:16:02.210
And what remains, what remains
after this, the memory, memory.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:09.180
Ah, ah Voltaire says with "
sans les sens y pas de memoire".

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:16.300
The sense, all the things that
touch us, it makes our memory.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:21.230
We don't, we remember only
the things that touching us.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:28.150
A nice pasta, [audience
laughs], a nice beautiful breeze

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:33.230
and the sun and the afternoon.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.040
A beautiful person.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.860
We remember from the, the nice
times, also the very bad things.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.910
But human beings has tendence
to forgot the bad things

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.250
and to remember the best things.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.040
And this is the quality
of the music.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.550
For this is so important to play
the music with the old emotion

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.910
and all the beauty because only

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:03.580
like this we will remember
this moment forever, you know.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:09.210
And I think this is a
quality that's possible

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:15.670
because with music
we cannot lie.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.160
As you know, many
people are lying today.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.390
[audience laughs] And it's
very easy to lie with the words

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.970
but with the music
no, it's not possible.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.640
Even the most [inaudible]
person,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.590
the person who has
no idea about music,

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.430
will feel if a singer is
singing with emotion or not.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.320
It's not necessary to
start in conservatory

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.650
to know about musicology.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.070
Everybody and hear every singer
sing with emotion or not.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.540
If a musician is
playing with sensitive,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.990
sensibility and pleasure.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.530
And this, I think, is
the most important thing.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:09.400
And this is why the music
remains a fantastic source

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.460
of dialogue, of comprehension

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.150
of sharing experience,
building bridges.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.100
Because you will see tonight
we have 14 different varieties,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.600
the first soprano is from
Morocco, the second is

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.350
from Italy, contralto is from
the Basque land, the tenor is

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.370
from Catalonia, the
base is from Italy.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.420
We have the musicians
from Istanbul,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.650
from Armenia, from Greece.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.820
We have the vocal
ensemble from Salonique

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.670
and from the musicians we
have the first violins from,

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.670
from Argentina, the cello from
Hungary, the [inaudible] one

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.210
from Germany, the
other from Austria.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:57.480
The harp from England, the
guitar from Spain and etc tetra.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.880
And this is, but this is,
and still we are a family.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.830
And we share the music
with great joy and respect.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.130
And the thing is this is
the best thing to do today.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:18.860
To show the, even with the
very strong differences,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.550
we can be very well together.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.580
The diversity is not a tragedy.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:30.880
It's a country and your country
it's the best example today.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.050
How a country is built,
extraordinary diversity

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.430
of cultures and has
living together

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.660
for so many hundred years.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.510
Thank you.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:59.960
[audience applauds]

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.320
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: I need a bow.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.030
I need a bow.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.270
I don't see any bow.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:11.070
Can play like a guitar but.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.370
One moment.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.670
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You know
while he's asking for the bow,

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.440
we should say that in our
cases tonight, if you have time

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.410
to look at them, there
a number of rare items

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.950
that show the history of Venice
as a music publishing center.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.530
So for example we have
have the famous auhexitan

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.640
which was the first by Petrucci,
the first score printed

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.610
in musical movable type.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.570
The first musical score
printed in movable type.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.170
So that's on display tonight.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.210
We also have, I believe
the eighth book

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:44.340
of the Monteverde
madrigals [inaudible]

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.050
and a number other
of very rare items.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:53.060
Venice was a printing center and
so printers like [inaudible],

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:59.670
Dorea, Gardona and others were
making it a commercial hub

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:00.970
for that.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.270
It was also a home
for gamba making

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.820
which I was thinking Mr.
Savall would talk about.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.210
Oh, thank you so much.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:14.570
This instrument he's kind enough
to demonstrate briefly for us is

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.290
by Peter Rumboughs,
1708 it's part

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:21.510
of the Library's Wilson's files.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:23:09.040
[Jordi Savall tunes instrument]

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.910
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: This
is a viola gumba.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.440
In fact it's like a
lute with the bow.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.510
We have the same
feeling as a lute.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:49.100
[music]

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.810
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: And [inaudible]
it's not playing everyday.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.110
[audience laughter].

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.410
She's a little...undormi
[audience laughter].

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:58.730
But anyway [inaudible].

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:06.840
As you can see, as is typical

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.790
from the viola gumba,
seven strings.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:21.870
This is one of the reasons
why people abandon the viola,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:27.440
[audience laughter],
it's too many strings.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.610
[audience laughter] And it's
seven frets making the divisions

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.030
and this is not for
helping to tune.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:42.510
It's more to help the
quality of open song.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:25:06.100
[music]

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.200
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: And on of
the [inaudible] of the viola,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:18.950
we don't take the bow like
the violin, it's the cello,

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.570
[inaudible] was the
base of the violin.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:26.160
The name of the cello

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.900
in the beginning before the
[inaudible] was the villo.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.570
La base, le villo.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:34.900
Your arm was like this.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:42.200
If you play it with the
instrument in this position,

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.710
like it was the beginning,
before the violin.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.670
Two families of bows, the viola
[inaudible], play on the arm.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:58.370
And this is a natural position.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:06.910
And the contrary of the
gamba position this is not,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.310
[inaudible].

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.070
This is more natural.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:18.930
This is a very natural position.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.570
And the reason after this time,

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:27.310
it's not possible to
make tension here.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:35.170
Like this you can control
tension with your fingers.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.540
[inaudible] control the music.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.290
Everything you are
doing, soft, [inaudible],

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:49.010
crescendo [inaudible]
is made by this finger.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:50.310
[inaudible].

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.890
This was so important the
[inaudible] finger was called

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.190
"lamb la music".

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:06.040
[inaudible] It was a
connection with feeling.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:14.330
And well, I will play
you a little piece

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.510
to see how it sounds
the instrument.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:28:44.510
[tuning instrument]

00:28:44.510 --> 00:31:47.510

00:31:47.510 --> 00:32:04.070
[audience applauds]

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.640
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: We very
much would like to thank you

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.950
on behalf of the Library
for taking the time.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.290
You're very gracious to try the
instrument before your concert.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:15.040
&gt;&gt; Jordi Savall: I would like
very much to take it too.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.060
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: We'll talk,
we'll talk with the curator.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.980
But ah, we've just wanted
to say that this concert,

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.190
this extraordinary concert
of music and musicians

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.390
that you have brought
to us gives us a sense

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.180
of tremendous joy and helps us
to understand in person tonight

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.800
so much of why you are a
UNESCO artist for peace.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.280
And why we admire you and
we thank you tremendously.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.510
From the bottom of our hearts.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:55.050
[audience applauds]

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.730
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
