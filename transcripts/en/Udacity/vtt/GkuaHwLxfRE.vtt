00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.370
So, here's what the @Index annotation looks like if

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.990
we only want the city to be indexed, but

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.530
it's not the default city. So @Index, and then

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.690
we add, if not default.class, then the index, the

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.550
property name, which is city, and then here we

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.410
just specify the default value which is default city.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.080
And if the city Is created without a value,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.375
it's going to get the default city as its value and

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.590
it's not going to be indexed. We can actually also

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.950
see that in the admin console on local host.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.970
Here's two conferences that I created, and you can

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.780
see it tells us that they're not indexed, even though

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.070
these two are indexed because they have values. These

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.270
two conferences are not indexed. So, I encourage you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.430
to explore the documentation in Objectify to learn about

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.730
different ways to conditionalize how you can index your properties.
