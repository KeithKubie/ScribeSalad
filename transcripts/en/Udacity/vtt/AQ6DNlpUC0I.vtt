00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.290
So, without more pigmentation my skin is more susceptible to skin cancer?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.440
&gt;&gt; Exactly. The practice of laying out in the

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.980
sun, what some people call tanning, is actually the

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.580
process of your skin getting darker. It's producing more

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.370
melanin, more pigment to protect itself from actual sunlight.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.280
&gt;&gt; So, being tan is just my body protecting me from more sun?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.470
&gt;&gt; Exactly. It makes you think twice about laying out in the sun doesn't it?

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.
