00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
When reasoning about HTML, it's critical

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that we understand quoted strings.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They come up in almost every anchor tag,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and anchor tags are the essence of hypertext.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're the interlinks between documents, so we really need those.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They rely on quoted strings.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That means we're going to need to understand quoted strings.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It is convenient then that we are amazing at quoted strings.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You have plenty of practice with them from the previous unit.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Once again, it's time for a quiz.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Suppose that the strings we care about start with a double quote,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
end with a double quote, and in the middle

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
they can contain any number of characters except double quotes.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'd like you to write a definition for the Python function t_string

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and submit it via the interpreter.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And just to make this a bit clearer, we should definitely accept quoted strings like

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
cuneiform or sumerian writing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But we should not accept 30th century BCE

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because it doesn't start and end with quotes,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and we should not accept this string which has an escaped double quote.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We may want to get to that later, but for now, don't worry about escaped double quotes.

00:01:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Go to it. Submit via the interpreter.
