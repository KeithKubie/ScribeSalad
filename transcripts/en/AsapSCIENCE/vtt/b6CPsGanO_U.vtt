00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
You've likely heard about the effects climate change is having on our planet and specifically in the Arctic

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120
which is warming twice as fast. But what would actually happen

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120
if all the ice melted on Earth.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.560
Bill: I can help with that! When you and I drink water

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.900
We drink non-salty water, we drink fresh water

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.000
Of all the water in the world most of it is salty, just 3% is not salty

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.040
Now of that 3%, you can't get to most of that because 70% of that 3%

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.480
is FROZEN - thirty million cubic kilometers of frozen water!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.860
It's so much frozen water, so much ice that if you put a layer of it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.320
a thousand meters thick, it would cover North America

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.320
That's a lot of frozen water people!

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.460
On land frozen  forms glaciers, icesheets, permafrost and snow

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.960
but the Arctic is largely ocean so there it takes the form

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.960
of floating sea ice like icebergs and because it's in direct contact with warming waters

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.480
Sea ice will be the first to melt as global temperatures rise

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.840
In fact this year NASA reported that the extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.660
for January, February, April, May and June 2016

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.700
Bill: So the world is getting warmer and the ice is melting

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.500
Pretty soon you'll be able to drive your ship from Europe to Russia,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.080
right over the North Pole, with no ice in the way.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.720
That's good for certain shipping companies maybe, but for the marine species: the polar bears, the walruses,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.580
the seals! They don't have their own habitats. They're all going away, they're melting out from under them.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.660
And ocean dwelling animals like bowhead whales and narwhals aren't immune to these changes either.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.880
As sea ice melts energy and oil companies are taking it as an opportunity to search

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.940
further north for untapped resources using a process known as seismic blasting

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.180
they shoot air explosions into the water in an effort to map the ocean floor

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.280
and find oil. Of course, this has detrimental effects on the whole ecosystem of the Arctic ocean

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.040
while also causing physical trauma and habitat relocation in whales.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.340
In terms of sea levels, melting sea ice won't have much of an effect.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.520
This is because the floating ice already displaces roughly the same amount of water

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.920
as it would produce when it melts, so that effect would be negligible.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.460
Furthermore, of the majority of Earth's ice, more than 95% is land-based

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.860
and contained mostly in enormous ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antartica

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.860
where there are entire mountain ranges almost as big as the alps, completely buried in ice

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.500
So, what if all the ice on land melts?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
Bill: If all this ice melts, the ocean's gonna have more water in it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.860
So the sea levels, as measured from the coasts,  is gonna go up.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.060
It's gonna go up 70 meters. That's a long way people. Half the world's citizens

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.980
live on sea coasts. That's where the, uh, commerce action is.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.920
So they're gonna have to move! Where are they gonna go? And...

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.500
who's gonna pay for it?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.260
Tokyo, New York, Sao Paulo, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta are all coastal

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.340
and happen to be some of the world's biggest cities.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.600
Even a small sea level rise of only a couple feet could cause up to a trillion dollars worth of flood damage

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.800
per year. A rise of 10 meters would displace more than 630 million people

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.120
nearly 10% of the world's population.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.780
At 25 meters, 1.4 billion people, roughly 20% of humanity is left homeless

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.580
and to visualise the full 70 meters, the rising seas would drown out most

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.760
of the US Eastern seaboard, much of the West coast,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.080
the entire state of Florida, huge areas of Asia including Bangladesh

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.660
and much of Northern China and create a new inland sea in Australia.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.300
At the North and South pole of the Earth we have a lot of ice. Ice is white.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.720
Ice reflects sunlight into space.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.640
But there's a feedback mechanism, one thing leading to another. As the world gets warmer

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.380
the ice melts. As the ice melts it's reflecting less sunlight into space

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.860
which lets the world get warmer still. The sunlight is absorbed

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.380
by the dark , liquid ocean. So as the ice melts

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.100
the world gets warmer. And the sea gets fresher.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.020
Currently the world's oceans are criss crossed by a set of currents that act as a giant conveyer belt.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.120
And these currents are powered in part by the differences in the saltiness

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.280
between one part of the ocean and another.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.740
So, if a melting ice sheet in Greenland dumps a whole bunch of non-salty, fresh water into the North Atlantic

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.180
it's possible that it could disrupt the currents.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
Bill: So the conveyer belt takes chemicals, takes nutrients around the world,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.920
which feed plankton,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.860
which feed fish,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.240
which feed us.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.520
Half of the oxygen you breathe is made by plants in the ocean.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.740
So you don't wanna mess with this.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.180
Furthermore, as that sea surface gets warmer,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.340
off of Greenland, the Gulf Stream will probably shift a little bit,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.960
and if that shifts, what keeps Europe warm right now,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.100
May not keep Europe as warm. So the crops are gonna have to be grown elsewhere

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.900
and who's gonna grow them and  who's gonna ship them around and who's gonna feed each other

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.720
and what's going on?! This is serious business! When you go melting the ice.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.380
We actually went up to the Arctic to see the current state of things first hand

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.860
while documenting it all and were absolutely shocked by what we found.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.200
Click here to watch our documentary, The End of the Arctic,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.960
where we learn about an Inuit communities fight to defend their human rights

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.260
against oil companies and the Canadian government

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.840
all while trying to save the Arctic from the drastic effects of climate change

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.140
and seismic blasting.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.100
You can help spread awareness by sharing the video and signing our petition

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.140
to put pressure on the governement to prevent seismic blasting in the Arctic

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.900
which would have detrimental, long-lasting effects on the wildlife

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.220
and the Inuit people living in Northern Canada.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.020
