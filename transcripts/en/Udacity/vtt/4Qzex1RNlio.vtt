00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.280
So maybe this becomes
clear with an example so

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.080
we go back to the Pac-Man example,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.990
at all times you want to eat ghosts, eat
dots, eat big dots, and avoid ghosts.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.650
It's sort of all happening
at the same time.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.490
It's just at any given point in time
one of them happens to be ascended.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah that example
makes more sense to me than

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.950
in the navigation example.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.900
&gt;&gt; Sure, but I think conceptually
they're the same it's just it's easier

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.860
to think about it.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.940
In fact we actually have a name for

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.808
these kind of things,
we call them predator-prey scenarios.

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:32.188
&gt;&gt; Who's we?

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.030
&gt;&gt; You and me.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.947
So here-
&gt;&gt; No, no, no I don't call them that.

00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:41.368
&gt;&gt; Yes you do this is a pretty, yeah
well okay the literature is replete with

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:44.133
examples of things called predator-prey.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.396
Where you basically want to go around
eating as much as you can, but

00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:49.683
there's some predator
who's trying to you.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:51.577
So you're always trying to eat,
because you have to eat or

00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:53.340
otherwise you die of starvation.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.120
But you have to avoid a predator
otherwise you die while the other one is

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.410
not dying of starvation.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.680
And Pac-Man is just
an example of predator-prey.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.270
Right?
Pac-Man

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.649
needs to eat all of these things.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.860
Meanwhile there are predators out
there trying to eat it and so

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.890
they're kind of competing goals
happening at the same time.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.428
I need to eat,
I need to avoid being eaten.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:14.645
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:15.213
Right?
And

00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:16.693
all of these are really
examples of that,

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:18.207
they even use the word eat and
avoid them.

00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:22.070
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So I need to eat my food and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.070
at the same time I need
to avoid being eaten.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.320
And occasionally because I live
in a magical world where suddenly

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.040
rabbits become as big as wolves,
I can occasionally the wolf.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.420
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.100
&gt;&gt; Right, but once you think about it
that way you can stop thinking about,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.600
I mean, so I'm not trying to
make a gigantic point here.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.060
Other than we can think about actions
as actions we're executing or

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.490
we can think about these options as
things that are accomplishing goals.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.040
And this is where goal abstraction
comes from in my title here.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.410
That really all of these options
are about accomplishing different goals,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.370
you're trying to always
accomplish those goals.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.600
Some goals are more important
others at any given point in time.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.370
And options in fact really make this
sort of nice to think about because

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.558
of beta.

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:11.620
Because beta captures sort of
the probability that we might terminate

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.580
in a state.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.870
&gt;From this sort of goal obstruction point
of view you could think about this as

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.000
either the probability that I've
succeeded in executing that option,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.530
that is I have accomplished my goal.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.130
Or that another goal has
become important and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.830
I need to interrupt whatever goal I
was paying attention to at the time.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.630
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.130
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.185
So I like this notion of thinking about
options, or thinking about actions

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:40.290
as always accomplishing goals and
always sort of happening in parallel.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.460
Options are easier to think about than
primitive actions that way because

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.020
in fact when we define the options I
think we sort of naturally think of them

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.050
as accomplishing goals.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.305
That's sort of the whole point.

00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:52.350
And primitive actions are sort of so
low level they don't really have,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.210
other than primitive goals like
moving left or moving right, they

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.440
don't really have big high level things
that they're trying to accomplish.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.374
But options almost always do, that's why
they're useful and that's why people

00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:05.150
tend to come up with the ones they tend
to come up with, so it seems to me.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.210
And so we think about managing
goals then we actually end up

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.070
with a different way of
thinking about this problem.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.230
And we move from a world where
we're worrying about sequencing and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.988
hierarchical abstractions to a world
where we think about managing and

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:20.925
arbitrating between goals.

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:23.640
Yeah, so let me write down different
ways you might do that because

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.630
it turns out there's a whole
subfield that worries about

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.930
thinking about the problem this way.
