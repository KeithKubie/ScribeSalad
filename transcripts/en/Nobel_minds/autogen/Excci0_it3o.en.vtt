electron microscope I think it's a

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059
electron microscope I think it's a
 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.359
electron microscope I think it's a
revolution because now it's possible to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
revolution because now it's possible to
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.019
revolution because now it's possible to
extract molecules from the cell that are

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
extract molecules from the cell that are
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.720
extract molecules from the cell that are
in in the same environment as they're

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
in in the same environment as they're
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.290
in in the same environment as they're
usually in a Cell in in the water and

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300
usually in a Cell in in the water and
 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.599
usually in a Cell in in the water and
not also see the structures of these

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
not also see the structures of these
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970
not also see the structures of these
molecules but also see how they interact

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
molecules but also see how they interact
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.150
molecules but also see how they interact
with each other how how they operate one

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
with each other how how they operate one
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.540
with each other how how they operate one
can get since the other particles

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
can get since the other particles
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.369
can get since the other particles
molecules that are studied are in

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
molecules that are studied are in
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.190
molecules that are studied are in
solution they are frozen in a different

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
solution they are frozen in a different
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380
solution they are frozen in a different
state and one can then combine the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
state and one can then combine the
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869
state and one can then combine the
different pictures to to understand

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
different pictures to to understand
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.240
different pictures to to understand
function as well dynamics and that's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
function as well dynamics and that's
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.110
function as well dynamics and that's
just our key to understanding life

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120
just our key to understanding life
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.700
just our key to understanding life
everybody knows for the microscope is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
everybody knows for the microscope is
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.599
everybody knows for the microscope is
better how does this one look like it's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
better how does this one look like it's
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.900
better how does this one look like it's
a big blue box that is I think in here

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
a big blue box that is I think in here
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329
a big blue box that is I think in here
three four times be taller than we are

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
three four times be taller than we are
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.000
three four times be taller than we are
and and then there is a chamber where

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
and and then there is a chamber where
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.469
and and then there is a chamber where
one place is a sample and then it's

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
one place is a sample and then it's
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.170
one place is a sample and then it's
illuminated inside there's vacuum inside

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180
illuminated inside there's vacuum inside
 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.390
illuminated inside there's vacuum inside
and and then there's the camera which is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400
and and then there's the camera which is
 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.590
and and then there's the camera which is
one of the key components oh they say

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600
one of the key components oh they say
 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.510
one of the key components oh they say
they keep components developed most

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520
they keep components developed most
 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.050
they keep components developed most
recently that is they use them to detect

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060
recently that is they use them to detect
 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.800
recently that is they use them to detect
the pictures and monitor it so it's like

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810
the pictures and monitor it so it's like
 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.920
the pictures and monitor it so it's like
a girl taking like a room it's a whole

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930
a girl taking like a room it's a whole
 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.710
a girl taking like a room it's a whole
room yeah and it must be very stable the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720
room yeah and it must be very stable the
 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.240
room yeah and it must be very stable the
floor must be stable because the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250
floor must be stable because the
 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.970
floor must be stable because the
sensitive to vibrations and so so it's

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980
sensitive to vibrations and so so it's
 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.110
sensitive to vibrations and so so it's
it's a big expensive machine there's one

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120
it's a big expensive machine there's one
 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.530
it's a big expensive machine there's one
in Stockholm which is shared between

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540
in Stockholm which is shared between
 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.120
in Stockholm which is shared between
Stockholm University and other

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130
Stockholm University and other
 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.880
Stockholm University and other
universities and it's I love love and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
universities and it's I love love and
 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.969
universities and it's I love love and
then there's fun in email so yes we do

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979
then there's fun in email so yes we do
 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.460
then there's fun in email so yes we do
use it we just started recently because

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470
use it we just started recently because
 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.560
use it we just started recently because
it's the instrument is no because there

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570
it's the instrument is no because there
 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.040
it's the instrument is no because there
we we do use it in my research also I

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050
we we do use it in my research also I
 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.620
we we do use it in my research also I
think a lot of people are really

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630
think a lot of people are really
 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.330
think a lot of people are really
interested in using the instrument

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
interested in using the instrument
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.220
interested in using the instrument
because it can provide so much

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
because it can provide so much
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.510
because it can provide so much
information that is it's it's very

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520
information that is it's it's very
 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.240
information that is it's it's very
important for understanding function so

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250
important for understanding function so
 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.870
important for understanding function so
what would be your dream discovery at

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880
what would be your dream discovery at
 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.380
what would be your dream discovery at
this moment I think for for the future I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390
this moment I think for for the future I
 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.449
this moment I think for for the future I
mean first of all it is to see the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459
mean first of all it is to see the
 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.080
mean first of all it is to see the
molecules we work on that's in itself

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090
molecules we work on that's in itself
 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.010
molecules we work on that's in itself
it's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020
it's
 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.470
it's
it's something very warm rewarding to be

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480
it's something very warm rewarding to be
 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.260
it's something very warm rewarding to be
able to see the objects you work on but

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
able to see the objects you work on but
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.720
able to see the objects you work on but
I think for the for the future and which

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730
I think for the for the future and which
 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.240
I think for the for the future and which
is now more and more become possible

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
is now more and more become possible
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.870
is now more and more become possible
Lister to observe as I mentioned before

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880
Lister to observe as I mentioned before
 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.430
Lister to observe as I mentioned before
these different states that one can

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440
these different states that one can
 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.550
these different states that one can
freeze the sample while freeze the the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
freeze the sample while freeze the the
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.620
freeze the sample while freeze the the
molecules why they do something to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630
molecules why they do something to
 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.990
molecules why they do something to
actually combine the information into a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000
actually combine the information into a
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.920
actually combine the information into a
movie or they understand the dynamics

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930
movie or they understand the dynamics
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.210
movie or they understand the dynamics
how how they interact what they do how

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
how how they interact what they do how
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.280
how how they interact what they do how
what what happens in inside the cell I

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290
what what happens in inside the cell I
 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.020
what what happens in inside the cell I
mean this is with purified proteins of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030
mean this is with purified proteins of
 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.390
mean this is with purified proteins of
course but one can venom I've tried to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
course but one can venom I've tried to
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.370
course but one can venom I've tried to
understand what happens inside the cell

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
understand what happens inside the cell
 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.780
understand what happens inside the cell
is really there any more secrets that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790
is really there any more secrets that
 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.230
is really there any more secrets that
are not revealed in the living cell

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240
are not revealed in the living cell
 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.160
are not revealed in the living cell
animal and not yet because the technique

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170
animal and not yet because the technique
 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.520
animal and not yet because the technique
or the style at the status is relatively

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530
or the style at the status is relatively
 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.240
or the style at the status is relatively
new so the possibilities to use this

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
new so the possibilities to use this
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.910
new so the possibilities to use this
technique to in this way way that is

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920
technique to in this way way that is
 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.640
technique to in this way way that is
used today it has only been possible

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650
used today it has only been possible
 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.720
used today it has only been possible
since just a couple of years so I think

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730
since just a couple of years so I think
 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.180
since just a couple of years so I think
now it's an explosion and a research and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190
now it's an explosion and a research and
 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.370
now it's an explosion and a research and
what is limiting now it's its access to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380
what is limiting now it's its access to
 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.770
what is limiting now it's its access to
the microscope actually

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
the microscope actually
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.650
the microscope actually
so it's a waiting time it's very long I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660
so it's a waiting time it's very long I
 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.700
so it's a waiting time it's very long I
think with no new microscopes and more

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710
think with no new microscopes and more
 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.760
think with no new microscopes and more
microscopes I think I'm there there's a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770
microscopes I think I'm there there's a
 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.550
microscopes I think I'm there there's a
lot to be seen

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560
lot to be seen
 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.320
lot to be seen
there's also a very long way to develop

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330
there's also a very long way to develop
 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.810
there's also a very long way to develop
this one it's like since 70s or 80s what

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
this one it's like since 70s or 80s what
 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.770
this one it's like since 70s or 80s what
was the main obstacle I think it's I

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
was the main obstacle I think it's I
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.170
was the main obstacle I think it's I
mean from the beginning the problem was

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
mean from the beginning the problem was
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.590
mean from the beginning the problem was
that studies of biological objects in an

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
that studies of biological objects in an
 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.330
that studies of biological objects in an
electron microscope it's not trivial

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
electron microscope it's not trivial
 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.159
electron microscope it's not trivial
because there is vacuum inside which the

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169
because there is vacuum inside which the
 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.270
because there is vacuum inside which the
biological samples contain primarily

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280
biological samples contain primarily
 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.970
biological samples contain primarily
water so they dry inside and shape

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980
water so they dry inside and shape
 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.800

special way of freezing the water the

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370
special way of freezing the water the
 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.270
special way of freezing the water the
solution yes divided waters yes yes so

the idea is that in one freeze normally

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460
the idea is that in one freeze normally
 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.390
the idea is that in one freeze normally
when one freezes water ice crystals are

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400
when one freezes water ice crystals are
 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.189
when one freezes water ice crystals are
formed and ice crystals diffract

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199
formed and ice crystals diffract
 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.610
formed and ice crystals diffract
electrons so that the information is

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620
electrons so that the information is
 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.490
electrons so that the information is
lost because the electrons go diffracted

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500
lost because the electrons go diffracted
 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.850
lost because the electrons go diffracted
always so the idea was to to freeze the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860
always so the idea was to to freeze the
 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.879
always so the idea was to to freeze the
water so fast that the crystals would

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889
water so fast that the crystals would
 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.300
water so fast that the crystals would
not have time to form so and this is

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310
not have time to form so and this is
 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.310
not have time to form so and this is
called vitrified water or a like a glass

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320
called vitrified water or a like a glass
 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.620
called vitrified water or a like a glass
it's the same principle as glass in a

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630
it's the same principle as glass in a
 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.270
it's the same principle as glass in a
window it's also a liquid all the

window it's also a liquid all the
 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.310
window it's also a liquid all the
molecules are disordered and they are

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320
molecules are disordered and they are
 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.310
molecules are disordered and they are
they are not crystallized but because

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320
they are not crystallized but because
 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.920
they are not crystallized but because
it's like a liquid that is like a solid

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930
it's like a liquid that is like a solid
 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.140
it's like a liquid that is like a solid
but it's actually on windows you can see

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150
but it's actually on windows you can see
 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.420
but it's actually on windows you can see
in the lower part of all all the houses

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430
in the lower part of all all the houses
 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.010
in the lower part of all all the houses
the windows a little bit thicker and

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020
the windows a little bit thicker and
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.610
the windows a little bit thicker and
it's the same way here yes right right

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620
it's the same way here yes right right
 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.490
it's the same way here yes right right
and so it means the same way here freeze

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500
and so it means the same way here freeze
 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.070
and so it means the same way here freeze
water so far rapidly that that the

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080
water so far rapidly that that the
 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.830
water so far rapidly that that the
crystals don't have time to be formed

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840
crystals don't have time to be formed
 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.969
crystals don't have time to be formed
and it's it's like a uniform glass that

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979
and it's it's like a uniform glass that
 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.490
and it's it's like a uniform glass that
is transparent or actually it does

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500
is transparent or actually it does
 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.439
is transparent or actually it does
interact with electrons but in a uniform

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:08.449
interact with electrons but in a uniform
 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.219
interact with electrons but in a uniform
way and this allowed the technique to be

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229
way and this allowed the technique to be
 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:13.810
way and this allowed the technique to be
developed such that contrast could be

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820
developed such that contrast could be
 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.760
developed such that contrast could be
increased and anyone could see the

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770
increased and anyone could see the
 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.240
increased and anyone could see the
molecules

detectors which was the latest

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210
detectors which was the latest
 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.400
detectors which was the latest
breakthrough they are not perfect there

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.410
breakthrough they are not perfect there
 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.930
breakthrough they are not perfect there
is still a lot to do to improve them

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940
is still a lot to do to improve them
 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.110
is still a lot to do to improve them
also the sample preparation methods

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120
also the sample preparation methods
 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.640
also the sample preparation methods
could be improved way the cryo stage and

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:45.650
could be improved way the cryo stage and
 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.680
could be improved way the cryo stage and
the weather or kept that the temperature

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:47.690
the weather or kept that the temperature
 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.460
the weather or kept that the temperature
is kept constant because the variation

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.470
is kept constant because the variation
 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.900
is kept constant because the variation
in the temperature can cause movement so

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:55.910
in the temperature can cause movement so
 

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.480
in the temperature can cause movement so
so there are lot of techniques and also

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.490
so there are lot of techniques and also
 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.670
so there are lot of techniques and also
I mean it's in principle very little

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680
I mean it's in principle very little
 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.960
I mean it's in principle very little
sample is needed to for the studies but

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:04.970
sample is needed to for the studies but
 

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.450
sample is needed to for the studies but
since one has to apply a droplet to this

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:07.460
since one has to apply a droplet to this
 

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.590
since one has to apply a droplet to this
grid one has to remove almost all the

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:11.600
grid one has to remove almost all the
 

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.600
grid one has to remove almost all the
sample and very very small fraction such

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:13.610
sample and very very small fraction such
 

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.580

a droplet in a bathtub that is actually
 

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.130
a droplet in a bathtub that is actually
left so if one could develop techniques

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:18.140
left so if one could develop techniques
 

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.770
left so if one could develop techniques
that would allow applying very small

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:20.780
that would allow applying very small
 

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.300
that would allow applying very small
amounts of samples and there is of

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:22.310
amounts of samples and there is of
 

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.640
amounts of samples and there is of
course my many more molecules that could

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.650
course my many more molecules that could
 

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.130
course my many more molecules that could
be studied because it's not possible to

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.140
be studied because it's not possible to
 

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.580
be studied because it's not possible to
to purify all molecules in animal at an

to purify all molecules in animal at an
 

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.370
to purify all molecules in animal at an
amount that is allowed studies so there

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:33.380
amount that is allowed studies so there
 

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.260
amount that is allowed studies so there
are not a lot of pieces that can be

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.270
are not a lot of pieces that can be
 

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.000
are not a lot of pieces that can be
improved and I think for the future it

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010
improved and I think for the future it
 

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.790
improved and I think for the future it
will

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800
will
 

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.829
will
and I think that technique has locked

00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839
and I think that technique has locked
 

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:42.050
