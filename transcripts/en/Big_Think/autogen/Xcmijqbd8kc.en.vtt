Michael Montoya here what do you think
is the evolutionary advantage to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
is the evolutionary advantage to
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.810
is the evolutionary advantage to
humanity being both musically and

humanity being both musically and
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.330
humanity being both musically and
artistically creative and where do you

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
artistically creative and where do you
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.010
artistically creative and where do you
think this initial spark of creativity

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
think this initial spark of creativity
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.790
think this initial spark of creativity
came from Michael Michael this is a

great question and susceptible to
 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.259
great question and susceptible to
speculation

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269

apparently music and art is part of the
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.580
apparently music and art is part of the
way we communicate and it's certainly

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
way we communicate and it's certainly

the way you attract mates

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
the way you attract mates
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.010
the way you attract mates
maybe I'll just put it to you that way

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020
maybe I'll just put it to you that way

musicians and artists engage other
people in a way that people who don't

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
people in a way that people who don't
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.729
people in a way that people who don't
use music and don't use art do not now

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739
use music and don't use art do not now
 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.619

there's a lot of talk about songbirds in

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629
there's a lot of talk about songbirds in
 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.700
there's a lot of talk about songbirds in
evolutionary biology and they all have

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
evolutionary biology and they all have
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150
evolutionary biology and they all have
these songs which must be pleasing to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
these songs which must be pleasing to
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.000
these songs which must be pleasing to
the ears of their potential mates and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
the ears of their potential mates and
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.680
the ears of their potential mates and
also must send messages to others of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
also must send messages to others of
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.330
also must send messages to others of
their species well I guess two other

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
their species well I guess two other
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.060
their species well I guess two other
species as well I'm angry this is my

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
species as well I'm angry this is my
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.390
species as well I'm angry this is my
territory I'm looking for a mate it's a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
territory I'm looking for a mate it's a
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.550
territory I'm looking for a mate it's a
sunny day these sort of announcements

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
sunny day these sort of announcements
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.740
sunny day these sort of announcements
are made by other species so you figure

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
are made by other species so you figure
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.469
are made by other species so you figure
humans have just taken it just a whole

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
humans have just taken it just a whole
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.929
humans have just taken it just a whole
nother level with albums and and record

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
nother level with albums and and record
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.380
nother level with albums and and record
release parties and art exhibits and art

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
release parties and art exhibits and art
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.800
release parties and art exhibits and art
museums and art galleries so it really

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
museums and art galleries so it really
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.819
museums and art galleries so it really
is deep within us and I think art

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
is deep within us and I think art
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.630
is deep within us and I think art
enriches our lives engages our brains

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
enriches our lives engages our brains
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700
enriches our lives engages our brains
and stimulates us in a way that nothing

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
and stimulates us in a way that nothing
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.819
and stimulates us in a way that nothing
else we do does so this is the only

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
else we do does so this is the only
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.870
else we do does so this is the only
speculation on my part but music

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
speculation on my part but music
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.539
speculation on my part but music
especially is certainly certainly

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
especially is certainly certainly
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.850
especially is certainly certainly
inspires us that's for sure

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
inspires us that's for sure
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.350
inspires us that's for sure
so carry on Michael turn it up loud

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
 
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420
