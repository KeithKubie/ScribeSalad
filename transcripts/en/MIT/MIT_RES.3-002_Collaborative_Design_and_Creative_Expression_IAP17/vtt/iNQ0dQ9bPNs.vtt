00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.360
GUEST SPEAKER 1: But
we got the propellers

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.410
to start spinning
and everything.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.550
But then, the first problem
was that the propellers

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.011
weren't spinning fast enough.

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:28.052
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yes This
is like the motors that

00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:29.740
were spinning the propellers.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.000
However, the motors
are too small,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.040
that it cannot provide enough
force for the drone to fly.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.490
So basically, we
disassembled everything

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.040
and we get advice
from one of the clubs

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.380
on campus, which is MITERS.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.430
And they tell us, our
drone is not going to fly.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.700
But I know people in our
class that have seen it spin.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250
Like all of the four of us.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.833
Unfortunately, we
weren't able to take

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:55.260
a picture of our initial drone.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.299
But we got inspired
by it, and so, Daren,

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.590
do you want to talk about
the transmitter and receiver.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.195
The gyroscope that we
were initially working on.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.019
GUEST SPEAKER 3: OK,
so for the basic drone,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.894
we got the basic sensors,
like the gyroscope.

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:08.460
So we managed to
get data off that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.920
and we tried to plan a simple
way to base on the balance

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.320
until hard to
distribute the power

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.470
and arrange it so that
if it tilts this way,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.805
the cycles will spin fast.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:23.024
[INAUDIBLE] I don't know
[INAUDIBLE] I mean, it might.

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:24.710
If the drone is,
again, to the side,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.307
we just add more power to the
other side to compensate for it

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:28.390
and try to keep it stable.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.200
That was the initial plan.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.850
Managed to get the
readings off the gyroscope

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.156
so we can actually distribute
the power correctly.

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:39.070
We were trying to control it
with a simple joystick using

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.260
RF transceivers, but
we managed to get--

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.660
it was working a few days
ago, then it suddenly

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.010
decided to break and die.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.340
So we just scrapped
the entire idea

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.140
and just went with
direct control.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.953
So for this [INAUDIBLE]
we just tried to--

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:54.453
OK.

00:01:54.453 --> 00:01:55.828
As soon as we had
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:55.828 --> 00:01:58.830
we had the [INAUDIBLE] control.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.109
And I rotate the fan spin, so--

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.650
GUEST SPEAKER 2:
Yes, so right now we

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.759
have the joystick controlling
so it has four directions.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.700
It is going up.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.200
Like that.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.128
We should plug this in first.

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:16.440
Sorry.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.030
GUEST SPEAKER: So we scrapped
our goal to make a drone,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.550
because it just wouldn't work.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.514
So we just got all the
pieces from our drone

00:02:25.514 --> 00:02:27.680
and then put it all together
to make something else.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.000
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yeah, so the
basic science is the same.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.850
Like we used-- we didn't
use the motor shield,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.240
because we have a motor
driver, which is a chip that

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.130
can control the propeller.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.450
So it's the same basic idea
of how the drone works, and we

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.560
want to use the joystick.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.050
This is to control the
drone, as well, like up

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.310
and down control the speed
and left and right control

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.160
the servo motor that is
spinning underneath, which

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.000
is our fan right now.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.150
So right now, I'll
control the car.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.540
It now is accelerating the fan.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.140
Sorry, decelerating.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.770
Yeah.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.270
And then it's going
back to the loop

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.870
and going to the same speed
now and then accelerates up.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.010
[INAUDIBLE] So now it's
accelerating, right now.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.910
So if you want to turn a
fan right now, just like--

00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:28.630
OK, I guess the servo doesn't
like-- it works this morning,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.130
but--

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.250
OK, so maybe--

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.940
Yeah.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.370
Sorry I didn't really
make the thing work,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.390
but it actually does work--

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.800
just like an hour ago, as well.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.420
So we get the common sense
of how a drone works,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.590
even we're maybe
taking too much--

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.602
we were envisioning
wanting to build a drone,

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:02.685
but then realized that
there's so much things need

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:03.680
to consider.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.200
But the learning process
teaches us how to build a drone,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.280
and we actually went to MITERS.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.186
Do you want to say?

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.894
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK,
so we went to MITERS

00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:17.250
and then we showed them our
original drone design, which

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.208
is like-- they looked at
it and they were like,

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:23.140
oh it's not going to work,
because the motor driver can't

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.400
take that much power
to fly a drone.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.700
And then we need a really,
really big battery to power

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.930
the motors, and we
didn't have the battery

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.420
to supply the power
in the first place.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.020
So they're just like,
hey, we have some pieces

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.280
of a drone lying around.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.710
You guys should
put one together.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.900
So we put one together.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.780
Here it is.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.986
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:45.150
Well the thing
is, it is too big,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.220
so it's very hard to
control it inside the room.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.180
You need a very big
land of parking lot

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.756
or like a grass
land or something,

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:54.550
so that you can actually fly it.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.340
So actually fly it,
and this is the basic--

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.820
the transmitter they
lent us to fly it.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.230
And so I will
introduce this part.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.670
So these are the stronger,
brush-less motors.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.330
They can actually spin,
and unfortunately we

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.070
break the propellers.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.740
That is initially all,
which is bigger than that.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.970
But we used our propellers, as
well, to assemble to this part,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.520
and we reprogrammed the--
so people in the MITERS

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.270
helped us reprogram the
whole speed controllers

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.640
and they get a really good
flight controllers that

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.584
can control the four motors over
here, and let's see, actually.

00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:39.470
[INAUDIBLE] Can we
make it into the fan?

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.170
Like I will be really...

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.383
GUEST SPEAKER 4: It can
be like a something that

00:05:46.383 --> 00:05:48.080
cleans the floor.
