MALE SPEAKER: Welcome, Googlers.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.910
I've got a really cool
speaker for you today.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.060
So she's done some amazing
volunteer and work with NGOs

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.760
as a professional now
in Rwanda and Ghana,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.220
and she's going to share the
stories of the people she works

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.480
with, but more importantly, how
she's found to make development

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.160
sustainable and not reliant just
on people swooping in and then

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.180
swooping out.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.700
And I think that
the story should

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.740
tell a really poignant
and meaningful,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.560
especially going into the
Googler Gives time of the year.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.170
So with that, I'm going to
let Kelsey tell her story,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.450
then we're going to switch
to a Q&amp;A in little bit.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.477
Kelsey?

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:39.310
KELSEY FINNEGAN: OK.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.620
Hi everyone.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.860
Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.140
I'm Kelsey Finnegan,
as James said,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.020
and I am actually
from the Bay Area.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm from Dublin in the
East Bay, but I live now

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.280
in Kigali, Rwanda.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.090
So I'm here today because
I want to tell you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.820
about my work the last six
years in Ghana and Rwanda.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.100
But I also hope that I can
give you some tangible examples

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.560
of ways that you
can be effective

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.840
if you want to do something
in the developing world.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.570
So I think it's
important to point out

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.180
that I didn't start out
wanting to have this career.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.790
I never dreamed of
living in Africa.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.860
And when I was studying at UCSB,
I was studying communication,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.930
and Africa and
international development

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.570
could not have been
further from my mind.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.120
I was removed and
distant, and I assumed

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.830
that while it was unfortunate,
the circumstances and lives

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.000
of people on the other
side of the world

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.670
weren't inextricably
linked to mine.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.300
I was a student.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.900
I could barely pay
my rent on time.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.040
I couldn't really
take care of myself,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.580
so I assumed that
that meant that I was

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.350
powerless to help other people.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.360
I didn't realize how wrong
I was until curiosity

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.876
and a free summer took me to
a volunteer trip in Ghana.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.100
I was placed to be an assistant
teacher in a kindergarten

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.250
class.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.070
And I, by the way, was
not a trained teacher.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.850
Communication at UCSB
doesn't really give you that.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.830
So I was given a class of
60 wild five-year-old kids,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.410
and the teacher
that I was supposed

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.830
to be working with usually
used my presence as a way

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.280
to go get her hair
or nails done.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.670
So for the most part,
I was on my own.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.060
So I decided to
focus on literacy.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.500
And we spent most of our time
on the alphabet and numbers.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.750
So one day towards
the end of my trip,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.620
I was assessing them to
see how far they actually

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.350
knew with their literacy.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.130
And I was testing them on
letters of the alphabet.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.820
And I realized
throughout the day

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.410
that actually, they had not
understood a single thing

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.160
that I'd taught them the entire
time that I had been there,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.610
and that they had
just tricked me

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.920
into making it seem like they
knew what I was teaching them.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.990
So I left that day, and then
I left Ghana a few days later,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.050
and I was completely devastated.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.964
I knew that if I had actually
known what I was doing,

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.880
I would have been able
to identify the problem

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.230
and help them.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.800
But instead, I'd
wasted their time,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.070
and even more so,
I'd also wasted mine

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.070
because they were going to
be moved up through a system.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.680
They were going to graduate
to the next grade level.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.200
And I realized that they
were going to consistently

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.640
be in a system that could
never teach them to read.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.360
And instead of actually
being effective,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.250
I had wasted two months
of their academic career.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.980
And I was really upset
because it was very clear

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.630
that they were five years
old and the entire trajectory

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.130
of their lives had
already been decided.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.930
So I had so wanted
to be effective,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.310
but instead, my
presence had probably

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.780
left them in a worse state.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.530
And a lot of that
was because I went

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.660
in with my own agenda
and assumptions of what

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.410
I thought that they needed.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.550
So I went back to
the States, but I

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.170
found it really impossible
to resume normal life.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.180
And I wanted to make it
right, and even more so, I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.910
wanted to find a
way to actually help

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.370
the community in an effective
and sustainable way.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.100
So I went back to
Ghana on my own,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.030
and there I actually met
a woman named Elizabeth.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.810
And so several years
before, Elizabeth

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.890
had started gathering
street children under a tree

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.900
and teaching them, and
eventually, her home

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.700
had turned into a
school and an orphanage.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.670
But I was surprised by the state
that the kids were living in.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.812
They struggled to
find food every day.

00:04:58.812 --> 00:05:02.130
They didn't have any
infrastructure, didn't really

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.580
have books or pencils.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.080
And a lot of people had passed
through this place, which

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.000
was called Happy
Kids Orphanage, a lot

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.170
of local and international
people, but all of them

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.470
had felt too overwhelmed
to actually help

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.750
Elizabeth improve it.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.610
So we started working
together, and we

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.730
decided to work piece by piece.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.630
So the children didn't have a
place to sleep at Happy Kids.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.490
So that was our first goal.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.220
And I didn't know
how to fund raise,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.930
but I decided to take a
chance and sent out an e-mail

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.620
to family and friends.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.980
And that ended up
getting us the money

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.820
that we needed to
build a dormitory.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.050
And I went back a few months
later, and we built it.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.150
And so once we
had the dormitory,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.330
we obviously realized that they
needed more infrastructure.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.860
They needed more ways
to actually sustain

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.650
the facility themselves.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.266
And so we registered Happy
Kids Foundation as an NGO.

00:05:57.266 --> 00:06:02.410
and we continued
to work together,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.790
and we built a school
classroom by classroom.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.320
I started to realize as we were
building this infrastructure

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.890
that they needed something
to sustain the added cost

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.500
of having that infrastructure.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.060
So from that point on, every
time we built something,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.650
we implemented an
income generating

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.180
project or an
empowering project that

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.060
would help the facility
sustain itself-- a livestock

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.170
program, a sewing program where
the kids not only learn skills

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.710
that can help them support
themselves after they leave us,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.180
but it helps us to also
raise some small money

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.800
in the village.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.668
We opened the first internet
cafe in the village.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.720
We also do things that
aren't income generating

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.080
but are important.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.250
So this is Hannah when she saw
the ocean for the first time

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.330
a few years ago.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.430
So I know that it
would be really

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.850
easy to say that
I did all of this,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.120
and that all of this progress
could be attributed to my being

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.000
there.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.800
But that would be giving
you an incomplete story.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.980
It's actually because
of this person,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.760
and because of an
amazing team of people

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.620
that we have in Ghana.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.090
I'm a part of it.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.580
That's very true.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.060
But it's important to
remember that all I did

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.370
was build an idea off
of Elizabeth's already

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.680
existing dream.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.810
And that's something
that I learned

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.522
that was really
important, which was that

00:07:29.522 --> 00:07:31.230
in order for development
to be effective,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.450
it has to be locally driven.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.970
So if you want to make an
impact, the best way to do it

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.540
is to find someone who is
doing what you want to do

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.060
and supporting them.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.930
As my work and
experience evolved,

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.050
I became really interested
in post-conflict development,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.820
and I ended up
getting an opportunity

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.485
to work in Rwanda with survivors
of the Rwandan genocide.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.050
Rwanda, by the way, is one
of the most beautiful places

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.930
you will ever see.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.190
But it's not known for that.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.910
It's more known for its history,
which I hope most of you know.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.755
In 1994, the genocide resulted
in an estimated 800,000

00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:18.400
to a million people being
killed in just 100 days.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.800
Rwanda is famous not
only for the fact

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.860
that all of these
horrific things happened,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.540
but also for the
conscious decision

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.610
of the international
community not to stop it.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.440
At Survivors Fund, we work with
local survivors organizations,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.919
and we work through
those local organizations

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.799
to support survivors
to access justice,

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:43.559
to gain skills that can help
them start small businesses,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.410
for education,
and for counseling

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.830
among many other things.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.850
This is a counseling
group that we have.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.450
This is an income
generating group

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.630
meeting to go over
their accounting books.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.090
So being in Rwanda,
I've had the privilege

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.180
of working with really
incredible people.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.290
These people are
those who have managed

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.190
to survive not only
against the odds,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.990
but they also are committed to
not being defined or limited

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.990
by what happened in 1994.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.890
They consistently stand
up to improve themselves

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.500
and to improve
their communities,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.090
despite the fact
that a lot of them

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.680
are still struggling with
the consequences of genocide.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.120
One of those women is Josee.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.780
In 1994, Josee was living with
her husband and three children.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.000
And when the genocide started
and the extremists launched

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.810
the campaign to exterminate
the Tutsis and moderate Hutu,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.570
her family was targeted.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.110
So her husband and her son
were immediately killed,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.560
but she managed to escape with
her children and her sister.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.300
And they found refuge in
a family friend's home.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.560
So while they thought
that they were

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.130
in a place that was
protecting them,

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.410
it turned out the man
that was protecting them

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.990
raped Josee and her sister.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.790
So they fled again.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:21.370
And despite the odds and despite
consistently being targeted,

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.230
Josee managed to survive.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.580
And unfortunately,
soon after her sister

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:35.180
realized that she was pregnant
with the child of the rapist,

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.250
and these children in Rwanda
are typically referred

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.990
to as children of bad memories.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.720
So because her sister
was so traumatized,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.510
she was unable to
take care of the baby.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.970
So Josee adopted her.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.050
She felt that she
was really sick,

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.540
but she didn't really know
why, and several years passed.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.100
And then in 1996,
Survivors Fund partnered

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.780
with another women's association
to launch a project that

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.050
gave free HIV testing.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.550
And it was then
that Josee realized

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.775
that she was HIV positive.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.460
So she wasn't able
to access medication

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.420
because it was really
expensive at that time,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.180
and she was unable
to work or really do

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.880
much of anything for 10 years.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.680
But eventually, she
got access to treatment

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.138
and became able to work.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.340
So a lot of what we
do at Survivors Fund

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.910
is providing income
generating skills,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.930
because a huge
number of survivors

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.110
are still living
in extreme poverty.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.720
So we provide training
so that these people can

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.610
start their own small
microbusinesses.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.630
And Josee participated in one
of those trainings in 2012,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.460
and then she received a
loan to start a business.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.370
She had prepared this
great business plan.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.920
It seemed like everything
was going to plan,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.040
and then he gave her the
money, and the moment we left,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.750
she turned to her son
and she said, come.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.570
Let's spend this money before
the killers come back for us.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.060
This was 18 years
after the genocide.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.400
So you can imagine how deeply
embedded that type of trauma

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.900
is.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.340
And that is what trauma
in Rwanda still is today.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.870
It's still very much there.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.880
So once Survivor's Fund
learned about this,

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.450
we invited Josee to be a
part of a counseling group

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.800
that we run for women with
children born from rape.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.420
And she went
through the program,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.820
and she developed
another business plan.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.810
And when she finished, we
gave her a second chance,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.390
and she got a loan.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.890
And that time she used
it for a business.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.460
First it was chickens.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.670
She's the true entrepreneur.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.400
It was chickens.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.270
Then it was goats.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.265
And then it moved
into basket weaving.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.540
Now, Josee runs
several businesses,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.670
and she also goes
around the village

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.720
and teaches others
income generating skills

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.780
like basket weaving.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.740
Josee's a really good
example because Rwanda

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.320
has made a lot of
progress since 1994,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.430
and that can't be understated.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.730
The government has put in place
so many incredible policies

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.390
to try and rebuild the country.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.850
But there's also still
a lot of challenges

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.880
that survivors specifically
are struggling with.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:56.160
And Josee is also an
example of the potential

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.479
that individuals have to create
solutions to their own poverty

00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:01.062
if only they're given
the opportunity.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.820
I realize that we can at
times feel overwhelmed

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.100
by the breath of
catastrophes happening today,

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.560
and maybe it's hard for
you to decide how or where

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.934
to lend your support.

00:14:18.934 --> 00:14:22.110
But we can't shy away
from harsh realities,

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.810
because it's only in recognizing
them that we can actually

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.460
do something about it.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.900
I think we're so often
paralyzed by the idea

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.940
that we as individuals are
too small or inconsequential

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.350
to actually affect any
sort of real change.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.960
And I want to end my
presentation by telling you

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.320
that that assumption is wrong.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.840
If my story demonstrates
anything, it's that none of us

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.140
are powerless to do
something, regardless

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.410
of the scale of the problem.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.690
And you should choose
something that you believe in,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.420
work to understand
it, and then find

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.630
someone locally who's working
to address it and support them.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.110
Lastly, we have
to be optimistic,

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:12.700
both about the state of the
world and our existence in it.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.390
These are the two
organizations that I

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.260
work with if anyone is
interested in learning

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.602
more information.

00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:20.310
MALE SPEAKER: So it's
been over 20 years.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.720
I think it's almost 21 now,
since the genocide in Rwanda.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.630
Yet for many Rwandans, the
effects continue to haunt.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.600
And you spoke about this with
a really pointed example.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.690
What have you learned
about the long-term impact

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.939
of horrific events like this
from your work supporting

00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:33.910
survivors?

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.410
KELSEY FINNEGAN: I
think that that's

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.910
one of the most confusing and
maybe sometimes surprising

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.510
thing for people to
realize, is that Rwanda

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.350
is, by all definition,
a success story

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.380
and has really come
a long way from 1994.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.820
But it takes a lot
longer than 21 years

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.430
to actually recover
from genocide.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.630
The consequences that
survivors are feeling

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.920
continue to change, and
in some cases, evolve.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.370
In the immediate
aftermath of the genocide,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.666
the priorities were
very different.

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:11.380
A lot of that was
on infrastructure.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.390
Actually finding a
place to bury bodies

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:19.400
was a huge problem,
HIV, AIDS, counseling,

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.525
establishing a
secure police force

00:16:22.525 --> 00:16:23.816
so that it secured the country.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.410
Now, the challenges are
in some cases the same,

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.610
like Josee's story,
in terms of trauma

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.940
still being very
present in there,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.560
but also being very different.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.690
For example, women
that had children

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.020
that were born from rape
who are now growing up

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:48.790
into adulthood face issues
with identity and who they are.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.300
The projects that
I work with support

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.960
young survivors who were
children during the genocide

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.680
and have grown up
for the most part

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.530
without social
support or family.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.010
And they graduate
from school but find

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.440
that they're unable to find any
sort of job or access finance

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.930
that would help them
start a small business.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.040
There's a lot of legal issues
related to the genocide,

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.819
and specifically with youth
who their parents had land

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.270
during the genocide,
and then they

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.640
have now grown up and
realized that they rightfully

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.220
should have land that
belonged to their families.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.660
And that's a huge
asset in Rwanda

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.540
because it's a very
overpopulated country.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.440
So they need legal support
to fight those battles

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.690
and to actually get
their land back.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.090
And we run a legal and
counselling helpline program

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.850
that tries to support
people to do that.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.940
Obviously, like I said, extreme
poverty is still an issue.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.360
The opportunities for work are
still very limited in Rwanda.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.790
So the challenges are
very multifaceted,

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.800
and they also continue to
evolve as time goes on,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.650
which is why we
think and believe

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.534
that it needs a
targeted approach.

00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:11.367
MALE SPEAKER: So I want
to switch gears back

00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:12.552
to Happy Kids.

00:18:14.587 --> 00:18:16.670
I think you've told me
some stories over the years

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.990
about introducing the
internet and computers to kids

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.610
for the first time.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.460
What have you learned
about the impact of access

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.565
to the internet and
technology, both positively

00:18:25.565 --> 00:18:26.690
and potentially negatively?

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:31.750
KELSEY FINNEGAN: We opened
the first internet cafe

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:36.250
in the village, which was
really interesting to see.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.820
From an organizational
perspective,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.640
it was huge for us in terms
of being able to communicate

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.350
with the outside world,
being able to advocate

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.140
for what we are
doing, learn lessons

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.360
from other organizations.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.670
It was huge in that sense.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.520
What I think was
probably more huge

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.420
was the impact it had
on the kids themselves.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.520
Just in general, I was shocked
by how quickly they picked up

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.080
on the technology.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.140
They fix my computer
now when there's

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.940
a problem, which is pretty
impressive because they've

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.720
had almost no training in it.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:19.190
But it's also enabled them
to see outside of the village

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.230
and see really the possibilities
that they could have

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.740
despite being where they are.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.630
One example is when
we first started

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.650
it and I had all these really
idealistic dreams about only

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.740
using the internet as
an educational resource.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.874
And they were baiting me.

00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:36.040
Kelsey, we've seen Facebook.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.120
We really want Facebook.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.890
You are too young.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.660
They were like 14 at the time.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.060
I said, this is going to
be an educational resource.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.620
So I left the internet cafe,
and like 20 minutes later

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.180
I had 10 friend requests.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.592
So I lost that battle.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.990
Our kids are also growing up.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.990
I was there a few
weeks ago, and you

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.730
have situations where teenage
boys are using the internet

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.960
that teenage boys
use the internet for.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.290
That's been a really awkward,
hilarious thing to witness.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.040
But that's what's so
cool is it kind of

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.460
enabled them to be normal
kids, which was a really

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.340
incredible thing to watch.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.941
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:25.940
At Happy Kids now, you
provide donors the option

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.420
of sponsoring a child.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.389
And there are numerous
programs that do this.

00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:30.930
Describe how that
works at Happy Kids

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.305
and what you've learned, at
least in your own experience,

00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:35.774
about making that an
effective giving option.

00:20:35.774 --> 00:20:37.190
KELSEY FINNEGAN:
In the beginning,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.740
I actually shied away from
the sponsorship program

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.370
because I really
wanted to emphasize

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.990
on that local solution
and finding the way

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.830
to build up resources locally.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.800
But raising that many
kids, which we have 40,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.850
is always going to
be really expensive.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.530
So we introduced
sponsorship as a way

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.820
to make sure that we can secure
basic needs for every kid.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.740
So typically, the
person will either

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.260
choose the child-- we have
their profiles on our website--

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.330
so they can choose the child
or we can choose them for them.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.930
And then with us, because
we're a small organization,

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.830
we really do connect that
individual to that child.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.760
That doesn't always happen
with sponsorship programs.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.710
But with us, we really wanted
it to be mutually beneficial,

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.860
both for the kid themselves
and also for the person

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.710
that chooses to sponsor them.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.140
So when they link up,
normally the sponsor

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.020
will write a letter.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.970
And then if we can,
when we can, the kids

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.760
will write back, which
has been hilarious.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.000
Because we really just
hand them a piece of paper

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.390
and tell them to write.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.170
And so we have
really great letters

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.590
that they write
about their lives,

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.256
and then we have
others that are written

00:21:48.256 --> 00:21:50.400
by six-year-olds that are
like, "Dear Jonathan, I

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.770
love flowers."

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.355
And that's it.

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:55.870
So that's been
really entertaining.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.680
But I was surprised by how much
it ended up meaning to the kids

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.240
personally, how
much they actually

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.120
value having a sponsor.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.190
And I can only speak
for our program

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.670
because we really make
that effort to make

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.460
them understand where the
support is coming from.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.540
I think in general with
sponsorship programs,

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.780
the support doesn't
just go to that child,

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.100
and ours is the same.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.290
It supports that
child, but it also

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.270
helps us just run
the organization

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.485
and try to improve
on what we're doing.

00:22:26.485 --> 00:22:27.860
So I think any
time that you want

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.990
to be involved in
sponsorship, you should also

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.720
be connected to what the
organization's mission is,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.072
because either way your support
is going to affect both.

00:22:35.072 --> 00:22:36.530
MALE SPEAKER: CNN's
Anderson Cooper

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.010
has spoken of telling stories
of people who would otherwise

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.440
be invisible and forgotten.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.820
And he had a great quote
that I couldn't track down

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.560
during the tsunami that affected
Indonesia, where there were

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.810
people that just existed,
then didn't exist, and would

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.520
have been completely wiped
off the history of the earth.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.530
So what have you learned about
from the individual people,

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.571
their stories, and your
years in Ghana and Rwanda

00:22:54.571 --> 00:22:57.344
that you'll take with you
for the rest of your life?

00:22:57.344 --> 00:22:59.260
KELSEY FINNEGAN: I think
it's really important

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.300
to tell those individual
stories because that's

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.140
what makes it relatable.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.590
I think we can so often get
bogged down by the broader

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.330
numbers and all
these catastrophes

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.650
that we can't really relate to,
and telling an individual story

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.110
humanizes problems or successes.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.830
And so I realized
that it was really

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.680
crucial to tell those
stories in order

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.220
to help people connect with
things that are maybe very far

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.610
away and foreign to them.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.960
When I went to see
Josee a few weeks ago

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.070
and asked her if she was OK
with me telling her story today,

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:38.460
she was very calm and she
said, please, go and tell them.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.700
And I think with that, it's
a very good example of how

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.410
a lot of people in
Rwanda, as difficult

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.670
as it is to tell
their story, they

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.850
want it to be shared because
they're so desperate to have

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.250
people realize what
happened, and also realize

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.570
the mistake that all
of us made and why

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.560
it shouldn't happen again.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.190
I think it's also
important to say, though,

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:07.800
that you're not only sharing
stories of doom and despair.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.870
And I try to do that a lot.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.300
I try to not always show
pictures of sad people

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.940
because that's not
how Africa is defined,

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:22.290
and genocide certainly isn't
all that Rwanda is defined as.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.810
And so it's also important
to share positive stories

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:32.530
and to make sure that it doesn't
create a negative image when

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.410
it's not the full story.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.910
MALE SPEAKER: Just
one more question

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.160
before I open up the audience.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.710
For most people, the
ability to help and support

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.110
those outside their communities
is limited to donations.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.700
What have you learned working
for charitable organizations

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.229
that can help
individuals channel

00:24:46.229 --> 00:24:48.520
their donations in the most
effective and impactful way

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.620
possible?

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.550
KELSEY FINNEGAN: That's what I'm
hoping that you could take away

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.174
from this, is that
you realize that you

00:24:53.174 --> 00:24:56.480
don't have to go to Africa
or volunteer in Africa

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.250
to make some sort of impact.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.350
Actually, for most of
you, it's probably better

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.510
that you support from here.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.970
You can actually make more
of an impact from here.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.040
And a lot of that is
through supporting

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.900
local people or
local organizations,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.380
which is what we do
at Survivors Fund.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.070
It's what we do at
Happy Kids, building up

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.450
the capacity of local
people, which really makes

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.410
sure that the projects are being
determined by the people who

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:29.560
actually need them and not
by the donors themselves.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.010
I think it's also
really important

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:35.520
to be flexible and open,
because sometimes the causes

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.700
or projects that could benefit
from your support the most

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.525
are maybe not so attractive.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.110
If you find an organization
or an individual

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.340
that you think is
really doing good,

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.870
giving them the flexibility
to use your money

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.830
as they see best fit will make
your money go much further.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.080
AUDIENCE: It's so interesting.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.740
You make a differentiation about
if you want to make an impact,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.230
find somebody who is doing
what you are interested in

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.030
and support them.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.750
And I feel like that's
an important shift

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.740
that-- I don't know.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.900
Do you see that taking place
in the developing world

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:22.550
right now, where we're starting
to support local organizations?

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.175
Because I feel like what
was happening before

00:26:25.175 --> 00:26:27.837
was we'd show up with
our ideas and make

00:26:27.837 --> 00:26:30.920
our suggestions and
our money, and we'd

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.200
try to fix things for people,
and that that wasn't working.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.790
And when you talked
about going to the school

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:44.630
and how you spent two months
at it and that didn't work,

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.310
I just wonder if that
shift is happening

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.760
or if you still see people
showing up and trying

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.359
to fix things on their own.

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:53.650
KELSEY FINNEGAN: Good question.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:58.830
I think that development
itself is really advancing.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.000
I think a lot of
people have this idea

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.320
of what development used to
be, and that can sometimes

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.190
be ineffective.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.020
I think that the way
it's going is definitely

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.060
on building local institutions
and having local partners.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.150
It is worth saying, though,
that that's really difficult

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:25.340
because it takes time to build
the capacity of organizations

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.470
and to make sure that
they also play a part

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.676
in the design of a project.

00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:38.450
I would say in Ghana,
it happens more often

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.270
that people just
kind of jump in,

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.920
at least in the village,
and some people who maybe

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.560
have development as a hobby.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.880
But it is a very
professional sector,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.220
and I think it's
better to support

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.960
experts that are
on the ground that

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.255
are working with local people.

00:27:56.255 --> 00:27:58.130
And it doesn't necessarily
mean that you only

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.640
support local
institutions, but make sure

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.800
that whatever organization
you're supporting

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.800
is working with a
local institution

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.610
and trying to make the work
more sustainable that way.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.075
So I think it's kind of both.

00:28:11.075 --> 00:28:13.220
I do think we're going
in that direction,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.160
but it's definitely the
more difficult way to do it.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.730
So it's a slow
progression, I think.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:20.730
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.810
I want to thank
Kelsey and everyone

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.000
on the live stream for however
many there are-- I always

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.832
have no idea who's out there--
and everyone that's going

00:28:29.832 --> 00:28:31.040
to see this later on YouTube.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.840
So thank you very much,
Kelsey, for sharing

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.340
your story and the story
of those you work with.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.201
Appreciate it, and
found it very moving.

00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:37.700
Thank you.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.182
KELSEY FINNEGAN: Thank you.

00:28:39.182 --> 00:28:42.090
