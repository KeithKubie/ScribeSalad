00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.207
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.207 --> 00:00:05.374
is introduce ourselves to the
notion of a definite integral

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:11.068
and with indefinite
integrals and derivatives

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:14.937
this is really one of
the pillars of calculus

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:17.343
and as we'll see, they're all related

00:00:17.343 --> 00:00:19.491
and we'll see that more
and more in future videos

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:20.914
and we'll also get a better appreciation

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:22.093
for even where the notation

00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:24.426
of a definite integral comes from.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:27.203
So, let me draw some functions here

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:28.279
and we're actually gonna
start thinking about

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.862
areas under curves.

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:33.653
So, let me draw a coordinate axes here,

00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:36.903
so that's my Y axis, this is my X axis,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.107
actually I'm gonna do two cases.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.440
So, this is my Y axis, this is my X axis

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.346
and let's say I have some function here,

00:00:49.346 --> 00:00:51.929
so this F of X right over there

00:00:53.223 --> 00:00:56.306
and let's say that this is X equals A

00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:00.021
and let me draw a line
going straight up like that

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:03.320
and let's say that this is X equals B,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.487
just like that

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:08.280
and what we want to do
is concern ourselves

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.555
with the area under the graph,

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:14.020
under the graph of Y is equal to F of X

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.380
and above the X axis and
between these two bounds,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.980
between X equals A and X equals B,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.128
so this area right over here

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:24.163
and you can already get an appreciation.

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:25.620
We're not used to finding areas

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.704
where one of the boundaries
or as we'll see in the future,

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:30.386
many of the boundaries
could actually be curves

00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:33.113
but that's one of the powers
of the definite integral

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:36.175
and one of the powers
of integral calculus.

00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:39.493
And so, the notation for
this area right over here

00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:41.993
would be the definite integral

00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:46.215
and so, we're gonna have our
lower bound at X equals A,

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:47.438
so we'll write it there,

00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:50.083
we'll have our upper bound at X equals B,

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:51.085
right over there.

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:54.907
We're taking the area
under the curve of F of X,

00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.490
F of X and then DX.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:01.881
Now, in the future we're going to,

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.780
especially once we start
looking at Riemann sums,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.747
we'll get a better understanding

00:02:05.747 --> 00:02:07.437
of where this notation comes from.

00:02:07.437 --> 00:02:08.850
This actually comes from Leibniz,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.647
one of the founders of calculus.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.725
This is known as the summa symbol

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:14.021
but for the sake of this video

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:16.353
you just need to know
what this represents.

00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:17.910
This right over here,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.448
this represents the area under F of X

00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:24.552
between X equals A and X equals B.

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:26.727
So, this value and this expression

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:27.998
should be the same
