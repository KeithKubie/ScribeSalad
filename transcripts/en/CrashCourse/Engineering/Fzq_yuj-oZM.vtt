00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
At its heart, engineering is about solving
problems.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.300
And for better or worse, the world won’t
have a shortage of those anytime soon.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.980
Throughout this series, we’ve covered many
of the areas where these challenges lie and
how engineers are making their mark.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.860
But we’ve only just skimmed the surface!

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.640
While we couldn’t get to them all, one thing is
certain: the future landscape of engineering will
be very different from what we see today.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:31.660
[Theme Music]

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.400
From the tiny to the large, we’ve seen
engineering in action to deliver drugs, build
bridges, and shore up skyscrapers.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.080
In general, the kinds of problems that engineers
solve depend on what we want and need.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:51.340
Farms, factories, cities, and homes all rely on energy
production, civil infrastructure, and communication
networks for their basic functions.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.300
Society will continue to need those in some
form in the future, which is why a lot of focus
is put into these fields of engineering.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.340
But new engineering specialties are also popping
up all the time.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.820
In the last decade, the demand for smartphones
has driven huge developments in electrical and
computer engineering.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.740
The industry is working on improving the
designs of components like processors and
finding cheaper ways of producing them.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.440
In other words, economic factors can play a big
role in what fields engineers end up working in and
what sorts of jobs are available to them.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.320
But in the 21st century, there are challenges
facing the world that go beyond economics,
with implications for our very existence!

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.820
The environment is changing more radically
than ever.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.500
There are entirely new threats to our infrastructure.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.300
Healthcare and sanitation have the potential
to save hundreds of millions of lives.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.720
Although engineering has improved the average
quality of life to the best it’s ever been,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.820
big challenges like these need to be addressed
if humanity is going to keep thriving.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.340
To outline some of these problems, the US
National Academy of Engineering, or NAE,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.840
has consulted with engineers, scientists, and
technologists to create a set of Grand Challenges
for Engineers in the 21st century.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.640
These goals address some of the most essential
global issues in both big and small ways.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.440
Broadly speaking, they focus on sustainability,
security, health and general quality of life.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.940
It all starts with sustainability, or making
sure our planet stays a place where we can live.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.500
To heal the environment and keep humanity
safe, we need to engineer a future that looks
very different from our past.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
To prevent further damage from the burning
of fossil fuels, we need to develop cleaner
methods for energy production.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.860
Engineers are already working to make solar
panels more efficient and investigate the possibility
of power plants that use nuclear fusion.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.600
But producing power isn’t the only way we’re
warming the planet.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.100
Modern agriculture uses lots of artificial
fertilizers to increase food production.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.700
Unfortunately, only some gets absorbed into
living things like crops; much of the rest escapes
to the atmosphere as nitrogen oxide.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.220
There, it acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping in
heat and deepening the effects of climate change.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.500
Worse still, some returns to Earth in the
form of acid rain.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.700
To address these problems, engineers need
to find ways of stopping nitrogen from leaking
out of the food production process.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.260
Stopping the release of nitrogen oxide is
essential for managing the nitrogen cycle
that supports the Earth’s ecosystem.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.140
And that may mean designing new methods of
applying fertilizer, or processing organic waste into
more environmentally-friendly alternatives.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.390
But it’s too late to just change what we
do in the future.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.800
To fix the warming planet, we need to reverse
the effects of greenhouse gases.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.120
That’s the goal behind carbon sequestration,
which aims to take carbon dioxide out the
atmosphere and store it safely away.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.680
The good news is, sequestration is already
possible!

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.350
There are chemical reactions for capturing
CO2, like the kind used to add fizz to soda.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.620
The huge challenge is to scale up that technology to
remove billions of tonnes of it from the atmosphere
in a way that’s economically viable.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.960
A good start would be capturing carbon dioxide
as it is released from fossil fuel-based energy plants.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.780
The smokestacks in coal-powered plants could
be altered to absorb greenhouse gases at the source.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.960
And once we can prevent its release or take
it out of the atmosphere, we’ll need a way
to store that CO2.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.280
Engineers are working on finding places, like
deep within porous rock formations, where
all that carbon could be put away.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.060
While preventing environmental ruin is a huge
task, there are other risks engineers need to
plan for in the future.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.680
While civil engineering has provided a lot of
infrastructure needed to support our daily lives,
not enough work has gone into maintaining it.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.680
Old structures and outdated transportation
systems are in need of modernization to make
them safer and more reliable.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.200
As part of these efforts, engineers in the UK are
sending electromagnetic waves through the ground

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.280
to locate buried objects like pipes and cables
that are part of the current communication
and plumbing networks.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.420
This will allow engineers to map them out
and improve waste treatment facilities and
telephone networks,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.820
making those systems more
resilient against potential catastrophes.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.300
Sadly, the risks posed to infrastructure aren’t
just because of negligence.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.120
As the world becomes more connected, systems
like power grids are increasingly coordinated
using networks of computers.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.620
Unfortunately, that makes them more vulnerable
to attacks from hackers!

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:53.800
In 2015, hackers managed to disrupt the power grid
in Ukraine, temporarily cutting off the supply of
electricity to 230,000 residents for several hours.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.010
If attacks like this continue to escalate
in scale, they could threaten important services
like hospitals and firefighters.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.000
To prevent hackers from attacking critical infrastructure,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.200
computer engineers are developing solutions
to ensure that only trusted operators can access
the systems that control them.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.580
That involves developing more secure software,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.140
and even implementing new hardware like
fingerprint scanners to make sure only a few
designated people can make changes.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.320
They can also organize vulnerable computer
systems to operate on networks that are entirely
disconnected from the internet,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.620
so hackers have a harder time accessing
them in the first place.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.020
But big threats to infrastructure aren’t
just restricted to cyberspace!

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.640
Although nuclear weapons haven’t been used
in warfare since World War II,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.980
there’s always the chance that a malicious
group could turn stolen nuclear material into
an improvised bomb.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.840
To prevent this, engineers are developing ways to monitor and track the radioactive elements used in places like energy plants, hospitals, and research facilities.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.980
For example, devices could be designed that
measure the radioactivity near nuclear reactors,
giving an indication of the amount of material inside.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.100
If that level drops suddenly and without explanation,
it could alert investigators that a theft has occurred.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.320
Now, this all kinda sounds like the future
of engineering is just preventing terrible
things from happening.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.700
But the good news is that engineering is also
an active, positive force for improving lives.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:15.360
Because of the incredible pace at which technology
has advanced, engineering can make huge strides
in the fields of health and sanitation.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.900
We saw a way to provide better access to clean water
in the context of engineering design, which is vital for
sanitation and preventing the outbreak of disease.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.490
But there are lots of ways engineers could
help treat diseases, too.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:34.480
The tools of genetic engineering, for example, give us new ways to create medicine, such as specially-designed enzymes that produce cancer drugs more efficiently.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.400
Some recent advances like CRISPR might even
allow doctors to treat patients based on their DNA
and eliminate certain diseases entirely.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.680
And as we saw with biodevices, new hardware
is being developed to work within the body for
medical diagnoses and monitoring.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.240
The data that those devices collect, like blood
pressure and heart rate, could be used to alert doctors
immediately when something goes wrong.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.320
Grouped across many patients, this data could
also be used to investigate and predict healthcare
trends, a field called health informatics.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.780
Engineers will play an enormous role in designing
the systems that collect, transmit, and even
analyze that data.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.860
As well as personalizing healthcare, engineering
can develop other kinds of tools that are tailored
to individuals, like those used in education.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.140
Many current resources, including videos like
this one, are aimed at a broad audience.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:27.100
In the future, though, resources could be designed to change the style and depth of information they provide based on an individual student’s strengths and preferences.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.560
Imagine an online textbook that could automatically
elaborate on topics you didn’t get the first time around,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.860
or digital flashcards that adapt to test you
on the things you forget most often.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:44.560
New hardware, like virtual or augmented reality
headsets, could even provide simulated environments
for students to learn and experiment in.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.440
Software engineers will be key to bringing
these sorts of tools into classrooms and homes.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.520
Of course, similar technologies could be applied to
every aspect of our lives to allow our thoughts and
personalities to influence our environments.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.140
But to do that, we’d need to understand
the brain a lot better than we do now.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.460
Understanding the human brain is one of the
biggest scientific challenges there is.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.000
Doing so would allow us to develop new medical
and psychiatric treatments.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.060
Modeling computer systems on the design of
the human brain could also give us entirely
new ways of solving problems.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.800
You’ve probably heard of the progress being
made in fields like artificial intelligence.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.000
The goal is to construct systems with problem-solving
capabilities similar to the kind humans have,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.980
such as driving cars or recognizing tumours
in X-ray scans.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.780
So far, we can only crudely mimic how brain
cells are connected.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.080
Understanding how the brain works more completely
could help us replicate some of its remarkable abilities.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.160
On this front, engineers are developing new
hardware to assist in making scientific discoveries,
like infrared sensors that measure brain activity.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.860
This helps us to understand how physical changes
like blood flow and electrical impulses correspond
to the act of thinking.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.830
And determining that could help us better
model individual parts of the brain and improve
our efforts at artificial intelligence.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.600
From brains to biofuels, it’s clear that
engineers have lots of ways to impact the future.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.040
Despite the challenges laid out by the NAE, the truth
is that engineering rarely goes the way we predict.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.400
Few people would have thought that less than
70 years would separate the flight of the first
airplane from our first steps on the Moon.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.180
The development of technology, and the challenges
that come with it, are still big questions on the horizon.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.820
But what we can say is that whatever the future holds,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:22.460
the problem solving skills and fundamental
ideas provided by engineering will put you in a
good spot to take a crack at them yourself.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.640
Because that’s really what engineering is
all about – using bright ideas to tackle
big challenges!

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.280
And we hope this series has put you on the
path to do just that.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.580
