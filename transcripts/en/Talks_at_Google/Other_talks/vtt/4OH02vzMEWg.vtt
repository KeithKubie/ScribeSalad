FEMALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.220
My name is Ruchika, and I work
in the well-being learning team

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.170
here at Google, a
team that brings you

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.430
well-being learning programs
like Search Inside Yourself.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.490
Thank you to Meng,
who is here with us

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.350
today, for creating that program
and G-Pause, G-Calm, et cetera.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.480
We are very fortunate to have
Dr. James Doty join us today.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.000
He is a professor in the
Department of Neurosurgery

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.270
and the founder and director
of Center for Compassion

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.350
and Altruism Research
and Education,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.060
which is also known
as CCARE more simply

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.700
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.050
He collaborates with scientists
from a number of disciplines

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.640
examining the neural basis
for compassion and altruism.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.430
He's an inventor
and entrepreneur

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.140
and a philanthropist.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.450
His work has been published in
a variety of research journals.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.270
You wouldn't know it
from meeting him today,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.020
but Dr. Doty had a rather
challenging childhood,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.790
a poignant memoir of
which he has shared

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.950
so authentically in
his book-- that you

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.870
can get a copy of outside.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.760
When he was 12 years old, he
wandered into a magic shop--

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.170
literally-- and met a woman
who saw the potential in him

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.830
and taught him how to
manifest his greatest

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.200
desires through a series of
techniques and meditative

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.160
experiences.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.260
With her he learned
a unique relationship

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.460
between the brain and the heart
that led to incredible success

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.310
and happiness in life.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.570
I was personally blown
away by the book.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.950
I couldn't put it down.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100
I did the Audible
copy first and then

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.330
I actually read through
the whole book again.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.480
With that I present
to you the author

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.470
of "Into the Magic Shop--
a Neurosurgeon's Quest

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.510
to Discover the
Mysteries of the Brain

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.569
and the Secrets of the
Heart," Dr. James Doty.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.610
DR. JAMES R. DOTY: Well,
thank you for having me.

00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:58.020
I'm actually not going
to show any slides.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.478
I hope you're not
too disappointed.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.890
So what I thought I would
sort of tell you a little bit

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.430
about this book and sort of the
journey I had in that regard,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.300
but really at the end
of this, I basically

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.430
want you to remember four words
and 10 letters of the alphabet.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.220
So the four words are suffering,
authenticity-- oh-- connection,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.850
and service.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.210
And then the letters of the
alphabet are C through L,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.220
and it'll become more clear
as we come along here.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.340
One of the things that
many of us don't appreciate

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.440
is that all of us are suffering.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.130
And often times we get involved
with our own suffering,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.187
and it prevents us from actually
connecting with other people.

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:53.270
And the prevention of
connecting with other people

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.190
then doesn't allow
us to truly connect.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.530
And as a species, that is how
we have evolved, and in fact,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.890
it's this connection
that allows us

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.550
to function at our best-- both
mentally and physiologically.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.910
In regard to the book,
as Ruchika was kindly

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.851
enough to describe, I had
a challenging childhood.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.100
Actually I grew up in poverty.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.870
My father was an alcoholic.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.420
My mother was an invalid--
she'd had a stroke.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.110
She was paralyzed.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.170
She was chronically depressed--
had attempted suicide

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.800
on multiple occasions.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.460
Neither of my parents
had gone to college.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.970
And we were on public assistance
essentially my entire life.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.930
So this is typically not the
route to success in life.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.380
But a transformative
event occurred

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.200
which really changed the
trajectory of my life

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.890
at the age of 12.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.780
And what happened was I
walked into a magic shop

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.320
in a strip mall.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.700
And I lived in the high
desert, and really I

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.260
had no guidance or direction
and oftentimes would just

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.290
take off on my bike.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.280
And I went into this shop.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.150
And as I walked in,
there was a woman who

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.690
I describe as an earth mother.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.649
Now, depending on the audience,
if they're under the age of 50,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.890
few of them know what
an earth mother is.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.570
If you're over the
age of 50, you know.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.570
An earth mother-- if you recall
the '60s and the Beatles--

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.210
there was this summer of love.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.680
And there were all
these people who

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.540
were very much into--
sort of at that time

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.970
the Beatles had brought
eastern religion.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.640
And they sort of embraced
this idea of loving everyone

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.700
and peace, children, et cetera.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.950
Well, anyway, I would
describe this lady as that.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.390
She had this wavy gray
hair and had these glasses

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.550
sitting on her nose.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.520
And by this time, I was
already becoming a delinquent.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.110
Because if you have
no hope or future,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.080
you have nothing to lose.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.890
And if you don't have mentors,
access, financial resources,

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.610
frankly in America
it's actually very hard

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.670
to overcome those
circumstances, especially

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.230
if you are a minority.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.310
So this woman looked
up from her glasses--

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.860
she was reading a
paperback book--

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.390
and we began a conversation.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.830
And she had one of these--
and I'm sure each of you

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.650
have met at times-- people have
like a radiant smile that just

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.880
as soon as you see them with
their smile, they embrace you.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.280
And you just feel very
comfortable with them.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.150
And she was that type of person.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.180
And frankly, I did not
advertise my personal situation,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.820
because I was ashamed of
it and was embarrassed.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.860
And over the course of
this brief conversation,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.430
though, she actually
asked me some

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.640
quite penetrating
questions, which--

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.050
this is my son back there.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.920
Asked me some
penetrating questions.

00:06:00.488 --> 00:06:02.100
And she said, you
know, I know nothing

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.490
about the magic in this store.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.870
That's my son's thing.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.740
In fact, it turned out
she was just a place

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.170
setter while her son
was doing an errand.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.780
And she said, I know nothing
about the magic in the store,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.080
but there is a magic
that I know that I

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.840
think could change your life.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.660
Now, I wish I could tell you
as a 12-year-old I had any

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.820
insight, because I didn't.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.500
What she said to me next was,
I'm here for another six weeks.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.210
And if you show up, I'll
teach you something.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.320
And if you really
practice it hard,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.150
everything will change for you.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.120
Well, then she offered
me some cookies.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.024
And we started chatting again.

00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:39.190
And the only reason I came
back was because I really

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.240
wanted some more cookies.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.712
And as a 12-year-old,
she was so nice to me.

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:43.920
And I had nothing else to do.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.260
It wasn't because I had this
incredible self-awareness.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.790
So I showed up every
day for six weeks.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.820
And I tell people
that prior to that,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.390
I felt like a leaf being
blown by an ill wind.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.360
Because I had no
certainty about anything.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.580
You know, I wasn't
sure if we would eat.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.880
I wasn't sure if my
father would come home.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.530
I wasn't sure if
I would come home

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.470
and my mother would have
been taken to the hospital,

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.370
because she had
attempted suicide.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.460
So it was a very chaotic,
unpredictable situation.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.120
When you're in that
situation, what happens--

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.870
there's now something
that we describe

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.492
as adolescent or adverse
childhood experiences.

00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:26.950
I don't know if
you've heard of it.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.370
It's called ACEs.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.980
And it really has
had a profound effect

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.699
on how we look at
childhood experiences,

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.990
especially children of poverty.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.880
Because many of them have
these experiences which

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.220
actually-- from a emotional
response point of view--

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.160
is very much like
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.840
And it very negatively impacts
health, wellness, and actually

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.516
your ability to succeed in life.

00:07:57.516 --> 00:07:59.640
And I was one of those
children, although certainly

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.350
at that time, I
didn't recognize it.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.520
So over the course of this
period, the first thing

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.610
that she taught me-- and
I actually describe it

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.340
in the book as ruse for tricks.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.150
Now remember, this was 1968.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.440
I know I don't look that old.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:23.040
But the terms mindfulness,
meditation, or neuroplasticity

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.070
were really unknown
and certainly not

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.340
in the popular conversation.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.059
But the first
thing she taught me

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:36.940
was number one-- that unless
you have attention and focus,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.169
you can't succeed.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.110
And one of the preventers
of attention and focus

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.410
is that emotionally
you're wound up.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.210
And this winding up of
you or this response

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.490
to this emotional state--
and in my case, it was anger.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.030
It was hostility.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.910
It was a sense of hopelessness--
has an effect on your body.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.100
So she spent a
great amount of time

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.280
teaching me this idea
of relaxing the body

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.870
and getting attention and focus.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.170
And we now know that this is
one of the first paths that

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.990
is necessary to gain insight,
awareness, and control

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.890
of your mental state.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.264
Because without
those two things,

00:09:17.264 --> 00:09:19.770
it's hard to progress on.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:25.290
So over the period of time, she
taught me how to relax my body.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.580
And what I used
ultimately was a mantra.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.320
But she also taught me
how to look at a candle.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.780
And both of these
methods are quite

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.060
effective in sort of getting
you into this position.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.450
And this is really
one of the first steps

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.040
in traditional
mindfulness practice.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.540
And once I had felt that
I had understood that

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.010
and began practicing it, the
next thing that she taught me

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.720
was something that I
call taming the mind.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.410
Now how this is
slightly different

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.870
from a traditional
mindfulness practice

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:05.140
is that in that context,
the analogy that I use

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.830
is that we have a dialogue
going on in our head.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.910
And I call it a radio
station, if you will.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.510
And for me-- and
like many people

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.900
who are suffering or even
just living a regular life

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.400
but have not been
able to manifest how

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.110
to fulfill their potential--
the dialogue that they

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.780
have going on in
their head is not

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.190
one which is a benefit to them.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.720
It is a creation
that they accept

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.530
as equivalent to who they are.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.350
And often times it is negative.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.780
It is critical.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.330
It is certainly is
not self-affirming.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.940
And when that is present, it
is hard for you to be present.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.390
And it's interesting also,
because what many of us

00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:00.430
don't appreciate is
as a human species,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:04.830
we have the unique ability to
have an awareness of a past

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.050
and a perception of a future.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.940
But what that also does
is it results in us

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.870
not being present.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.370
And in fact, surveys
have been done,

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.400
and between 45% and 78% percent
of people-- like in this room,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.810
probably-- you're not with me.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.810
You're thinking about
what you should have done,

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.450
could have done, didn't
do, or what you're supposed

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.520
to do after this lecture.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.990
Is anybody in that
position at all?

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.490
Nobody.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.290
That's wonderful.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.600
And the problem is when
you're in this position,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.010
you cannot absolutely--
authentically-- connect.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.500
And this also-- these two things
which you were fighting-- also

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.350
results in you
worrying about what

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.030
is going to happen to you or
your future or who you are

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.830
or if you're good,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.350
And as a result, what many
of us don't appreciate

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.630
is this dialogue-- this
negative dialogue--

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.430
has an effect on your
autonomic nervous system.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.990
And it's divided into the
sympathetic nervous system

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.440
and to the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.460
When you engage in
negative dialogue,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.600
often times it has an
effect by increasing

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.580
your sympathetic
nervous system output.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.660
And when that happens, you
have this release of hormones

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.380
that if you were on
the savanna in African

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.970
and you see a lion would allow
you to run away and climb up

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.470
a tree.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.814
Your sphincters would tighten
up-- at least mine would.

00:12:35.814 --> 00:12:36.980
I don't know about you guys.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.580
But your blood flow
would be diverted

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.720
to your skeletal muscle.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.810
Your pupils would dilate.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.750
And if you survive, great.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.458
If you didn't, it
probably didn't matter.

00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:46.090
Right?

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.230
But in modern society, these
are engaged on a low level

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.800
with this type of dialogue.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.130
And so your emotional state
has a huge impact on this.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.980
When you have the
chronic release

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.840
of these types of hormones--
cortisol, epinephrine,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.340
norepinephrine-- it
suppresses your immune system.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.830
It increases your
blood pressure,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:12.440
increases your heart rate,
and is very, very deleterious

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.210
to your health in the long term.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.030
So one of the bases
of mindfulness

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.170
is that you have this
non-judgmental response

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.170
to these events
that are occurring.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.420
But what you can do
over time-- and what

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.720
she taught me-- was
you can actually

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.200
change that dialogue
to one of sort

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.250
of this negative stuff
that is flowing along,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.020
which oftentimes
you identify as you,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.530
and recognize that
it is not you at all.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.360
And it is in your capacity
to change the conversation--

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.550
or if you will,
change the channel--

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:53.090
to one of self-compassion
and one of self-affirmation.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.800
And when you do that,
it has this huge effect

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.060
on your physiology.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.440
And actually it
allows for these parts

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.290
of the brain-- as an example,
the executive control area--

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.810
to function better.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.420
And when your executive
control area functions better,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.500
instead of when you're
stressed or anxious,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.180
you make reactive
decisions-- and I'm

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.069
sure nobody here is
stressed or anxious.

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:25.110
You know, it's interesting
in the Silicon Valley,

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.340
one of the biggest causes
of health care expenditure

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.030
is stress, anxiety,
depression, and then

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.430
all the effects on the
body from those, which

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:40.220
are gastrointestinal upset,
back pain, neck pain, muscle

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.830
spasm, and headache.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:47.420
I'm sure none of you guys
have had any of those, right?

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.030
So what happens is,
though, when you

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.850
have that type of
emotional response,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.570
it's very deleterious.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.280
But if you're able
to change the channel

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.040
and shift from engaging your
sympathetic nervous system

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.260
to your parasympathetic
nervous system,

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:07.680
it has a huge, huge positive
effect on your health.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.800
And so we talked
about suffering.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.280
The other part of this
was also a recognition

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.590
that it wasn't just about me.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.800
You know, I would go
around through my day

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.330
and say, oh, my life sucks--
if only this would happen.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.290
Gosh, why can't this happen?

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.030
Why couldn't I have been born
into this family, et cetera,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.490
et cetera?

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.440
And she gave me the
insight, though,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.170
to understand-- as
an example, I used

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.610
to have an immense amount
of anger and hostility

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.790
towards my parents.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.340
Because my view was that
they were failures--

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.130
that they had failed me,
that I deserved better.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.460
And while on some
level, maybe that

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:57.810
was true, if I actually looked
at them in a different way

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.750
and said, what is causing
their own suffering?

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.840
Like as an example, my
father's background--

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.750
it turned out-- was one
which was very difficult.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.440
And he had a very
demanding father

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.630
who made his life miserable
and always told him

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.470
he would not be successful.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.340
So his actions as an
adult were playing out

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.240
from his own suffering.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.190
So once I recognized
and had the ability

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:33.530
to perceive that other people
were suffering, not just

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:38.310
me-- my parents-- and
also to be able to attend

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:44.510
to my own suffering by being
compassionate to myself,

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.980
giving myself
self-affirmation, it

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:53.000
allowed me to no longer
have an emotional response

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.820
and to be able to
more thoughtfully

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.790
or discerningly think
through interactions.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:07.500
And in fact, many of you
read Viktor Frankl's book?

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.550
This is a psychiatrist who
was a victim of the Holocaust

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.220
and was in a concentration camp.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.599
And basically the
summation of his experience

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.690
was that he could
tell essentially

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.720
in just a short
conversation with somebody

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.950
if they were going to survive
in the concentration camp.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.300
The most important
determinant of that

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.322
was that they had
meaning and a purpose.

00:17:32.322 --> 00:17:33.202
OK?

00:17:33.202 --> 00:17:34.660
But the other thing
he talked about

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:41.130
was this idea of
stimulus and response.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.390
And this is the aspect
of the second lesson

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:49.140
that Ruth taught me, which was--
and let me give you an example.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.110
Have any of you had anybody
cut you off on the freeway?

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.870
Now you usually do two things.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.380
One is a hand movement, right?

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.431
Meng's is to wave.

00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:03.305
But he's enlightened.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.540
But the other one
is usually some sort

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.030
of an expletive that
comes out of your mouth.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.150
And so this event occurs.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.070
You have this immediate
emotional response.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.040
And then you do something.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.370
And oftentimes it's
not helpful, is it?

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.230
Now, let's say, though,
if I taught you to look

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.720
at the world a different way.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.160
As an example, the
person who cut you off--

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:36.890
instead of thinking that they're
a jerk, what if you reframed it

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.507
and said, well, what if the
person driving that car--

00:18:40.507 --> 00:18:41.840
his wife is sitting next to him.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.810
She's nine months pregnant.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.570
She broke her water.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:44.216
She's bleeding.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.770
He's trying to get
her to the hospital.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.280
Would you feel the same way
about your hand movement

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.980
or the way you were
thinking about them?

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.000
And so in this short
little exercise here,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.200
you've already seen the world
a completely different way.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.490
And you see, it's seeing
this world-- we give people

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.610
the benefit of the doubt.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.680
You look at it in a
completely different way.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.460
It's one of the
most powerful gifts

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.490
that you can give to somebody.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.710
Because most of the time,
the negative interactions

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.100
that you have with
people oftentimes

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.800
have nothing to do with you.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.340
Somebody comes up
to you aggressively.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.650
And what do you do again?

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.760
How do most of us react
when somebody comes up

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.340
to us aggressively?

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.240
We react aggressively, don't we?

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.870
True?

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.050
But if you then looked
at the person and said,

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.260
jeez, this is not
their normal behavior.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.840
Why would they be
acting this way?

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.180
And you said to them, jeez, Mike
or Jim or whoever, you know,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.540
it's so unusual to act this way.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.080
What's wrong with you?

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.790
Again, you reframe it.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.620
Again, because you're
taking the time.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.560
And when you take the
time with that pause,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.480
we know that that
allows-- instead

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.640
of having a reactive interaction
associated with engagement

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.800
of your sympathetic
nervous system,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.180
it allows for engagement of your
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.260
which is affiliative--
wants to connect and is

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.290
when your executive
control area works best.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.140
And you are more thoughtful.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.080
You are more discerning.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.630
And of course, when you do that
the outcome is much better.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:45.010
So this was this idea of taming
the mind that Ruth taught me

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.030
as the next part.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.527
And, of course, you
know that it's hard

00:20:51.527 --> 00:20:53.360
if you're wrapped up
in your own suffering--

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.940
in your own issues-- to
care for other people.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.520
Because it's hard to be present
and you're focused on yourself,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.649
which doesn't allow you to
give attention to other people.

00:21:04.649 --> 00:21:06.190
So the third thing
that she taught me

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.370
was this idea of
opening the heart.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.140
Now, opening the
heart can be very

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.990
challenging for some
people, and some people

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.910
don't know what
that means exactly.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.770
It gets back to what
I was just talking to,

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:26.080
which is this idea of looking
at people in a different way.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.820
Now certainly it's easy for
all of us in this room-- well,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.580
maybe not always
with your spouse--

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.020
but for most of us for our
children, as an example,

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.180
it's easy to give them
unconditional love.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.730
And hopefully you also
do this with your partner

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:41.567
or your spouse.

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:42.650
But even that can be hard.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.561
It can be challenging, can't it?

00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:46.060
I mean, have any
of you gotten upset

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.030
with your partner or spouse?

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.232
Oh, come on here.

00:21:51.232 --> 00:21:53.190
They must have something
in the water at Google

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.820
that makes everybody
just love each other.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.170
But all of us have gotten
upset with our spouses.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:04.670
And so imagine if it's
easy to do that, then what

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:10.350
about giving compassion or
unconditional love to someone

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.800
who you don't know?

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.500
And then the next
step is giving it

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:21.280
to someone who you may have a
negative feeling about that?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.150
And these are big,
big challenges.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.820
But what we do know
from science is

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.680
that when you mentally
function that way--

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.850
where that is your
default mode-- again,

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:37.190
this is when you connect most,
which is our default mode.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.236
This is when your
physiology works the best.

00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:41.610
Now one of the
things I mentioned

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:42.818
earlier was these four words.

00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:44.550
Does anybody remember them?

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:49.480
As a neurosurgeon, we test
people on short term memory.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.780
You all failed.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:57.770
So suffering, authenticity,
connection, service.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:58.660
OK.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.410
So when we talk
about authenticity,

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.510
this is also a
challenge for people.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.150
Because-- especially at a place
like Google-- because most

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.630
of the people who I know who
work at Google-- with maybe one

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.330
or two exceptions, I'm just
kidding-- are exceptions.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.520
Those are two of
them right-- no.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.440
With few exceptions are actually
incredibly accomplished people.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.687
But you know one-- I guess no
one else in the room thinks so,

00:23:30.687 --> 00:23:31.270
and I'm sorry.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.950
But-- are you guys
OK over there?

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.470
Yes.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.630
But the thing, though,
is that I can't tell you

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.050
the number of times when I've
been at Google-- and with Meng

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.980
and others-- and
oftentimes there's

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.330
a compulsion by some to sit
there and say, you know,

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.150
I'm from Harvard.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:58.810
And I graduated with a 4.8,
and I was the top of my class.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.430
Well, that's not even related
to the conversation here.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.490
And the problem is-- or
the challenge of this

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.560
oftentimes-- is why do
people say things like that?

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.370
Because they want to
project what they think

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.970
is their best self to you.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.689
And there's a great cartoon.

00:24:18.689 --> 00:24:20.230
And it's two people,
and they're just

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.070
meeting each other
up in whatever--

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.790
where the writing is.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.530
It says, jeez, their
projection of themselves

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.810
was so impressive
now I have to create

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.260
my own projection to compete
with their projection.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.350
Right?

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:38.850
And the problem is that everyone
in this room is suffering.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.450
They have had failures.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.500
They have done things that
they're not proud of themselves

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.530
about.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.840
They have hurt other people.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.420
Because that is the
nature of our humanity.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.040
And the problem is, though, that
if all you project to another

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.390
person is your best self,
then you cannot connect

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.320
authentically.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.460
And it's this
authentic connection

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.810
that empowers you to
be your best self.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:19.190
As an example, I know
that-- and it's interesting.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.970
Because I have
colleagues, and they'll

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.770
make these presentations about
the most horrible disasters

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:24.640
in the world.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.860
And they just have
this monotone where

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.290
there's absolutely no emotional
content to what they're saying.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:37.940
But if I give a talk and a part
of it-- which you've already

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.970
probably noticed here.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:43.240
There are certain times where my
voice has cracked a little bit

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.170
or I may get emotional.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:52.350
As soon as I do that, you
sort of resonate with that.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.100
That's who we really are.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.300
And it's allowing
yourself to not

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.040
be your best self--
allowing yourself

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.470
to be exposed as the
frail fragile human

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.380
being that you are--
that allows you

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.010
to connect best with people.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.300
So this whole idea of
authenticity-- and this

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.270
is something that Brene Brown
has promoted and done research

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:20.020
on-- is extraordinarily powerful
and is important to have

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.950
true relationships.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.970
And one of the reasons
that prevents us

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.215
from that-- do any of you
know about the blue zones?

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.200
The green zones?

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.820
The red zones?

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.250
So there are parts of the world
where people live routinely to

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.760
over a century, and these
are called the blue zones.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.130
And there's been a lot of
work on why this is the case.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.510
And what's extraordinary is
that in some of these places,

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.970
you know these
people-- they smoke.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.040
They drink.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.960
Yet they're still living
to over a century.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.820
And what is it that they found
that's the most important thing

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.140
and that relates to
what I was just saying?

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.940
It's that in those
situations, those people

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.900
live in small villages
or places where

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.860
there are multigenerational
families where

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.710
they have lived with the same
people their entire lives.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.690
And so what happens
in that situation?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.200
And why do those people
then live so long?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.920
Because that is how we were
meant to be as a species.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.890
Because in those situations--
unlike this idea where you're

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.890
presenting your best
self-- if you've grown up

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.770
there running around naked as
a child and everyone has seen

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.400
you, if you've sort of done
all your juvenile delinquent

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.720
things as a child and
everyone still loves you,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.274
what do you know?

00:27:44.274 --> 00:27:47.084
You know you're loved
unconditionally.

00:27:47.084 --> 00:27:48.500
You know, I've
spent a lot of time

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.240
with various religious and
spiritual leaders-- the Dalai

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.510
Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh,
Amma-- and one of the things

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.010
that I will tell
you about every one

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:02.260
of them is that as soon as
you're in their presence,

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.680
there is a lightness
to your spirit

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.740
and the sense of
unconditional love.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.380
Because what do you
know as soon as you

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.590
walk into their presence?

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.570
You know there's no agenda.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.270
You know that they love
you unconditionally.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.950
And you no longer have to
carry this projection around

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.940
that you promote
to other people.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:26.740
And the psychological weight of
that burden is incredibly huge.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:33.540
So we were then talking about
sort of opening your heart.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.890
And one of the challenges
I had growing up

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.230
was I heard the first
two lessons that Ruth

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.470
had taught me and the last one.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.860
And the last one was this
idea of clarity of intention.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.140
And the techniques that
I've talked about-- which

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.760
are outlined in the
book and you can

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.570
find in other places as well--
this idea of visualization

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.010
or clarity of intention
is incredibly important.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:03.360
And when you have this ability
to attend, to relax, to change

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.470
the dialogue, and then utilize
this technique of clarity

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:12.230
of intention, this on
a subconscious level

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:20.070
imbues you with a ability to
be much, much more powerful

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.630
than you can even imagine.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:26.140
And as a result,
[MUSIC PLAYING] music

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.203
starts playing spontaneously
in any environment.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.710
It allows you to
achieve your goals.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.779
Now certainly, of course,
that's in the context

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:40.070
of they're not harmful to
others, et cetera, et cetera.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.110
I'll throw that karmic
requirement in there

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.342
even though I'm an atheist.

00:29:45.342 --> 00:29:47.210
And this is actually
the technique

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.330
that really allowed me
to have great success.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.220
So after this period
of time with Ruth

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.010
over the six-week period,
my personal circumstances

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.160
in no way changed whatsoever.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.600
What changed was how I reacted
to those circumstances.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.490
And this is the
case with all of us.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.600
It's really not the events in
our lives that are the problem.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.970
It is our reaction
to those events.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:21.520
It is us who gives power to
those events, either to help us

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.740
or to hinder us.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:29.510
And that's really the idea
behind really pretty much

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:34.750
all of the teaching that gave
me in addition to this aspect

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.497
of actually opening your heart.

00:30:37.497 --> 00:30:39.080
And I'll talk about
that a little more

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.034
and how I ignored it.

00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:42.950
The thing, though, about
clarity of intention,

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.910
though, is many of us would like
the simple way-- which is jeez,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:46.930
I used this technique.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.430
I really practiced it.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.770
I have this point here.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.796
I want to go to point
B. It's going to be

00:30:51.796 --> 00:30:52.920
this smooth, straight line.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.560
It will all happen as fast
as I want it to happen.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.140
The reality is it
doesn't work that way.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.227
Even in the face of those
best techniques, typically

00:31:01.227 --> 00:31:02.310
it is not a straight line.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:07.780
It is an up and down valley
with detours and setbacks.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.220
And I give many
examples in the book.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.430
At least for me, it did allow me
to ultimately get from point A

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.530
to point B. Let's see.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:23.424
We covered-- what
are the four things?

00:31:23.424 --> 00:31:24.398
AUDIENCE: Suffering.

00:31:24.398 --> 00:31:25.372
Authenticity.

00:31:25.372 --> 00:31:26.350
Connection.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.830
DR. JAMES R. DOTY: Connection.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.955
So we covered connection--
the power of connection.

00:31:28.955 --> 00:31:31.790
Why do we want to connect,
or why physiologically

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.060
does that happen for us?

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.020
Why is it important?

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:41.730
Well, there are three
parts of us-- our species--

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:46.570
that we evolved and
which were necessary.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.405
And as a result, it was
critically important

00:31:48.405 --> 00:31:50.240
that we connect.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.560
And that was something
called theory

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.440
of mind, abstract thinking,
and complex language.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.810
The requirement for that
was an enlarged cortex,

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.850
but the other aspect of
it was that our species,

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.360
unlike other species--
what has to happen?

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.110
We do not just run off into
the forest or swim away.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.750
We have to be
attended to for, what,

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:20.113
15, 20 years-- in my case, over
30 years-- to our offspring.

00:32:20.113 --> 00:32:21.660
Right?

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.630
If our offspring are not cared
for for a decade and a half

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.830
or two decades, they will not
survive in a harsh environment.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.270
So what are the critical parts?

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.061
Many of you have heard
of the mirror neuron

00:32:32.061 --> 00:32:35.060
system, which allows
our species to mirror

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.560
the behaviors of others.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.720
But it is critical, and it
takes immense amounts of time.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.730
But what would be the
reward for the parent

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.010
to put so much energy and
resources to our offspring

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.090
unless there was something
that they got from it?

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:57.990
And what they get from it is
we are rewarded with oxytocin.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.210
OK?

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.510
When we get these
drips of oxytocin,

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.140
it causes our pleasure
centers and our reward

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.840
centers to increase
their metabolism.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.670
And we are getting
benefit from caring.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.360
The other aspect is
that as a species,

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.620
to care for our
offspring we have

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.080
to be able to understand
their emotional state

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:26.060
in a microsecond and attend
to their suffering or pain.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.130
And this is why--
and Paul Ekman has

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.910
done this work on micro
facial expressions.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.059
There's a body of
work on body posture.

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:34.350
And let me give you an example.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.891
Any of you who has
lived with someone

00:33:35.891 --> 00:33:40.250
for a long period of time,
if they walk into a room

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.510
and don't say a word,
generally speaking you

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.200
can tell if there's
something going on.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.670
You can tell if they're happy.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.890
You can tell if they're sad.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.880
You can tell if they're hurt.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.140
And this is this thing
that oftentimes we

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.780
don't appreciate
that we have and we

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.610
get distracted from because
we are not attending.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.990
OK?

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.880
And this is how we evolved.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.130
When we attend,
science has shown

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.199
that our physiology
works at its best

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.480
and that is what we
are designed to do.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.310
Amazingly the same traits
were critically important

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.540
as we went from
the nuclear family

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.850
to the hunter gatherer tribes.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.920
Remember, that was our
primary survival strategy

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.600
until 6,000 to 8,000 years
ago in groups of 10 to 50.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.409
If a person did not live up
to their responsibilities

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:32.739
in that group and put
the group at risk,

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:36.679
then potentially bad
things would happen.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.510
So an individual being able
to see the suffering of one

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.110
of their members of their tribe
and alleviate that suffering--

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.250
again, critical to our survival.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.630
And then, of course, we
evolved to culture, religion,

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.909
and what we know as
today's modern society,

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:54.350
of which we were never
meant to live in, right?

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.280
Evolution is a
very slow process.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.390
It takes millions of years,
while technological development

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.160
simply takes less
than a decade or two.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.150
So you see this exponential
growth here and us here.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:12.330
So we have to basically live
with our baggage from evolution

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.690
and be our best person.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.880
And that baggage includes
what we're talking about,

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.890
which is this flight or fight
response which is characterized

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.830
by activation of our sympathetic
nervous system, which can

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.330
be deleterious to our health.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:31.250
It is this tendency
to have a desire

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.750
to connect with people who
look like you, act like you,

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.080
think like you.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.772
And this is called tribalism.

00:35:37.772 --> 00:35:39.980
And we see this playing out
in the political process,

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.070
don't we?

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:48.530
And where people-- if you
activate their fear mechanism,

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.289
then they go off into tribalism.

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:52.080
And then they want to
exclude other people.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.350
And this is a negative
part of our baggage.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.600
The positive part of our baggage
is this caring, nurturing part,

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.310
which is really
our default mode.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.470
These other two parts actually
are very negative towards us.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.970
But these types of
practices I described to you

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.590
can overcome those.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.720
And as long as you
have a self-awareness

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.870
and also understand
your own cognitive

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.310
biases towards being
these other ways,

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.840
it can allow you to reach
your full potential.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.680
So coming from the environment
which I described to you,

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.610
I was able to go to
college, to medical school,

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.740
become a neurosurgeon, become
a professor at Stanford,

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.780
run a technology company-- a
medical device company-- that

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.180
went public for $1.3 billion.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.530
But the thing I did not connect
with all of this at the time

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.700
and that I was reacting
to-- because I really

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.230
believed that what would
make me happy was what?

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.790
Money.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.720
Because my life as a
child was out of control.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.940
So I believed that money
would give me control,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.380
and therefore, control
would give me happiness.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.120
And along this path I
took, I ended up not

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.840
actually opening
my heart, really,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.410
the way that I had
been taught by Ruth.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.410
And it had a very negative
effect ultimately.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.160
So here I was, theoretically
at the pinnacle of my success,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.240
where I had Ferraris and
Porsches and big houses

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.350
and traveling all over
the place in private jets,

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:21.820
and I had never been so
miserable in my entire life.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.140
Because what I thought
that would give me

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.530
sustenance was a chimera.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:32.600
It only led to more emptiness.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.350
And finally, when I was in a
position and self-reflected

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.300
on what was really important--
which actually took me back

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.820
to this magic shop with this
woman and dissecting everything

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.280
that she had taught
me-- I realized

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.750
the most important thing
was this opening the heart

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:52.370
and having connection.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:56.260
And it led me ultimately in the
face of actually financially

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:01.326
losing everything to giving
away the last asset that I had,

00:38:01.326 --> 00:38:02.700
which was stock
in a company that

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.062
had not gone public to charity.

00:38:04.062 --> 00:38:06.020
Because I had made some
commitments to charity,

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.510
even though I was
essentially $3 million

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.170
in the hole from being bankrupt.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.206
Because I lost everything
during the dot com thing.

00:38:13.206 --> 00:38:15.080
But that then allowed
me to create the center

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.155
that I run at Stanford,
to connect with the Dalai

00:38:17.155 --> 00:38:19.280
Lama and a variety of other
spiritual and religious

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.880
leaders, and really
changed my view.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.700
So I talked about
connection, but this

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.990
is where service comes in.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.820
It has been shown, and
I'll give you an example.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.710
There is a Wisconsin
longitudinal study.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.280
And this is a
study that was done

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.380
in people over the age of 65.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.870
And one group committed to
a certain minimum amount

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:44.560
of service to others.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.420
The other group was a
control group and did not.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.980
And it shows you the power
of connecting to others

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.270
and being of service
to others and caring.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.890
The people who did a
minimum number of hours

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.220
over a period of time
compared to the control group

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:06.090
had a 1.9 X increase
in longevity

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.610
compared to the other group.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.680
1.9.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.700
Huge, huge.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.290
Now, there were a
couple exceptions.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.165
The exceptions related
to when the people who

00:39:14.165 --> 00:39:16.290
did the service--
they did not receive

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.290
the benefit-- a
subset-- and those

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:21.690
were people who were
doing it for self benefit.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.590
They wanted to get
a reward, or they

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.320
wanted to impress other people.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.620
You can't fake these things.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.607
You have to care.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.487
So that is the power of service.

00:39:32.487 --> 00:39:33.820
That is the power of connection.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.830
That is the power
of authenticity

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.310
and the recognition that
everyone in this room

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.380
is suffering in
some way or another.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.030
And even the person who
appears the most prominent,

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.880
the most successful-- many
times those people are

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.780
alone in a room crying.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.020
Now I told you about 10
letters of the alphabet.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.260
And I'll finish up with that.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.092
Do I have enough
time to do that?

00:39:56.092 --> 00:39:56.592
Great.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.150
I was asked to give a talk-- and
it was quite an honor for me--

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.850
to my medical school.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.470
Because, believe it or not,
my medical school actually

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.680
let me into medical
school without a degree

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.955
and with a GPA of
2.53 out of four.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.630
And that's a long story.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.800
It's in the book,
so read the book.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.580
But I ultimately-- at
the end of the day--

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.170
I was the last person
who probably would

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:32.560
be accepted to medical school.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.330
And in fact, I was
just with the president

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.450
of the university and the
dean, and they told me

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.220
I still have the record
for the lowest GPA

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.261
and not getting a degree.

00:40:40.261 --> 00:40:42.790
So it's necessarily
I'm something proud of,

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.220
but I had a few
distractors in there.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.130
But I want to talk
about this-- what I

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.000
call the alphabet of the heart.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.770
And I'll tell you the story
about the medical school really

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:53.270
quick.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.170
So they did accept me, and it
is a very unusual situation.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:00.605
But what happened is-- and
this is also to show you--

00:41:00.605 --> 00:41:05.060
you can never predict the
trajectory of someone's life.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.110
I became a very
successful entrepreneur

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.230
as I indicated to you.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:14.340
After Hurricane Katrina, the
medical school was flooded.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.800
They moved the medical
school to Baylor in Houston.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.730
The present dean-- he got
so depressed about this,

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.290
he resigned.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.480
They had no dean.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.230
The library was damaged.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.500
So they were trying
to recruit a dean,

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.610
and they wanted a
fellow from Harvard.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.550
But he wanted an endowed chair.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:36.810
Well, I was in the
position to endow his chair

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:38.340
and repair the library.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.220
And I set up a multimillion
dollar scholarship for students

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.430
who were going into service.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:47.550
Yet, I was the last person
who you would probably

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.929
think would be accepted
to medical school.

00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:52.470
And so I'm on the
Board of Governors,

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.636
the President's Council of
the university, the board

00:41:54.636 --> 00:41:56.960
of administrators, et cetera.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.560
My point is that you
can do amazing things,

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.220
and you can never
predict the power

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.620
you have over another
person to change

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.800
their life like this
Ruth person did for me.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.660
And each of us-- no
matter our position--

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.410
if you recognize another
person and give them

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.740
the gift of your
time or attention,

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.076
you can change everything.

00:42:18.076 --> 00:42:19.951
But back to these 10
letters of the alphabet.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.570
So I was asked to give this
talk to the new medical students

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.280
to try to inspire them
for a future in medicine.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.890
And I spent a lot of time
thinking about this, including

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:37.760
my time with Ruth and all the
lessons that I had learned

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.360
and all the science behind it.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.930
And I came up with 10
letters of the alphabet

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:46.530
that I actually now use as
my own personal practice.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.570
And it starts with
C and ends with L.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.580
And I go through this with
intention multiple times a day,

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.880
and it centers me and,
again, clarifies my intention

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.960
as to who I wish to be.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.240
And that's compassion
for self and others.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.240
Recognizing the dignity
of every person.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.340
Practicing equanimity.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.105
Practicing forgiveness.

00:43:11.105 --> 00:43:12.480
Because what
happens with so many

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.310
is you hold these
emotions, because you

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.670
think someone has wronged you.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.060
And it stops you
from connecting.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.630
And you always carry this.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.150
So forgiveness.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.310
Having gratitude.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.830
Science has now shown that
showing gratitude-- having

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.980
gratitude-- is
one of the biggest

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.290
effectors of your own health
and mental well-being.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.660
You know, so many
people in this area--

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.390
they're always looking up
about what others have.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.420
Yet if you look down and you see
what the rest of the world has,

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.980
you're one of the most
blessed people in the world.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.782
H is humility.

00:43:46.782 --> 00:43:48.240
I will tell you,
as a neurosurgeon,

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.990
practicing humility is
probably the hardest.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.900
Nobody says anything.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.840
You're supposed to laugh.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.420
Neurosurgeons are
not usually humble.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.630
It's difficult,
but, you know, when

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.330
you recognize-- it's hard to
be compassionate to another

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.560
person, to care
for another person,

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.520
if you're looking down on them.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.250
These practices have
to be done eye to eye.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.690
Because no one is
better than you,

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.160
and you're better than no one.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.260
The other one is integrity
or having personal values

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.910
that you live by.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:27.500
Then one that is important
to me is justice.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.177
We have a responsibility
for our privileged position

00:44:31.177 --> 00:44:32.926
to care for those who
are most vulnerable.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.600
The last is the active
component of compassion,

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.580
which is kindness.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.930
And all of this is
contained by love.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.655
Those are the 10 letters now.

00:44:49.655 --> 00:44:51.780
I'll end this with telling
you an interesting story

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.050
about those 10 letters.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.424
About two months after I
got-- or I gave-- that talk,

00:44:56.424 --> 00:44:57.590
I got an email from a woman.

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.089
She said, I'm the
spiritual director

00:44:59.089 --> 00:45:02.310
of the largest homeless
shelter in the United States.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:06.299
And she said, all my
friends had sent me

00:45:06.299 --> 00:45:07.590
notes because I was burned out.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.880
I couldn't go to work anymore.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.170
I had resigned my position.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:14.310
And on my last day at work
after everything had failed,

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.530
I saw your talk that
goes through these 10

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:17.822
letters of the alphabet.

00:45:17.822 --> 00:45:19.530
And it was so inspiring
to me, it gave me

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.821
the strength to return to work.

00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:24.660
And I was, of course,
incredibly moved by that.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.240
And so I thanked
her for the note.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.031
And a few months later,
she said, you know,

00:45:28.031 --> 00:45:29.942
we started using
this on our clients.

00:45:29.942 --> 00:45:30.900
And it's very powerful.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.760
We use it every morning
to start our day.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.315
And again, I'm
extraordinarily moved.

00:45:35.315 --> 00:45:37.070
She sent me another note.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:42.860
And she says, you know, my best
friend's daughter makes beads.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.300
And she says, as you know,
in all religions beads

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.110
are utilized for centering.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.740
She said, my friend's
daughter made a set of beads

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.270
with 10 wooden
beads, but she also

00:45:54.270 --> 00:46:00.370
added another bead, which was
to represent the golden rule.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:04.100
And she said, I've started using
this and carrying this around.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.430
And would you mind if we
sell this as a fundraiser?

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:08.550
So then they did that.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.630
Then a few months passed.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.280
She sends me another email.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.050
And she says, we made a
video about these beads,

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:15.710
because they're so powerful.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:16.630
And it's on YouTube.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:17.910
And it's called
compassion beads,

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.493
and it's associated
also with her work

00:46:19.493 --> 00:46:21.480
at the San Antonio Peace Center.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.780
And it's this
beautiful video that

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.350
talks about how utilizing
these in practices.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.160
And this is clarity
of intention.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.330
It creates, if you will,
these compassion super-neural

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:35.580
highways.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.380
And so this has gone
on, and now these

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.820
are sold all over the world.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.222
But it's really a
powerful statement.

00:46:42.222 --> 00:46:43.930
And I actually carry
them around with me,

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.010
and it's become actually
my own practice.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.560
Because at any time, I can
just touch one of those

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:54.010
and it puts me into this mode
of self-reflection, connection,

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.610
and sort of trying or
aspiring to be the best

00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:59.750
person that I can be.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.500
And I know that's
what all of us want.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.545
So thank you.

00:47:06.663 --> 00:47:11.950
Do we have time for questions?

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:12.910
Any?

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:13.790
Oh, sure.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:15.040
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any questions?

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.840
I'll pass the mic around,
because this video is recorded.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.680
And if there are any
questions on the live stream,

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.860
feel free to ping it to me.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:27.360
Ruchika@ and then I'll be
happy to ask on your behalf.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.844
Any questions in
the audience first?

00:47:30.844 --> 00:47:33.093
DR. JAMES R. DOTY: I must
be the most cogent lecturer.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.450
AUDIENCE: So your talk
was very inspiring.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.470
DR. JAMES R. DOTY: Thank you.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.020
AUDIENCE: I want to
know about the woman

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.853
that in the [INAUDIBLE]
shop-- are you still

00:47:41.853 --> 00:47:43.280
in touch with her?

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.484
Has she done anything
else for you after the--

00:47:45.484 --> 00:47:46.900
DR. JAMES R. DOTY:
Well, she would

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.760
have to be-- she
would have to be

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.160
like in your longevity program,
because she'd be about 104

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.312
right now.

00:47:53.312 --> 00:47:54.770
So when I met her,
she was probably

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.120
in her late 40s or early 50s.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.720
Actually a strange
part of that story

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.560
is that after about nine months,
because this was so powerful

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.540
for me, I wanted to go
back and see her and thank

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.310
her and connect with her.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:09.874
And I went back
to the strip mall.

00:48:09.874 --> 00:48:12.540
And there was a fence around it,
and all the stores were closed.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.360
And it was very strange.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.470
This was in the high desert.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.303
And if you've ever lived
in the high desert,

00:48:16.303 --> 00:48:18.630
in the wee evenings
the skies can sort of

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:22.210
get this dark blue
with different shades

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:23.560
and wispy clouds.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.689
And I used to drive this
orange Stingray bike.

00:48:25.689 --> 00:48:27.980
And I pulled up there, and
I was reflecting on the fact

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.320
that it was gone.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.290
She had completely disappeared.

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.815
And as I'm sitting there on my
bike and thinking about this,

00:48:33.815 --> 00:48:37.520
this big tumbleweed
blows into my bicycle.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.240
It was like almost
this TV moment.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.230
But no, I never saw her again.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.130
Now, to research this book,
though, because many of us

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:49.270
don't appreciate that our
memories can-- even though we

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.180
have a clear memory
of something--

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.280
can often not be real.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.260
And in fact, a wonderful
example-- there's

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.660
a woman who used to tell a
story that her father died

00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.680
when she was 10.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.430
And she would go around
telling everybody,

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.620
you know, I keep my
father in my heart.

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.875
Because every night he would
read the same story to me.

00:49:06.875 --> 00:49:09.125
And then at some point, she
was telling somebody that,

00:49:09.125 --> 00:49:10.400
and she goes,
that's not possible.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.630
She goes, what are
you talking about?

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.046
She says, well,
the author who did

00:49:13.046 --> 00:49:15.410
that story didn't write
it until five years

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.170
after your father died.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:20.880
But she created a
narrative in her head.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.430
So actually at one point, as I
was going back and reflecting

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.800
on all of my interactions
with this woman, I'm going,

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.840
did I just make this up?

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.595
And so I actually
got it investigated.

00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:33.470
And we researched it.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.730
We tracked down the grandson.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.210
And in fact, he said she was
exactly like I described.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.380
And she had had sort
of this background.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.160
And what's interesting
about this,

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.420
though it's sad in some
ways, is that the guy who

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.770
owned the store-- he had
divorced his wife and the son

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:53.580
lived with the wife.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.370
And that summer that
child who was my age

00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:01.360
was supposed to be with
them during the summer.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.330
And the parents got
into a big argument,

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:06.500
and the mother
refused to send him.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:13.090
So I think I probably got the
benefit of that interaction.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:14.890
Any other questions?

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:16.086
Yes, sir?

00:50:16.086 --> 00:50:18.870
AUDIENCE: Sort of an
anecdote, slash, question.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.440
I read your book last month.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.500
It was a great time
for me to read it,

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.620
because five years ago I had
done a visualization exercise.

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.150
And so it's been five years.

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:32.290
And everything had come to pass.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.880
And I was sort of doing this
reflection of, like, OK.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.720
I need to do my next five years.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.350
And now I'm scared shitless.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:43.650
This came to pass
and what do I do now?

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:46.110
Like, the pressure
and the-- seeing

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:48.850
the power of these
techniques sort of

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:54.040
puts me in this place where
I'm at an impasse of how

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.250
do I actually
visualize the next set?

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.880
And I was just
wondering-- I don't know

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.130
that I have a direct question.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:03.030
But I was just--

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.220
DR. JAMES R. DOTY: No, I
understand what you're saying.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.690
Because sometimes
it can be scary,

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.600
because you see
these events unfold

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.090
before you, which
actually sometimes

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.650
seem extraordinarily amazing.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.920
And I can say that with my own
experience as you read about.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.520
But the challenge
for I think all of us

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.350
is we create these types
of narratives in our head,

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.210
but we become attached to them.

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:29.290
And then we start grasping.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.400
And this is the
biggest challenge--

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.870
is because while we may
with good intention--

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:37.770
with clarity of intention--
desire something, when

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:42.250
we attach to it very strongly,
actually that interferes

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:45.030
many times with it
actually manifesting.

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.790
And when it doesn't
manifest, because you're

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:51.690
so emotionally attached to it,
it has very negative effect.

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:56.010
As an example, I've been working
on a project for some time.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.850
And it has done very well.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.820
And I had manifested
that it was going

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.740
to go on in a different way.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.410
And it appears as though
that's not the case.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:07.940
And you know, my
initial response--

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:13.830
because it was so important to
me-- is to bemoan the-- oh god.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:14.930
What did I do?

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:16.520
What's wrong with me?

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.680
And the thing, though, is that
by not having an attachment

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.300
to that and still being
joyous and thankful

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.080
of what you already have,
then you're liberated.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.330
Because what you're describing
is a fear of success.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.510
But why would you have
a fear of success?

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:38.310
So you have to
remember that you can

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:40.020
be joyous in every situation.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.800
And it's getting
back to it's not

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:47.050
the situation-- it's how you
respond to the situation.

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:48.797
And that's always,
always the case.

00:52:48.797 --> 00:52:50.630
And that's one of the
greatest gifts you can

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:54.090
have-- is to see this reality.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:57.700
Because events have no power.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.010
It's you only give them power.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.300
Any other questions?

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.076
Yes, ma'am?

00:53:05.957 --> 00:53:07.790
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
on several occasions

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:11.190
how we've used science to
inform compassion practices-- so

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.010
the longevity
studies and whatnot.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:14.880
Are we turning around
to use compassion

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.060
to inform scientific research
or interaction with patients?

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.280
How does it flip back over?

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.212
DR. JAMES R. DOTY: Correct.

00:53:23.212 --> 00:53:25.170
We are doing that.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.590
Yes.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:29.310
In every domain of life.

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:32.560
And this is why fundamentally
in every religious practice,

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.360
compassion is at the base.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.550
Because it's so, so important.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.850
If you look-- not only
for the individual, which,

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:42.620
in some ways, is what
we're talking about today--

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.578
but if you look at the
educational environment,

00:53:44.578 --> 00:53:50.990
a variety of studies that
with intent put compassion

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:54.500
in the forefront, in the
educational environment

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.080
with mindfulness
types of practices,

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.650
this is having a significant
effect on attendance

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:06.227
and academic performance
and decreasing violence.

00:54:06.227 --> 00:54:08.060
Now we're still at the
early stages of this,

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.100
so I don't want
to make a blanket

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.130
statement that jeez, mindfulness
is great for everything.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.100
Because it's not.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.870
And mindfulness alone without
compassion definitely is not.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.319
But in general in regard to
the educational environment,

00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:20.110
if we look at the health
care environment--

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:23.790
I just did a paper and a
blog in the "Huffington Post"

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.310
called "Why Kindness Heals."

00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:29.110
And I even tell my residents
that even though I'm

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:31.750
in a very technologically
sophisticated specialty

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:36.090
such as neurosurgery, my
successes, my outcomes,

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:40.290
are just as much affected by
my connecting with the patient.

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:41.830
And all of you have
been to doctors.

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.350
The worst doctor you
can have is somebody

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.450
who doesn't look you in
the eye, who is brusque,

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.980
sort of looking around here.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:50.390
You know he wants to be
somebody else or someplace else.

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:54.390
But if you see a doctor
who leans forward,

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:56.890
who touches you, who
says, take your time.

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:58.744
I want to understand
what's going on.

00:54:58.744 --> 00:54:59.660
It changes everything.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.920
Because you're shifting
from the stressful mode

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.400
you're in, because seeing
a doctor is stressful,

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.180
to one of calmness and
being with somebody

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.120
who you feel you can
be authentic with,

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.430
who you can trust.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:11.640
And that calms everything.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.190
In fact, we're just
beginning a study

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.970
on how these types of
practices affect wound

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:18.250
healing in surgical patients.

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:22.030
And we actually have a grant
with Dignity Health where we're

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.500
actually looking at how all
of these different types

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.240
of engagements not only affect
patient outcomes, readmission

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:34.140
rates, wound healing, et cetera,
but also how you can decrease

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.400
health care worker burnout.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.230
And we're also doing
these practices

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:41.110
with some of the
medical students as well

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:42.010
as the residents.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:43.490
So at Stanford we
have the center,

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.500
which is the acronym CCARE.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.590
And we actually have developed a
compassion cultivation training

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:50.200
program, which
has been validated

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.690
in a variety of studies.

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:53.700
And we also have
created something

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.080
called the compassion skills
training program online,

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.300
which can be used in
a variety of settings.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.115
In the business
environment, we know

00:56:02.115 --> 00:56:04.150
that the integration of
these types of practices

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:07.580
have an effect, not only--
and again, multiple studies

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.240
have shown this-- if you look
at a publicly traded company

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.280
and the integration of
these types of practices,

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.660
in terms of shareholder
value and productivity--

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.750
that goes up.

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:19.350
In terms of expenditures
on health care,

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:23.020
in regard to these areas we were
talking about earlier, in terms

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:28.540
of HR costs, because people
are not leaving the company,

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.210
they're not not showing up.

00:56:33.331 --> 00:56:35.330
You know, there's this
thing called absenteeism,

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:37.204
but there's also a thing
called presenteeism.

00:56:37.204 --> 00:56:37.900
Right?

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.770
You're here, but
you're not here.

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:45.290
And so then if you look in
the social justice arena,

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:47.980
we have a disaster in the
juvenile justice system.

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.540
We have a militarized
police force.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:50.570
Right?

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:52.560
Those are not
compassionate environments.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.390
But we know-- and
we were just talking

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:55.600
about-- what was her name?

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.730
Bedi?

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:01.890
Kiran Bedi, who from India--
she integrated these types

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:03.359
of practices into
the prison system

00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:04.400
in the police department.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.560
Had a profound, profound
impact-- to the point

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.030
that they require it.

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:09.510
That's what we need to do here.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:11.180
And in fact, I'm
the vice chairman

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.200
of an entity called the
Charter for Compassion.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.379
And there's a compassionate
cities movement.

00:57:16.379 --> 00:57:18.420
And the mayor of Louisville--
believe it or not--

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:23.100
Louisville, a bastion
of blue and red,

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.047
he's integrating all of
these types of things

00:57:25.047 --> 00:57:27.630
into the business environment,
educational environment, health

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.350
care system, all of these.

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:33.220
And the police system and
the juvenile justice--

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.020
and very, very positive impact.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.360
In fact, he was re-elected
without an opponent based

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:42.880
simply on being compassionate.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.060
That is the power of this.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.920
So again, to
emphasize, each of us

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.870
has within our ability to
profoundly affect not only

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:53.540
ourselves but
everyone around us.

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.540
So thank you again.
