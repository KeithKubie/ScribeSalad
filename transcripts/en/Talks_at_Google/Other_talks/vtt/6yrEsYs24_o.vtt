00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:05.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: For our first
talk, Rodrigo, as I mentioned

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.039
is CEO of One Laptop
per Child.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.180
And One Laptop per Child, which
many of you know about,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.460
has been around for a few years
and its mission is to

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.180
empower the world's poorest
children through education.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.650
So today Rodrigo will tell us
the success story of how One

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.110
Laptop has revolutionized
education through nonprofit

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.200
entrepreneurship.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.930
And also unveil information
about the new Android tablet.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.560
And how we can do our
part to help.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.530
Please welcome Rodrigo
Arboleda.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.780
RODRIGO ARBOLEDA: Thank you.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.420
Well thank you Rachel.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.620
And thank you everybody
for being here today.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.930
My name is Rodrigo Arboleda.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.820
And I'm the chairman and CEO
of One Laptop per Child

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.780
Association which is the
operating side for the One

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.220
Laptop per Child Foundation,
that has been run by my dear

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.860
classmate and old time friend,
Nicholas Negroponte, which you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.880
probably know more about.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.790
And I'm very happy to be here
because Google was one of our

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.920
original funders and
benefactors.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030
So this is a continuation of
an already existing story

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.760
between our two groups.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.330
Let me be very rapid in trying
to reach to the end of the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.450
idea that we have here.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.440
So Joe then can talk about the
book and why the connection

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.580
between us, the book,
and you guys.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.482
So let me tell you about the
genesis of this whole idea.

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:31.820
[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

00:01:31.820 --> 00:02:01.490
[TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STARS]

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.370
There was an original concept
that we had, not only to use

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.720
technology in education in third
world countries, but

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.390
also something that Nicholas
and I had been working

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.660
together for more than 31 years,
which is how to bring

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.430
peace through education
as well.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.500
So that was used by some of the
very talented advertising

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.320
agency that had been working
with us on a pro bono basis,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.620
as most of everybody that has
been working with us, in

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.990
trying to convey the message
that this is a mission.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.940
And this is not a
market for us.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.390
Children for us are a mission,
and not a market.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.810
How did I get involved
with this?

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.740
Well I'm an architect
as a profession.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.600
And I went to school with
Nicholas Negroponte

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120
at MIT in the 1960s.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.020
So we are both architects.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.060
And I went back into practice
in the private world.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.570
But 30 years ago I met with him
and we started the first

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.240
large scale project of education
at a distance, when

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.850
Nicholas and I went to my
country of origin, Columbia.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.430
And developed what is considered
to be the most

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.100
important education at a
distance project ever done in

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.380
Latin America at that time.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.420
It was 32 years ago.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.130
And the final push for action
for me, which has prompted me

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.090
to continue all my life in the
current realm dedicated to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.000
this project is, that I have
lost these three children of a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.650
very rare disease.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.700
Of a heart condition.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.390
And my only concern right now
is how to leave the children

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.860
of the world a little bit of a
legacy that I hoped I could

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.020
have left for my
three children.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.150
And therefore it's a combination
of a professional

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.700
friendship with Nicholas.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.550
The dedication to study
and education.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.400
And my personal family life.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.750
How this whole thing started?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.020
Believe it or not this whole
thing started for us when we

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.890
started looking at this in my
country of origin, Columbia.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.920
In 1948 there was a very major
discovery or invention called

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.760
the transistor radio.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.900
Well a priest in the forgotten
lands of the Altiplano of

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.820
Bogota, saw this little
invention and immediately saw

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.310
the connection between that
little gadget and technology.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.130
And immediately put into every
peasant in the region.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.900
At the end there were more than
four and a half million

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.880
peasants, a transistor radio in
the pocket of their shirts

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.780
while they were still plowing
the land with oxen and very

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.230
primitive ways.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.730
And in order to that he created
a radio station that

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.415
was emblematic for 40 years
in Colombia, called Radio

00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:41.090
Sutatenza, Radio Sutatenza.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.990
It transmitted constantly,
while the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.750
peasants and their wives--

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.980
were at home-- and the peasants
in the field,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.030
constant programs on
how to improve the

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.990
conditions of the soil.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.970
The conditions of
the household.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.970
How to boil water, how to do the
most incredible primitive

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.410
ways that for us were
taken for granted.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.710
But for them were nonexistent.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.470
This priest educated four
and a half million

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.810
peasants in that way.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.940
Alvin Toffler in his book,
"The Third Wave" and "The

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.000
Future Shock" visited
with him.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.810
It was very important at that
time how to use technology in

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.290
education and improvement
of social conditions.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.530
The pedagogical side is
these two gentlemen.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.150
It's Jean Piaget from
Switzerland.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.690
And our own Seymour Papert,
South African mathematician

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.870
who went to MIT in 1967 after
having worked with Jean Piaget

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.170
for 15 years.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.030
And they saw that people that
wrote code or programs

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.850
developed something, that for
you might be taken for granted

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.740
right now, a very special
condition of the brain.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.470
And that people who wrote
code could have a better

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.310
understanding of critical
thinking.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.950
Of solution oriented
mentality.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.790
Of sharing.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.370
And of reflection.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.300
Those four issues were
very important.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.840
So Seymour in 1967 arrives at
MIT to start the Artificial

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.330
Intelligence Lab.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.350
And he has the honesty and the
audacity of telling that every

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.330
child in the future should have
a computer and be able to

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.860
write code.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.630
At that time the computer was
larger than this building.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.810
Everybody thought that
this guy was crazy.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.770
But Nicholas saw him, when
Nicholas was already after

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.700
graduating from architecture,
and told him listen, far from

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.280
believing that you're crazy
what I think that you are

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.660
doing is great.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.930
Because what I'm trying to do
is create a graphical user

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.310
interface for us,
poor architects.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.050
That we're the last architects
that are still working with

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.950
square Ts and triangles.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.160
And pencils.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.950
So they got together and that
became an association that

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.310
lasted for almost 40 years
because Seymour now is almost

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.900
90 years of age.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.270
And that's with Nicholas at one
of the last meetings that

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.670
they were together.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.690
And so that prompted us to say,
we need to do something.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.380
We need to try to bring the
new technologies into

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.990
educations in similar fashion,
as the transistor radio and

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.390
radio station were brought
at the time in 1948.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.420
And it is not difficult to
understand because if you take

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.330
into consideration that the
transistor radio of the time

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.710
is today a laptop.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.130
And a radio station of that
time, today is the internet.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.540
Then immediately you can see
the similarities and the

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.430
symbolisms that are present
in this type of concept.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.160
So we didn't invent anything.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.640
We just tried to advance a
concept that we knew had

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.760
worked very well for four and
a half million peasants.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.450
And try to scale it
up to the rest of

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.680
the developing nations.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:50.130
So we needed to then decide
that we needed to

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.390
differentiate learning
from education.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.770
Education is one thing.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.110
It's the accumulation of
a lot of knowledge.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.680
Probably sometimes encyclopedic
knowledge.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.750
But is many times or most of
the times, still after 150

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.400
years of Industrial Revolution,
is still is a very

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.370
active person, which is the
teacher, and a very passive

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.830
person, which is the student,
listening to what they're

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.070
talking about.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.420
Learning is about taking into
your own hands more the

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.240
destiny, and being the architect
of your own destiny.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.230
And if you do that from the very
beginning, we can really

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.280
accomplish tremendous
miracles.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.140
And in order to do that writing
code is, I shouldn't

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.380
be talking about this to you
guys, but writing code for the

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.260
rest of the world is not
understood yet as a basic

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.600
element of learning.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.409
And also programming and
constructionism, what we then

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.920
develop after the basic concept
of writing code, how a

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.980
child of five years of age,
could build his own knowledge

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.870
base by building, by doing.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.900
And that's when Seymour came
up with this already well

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.810
known application called the
Logo language, which is a

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.130
language that allows a child of
five years of age to write

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.830
code in linear programming.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.880
Something that for us, the
pre-generation, required for

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.950
us to have known algebra, then
calculus, and then physics.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.080
Nowadays with that language
this could be done.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.700
This was written in 1980.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.660
And has been the basic element
of our pedagogical ideas.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.380
And that is embedded now in
three iterations which is

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.430
called Scratch, is called EToys
and TurtleArt, depending

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.230
on the age and the complexity
of the child

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.720
that is using them.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.000
But these are the cornerstone
of our

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.160
entire pedagogical element.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.920
Then we started in 1982
in three countries.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.760
We started in Colombia
as you saw before.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.590
When Nicholas working in
France with President

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.920
Mitterand, [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.860
creating what was called at
the time the [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.580
It was a pioneer work
in trying to get

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.310
children to use computers.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.870
And then we went to Senegal,
in Africa.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.070
And then we went to
Pakistan, in Asia.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.320
And that has been the most
important element of the

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.400
experience that we have had.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.630
Then in 2001 in Cambodia,
Nicholas and his family-- his

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.600
son and his former wife--

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.300
saw this little village that has
been very much published.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.620
And you can see it in "60
Minutes" also, because there

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.780
was a big segment in "60
Minutes" about this little

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.790
village in which there was no
electricity, no telephone, no

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.720
running water, nothing.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.100
And Nicholas took a big screen,
a satellite dish, and

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.970
he took a little generator.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.530
And all these children
started--

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.490
and the first word that they
learned how to say was Google.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.000
That was very important because
they immediately

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.560
started investigating Google.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.660
And that was one of the ideas
that Nicholas brought to

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.180
Sergey and Larry.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.520
And that's how they became
involved with us

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.210
five years later on.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.935
This is a school nowadays
that is emblematic.

00:11:01.935 --> 00:11:03.795
There are five of them
right now in Cambodia

00:11:03.795 --> 00:11:05.550
in very remote villages.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.200
And you should take a look
at their websites in "60

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.010
Minutes."

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:19.750
So that idea in Cambodia gave
birth to our idea that if this

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.460
is working in Cambodia, it
should work worldwide.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:29.070
And the blocking element was the
lack of access of a child

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.370
to computational capacity at
prices they could afford.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.560
At that time a laptop
was over a $1,000.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.360
And we thought that we should
reduce at least to 1/10 the

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.620
value of a laptop, in order to
be able to really go to the

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.150
base of the pyramid.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.530
So that's how the famous, or
infamous, name of the $100

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.090
laptop came to be.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.570
It was not that we had already
designed the laptop.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.210
It was that that was the order
of magnitude that we thought

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.980
was needed in order to really
be able to break the barrier

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.960
between massive scaling
of access to

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.320
computational capacity.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.960
And not being able to do so.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.990
And also because then in 2005,
Internet was becoming really

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.910
more ubiquitous.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.110
And it was not, as we did 35
years ago which was very

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.780
rudimentary--

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.980
telephone lines--

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.080
that took forever to
transmit words.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.500
Then Nicholas presented these
with Kofi Annan of the United

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.200
Nations, at the ITU
meeting in Libya.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.500
And it became an instant success
in terms of concept.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.400
The concept was so powerful.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.010
Curiously enough it was more
powerful because of the little

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.900
yellow crank, than
anything else.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.820
But that would remain.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.240
Because we can charge the
battery with a crank, as the

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.300
radios in South Africa do.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.880
But it was such a thing that
everybody became enchanted.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.420
And many presidents
of countries

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.030
started to talk to us.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.490
And then we decided
to launch it.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.190
So what have we done?

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.840
We converted a crisis into
opportunities because of the

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.160
problems that we faced in those
areas of the world.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.430
And this is the computer
at that

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.090
time, as what was presented.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.540
But this is the computer of
today, as you know very well,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.750
because you have seen it
all over the place.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.110
When you see a photo like this
you understand that something

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.290
transformational has happened
to the mind of a child.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.410
When you see the amount of
concentration, when you see

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.100
the amount of devotion, and the
amount of time that they

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.830
play today, and again this is
seven years ago, you might

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.240
think that this is obvious
because of the iPads, and the

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.550
Nexus, and the other tablets
that we have in place.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.180
But at that time it was
unbelievable for a person to

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.310
understand how much these could
be an attractive element

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.900
of learning.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.730
We end the isolation as well.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.150
I mean the child in a remote
village could become connected

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:56.170
and learn and experiment and
enjoy and play and do.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.200
And this is in the remote
villages of Peru in the

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.140
mountains where a child was
teaching the grandparent how

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.400
to read and write.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.470
So it became a child-centric
approach and the children

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.160
became the agents of change.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.360
We have been educated that we
are the ones who embed in the

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.950
children the change.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.880
In this capacity the empowerment
of the child

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.340
became so obvious, that
now we base the

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.660
change in their shoulders.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.170
This is in Bogota, with
Shakira, the singer.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.390
All of her schools are
with our laptops.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.930
And this is in a little
remote shanty town.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.825
And in this little place in
which there's no place even

00:14:37.825 --> 00:14:40.460
for the clothes, there
are two children and

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.690
each child has a laptop.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.230
We have delivered already two
and a half million laptops in

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.120
41 countries and 21 languages.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.430
And this is in Nepal.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.870
And this is in Peru.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.620
And every place we go, this is
the environment that we see.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.040
This is a real movement
and a revolution.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.170
And this is in India.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.370
This teacher, before their
computer arrived, used to

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.800
teach in a very orthodox
manner.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.380
The children were all
sitting in a row.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.260
They could not raise their
hands to talk.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.600
If they raised their hand at
the wrong time, the teacher

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.180
will come with a stick
and hit them.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.250
And the computer arrived and
pandemonium arrived.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:26.250
And the teacher the next day was
teaching in this fashion,

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.700
and he thought I had never been
in my life more alive.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.080
And more feeling a contribution
to the children's

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.270
education than when they
come in the morning.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.310
And I go home every afternoon
saying, I need

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.310
to prepare for tomorrow.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.400
Because tomorrow they're
going to be

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.710
asking me so many questions.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.930
There are going to be so many
involved, that I better be

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.870
sharp in what I'm going
to answer to them.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.120
This is near Bombay.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.820
This is about a week ago
or two weeks ago.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:59.170
You guys have given a prize to
a Sugar Labs kid of 14 years

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:04.350
of age, Augustine, in Uruguay
where we have 700,000 kids

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.090
with a computer.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.740
Every child in Uruguay in
primary school age, including

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.810
autistic children, including
Down Syndrome children,

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.910
including visually impaired
children, and including

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.260
physically impaired children
has one of our laptops.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.160
Connected to the Internet.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.115
It is the first country in the
world in which something like

00:16:24.115 --> 00:16:25.170
this is happening.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.090
It is the most important
educational

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.560
laboratory in the world.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.960
And you guys have something
to do with it.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.070
And you should be very proud
of what has happened there.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:39.570
Well if this guy, which is a
14-year-old hacker, and you

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.930
guys are giving him a prize and
you're going to bring him

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.780
over here to California, and
this happened to him.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.120
Can you imagine what could have
happened to the other

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.740
700,000 children that
are in Uruguay?

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.800
Or to the [? 900 ?]

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.930
children that are in Peru?

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.410
Or to the other 220,000 that we
have in Rwanda in Africa,

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.710
with a computer connected
to the Internet?

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.380
This is the challenge and this
is where the synergies between

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.580
what you guys do and what we
do, could become important.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.220
Let me show you this one also.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:08.609
Another film.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:09.443
This is in Peru.

00:17:09.443 --> 00:17:57.640
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.060
RODRIGO ARBOLEDA [OFFSCREEN]:
He won a prize.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.295
And Robert Redford brought
him to Sundance.

00:18:02.295 --> 00:18:06.030
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.450
RODRIGO ARBOLEDA [OFFSCREEN]:
Because of what he did

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.670
changing the life of a child.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.900
The teacher went with him.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:20:27.050
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.810
RODRIGO ARBOLEDA: So these two
examples, Augustine and this

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:37.200
kid, give you a living
testimony of

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.140
what this is all about.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.790
We have not a computer
project.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.200
We are a social equality
project and change the

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.530
paradigm of the education
project.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.880
That's exactly what we are.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.890
And this is what had
happened until now.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.770
I want to show you where we are
right now because this has

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.230
to do also a lot with you.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.750
Until now we have been
working in Linux.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.993
And the Sugar environment which
is the user interface,

00:20:59.993 --> 00:21:03.010
and is nowadays adopted
worldwide.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.380
And it is understood and
accepted that it is becoming

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.080
the standard of which education
should be all about.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.780
A one to one.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.550
But we are developing a tablet
that is all Android based.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.710
And even more we are now porting
our Sugar environment

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.730
into Android.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.420
And this is one of the reasons
why we are here today is

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.130
because the opportunities for
synergies that could be

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.870
developed among us.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.980
This is coming now in
about two months.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.670
And Walmart is going to
be introducing it.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.490
For the first time we are
coming to the States.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.390
We have done it in two stages.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.040
We went to two slums in
Miami, where I live.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.140
In Liberty City, because there
are pockets of ignorance,

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.610
violence, and ignorance.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.330
In Miami or in any other city of
the United States, equally

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.290
bad as many countries
that we find in

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.990
the third world countries.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.550
And therefore we should have
charity start at home.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.920
So I was able to convince
Nicholas that although this

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.870
was originally intended for
third world countries, there

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.120
should be something that we can

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.040
contribute here in the States.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.320
So what we are doing right now
is launching a massive

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.930
approach of how to bring to
children of fiive years to 12

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.160
years old, now with tablets from
three years to 12 years,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.980
an educational tablet that
could be of use to them.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.340
And this is going to be called
Build Your Own Dreams.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.380
And this is all Android.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.810
And it is all dedicated to
inspire children and to use

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.300
the constructionist approach
to learning in the most

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.270
important fashion that we can.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.040
And this is going to
have all the books.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.960
And this is all designed by the
same team that designed

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.990
our laptop, which is Yves
Behar, a group here.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.870
Fuse Project in San Francisco.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.570
For which even our laptop right
now is in the permanent

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.660
collection of the Museum
of Modern Art.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.510
Here in San Francisco,
and the Museum of

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.030
Modern Art in New York.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.250
This is the actual tablet and
this is where we are now

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.140
trying to combine the worlds
of Linux, Android,

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.820
portability, and low price.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.330
Because these will come
at a much lower

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.020
price than the laptop.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.740
And then I wanted to give you a
very brief glimpse before I

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.670
give Joe the opportunity to
round up why we are here

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:23.230
today, is our next long
term development.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.840
Nicholas has just been named
Chairman of a very interesting

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.670
project which is the X-Prize
project that you guys are

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.820
involved with, because of
this particular project.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.490
It just happened that we are
interested in children that

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.220
had no opportunity whatsoever
to know how to read.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.070
When they are 30 kilometres away
from the nearest school.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.440
And where nobody in their
communities or villages know

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.940
how to read.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:57.010
And we think that there are
between 60 million and 100

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.830
million of these children
worldwide.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.850
So we went and looked around and
we found in Ethiopia this

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.140
community in the crater of a
volcano up in the mountains of

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.160
4,000 meters high up.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.250
And we distributed, together
with Sugata Mitra--

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.950
which you already
know as well--

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.600
on the Hole in the Wall
project in India.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.420
And together with this lady by
the name of Maryanne Wolf from

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.400
Tufts University who dedicated
her life to study autism.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.920
And through that she started
to understand when mankind

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.260
learned how to read.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:36.100
When you pass from a very
graphic description of the

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.260
Egyptians' hieroglyphics to the
very abstract writing of

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.020
cuneiform writing code
of the Assyrians.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.680
When that happened?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.450
She discovers and she explains
in her book.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.990
The size of the brain
increased in about a

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:55.160
millennium or two from about
600 grams to 1,000 grams.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.360
So the brain had to create an
enormous amount of cells in

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.510
order to be able to understand
the passage from a figurative

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.690
environment to an abstract
environment.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.920
So together with these two
gentlemen, a lady and

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.410
gentleman, we have launched
this project.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.130
And this is--

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.180
unfortunately it's too
dark for this one--

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.120
these are the villages
in Ethiopia.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.990
And we about eight months ago
started a project in two

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.650
villages with 23 computers.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.890
These are Motorola laptops,
not computers but tablets.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:24.730
This is the environment.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:25.630
This is the type of village.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.650
There is no electricity,
no sign.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.820
The only words that we were able
to find were some of the

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.680
clothes that had the
Adidas name.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.790
Or whatever type of description

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.130
that came in the clothing.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.870
Nobody in the communities
learned how to read or write.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.610
They had never seen a sign.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.540
And the only thing that we
installed was a solar panel to

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.850
charge the batteries that every

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.950
night charged the computers.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:47.650
The tablets.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.530
And these are Motorola
tablets.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:54.590
And we gave the boxes
to the children.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:59.780
And 10 minutes later everybody
has un-boxed the tablets.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.070
15 minutes later on they
knew how to turn it on.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.910
Two days later on they were
already exploring.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:13.130
And the whole thing was so
incredible that even a month

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:19.950
and a half later on we have not
put the video camera to

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.080
use because we were afraid that
they were going to start

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.910
streaming video.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.110
And they hacked the tablet and
they put the camera to work.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.130
I mean, nobody knew
how to do it.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.390
And that's when the tipping
point came to us.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.600
This is something again
transformational.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.750
And this is something that
we should look around.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.066
And that's when Nicholas about a
month ago came and talked to

00:26:40.066 --> 00:26:43.430
Larry and Sergey.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.890
And in that group together
with other companies they

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.050
created the X-Prize.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.170
And they are now putting $10
million to develop a project

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.300
in the next two years of the
most innovative way of

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.010
teaching or learning
how to read.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.910
Because if you learn
how to read, then

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.630
you read how to learn.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.040
There's a tipping point about
seven or eight years of age in

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.330
which, if you have learned how
to read, then you can use that

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.820
reading expertise into
reading how to learn.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.570
And that's where we
are interested in.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.290
And that's the frontier in
which we want to advance.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.460
And this is the type of
environments that you can see.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.600
Together they are working.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.080
This particular photograph
is very important.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.590
Look at what is happening
here.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.960
This kid is looking at
this other kid work.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.380
This kid is looking
at this other one.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.940
Then you have one that
is sort of the

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.550
supervisor or the teacher.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.890
And this is complete environment
self-created by

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.980
them, in terms of how a complete
village can really

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.220
take into their own hands,
something that until then was

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.880
absolutely not existent.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.370
So a few weeks later on if you
could see, they were already

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:57.100
doing the alphabet.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.660
And they were already writing
in the floor.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.140
They learned.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.230
They were already singing the
alphabet, A-B-C-D-E-F. And

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:09.620
they are now really giving us
the first glimpse that indeed

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.990
a child could really
learn how to read.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.300
And if we prove that in the
next couple of years, this

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.140
will be as transformational
as the entire element from

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.760
Gutenberg printing stage.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.870
This could be a transformational
element.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.530
Because until now we have been
told that you need a teacher

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.770
to tell you how to read.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:40.210
So I'm finalizing here with
just why I am here.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.770
I gave you the history.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:43.610
Well number one.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.480
I met Joe in Mexico.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.940
And we are trying
to work a lot in

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.270
Mexico and Latin America.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.160
But evidently the commercial
entities, like the Microsofts

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.660
and all the similar guys,
are not very happy.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.220
Because we use Linux and we want
to have it free and we

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.400
want to have open source.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.520
And we are trying to advocate
all of the things that are not

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.050
very commercial for them.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:13.200
And what I can ask you today is
for you to leave with, and

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.350
what Joe is going to tell
you about, is how

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.570
can we again re-engage?

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.110
You were together with
us seven years ago.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.330
It was transformational.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.270
Then we became perhaps too
mundane for the Google

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.200
stratospheric type of things.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.500
But now we have a proof
of concept.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.060
Now we have shown that this can
be done and then we have

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.330
seen a new frontier
that comes up.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.500
And the new frontier is how
on earth can we scale up?

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.730
How we can really pass from
the two and a half million

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.240
laptops to the 200
million laptops.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.250
To the 100 million laptops.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.820
Because otherwise an entire
generation of children, ages

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.900
five and more, will remain in
the same obscurantism of the

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.500
medieval area in which
they were born.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.450
And their family were born.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.940
How to create synergy?

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.600
How can we work together with
the group that encompasses the

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.070
Google family, and the Android
developments, and so forth?

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:21.310
And for that I'm very thankful
that Joe, very generously, all

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.340
of the royalties of his book
are going to be given as a

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.910
contribution to OLPC.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.160
And that's one reason that I
wanted to be here with him

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.130
today because that is the type
of a spirit of a mission like

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:41.660
this that is surpassing any
commercial or any element of

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.140
mercantilism that we might
think of as the

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.520
other people do.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.200
And without any further ado,
what I would like to suggest

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:53.350
to you guys is, help us.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.230
Tell us.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.260
Write to us.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.320
Think about it.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.540
How we can really help hundreds
of millions of

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.560
children take advantage of

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.520
technology into their education.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:09.290
There's my email address.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:12.510
And feel free to
suggest ideas.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.060
We need your help.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.910
Because otherwise we will
just remain on a two

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.030
million or ten million.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.630
And that's not what we
were created for.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.550
Without any further ado, I would
like to ask Joe to give

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.410
you a glimpse of what
he's got going on.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.260
And thank you very much for
your attending to me.
