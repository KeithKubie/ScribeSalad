00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:09.136
&gt;&gt;Student: I run the Washington Post.

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:13.876
&gt;&gt;Student: I ran for President.

00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:17.186
&gt;&gt;Student: I lobby Congress.

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:21.266
&gt;&gt;Amber: We had one student in
my former district who dropped

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.196
out of high school and came

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:25.716
to AP Government every day
till the end of the year.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.636
And he called himself the worst
drop-out in the history of drop-outs,

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:30.186
because he still showed up.

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:32.006
I don't know why he came.

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:33.856
But I do! I do know why.

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.216
Because there was a role for him.

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:38.886
And he played a part in the
classroom learning experience.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:42.686
For him to drop out of high school,
but still to come to that class,

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:45.556
that was the moment
in that first year

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:47.446
that changed the way I
thought about the course.

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:55.316
&gt;&gt;Walter: What we're
working on in the Knowledge

00:00:55.316 --> 00:01:00.266
in Action project is a way of making
advanced high school course work

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:05.116
accessible to more and more children,
and worth it, by making it a deep,

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:08.566
rich curriculum that they can
take with them into the future.

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:12.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Do we want to say
before or against the Alabama law?

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:16.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Our interest group would
be before this, before the Alabama,

00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:18.916
because all it is is collecting data.

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:21.486
&gt;&gt;Student: It's hard to collect data
when people are not forthcoming.

00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:23.956
It makes it really hard
to get accurate data.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:26.366
&gt;&gt;Walter: The way we attempt

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.956
to achieve deep conceptual
learning is primarily

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.606
through a particular kind of
rigorous project-based learning.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:36.646
It's not uncommon in an AP
course to have a project or two.

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:40.316
We're trying to drive the course
through projects, which is to say,

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:42.006
through experiential learning.

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:44.266
&gt;&gt;Student: Two-thousand
students stopped going to school.

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.256
Alabama school systems are going to
fall apart, because there's not going

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:48.166
to be government funding.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.656
&gt;&gt;Student: Two-thousand students
in a state that probably has what?

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.376
Ten to thirteen million,
somewhere in there?

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:56.456
&gt;&gt;Student: How many of those
thirteen million go to school?

00:01:56.456 --> 00:01:57.366
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: Well, AP Gov is a class

00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:59.876
that has traditionally been
taught in one semester.

00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:02.686
So in one semester they fly through
all the institutions of government,

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:04.026
as well as how they're
linked together,

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:05.096
and how they're linked to the people.

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:09.116
And it has traditionally been
a very lecture-oriented course,

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:11.896
because it's a lot of content to get
through, and not a whole lot of time.

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:16.416
The idea came of, "Well, could we
make an entire course in government

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:19.766
that really is about how we put kids
in the middle of these situations,

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.696
and not how we just tell
kids about these situations."

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:26.646
&gt;&gt;Student: These people that are here
illegally, if they're here legally,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.796
if we make it possible for
them to get a Green Card,

00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:30.976
they'll then in turn be paying taxes.

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:35.066
They'll be benefiting our
society instead of hurting it.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.796
&gt;&gt;Lise: I came onboard
after the AP US Government

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:39.496
and Politics course was in place.

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.486
And the team wanted to add a second
course, AP Environmental Science.

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:47.246
&gt;&gt;Student: So the one
percent, where's one percent?

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:51.096
&gt;&gt;Student: Only four
of them are living.

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:53.406
&gt;&gt;Walter: Everybody understands all

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:56.376
of these brilliant hard-working
teachers that teach AP know

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.286
that what they need to
deliver is a large proportion

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:01.126
of their students passing that test.

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:04.816
So the most direct route to doing
that is to teach to the test.

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:06.656
Well, what we're trying
to do is figure out a way

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:09.886
to drive more learning
into that course.

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:15.506
So in our courses, students are
very often involved in a simulation.

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.066
In the case of the AP Gov
course, they're taking the role

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.336
of a Supreme Court Justice,

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:22.856
or somebody running a
campaign, or running for office.

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:24.546
&gt;&gt;Asher: It's not communistic.

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:25.986
What he wants to do is reinforce--

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.976
&gt;&gt;Anna: Sharing the wealth among
the people who didn't earn it?

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:31.126
&gt;&gt;Asher: He wants to reinforce
the already existing programs,

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:32.336
such as Social Security.

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:34.616
All we're doing is strengthening
the social safety net,

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:39.026
so that we can have free
trade that's also fair trade.

00:03:39.026 --> 00:03:41.436
&gt;&gt;Mariama: Sometimes you lose
the sense of you're in a role,

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.016
you're not actually
really that person.

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:45.916
But sometimes you become that
person without even realizing it.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:49.406
&gt;&gt;Amber: So it's different
than any kind of class

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:53.526
where you would just have a lecture,
do a worksheet or an activity,

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:56.166
maybe make a poster at
the end, and take a test.

00:03:56.656 --> 00:03:58.746
This is structured
completely differently.

00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:01.086
So that from the very
beginning students have a role

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:02.796
that they play, and a need to know.

00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:04.826
&gt;&gt;Jerry: All these
activities are a way for kids

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:08.276
to get personally invested in
the project, often with the goal

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:09.906
of winning, or coming out ahead.

00:04:10.276 --> 00:04:14.876
Especially kids who are not
already the ones really well-suited

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:16.586
for traditional AP format classes.

00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:18.636
&gt;&gt;Lise: One of the
key design principles

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:21.126
in the course is this
idea of looping.

00:04:21.316 --> 00:04:23.746
&gt;&gt;Amber: We ask students constantly
to go back and think about,

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:27.406
"What did it mean when you were
this, or when you played this role?

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:30.016
And what does it mean
now in this situation?"

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:32.076
So we try to get them
to make connections,

00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:34.966
by never leaving behind the
unit that we taught in the past.

00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:38.246
&gt;&gt;Caitlyn: A typical class
is just a lot of note-taking,

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:41.256
and a lot of reading from chapters,

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:45.546
and then reiterating
it back to the teacher.

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:49.296
But here you get to
apply it in your life,

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:50.816
and then apply it throughout
the year.

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:53.486
And not just on one
test or one essay.

00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:55.706
That's what makes this
class different.

00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:58.266
&gt;&gt;Adrienne: All right,
nice job, Nice job.

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:02.496
&gt;&gt;Lise: I think the biggest challenge
with the curriculum is scaling it

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.366
to a range of school environments.

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:09.416
Making it work for urban students
in poverty-impacted schools,

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:12.016
and also making it work
for more affluent students.

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:16.706
So we've tried to select problems
in each of the units in the course

00:05:16.956 --> 00:05:19.366
that can be adapted to
different environments.

00:05:19.456 --> 00:05:22.916
For example, the project
about looking

00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:25.286
at one family's impact
on the environment.

00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:28.236
That's relevant regardless
of the environment you're in.

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:31.526
&gt;&gt;Student: You're going to measure
the amount of recycled material.

00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:32.546
That's one thing we can measure.

00:05:33.056 --> 00:05:35.546
&gt;&gt;Student: But how would you do
this if you live in apartment?

00:05:35.546 --> 00:05:36.976
We all live in an apartment.

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:39.166
&gt;&gt;Student: Don't you guys
have like a recycling--

00:05:39.386 --> 00:05:43.236
like a box, like next to the garbage?

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.806
&gt;&gt;Amber: We started the curriculum
In the Bellevue School District.

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:49.266
And the Bellevue School District is
a suburban school district located

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:50.626
right outside the City of Seattle.

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:54.256
Bellevue has quite a
range of affluence,

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:57.786
but you're looking technically at
a wealthier suburban community.

00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:03.136
In 2011, we brought the
curriculum to Des Moines, Iowa.

00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:06.906
And the Des Moines Public Schools
has a free and reduced lunch average

00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:09.066
about 65 percent district-wide.

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:14.236
So the majority of our students are
in the lower socio-economic class.

00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:15.966
When bringing the Knowledge
In Action project

00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:17.646
to a poverty-impacted
school district,

00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:20.826
you're likely to find challenges,
including student preparedness

00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:23.236
for AP course work, reading skills

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:25.586
and reading level,
and teacher readiness.

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:28.086
And so we've needed to
make some changes in order

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:30.606
to provide opportunities
for them to have success.

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:34.766
We don't just want equity of access,
you know, entry into the course.

00:06:34.766 --> 00:06:36.156
We want equity of outcomes.

00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:39.416
We want our kids in
poverty-impacted schools to be just

00:06:39.416 --> 00:06:40.976
as successful as kids in other areas.

00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:45.466
&gt;&gt;Sherry: Richshunda
started out as one

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:47.326
of those students that,
"I don't like to read.

00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:48.346
I don't want to read.

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:50.956
And I've never picked up a
book, and I don't want to.

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:55.116
And so she went into a reading
strategies course last year."

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:58.806
Richshunda is like the poster
child of a student that didn't

00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:00.826
like reading, and now loves to read,

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:06.276
and is now reading advanced
placement college material books.

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:08.806
&gt;&gt;Richshunda: In that class,
like everybody's working,

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:11.186
everybody's talking,
everybody's doing groups,

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:12.636
everybody's just active.

00:07:12.636 --> 00:07:15.016
Like you don't even want to
leave the class when you have to.

00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:19.676
&gt;&gt;Jerry: This project approach gives
you a chance to engage the students

00:07:19.676 --> 00:07:21.846
who might otherwise
sort of sit and hide

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:23.686
and keep a low profile
and not do well.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.816
Their performance is
more clear to see,

00:07:26.186 --> 00:07:28.226
and their success shows more clearly.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:32.576
&gt;&gt;Michael: The problem-based
curriculum that they're using

00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:36.556
in the AP Government class
is definitely working.

00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:39.676
When you walk in, the students
are speaking, not the teacher.

00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:42.216
And so you know that they
are learning the material,

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:43.636
because it's coming
out of their mouth.

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:47.106
&gt;&gt;Lise: It's really
exciting to see students

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:51.116
that may not have traditionally
taken an AP course,

00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:56.426
or succeeded in an AP course,
actually connect with the material

00:07:56.426 --> 00:08:00.056
in a way that makes them successful
in the AP test, of course,

00:08:00.176 --> 00:08:04.386
but more importantly impacts
their lives and the decisions

00:08:04.386 --> 00:08:08.306
that they begin to make as
adults and even as young adults.

00:08:08.306 --> 00:08:13.306
I think that's really exciting to
feel like you've empowered students

00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:17.116
in a way that's going to stay
with them for years to come.

00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:20.466
I think that's probably the best part

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.746
of being involved in
something like this.
