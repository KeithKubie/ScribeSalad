SEAN ROBINSON: When you
see that a student has

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.130
an understanding of
what they're doing which

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.650
is very different
from what's real,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.930
you try to find
something in what they're

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.540
doing that is just very counter
to what their understanding is.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.510
Really point it out.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.670
You have to elicit it.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.862
Make them understand that, hey,
look, this thing over here,

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:29.070
you can see that that's true.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.870
And if that's true,
then your understanding

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.120
can't possibly be true.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.950
That gets them into
the mental state

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.724
that neuropsychologists
call cognitive dissonance.

00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:40.140
And that is a point
where students

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.090
are very ripe for learning.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.790
You elicit the
cognitive dissonance

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.110
and then help them resolve it.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.560
Those sort of
teaching moments are

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.800
things that really stick
with the student for quite

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.000
some time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.980
So for us, in the
course of the semester,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.280
we try to elicit many of these
moments of cognitive dissonance

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.882
early in the
semester, and really

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:10.840
try to get them through
these important lessons

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.010
of eliminating the very
common misunderstandings

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.970
that many people come
into the class having.
