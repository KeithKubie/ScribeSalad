00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.560
So here is a particle that was shot through
and it's knocked an electron out of an atom.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.400
And by having a magnetic field around the
bubble chamber

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.860
it bends the path of the electron

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.540
because the electron is negatively charged.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.020
Things don't change direction of their own
accord.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.640
Things like to go in a straight line unless
you influence them.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.440
If you make a magnetic field, negatively charged
particles will go one way,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.740
and positives the other.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.820
Neutral particles don't leave any trail at
all in these pictures.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.380
Now let's look at the next picture.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.320
If you really turn on the magnetic field,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.620
your electron will spiral round and round
and round and round.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.860
As it slows down the spiral gets tighter and
tighter and tighter.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.940
It looks like the picture of a snail from
the top or something like that.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.760
Now let's look at the next one.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.900
Now this has got a lot of information. It's
a beautiful picture.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.520
At this point here an electron's been knocked
out of the atom

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.540
and shoots off very high speed curving very
slightly.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.940
I know it's high speed because when you go
fast you only curve a little bit.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.040
If you go slow, you'll curve all the way around
when you get given the sideways kick.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.040
But look at this. Here's an electron that
started off slow.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.260
It's really gone into a very tight spiral.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.740
But on the other side there's the same thing
going the other way.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.900
Negatively charged particles go one way, positives
go the other.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.800
This, the red trail at the bottom, is a positively
charged electron.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.880
The exact mirror image of the regular negative
electron.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.140
It's an example of antimatter.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.180
Captured here on film.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.760
This is antimatter, it's as real as the electrons
are real.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.660
Now over here, an electron and its antimatter
partner,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160
which is called a positron by the way, is
produced.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.920
But between here and here, nothing appears
to have happened.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.840
These appear to have appeared out of nowhere.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.060
Well that doesn't make sense at all.

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.399
What's happened is that something without
any charge at all

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.780
has gone from here to here and left no trail.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.900
But we recognise he was there the moment it
did this.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.440
So, we've got the steps in deciphering the
pictures,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.060
Let's look at out original picture again and
see if we can make sense of it.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.100
OK, well this very faint circle here is just
an electron kicked out of an atom.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.640
Like the first part of our three pieces of
the jigsaw puzzle.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.660
At this point here we see a whole series of
negatively charged particles

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.480
curving off that way, and positives curving
off the other way.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.820
Then there's a gap where something without
any charge at all must have gone

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.840
And it reveals its presence when it turns
into two particles that do reveal themselves.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.800
So, that shows you how you begin to decipher
the picture.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.940
But in this picture there's something very
interesting. This gap here.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.720
A particle without any charge must have lived

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.820
and for a very, very short time.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.180
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.100
I've got this little clock along the bottom.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.260
This is the spot where this neutral object
was created.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.560
And that's where it died.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.080
Now what's this clock doing?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.380
Let's just think what happens in this thing
here.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.640
We've got this bubble chamber and the camera
taking photographs.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.550
There's particles shooting in from one side,
almost at the speed of light.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.340
They are across the bubble chamber in a flash.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.640
But the camera takes the picture, it's probably
for a thousanth of a second.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.420
Which is a short time to you and me,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.800
but it's a long time to a particle that is
moving near the speed of light.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.500
It's as if the particle enters this side of
the bubble chamber and the clock starts.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.700
By the time it's got to here, the clock is
just passed the starting point.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.740
By the time it's got to here, it's a millionth
of a second later.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.040
By the time it's got to here it's four millionths
of a second later

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.560
and then it exits on the other side.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.020
But the camera shutter has been open all the
time.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.200
And it takes what appears to be a still photograph
as you see here.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.560
But in fact it's a timelapse.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.160
The time is running from one side to the other.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.260
So between here and here it's maybe a millionth
of a second or less.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.040
So this picture has captured the passage,
the life and death of a particle,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.940
that lives for less than a millionth of a
second.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.999
It's astonishing to think that with this simple
device

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.120
you can capture short, short timescales and
make them for real.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.440
And that is as important a part of the universe
as everything else.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.780
We've suddenly opened up sections in time
here.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.460
With our naked eye we can see a rainbow from
red to purple

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.430
but we can expand right the way across the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.500
and see the great universe out there.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.120
Here suddenly we've expanded our senses in
time to the very, very short.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.920
These new unexpected short-lived particles
are as relevant to the universe,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.900
are as real to the whole picture, as the things
that live long enough to make you and me.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.720
And any rational explanation of the totality
must include them.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.800
And that's the big challenge.
