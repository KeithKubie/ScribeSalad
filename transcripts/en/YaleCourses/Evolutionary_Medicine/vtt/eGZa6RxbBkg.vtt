1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.890
We're now going to see whether the evolutionary,

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.930
evolutionary way of looking at the world gives us any special insight into

3
00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:08.980
mental disorders.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.720
And at the outset I want to acknowledge that there are some special difficulties

5
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:15.310
in explaining mental disorders.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.360
<v 1>To offer a null hypothesis.</v>

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.630
Then discuss how evolution might enter that kind of picture.

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.660
We'll take a look at mental disorders as byproducts of defense systems and as

10
00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:34.420
diseases of homeostasis in Admin and mismatch.

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.480
The first point to make is that mental disorders are almost all multi causal.

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.910
Most of them,
most of the time have several to many causes.

13
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:52.890
And that means that any hypothesis for why a mental disorder exists,

14
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.640
uh,
is not going to be mutually exclusive.

15
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.840
We're going to have to entertain several hypotheses at the same time.

16
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.670
Many mental disorders do not have credible equivalence in model systems,

17
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.670
and that means that experimental approaches are out of reach.

18
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.330
We do not really have a credible model system for schizophrenia or autism or

19
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.410
something like that.

20
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.420
So claims in this area of biomedical science need to be treated with particular

21
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:31.280
skepticism and agnostic patients is especially needed.

22
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.870
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.250
<v 1>Here's an old hypothesis.</v>

24
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.390
Any process that is influenced by several factors,

25
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.540
each of which can vary will be expressed,

26
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.240
is a broad range of phenotypes.

27
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.920
Those are the center of the range will be more frequent and we'll be the ones on

28
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:53.350
which natural selection acts most strongly.

29
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.060
Those at the extremes will be rare and will not be strongly selected.

30
00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.470
<v 1>Mental disorders represent abnormal cognition and behavior that occur at low</v>

32
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:05.304
frequency.

33
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.670
<v 1>If they represent the extremes of arrange,
who center is normal,</v>

35
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.190
the normal cognition and behavior are things that are selected and mental

36
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.000
disorders do not need.

37
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:28.980
Any special evolutionary explanation they are seeing here is the unavoidable

38
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:33.570
byproducts of tradeoffs that are expressed at the population level,

39
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.160
not within an individual,

40
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.810
but across the distribution of phenotypes found in a population.

41
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.293
<v 0>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.320
<v 1>That picture looks somewhat like this.</v>

43
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.980
We have functional behavior at the center of the distribution of phenotypes and

44
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:53.800
mental disorders are seen as the rare extremes.

45
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.180
Now,
how might evolution enter that kind of picture?

46
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.140
When evolution produces a novel aspect of cognition or behavior,

47
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.770
it usually does so by modifying some existing process.

48
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.570
This is normally how evolution works.

49
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.260
If we combine that with the previous figure,

50
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:19.261
then we expect mental disorders to be associated with underlying functions that

51
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:24.160
evolved for other reasons and are normally expressed close to the center of that

52
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.180
trait distribution.
There are correlations with other traits,

53
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:31.810
could be arbitrary reflections of some historical process.

54
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.030
They could also belong to several disease categories including monogenic

55
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:41.200
disorders and catastrophic environmental insults as well as the ones we

56
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.230
discussed.
Next is vulnerabilities of defense systems,

57
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.420
so how might mental disorders be?

58
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.220
Vulnerabilities of defense systems,
anxieties,

59
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.180
phobias,

60
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.360
and some forms of obsessive compulsive disorders are exaggerated behavioral

61
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:02.924
defenses,

62
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.090
anxieties and phobias or excessive expressions of behavioral defenses that

63
00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.030
normally avoid dangerous environments.

64
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.290
Germaphobia and excessive hygiene are a form of obsessive compulsive disorder

65
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.680
that exaggerates behavioral avoidance of pathogens.

66
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.490
Hoarding behavior may now represent inappropriate and excessive expression of

67
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:29.950
what was once normal foraging behavior.

68
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.170
How might mental disorders be?
Diseases of homeostasis and mismatch?

69
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.350
Well,
such diseases,

70
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.460
diseases of homeostasis and mismatch recur in systems that are designed to be

71
00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:47.930
adjustable with set points that define the states that the system's designed to

72
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:48.764
maintain.

73
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.500
Such systems are vulnerable to dysregulation because disrupting the set points

74
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.960
produces extremes of expression.

75
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.840
Behavioral homeostatic systems use internal mechanisms of reward and punishment

76
00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:06.320
who set points can be disrupted by exposure to novel substances.

77
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.610
One example may be drug addiction,
which is going to be discussed next.

78
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.860
So to summarize,
mental disorders or Har,

79
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.730
hard to explain because they have multiple causation and because credible model

80
00:05:19.731 --> 00:05:22.220
organisms are not available for experiments,

81
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.330
a simple no hypothesis is that some mental disorders represent the rare tales of

82
00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.830
distributions of cognition and behavior.

83
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.650
Who centers are normal and selected.

84
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.440
Mental disorders can also result from mirror rare monogenic mutations.

85
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.420
They can be byproducts of defense systems and they can be diseases of

86
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:46.490
homeostasis and mismatch.
