00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
Two

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.940
<v 1>Joel,
listen,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joe List.
Oh,
I'm already in.</v>

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.690
I'm already going to do it like when the morning Dj guys,
I appreciate it.
Joe.

4
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.250
I hear you're in town for the funny fuck

5
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.640
<v 0>I am.
I'm doing the funny fuck this weekend.
Tonight through Sunday.</v>

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.520
Excellent.
Actually,
you are working with me tonight.

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.180
We have two sold out shows at the Hollywood improv.
I appreciate it.

8
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:23.014
I'm excited to share.

9
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.760
<v 1>It's going to be fun.
It's going to be the machine.
Bert Kreischer,</v>

10
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.850
love bird and cheeto.
Santino Andrew Santina.
Do you know Andrew?

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.420
<v 0>I know,
I know Andrew.
I don't know if I don't know him personally.</v>

12
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.980
You just know he's hilarious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She'd be a good old fucking time.
Yeah.

13
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:39.680
I'm excited.
Sites for having my pleasure.
My pleasure.
How long have you down for?

14
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.940
I leave tomorrow morning.
Ah,
here on Sunday.
I got here Saturday actually,

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.030
but I stayed down in Manhattan beach.
Oh,
what are you doing?
Posh.

16
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:48.350
Hanging out with the people by the beach.

17
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.470
It was night while was down in the airport.
My wife is here and I said,

18
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:54.050
let's go down to Manhattan beach for lunch.
And we were enjoying ourselves.

19
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:58.070
So we got a hotel and made love and walked on the beach.
Oh,
you made love.
Yeah.

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.840
I just really love her.
If you meet love,

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.150
<v 1>I do.
Ooh.</v>

22
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.910
I went to a party once in Manhattan beach and the guy collected toasters.

23
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.340
Oh.
And I was like,
what is this?
And he's like,
ah,
I just collect toasters.

24
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.690
I'm like,
okay.
From all different time periods.

25
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:20.040
Like he had a toaster from like the 50s with all this Patina on it.

26
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.300
And then you had modern toasters.
But he,
I think he was trying too hard.
You know,

27
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.490
there's some dudes just where bowling shoes and shit,

28
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.480
they just try too hard to be whacking.

29
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.230
<v 0>Yeah.
Was he like a hipster or was there like an old is a girl.</v>

30
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.840
He was a guy who was trying to fuck my girlfriend.
Oh.

31
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.110
And she wanted to go to this party.
So looking.
All right.
Wow.

32
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:41.500
I think she was an actress and I think he was in the movie business.

33
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.540
Imagine getting cucked by a toaster pleasure.
Yeah,
almost it,

34
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.810
well it wasn't,
it was one of them squirrely deals where she was like,

35
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.730
I'm so not interested in him.

36
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.720
<v 1>I just want to go to this party for network thing.
I was a young lad.</v>

37
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.300
I had just moved to Hollywood and did not know the ways okay.

38
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.260
<v 0>Of this goofy fucking town yet.
I hadn't,
uh,</v>

39
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.740
<v 1>I hadn't exercised myself from Hollywood,
you know,</v>

40
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.100
I was still doing the thing,
acting,
going on auditions and shit.

41
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.270
So it was like you,
when you first get here you're like,
what is this?

42
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.560
Especially in the 90s,

43
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.010
it was super squirrely cause everybody was trying to get a development deal and

44
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:20.920
everybody was trying to get a sitcom and they kind of like let you think that

45
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:23.110
that was the only way you have to get a sitcom.

46
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.520
I want to be like Roseann do you want to be like Tim Allen?
What about Seinfeld?

47
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:30.870
He got a sitcom.
You should get a sitcom.
Like damn,
I want to get a of,

48
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.430
and so everybody was out here just trying to do the acting thing.

49
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.510
I did it for awhile and after awhile you're like,
these people are not worth it.

50
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.150
But you did get a sitcom,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.

51
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.180
<v 0>I've got a couple of them and I was on a couple of them.
It seems like fun.
Um,</v>

52
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.790
it's fun.
Stand ups.
More fun.
Yeah.
It's not something I'd be interested in doing,

53
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.340
but

54
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.440
<v 1>if you could do a sitcom with all stand ups,</v>

55
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:54.330
that would be the shit that would be the shit.
Like if you,

56
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.960
you could do a sitcom with really good writers who were cool and all the people

57
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.040
the show were standups

58
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.740
<v 2>that would be fucking monstrous.
But it's not usually like that.
No.</v>

59
00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:06.880
And it seems very,
uh,
what do you call it?
Uh,

60
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.250
corporate and you're going to do this and this and a lot of rules and stuff.

61
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.570
It seems like podcasts,

62
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.000
<v 1>they're trying to make money,
you know,
and they can't make money if,
uh,</v>

63
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.240
people do things and get people in trouble.

64
00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:21.980
They say things and get people angry or someone calls up human resources and Joe

65
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.210
Lewis was talking about his deck.

66
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.010
<v 2>Yeah.
The craft service lady heard it.
And now there's a lawsuit,</v>

67
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.600
I think with podcasts.
Now,

68
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.300
most of us comedians with podcasts have no chance of getting any corporate job.

69
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.940
I don't think that's true.
Really.
I get offered shit all the time.

70
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.240
I think that we don't need it though,
right?
I think it's,

71
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.050
it actually will get in the way.
Have you ever written on a Sitcom?
No.

72
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.410
Written on anything.
When you,
when you write,
there's a trap that

73
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.580
<v 1>comics falling into that are good writers.
They,</v>

74
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.390
they get the Sitcom writing gig and it's a sweet gig.

75
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:55.940
You get paid thousands of dollars a week,
your bills,

76
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.090
your bills are covered so you feel good,
but you're never going on the road.

77
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.090
You're,
you're in town all the time.
He just doing sets around town.

78
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:03.830
So you're pretending that you're still comic,

79
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.250
but you're really a sitcom writer who kind of like has a hobby you're doing

80
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.310
stand up and you never develop on the road.
And there's a bunch of guys.

81
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.450
Do you know Owen Smith?

82
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.860
<v 2>Uh,
I,
that's another guy.
I don't know.
I've met him a couple of times.</v>

83
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.980
Walk in hilarious.
One of the best comics

84
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.860
<v 1>in the world and he's just been spending so many years doing the sitcoms.</v>

85
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:28.910
Like I saw him one night at the comedy store.
I'm like,
how the fuck is this guy?

86
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.440
Not Gigantic.

87
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:33.860
Like how does he not have a Netflix hour that everyone's talking about?

88
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.050
How has it everybody not trying to book in places,

89
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.260
it's just because he's been doing this,
this Sitcom writer thing.

90
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.580
He's trying to break out of that now though.

91
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.230
<v 2>Tommy John Again is another guy.
You know Tommy John Again,
I've heard of him.</v>

92
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.890
He's one of the best comedians I think there is.
He's a writer.

93
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.870
He's been writing on a TV show,
but he's happy.
He likes,

94
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.700
he's got two kids and it keeps them off the road.

95
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.430
But to me it's a bummer as a comedy fan cause I'm like,
ah,

96
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.760
I want to see new hour.
But he's still,
I think he's still works a little bit.

97
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.300
Yeah.
Mitch Hedberg had a really funny bit about that,
about how comedy,

98
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.071
like when you're a comedian,

99
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:05.980
it's the only job where someone asks you to do another job.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

100
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.760
There was somebody,
when I first moved to New York,
there was a guy that was like,

101
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:13.860
do you do any writing?
And I was like,
well I did all that.
Right.
I wrote all that.

102
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.760
But I,
that's why I never liked writing other than standup because standup,

103
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.400
I can write all day and then go do it that night.

104
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.820
Whereas when I'm writing like a movie or a TV show,
I'm like,
I'm wasting my,

105
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.300
this isn't going to get made.
It's just not,
my therapist says that's not the way,

106
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.850
that's not what should inspire you to write.
You should be ready.

107
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:32.640
Cause it's a way to express yourself.
You therapist is right.
But then again,

108
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:36.120
if you are writing something and nothing happens,
this is fucking stupid.

109
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.930
It feels,
it feels wasteful.
But I could be writing jokes that I do on stage.
Yeah.

110
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:44.630
You,
um,
you just get into that sort of

111
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.180
<v 1>Dang where you're just like,
what am I doing here?</v>

112
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.830
And then it steals your thunder.

113
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.890
<v 2>Yeah.
I feel that way all the time.
Unrelated.
Yeah.</v>

114
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.010
What am I doing?
Here you are right,
right.
You sit down and write a little

115
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.980
<v 0>bit?
Yeah,
I try to,
but a lot of times,
um,</v>

116
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.280
a lot of times I'll start writing and then I ended up just jerking off.

117
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.930
Jerking off.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Although I do that less than I used.

118
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.400
Louie said that he had,
he kept his,
uh,

119
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.920
he had one laptop that could not connect to the Internet.
He had it.
Yeah,
yeah,

120
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.090
yeah,
yeah.
He still does that.
But if you do that,

121
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.300
like what if you want to Google something while you're writing?
Well,

122
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.210
I do that a lot and I'll use it as an excuse.
I'll be writing and then I'm like,

123
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.150
what?
What's the origin?
Let me Google that for research and then before,

124
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.420
you know what I'm just going through Instagram and I'm jerking off.
Yeah,
exactly.

125
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.370
Yeah.
You got to have discipline.
That's all.
I give myself an hour.

126
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.060
I have one hour than a half to write and then if I enjoy it,
I keep going.

127
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.350
But one for one hour,
there is nothing going on.
But writing,
she,
that's ambitious.

128
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.900
I have to go literally,
I'm not even joking like 10 minutes.

129
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.230
Let me do 10 minutes and usually they'll go a little longer cause I'm like,

130
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.260
all right,
all right,
now I'll do like 30 minutes.
Then I'm like,

131
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:55.190
then you can treat yourself.
I'm a child.
I am too.
But I found that,

132
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:56.690
I mean obviously we came in here,
we were,

133
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.530
me and Jeff were embroiled in a quick death match.
Yeah.
Yeah.

134
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:05.000
And we wouldn't stop to say hi.
I said hi briefly.
I appreciate,
I felt bad.

135
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.560
I felt like I walked in and you fucking you a little bit like,

136
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.640
well I got here early and I was going to,

137
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:12.980
I'm always compulsively early everywhere.

138
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.840
I spend a lot of time just doing laps around places cause I have so much
anxiety.

139
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.770
But I parked and I was like,
I'll just sit in my car for 10 minutes.

140
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.270
And then a big came out and was just looking at me.

141
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.390
And so then I was like,
I think at this must mean I have to get out of the car.

142
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.430
Yeah,
he's armed.
So I got out.
Um Oh is he?
Oh Great.
Oh I'm terrified.

143
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.310
But yeah,
so I got here early.
I was on camera,

144
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.150
but I would have showed up right at,
yeah,
it doesn't matter.
All right.

145
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.080
We shouldn't have snuck in that extra game.
It's just we get the problem is you,

146
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:48.770
you,
you play one game and then it gets going like we play for half hour,

147
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.820
plead to 100 points,

148
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.330
100 deaths and then it gets intense and then if one guy beats the other guy

149
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.331
gives him a drubbing,

150
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:59.200
then the other guy wants revenge and then you have to play that second,
right?

151
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.450
Yeah.
It's addictive and you start off your day with two ass kickings.

152
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.690
It's like trick enough,
a hundred deaths.

153
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.260
You start off your day with to jerk off sessions.
You're like,
man,

154
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.500
I have a lot of catching up to do a phone and make this a productive day.

155
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.760
I use still jerking off a lot.

156
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.910
Of course I feel like I know jerk off that much in the last,

157
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.480
well I have a wife and we have sex,
but here when she's not,

158
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.580
when she's away then you jerk off.
I'll drop off a little bit though.
I have less,

159
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:28.700
uh,
less than I used to.
There's something wrong with me.

160
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:32.730
I can still get my a vagina hard.
I just,
I'm just not a,

161
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.400
I'm not as interested.
Nothing wrong with that man.
But when she,

162
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.550
when I'm with her,
I'm very interested.
Yeah.
Yes,
yes.
I get it.

163
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.960
But in your free time,
you've got other shit on your mind.
Yes.
You're focused.

164
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.250
I am focused on about 5,000 things at once.
Yeah,
me too.
World,

165
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.580
the peanut comedian.
That's a lot.
Yeah.

166
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.190
It's Louis' idea is a good idea on paper to like not,

167
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.260
not have anything connected to the Internet.
Well he is just,

168
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.650
I think about doing this now he has two phones,

169
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:06.651
like a flip phone that like 12 people have the number and then he looks like a

170
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.310
smartphone that he'll leave behind.

171
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:12.270
So like his kids can call them or as you know mother or whatever.

172
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.060
Uh,
I'm one of the 12th but like you,

173
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.640
someone can get in touch with him and you can call nine one,
one word,

174
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.070
but there is no Twitter or Instagram,
whatever.

175
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.850
So that's like a decent ideas to phones cause I'm,
I'm fucked up with.

176
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.120
But then you know,
obviously you're friends with Ari.
He is the flip phone.

177
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.383
Louis has a flip phone.

178
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.690
But what sucks is when you're hanging out with these people,

179
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.230
they still need the shit.
So they ended up using your phone.
Exactly.

180
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.720
Like I'll go hiking with Ari whenever a trip and he's like,

181
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:39.810
pull up your Google maps.
Can I use your phone?
And they just has my phone.

182
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.930
How I have some discipline.
Ari.
Yeah.
And a real phone.

183
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.400
I don't want anyone to have my fight.

184
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:48.030
It's not like I don't have crazy parties or whatever.
Touching my phone.

185
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.000
I don't like people holding my phone.
That's like someone wearing your underwear.

186
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.390
Yes.
It's worse.
Can I borrow your underwear?
What you can eat.

187
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:58.260
You can take my underwear.
Raw Dog.
She just put pants on.
Yeah.

188
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.250
Do you have to have underwear?
It's weird.
If you don't need underwear.
You do.

189
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.720
I liked,
I sprinkle a lot of tinkle.
Yeah.
But um,

190
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.110
if you have a good pair of underwear,

191
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:09.990
it's better than like if you weren't jeans and shit.

192
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:12.390
And your ticks rubbing against your separate shit's annoying.
Yeah,

193
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:14.960
that's no good.
Good point.
You need to undo it.
I take it back.
I want to,

194
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.480
I want to stop and walk back.
My endless need.

195
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.510
Some discipline just needs some goddamn discipline.
He's such a child.
He does,

196
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:24.540
but I understand the addiction and stuff.

197
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:29.390
It's difficult because I have it where I'm like,
just don't look.
Yeah,
but I'm,

198
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.840
I'm obsessed with my phone too.
I am too,
but I'm not as bad as I used to be.

199
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.340
But Ari,
uh,
he realizes it.
He's like,
yeah,
he's not a loser.

200
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.600
He's a winner.
Like you figure shit out.
He's a winner.
He's like,
all right,

201
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.360
I have a fucking problem and I'm not getting better at this so I'm just going to

202
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:46.260
get rid of it.
Yeah.

203
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.050
Can get this fucking stupid flip phone that I could barely text on.

204
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:51.660
Like whenever he texts me,
it's like a miracle.
I'm like,

205
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.600
what are you doing here with this caveman phone?
Yeah,

206
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.870
the text message from the stupid fucking phone and then you have to keep it

207
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.830
short because you can't send like a long thing because it comes in like three

208
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:06.240
pages and out of order.
So it's like anyways,
I'm gay now.
And then it's like,
hey,

209
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:10.980
I just met.
It's all fucked up.
Yeah,
it sucks.

210
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.350
Button beBee.
I'm thinking about doing it myself.

211
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.520
Well to getting crazier now they're having these folding phones that get the

212
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:20.280
blow out to like 10 inches of you seen these goddamn things.

213
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.360
Oh well Samsung released it but then they took it back cause it started
breaking.

214
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.260
But it's uh,
it's a,
it looks like a regular smart phone,

215
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.520
but it's fat and the reason why it's fat as you can open it up and it becomes a

216
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:34.980
giant smartphone.
Oh that seems kind of Nice.

217
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.670
It's pretty nice if you need an iPad every where you go.
Right.
But do you know,

218
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.710
I use my phone also.
I was like a compute.
I barely use my computer.

219
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.130
I just write emails and Shit on my phone.
Yeah.

220
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:49.770
I write very few emails on my phone.
I tried.

221
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.070
I'm trying to limit my hour on the phone to to one hour,
one

222
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.320
<v 1>hour for the whole day.
One hour of screen time.</v>

223
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.550
<v 3>Yeah,
that's a,</v>

224
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.380
<v 1>it's doable.
Pressive yeah,
well I,
I forced it on my kid so I'm like,
okay,</v>

225
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.860
if she gets an hour of screen time,
I should get an hour of screen time.
Right,

226
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.850
<v 3>but you're also running a business.
You have a team,
but I'm also responsible.</v>

227
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.180
Right?
Yeah.
I have other people that pick up the slack.

228
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.320
It's a full on addiction though.
It's fucked up.
Like I will,
I'll go on a play,

229
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:18.220
I'll fly across the country.

230
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:21.640
I'm on airplane mode if you can't even use it and I'll find myself just looking

231
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.850
at photos just because I want the dopamine.

232
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:28.810
Where the fuck it is of just holding and moving my phone.
Yeah.
It's really a

233
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.490
<v 1>a problem.
It is a problem and I'm actually,
I've been doing a bit about it,</v>

234
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.540
about the real problem is what's next?

235
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.310
The real problem is where does it go from here because it's got you hooked.

236
00:12:40.311 --> 00:12:41.130
Just looking at

237
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.520
<v 3>photos and texts.
Well,
I mean,
I walked in,</v>

238
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.290
you couldn't say hello and you are crying playing quake.

239
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.730
So that might be the next step.

240
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.890
<v 1>Just something about staring at that screen.
When you get really intense,</v>

241
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.500
your eyes start watering.
I swear to God I wasn't emotional.

242
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.630
<v 3>No,
I thought your parents passed away.
As I pulled in,</v>

243
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:01.760
all these guys leave here.
I feel like a freak,
first of all.
Sometimes we leave.

244
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.510
<v 1>Well,
we'll have these battles that'll go like two hours.
And then when,</v>

245
00:13:05.511 --> 00:13:08.940
when I leave my fucking hearts pounding,
my adrenaline's rushing and I'm like,

246
00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:12.000
see you later man.
Bye.
Wow.
Can we leave?
And we're like,
what the fuck?

247
00:13:12.001 --> 00:13:15.390
And I'm driving home.
I'll tell.
It's like literally like I just had a fight.

248
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.310
<v 3>They go into a fight with somebody.
Wow.
I don't have that.
Yeah,
it's,
it's</v>

249
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.600
<v 1>[inaudible] very,
very bad addiction.
But it's really fun too.</v>

250
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:25.434
So part of me is like,

251
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.410
<v 3>I'm enjoying the shit out of this.
It's really fun to play.</v>

252
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.970
I think that's the case.
Just enjoy it.

253
00:13:29.971 --> 00:13:32.900
You got to enjoy whatever decision you're making.
This is again,

254
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.970
my therapist tell us three therapist tells.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I'm dealing,

255
00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:39.440
I had like a horrible diet my whole life for lady.

256
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.290
Well now I've changed.
I'm going through a bit of a medical situation right now.

257
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:48.490
Um,
I have aids.
I came here to do the Good Jack Jones.

258
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:52.170
Yeah.
Kind of the fun,
the fun.
You lose a little weight,
whatever,

259
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.740
but it makes you whimsical.
Uh,
yeah.
I feel good.
I can play basketball now.

260
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.300
Like the Flintstones,
like gay old time today have aids.
Yeah.

261
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.270
That's why they're not here anymore.
Um,

262
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.570
uh,
what was I gonna say?
I got caught up on the flips.
Total issue.
Oh,

263
00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:13.140
so I have this thing called silent reflux.
If you ever heard of this.
No.

264
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.490
It's acid reflux buttons.
They call it silent because there's no,
um,
heartburn.

265
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.720
It's different than Gerd.
It just goes straight up into your vocal chords,

266
00:14:21.721 --> 00:14:25.870
into deer throats.
It's like fucking up my [inaudible] my shit.
Oh No.

267
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.540
And I wake up at like a cough and it's like into my,

268
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.000
they're calling it respiratory reflux now we're at like,

269
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:35.380
it's almost like asthma sinus shit.
And it's diet related.
Yeah.
Well,

270
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:39.600
I ate exclusively a drink coke clotting like three or four cokes a day

271
00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:44.190
exclusively like a large pizza,
extra Marinara chicken parm,
extra Marinara,

272
00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:47.220
chipolte lay extra hot sauce,
chocolate chip cookies.

273
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.380
You eat garbage like a garbage child.
I'm a garbage child.

274
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.420
A grown up baby.
Yeah.

275
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:57.650
So I just ate exclusively that I was in therapy and it,
but I knew I was like,

276
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.900
I'm getting,
I'm fucking myself up.
I'm going to die.

277
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.660
I'm going to get cancer and die.
And my therapist is like,

278
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.710
just at least except your decision.
Enjoy eating shit.

279
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.480
Yeah.
He's like,
you're eating shit and not even enjoying it.
So what's the point?

280
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.620
And he's like accepting it would actually probably help you to eat healthier.

281
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.930
And I was like,
good point.
I'll just start enjoying it.

282
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:21.350
And that lasted 10 days and that's when the reflux started and I had to

283
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:22.550
completely change my diet.

284
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.390
So I should have had that conversation 25 years earlier.

285
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.270
So now I just ate like shit without enjoying it.

286
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.690
And now I'm refluxing mm.
And I can't eat any of that.

287
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.630
I had to cut out everything.

288
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.740
<v 1>So what did they tell you to eat?
Now you have to cut out dairy.
What do you,</v>

289
00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:39.420
what do you cut?

290
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:39.661
<v 3>Well,</v>

291
00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:43.950
going back to the doctor on Thursday that I'm seeing a specialist who coined the

292
00:15:43.951 --> 00:15:47.100
phrase,
it's like 1000 bucks for a consultation.
But at this point I'm like,

293
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.760
I'm losing my mind.
So crazy.
Is that the doctor can charge

294
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.370
<v 1>$1,000 just talk to you.</v>

295
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.770
<v 3>Well,
the other,
the first doctor I went to as an ENT and they do a thing,</v>

296
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:58.290
which I think is fucked up.
They're like,
I'm like,
I'm paying cash.

297
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.720
I don't have insurance.
I'm paying out of pocket.
And you're like,
Oh,

298
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.510
it's a 20% discount if you're paying out of pocket.
Like,

299
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.210
like I'm at a record store,
like were like,

300
00:16:06.211 --> 00:16:10.110
we give you a discount if you pay a crash.
And I'm like,
all right,

301
00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:13.530
that seems bizarre.
It's like my wellbeing.
That seems like something

302
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.740
<v 1>didn't.
Someone who deals with drug dealers guys come in with bullet wounds.</v>

303
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.450
You got cash and 20% off.
It's a little stretched.
Yep.

304
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:21.811
<v 3>Well,</v>

305
00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:24.450
I rolled up my money and put in a rubber band around it and handed it to him.

306
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.433
We always like to think,

307
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.210
<v 1>we always like to think that doctors are there.</v>

308
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.590
There's something special about them.
Know they're beyond reproach there,

309
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.580
above and beyond.
But I was reading this book called dead doctors don't lie.

310
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.050
It's by this Guy Joel Wallach.

311
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.720
And it's all about mineral deficiencies and how many people have mineral

312
00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:45.180
deficiencies and how little doctors actually know about nutrition and how,
uh,

313
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.530
so many doctors are not only unhealthy but have,

314
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:50.210
at least back when he wrote this book,

315
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:54.600
have easy access to prescription medicine and they're just overdosing.
Right?

316
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.990
They're just fucking,
yeah.

317
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.530
<v 3>Cooking themselves a coke.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm trying to do like an organic,</v>

318
00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:06.420
he thinks I started getting all these salads and oatmeal and a salmon set

319
00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:09.920
helping.
No,
I feel bad.
I've lost weight.
I'm thin.

320
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:14.921
I'm taking huge like green baby legs shits like and say like the s with the

321
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.440
good,
right?
Yeah.
It feels amazing flying out and I feel light and I'm,

322
00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:24.150
I'm a little more defined.
That's good.
Um,

323
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.100
but my throat is still all fucked up,

324
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.720
but I've heard it takes months and I'm like,

325
00:17:27.721 --> 00:17:31.800
maybe my body's repairing and it just doesn't,
it takes time to whatever.

326
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.830
So what specifically they tell you to get off of?
Well,

327
00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:37.500
first when I first went there,
it was like the end of the day,

328
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.740
like I started having like a fucking panic attack cause it's like white shit

329
00:17:40.741 --> 00:17:44.700
coming down my throat.
Um,
not the first time that's happened folks.

330
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.520
Why
come I get it.
All right.

331
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.760
Um,
so I went,
I just ran in there and I was like,
can I get,

332
00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:57.780
I got to see a doctor today.
I'm losing my mind.
And they were like,

333
00:17:57.781 --> 00:17:59.190
we can squeeze in an appointment.

334
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.580
And I think when you show up right before they close with no health insurance,

335
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.880
the guy kind of looked and went,
oh yeah,
that's silent reflux.

336
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.240
And then they print out a piece of paper from like Web MD,

337
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.720
which is amazing to me.
They just print shit out that I could have googled.

338
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:16.980
And he's like,
try to cut out the spicy foods,
take private sec and uh,
whatever.

339
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.580
So he made it seem like it was no big deal.
Spicy foods.
Yeah.

340
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.550
That's interesting that they would tell you to cut that out.
Like what,

341
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.070
what,
what is,
what did they say?
What is actually causing,

342
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:33.660
like what is the mechanism?
Like what's,
what's forcing this reaction?
Well,

343
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:37.320
I think what happens is,
um,
has something to do with your,
uh,

344
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.510
esophageal sphincter,
which is,
I didn't know I had one.
Uh,
yeah,
you do.

345
00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:43.590
It's a,
I guess it's at like,

346
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:46.620
I've read so much of this shit just like you're saying that g spot when you're

347
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:48.970
sucking dicks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He gets down there.
Right.

348
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.970
I feel like that would be deep in there.
Um,

349
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.960
so I,
it opens up and there's supposed to be some acid that comes up,

350
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.370
but I got too much acid.
I guess it flexes in the reflexes,

351
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.590
but my,
I think what happens is it gets so fucked up from diet that it becomes,

352
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:11.340
um,
compromise.
So it doesn't matter what I eat,
it's just open like a,

353
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.780
like a fucking big,
like a loose hassle.
Yeah.
So,

354
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:19.920
and that's from just all the acid hitting it over and over and over again.
Yeah.

355
00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:23.880
So I got into this,
there's a woman named,
uh,
Dr. Kaufman,
I forget her first name,

356
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:26.730
but she actually is in New York.
That's what I'm going to see for 1000 bucks.

357
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.210
But she like coined the phrase and wrote all these books and stuff and says,

358
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:33.360
you can fix it through,
um,
diet.

359
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.780
But I've been taking like a ton of private second shit.
And evidently I guess a,

360
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:39.920
I don't know what's helping,

361
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.150
like how much worse it would be if I wasn't taking that.

362
00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.710
But then when you get off of that,

363
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.100
there's a thing called rebound reflex where it just comes back fucking

364
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.930
gangbusters.
Oh,
no.
So,
uh,
I'm all like the people that take Xanax.

365
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.080
Yeah.
I used to take Xanax,
Cisco,
I've never taken him,

366
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:59.120
but they said that when you get off of it,
that you get super anxious.
Hmm.

367
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.180
I don't remember that.

368
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.820
I only took it if I was like having a panic attack or whatever,

369
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.480
but I took Paxil for a long time and then I couldn't come on the whoa.
Yeah.

370
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.390
Eventually.
Yeah.
It's unpleasant.
You and Mike Tyson at the same problem.

371
00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:15.240
Can he not come?
Couldn't whims on the Paxil.
We're very similar guys.
Real son.

372
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.720
Wait a lot of comments then when your backgrounds.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

373
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:23.430
I used to play with pigeons.
I shouldn't say play with.
I see you listening.

374
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.560
This is what's terrifying about this show.
He's a good guy.
He's super friendly.

375
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.930
He's like a a giant bear.
That's like your friend.
Yeah,

376
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:35.970
I'd like to,
he's like really sweet guy,

377
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:40.971
but you are very aware when you're around him that he is not you.

378
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:42.480
Like this is a cup.

379
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.800
This is an elite super athlete from the hall of

380
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.940
<v 4>He's Mike motherfucking Tyson and even though he doesn't even hardly work out</v>

381
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:54.880
anymore,
like even when you shake his hand it's like holding onto a brick.

382
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.570
It's like his whole body is like,
he's like five feet wide.

383
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.300
<v 3>Yeah.
I imagine a few work,
I don't know.</v>

384
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:02.520
You probably know more about this than I do.

385
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.540
If you work out enough for long enough and then you stopped,

386
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.730
I imagine you're going to have a base.
You definitely have a base.

387
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.910
Like I like when I was a kid,
when I was younger,
I ran,

388
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.820
I was a distance runner and I stopped running distance.

389
00:21:14.821 --> 00:21:19.420
But I feel like now I could go run five miles because I used to.
Yeah,
yeah,

390
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.100
for sure.
I feel similarly like Mike Tyson could feet

391
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.640
<v 4>me up probably.
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
he would kill you.</v>

392
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.460
You don't pray that well it's true.
I don't know.
He might have some skills.
Um,

393
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:31.720
my friend CT Fletcher,

394
00:21:31.721 --> 00:21:36.721
he actually had a heart surgery heart transplant one year ago and uh,

395
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.860
he hasn't been able to do much of anything other than like very light exercise.

396
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:44.890
Like he's just trying to like build his body back up.
But he's,

397
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.460
he used to be a world champion power lifter and even though he hasn't worked
out,

398
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:50.410
like really worked out and probably like a year and a half,

399
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.030
he still has giant arms.
He's still huge.
You keep a lot of it.

400
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.860
<v 3>He could probably pick me up.
Also.
You think,</v>

401
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.080
<v 4>uh,
he can't move that much cause of the heart.</v>

402
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.010
You know,
he's on a bunch of pills and stuff,
but if he got ahold of you,

403
00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:06.370
you'd be fucked.
He's got,

404
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.450
his arms are like double mine to have my arms on top of it.
It's a big,

405
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.680
he was an enormous man at one time.
Basically my height,
maybe an inch.

406
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.660
He's probably like five,
nine,
maybe an inch taller than me.
And he weighed three,

407
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.380
what do you say?
Three 20 at one point 320 pounds.
Wow.
Is it a picture of him?

408
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:24.370
It's so ridiculous.

409
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.930
Like you can't believe that a human could stack that much meat onto your

410
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:29.764
skeleton.

411
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.340
<v 3>Yeah.
I wonder that if I just started really lifting,
lifting,</v>

412
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.140
cause I'm like I can't eat healthy foods.

413
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:38.140
I mean I can't eat shitty foods anymore and I don't drink and I don't do drugs.

414
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.290
I'm like,
maybe I could get into exercise.
Like how big can I get?

415
00:22:41.291 --> 00:22:42.250
Can I get fucking,

416
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.430
<v 4>you didn't get big.
Yeah,
you definitely get bigger.
It's,
it's you're an Ectomorph,</v>

417
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.481
which become,
again,

418
00:22:47.481 --> 00:22:51.410
tall and you're tall and lean and tall is one of the reasons why,

419
00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:55.430
even though you are on that terrible diet and not built like a Ralphie May,

420
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.750
right.
Or something like that.
You know what I mean?

421
00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.790
Like some people just have bodies that just,

422
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.360
they can absorb a lot of sugar and a lot of bullshit and your body,

423
00:23:02.361 --> 00:23:04.020
I've obviously can do that.
Yeah.

424
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.060
That's CT Fletcher when he was three pounds fucking size was so ridiculous to

425
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.430
face.
So huge flipped the fuck.
Those are ridiculous.

426
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.030
<v 3>Do you know,
anyway,
I remember the fight or Vinny Pazienza.
Sure.</v>

427
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.910
He's from Rhode Island and I was working the providence comedy connection years

428
00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.320
ago and he was at the show.
We kind of met and then he was,

429
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:28.310
he was drinking a little bit and then after the show we were all at the bar

430
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.610
and uh,
I think it was like kind of fucking around and he's like,
ah,
the comedian,

431
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.760
I'm gonna come over there and kick that Canadians as he was kind of like a,

432
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.890
I think he was fucking with me,
whatever.
But I was like terrified.

433
00:23:37.891 --> 00:23:41.020
I'm a terrified human anyways.
And he's like,
yeah,

434
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:42.340
I want to come over there and beat his ass.

435
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.070
And then his girl that he was with was kind of like 50 no,

436
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.440
and she was like kind of looked nervous where I was like,
wait,

437
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:50.930
does this something,
is this like a real thing?
And like everyone there was like,

438
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.070
ah,
he just fucking with you.

439
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.030
And then I was like telling the story later to like my fat,
my uncle,

440
00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:00.200
and he's like,
ah,
he's drawn you fucking,
you'll be fine.
What?
I was like,

441
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.800
what do you mean?
He's like,
Eh,
he's older,
he's drunk.
Oh my God.
I'm like,

442
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:08.420
at what point of me hitting Vinnie,
Patsy Enzo.
Do you think he'd be like,

443
00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:13.430
all right,
I'm sorry.
I like,
this is no amount of like,
eh,
he's a little older.

444
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:15.320
He's had a couple of cocktails,
uncles or

445
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.890
<v 1>terrible for advice,
but you're not their kid to like,
hey,
you figure it out.</v>

446
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.290
They give you like really abbreviated shitty advice.

447
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.560
<v 3>Yeah.
It's like a nice idea that I'd be like,
yeah,
you'd be able to handle that.</v>

448
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.880
I'm like,
no,
no,
no.
I think he would,
I think he would win.

449
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.100
He's the fucking champion of the world at beating people up.
Yeah,
he was.

450
00:24:33.101 --> 00:24:36.340
He's a bad motherfucker.
Yeah.
It'd be a real problem for you.
Yeah.

451
00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:40.420
I wouldn't know how drunk he was.
Yeah.
I wouldn't have fared well.
It's uncles.

452
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.280
<v 1>Hmm.
They,</v>

453
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.300
they're terrible with advice that uncles are always buying you beer when you're

454
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:47.300
too young though,
showing you things you shouldn't see.

455
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.970
<v 3>Yeah.
There it's fun to be one.
Yeah.
I'm an uncle.
Yeah,
me too.</v>

456
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.253
<v 1>Do you like being an,</v>

457
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.820
you plan on shooting loads into the misses and having a real person?

458
00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.650
<v 3>No.
I mean,
I plan on shooting loads into our,
but I don't think so.</v>

459
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.420
My wife's a comedian as well and kid,
no,
we're a little old.
I mean,

460
00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:07.930
she's older.
I'm 37.
She's 41 and uh,

461
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.620
someone's career has to be sacrificed quite a bit,
I think to have a kid.

462
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.010
That's one way to look at it.
Yeah.
And not like adds up right now,

463
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.370
which it could change a,
anytime I'm making more money on the road.
Like,

464
00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:22.780
that's the majority of our money.
So it'd have to be like,
Aye,

465
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:27.420
I've got to keep going on the road.
Right.
So,
and then we're in New York and uh,

466
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.810
you know,
it's hard to have it child.
Yeah.
They're very expensive as you know,

467
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.940
<v 1>expensive in New York is a weird place to raise a child.
It's just weird.</v>

468
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.730
I have friends who raise their kids in New York and they're like,
we love it.

469
00:25:38.731 --> 00:25:41.990
The kids love it.
We let them go wander around the streets.
Okay.
All right.

470
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.950
<v 3>Did they have they go to like private school and shit cause I'd be like,
no,</v>

471
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.210
they go to public.
The idea of like your nine year old on the subways.

472
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.910
Terrified again.
Like it was anxiety,
right?
Yeah.
Every moment.
I'd be like,

473
00:25:53.911 --> 00:25:55.590
my kid is getting abducted right now.

474
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:56.610
<v 1>Well you never know.</v>

475
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.970
Like you could get a subway where everybody's cool or you could get a subway

476
00:26:00.971 --> 00:26:04.120
where there's a crazy person.
You're trapped in a tube with a crazy person.
Yeah.

477
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.030
It's one of the more interesting things about rolling the dice with the New York

478
00:26:07.031 --> 00:26:08.920
City subways that you're,

479
00:26:08.921 --> 00:26:12.940
you're just entering into a closed environment where you cannot escape for a

480
00:26:12.941 --> 00:26:15.790
prolonged period of time with people that you don't know.

481
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.510
And most people are cool.
Yeah.

482
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.440
Most people just want to get to their job or their house or wherever they're

483
00:26:20.441 --> 00:26:23.630
going.
But every now and then,
like I met a dude.

484
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.530
Do you remember there was a knife attack on a subway where a guy had killed a

485
00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:30.810
couple of people and caught one guy up in the guy,

486
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.990
disarmed them from some moves that he learned in the ultimate fighting

487
00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:39.310
championship watching it on TV?
No.
Yeah,
I met him.
He was just giant

488
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.190
<v 3>cuts on his head.
It was really intense,
man.
Yeah,
I not,
I would not do well.</v>

489
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.800
I would just be like,
yeah,
this cut me up.
I hate myself.

490
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.840
<v 1>Well,
he's just,
when you're,</v>

491
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.650
when you're in that sort of life or death situation,

492
00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.580
<v 3>it's just a,
becomes</v>

493
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.410
<v 1>your survival mode kicks in you like you don't even,</v>

494
00:26:57.411 --> 00:26:59.000
you didn't even know what you're doing.
Right.

495
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:04.430
I've talked to 'em people that have been attacked by animals and they say that

496
00:27:04.431 --> 00:27:05.050
it's just,

497
00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:05.883
<v 3>you don't,</v>

498
00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:10.240
<v 1>you can't even imagine how Reptilian your reaction is.</v>

499
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.160
There's no rational thinking at all.

500
00:27:12.161 --> 00:27:17.161
It's like 100% just a DNA firing the switches for you.

501
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.570
<v 3>Wow.
Hmm.
I was on the,
uh,</v>

502
00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:25.420
subway a couple of years ago and I was like,
it was empty.

503
00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:27.370
I was only the back of the train and there was like,

504
00:27:27.371 --> 00:27:31.170
it was just me sitting there and then there was like a guy sleeping on the other

505
00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:34.080
end,
like he was passed out or whatever.
And then,
uh,

506
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.470
there's like six hooligan,
like young teenager,

507
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.760
like they were acting all crazy and they got on the train on that end of the

508
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:44.370
train and they were like spitting on the guy and they were like,
well God,

509
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.010
there was screaming.
But the guy was like,
he was obviously drunk,
whatever.

510
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.820
And they were like hocking Louise on him and stuff and like jumping up and down.

511
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.010
And so I was just looking at my phone because it was like a,

512
00:27:53.011 --> 00:27:55.680
it was a bad situation,
unpleasant.

513
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.250
And then they kind of turned and focus towards me and they were like,
hey,

514
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:02.610
you fucking faggot,
look up,
look up from your phone.

515
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.190
And then I just did into kept ignoring them and then one guy was like,

516
00:28:06.191 --> 00:28:07.930
I'm going to kill you if you don't look over here.

517
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.080
And then the other guy was like,
I'll kill you if you keep looking at your phone.

518
00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:12.340
And I was like shitting my pants.

519
00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.060
And this is between Queensboro Plaza and Lexington Avenue,

520
00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:19.000
which is a pretty long underground station.

521
00:28:19.001 --> 00:28:21.370
It was like doing the thing where it's like delayed.
So it was probably like,

522
00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.980
realistically it was like four or five minutes,

523
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.850
but I was like shitting my pants and there's six of them.

524
00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:29.010
They were probably like early twenties late teens.

525
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:33.990
I have no fighting training or no weapon where I was like this is a bad

526
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:38.350
situation.
Like six people.
You're like,
um,
I'm not going to,

527
00:28:38.351 --> 00:28:41.690
I have no six people's a problem.
Six people.
That's a problem.

528
00:28:41.691 --> 00:28:43.100
I appreciate you saying it cause a lot of people are like,

529
00:28:43.101 --> 00:28:45.890
I would have busted up the biggest guy or whatever the fuck.
And you're like,

530
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:46.120
dude,

531
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.630
<v 1>tangle of arms and legs,
six people's a real problem.</v>

532
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.520
The only thing that would save you though is that you're in a subway and by that

533
00:28:54.521 --> 00:28:57.680
is they're not going to surround you,
right?

534
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:02.550
If you just put your back to the wall,
right.
Six people as they come towards you,

535
00:29:02.551 --> 00:29:04.740
they have to kind of come towards you almost single file.

536
00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.110
<v 3>I suppose so,
yeah.
There's not a lot of room.
You can get like two at a time,</v>

537
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.523
<v 1>but</v>

538
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:12.740
<v 3>you could crack one</v>

539
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.250
<v 1>and if you crack one,
most of them will start panicking.</v>

540
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.930
Most people don't know how to fight.
Right.
You smashed one guy's face and,

541
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.140
and he goes unconscious and then the other guys were there and you start moving

542
00:29:24.141 --> 00:29:27.230
in on them.
They have this anxiety attack.
They start freaking,

543
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.200
unless they know how to fight and I doubt they do cause people don't have,

544
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:35.070
who know how to fight.
They don't do things like that.
It's very,
very rarely

545
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.740
<v 3>do you run into thugs that actually know how to fight.</v>

546
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.980
But that's the problem is most people know how to fight.
I'm one of those,
most

547
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.590
<v 0>of them people.
Yeah.
So the smashing in the face.
I mean,
I can,</v>

548
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:46.960
I know how to throw a punch,
but I'm saying even for anybody,

549
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:50.380
even for a trained fighter,
if you're in a on a subway with six guys,

550
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:53.350
it's not good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Even if you really know how to fight,

551
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.140
if you're like a world champion,
you got to go.
God Damn it.

552
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:58.300
Because you could always break your hand.
But the first punch,

553
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:01.960
that shit happens all the time.
Yeah.
It was a unpleasant,

554
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.140
but after that I was like,
maybe I shouldn't get in the last train.

555
00:30:06.141 --> 00:30:08.890
At least give yourself a chance to go one.
It was early.

556
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:11.860
I was on my way to this show in the city.
It was like eight o'clock,
seven 30.

557
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:14.290
But Christ,
I mean,
I don't think they were leaving draw.

558
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:17.650
I think they would just assholes.
Yeah.
Just being wild or whatever.

559
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.750
Wildin I think is the term.
Whether the Italian,
uh,
they were not,

560
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.390
they were a of Latino descent.
Yeah.
Racist.
Uh,

561
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:32.620
I am describing what I think a very PC,
uh,
no,

562
00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:35.590
the way you set it,
it was clear.
You're demeaning.

563
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.480
I think Latino was good or is it Hispanic?

564
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:42.040
I think Hispanic is bad cause it's in reference directly to Spanish so that Tina

565
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:45.590
was better and that could be in reference to Latin America title than that.

566
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.470
That's all they can suck my dick.
I'm tired of it.
I really am.
Yeah.
Fuck you.

567
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:54.810
Let's see.
Knows I'm trust trying to figure out what your name is.
All right Joe.

568
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.080
Yeah.
But I mean,

569
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.040
I mean you can't just decide that something that people used forever as all of

570
00:31:04.171 --> 00:31:09.010
the sudden racist.
Like here's a weird one and I don't know why this is,

571
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.710
you can't say Chinaman but you can say Englishman.
Hmm.

572
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.270
I think a lot of it has to do with,
cause uh,
the Chinese were enslaved,

573
00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:21.670
does that right?
They built the railroads.
Yeah.

574
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.400
That's something that probably has something to do with it.

575
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.400
But you can say Irish men in the Irish were enslaved.
I,
there you go.

576
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:31.300
So that feats net.
Yeah.
By the way.
I'm just guessing.
This is not my Irish.

577
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:33.030
We're not enslaved here.
I mean,
there was,

578
00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.420
some are Irish people that came over that didn't indentured servitude.

579
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:42.340
I'm sure actually now that I'm,
I am reading,
I did read something about,

580
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.350
uh,
Irish slaves,
but,
but in comparison to African slaves,
it's not even close.

581
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.030
Yeah.
I don't know much about that Irish thing,
but I know that,
um,

582
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.160
black people,
African American people get upset when you say,

583
00:31:57.161 --> 00:32:00.610
but the Irish born slaved.
All I know is they don't like that shit.
Yeah.

584
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.820
They're not into that argument.
Yeah.
It's terrible argument.

585
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.570
It doesn't seem like a great one.

586
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.670
There's not a lot of pictures of the Irish slaves that built America.
Yeah.

587
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.490
I think a lot also came a voluntarily or something.
I don't,
I don't know.
Yeah.

588
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:21.400
My grandparents,
my grandfather on my father's side came from Ireland.

589
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:26.290
My,
uh,
I think my great grandparents.
Yeah.

590
00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:30.220
Imagine being one of those people from the 1920s.
It's like,
fuck it.

591
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.480
I'm taking a chance.

592
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.460
I'm going to get on a fucking boat and travel across the ocean like only like 50

593
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:39.410
years after pictures were made.
Yeah.
It's insane.
I about that.

594
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:40.010
I'll tell him I watched

595
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.590
<v 3>godfather part two the whole time.
I'm like,
yeah,</v>

596
00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:45.230
go get 'em a little buddy bucket take days.

597
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:48.300
Like the most powerful guy in the state.
Yeah,
whatever.

598
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.560
<v 4>There's no place like that now where people just can go,</v>

599
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.500
well that's here still isn't it?
But it's not though.
It's fucking hard.

600
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.840
Like it's hard if you're Canadian.
It's,

601
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.350
if you're Canadian gets hard to get over here and we're connected.

602
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.710
Like they make it real hard for Canadians to move here.

603
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.700
<v 3>Yeah.
Oh,
for sure.
Well,</v>

604
00:33:06.701 --> 00:33:09.220
I know a lot of Canadian comedians and they have to like Peru.

605
00:33:09.221 --> 00:33:13.870
It's the whole idea is hilarious of a comedian trying to prove they're necessary

606
00:33:13.871 --> 00:33:17.030
in America is just a hoot.
Comical like this.
They're like,

607
00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:21.410
can you guys write me letters that says we need more jokes in New York?

608
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.430
<v 4>We'd need more comedians.
Always.
I think we are.</v>

609
00:33:24.431 --> 00:33:28.260
There's a finite resource of comedian.
Well,
we need more quality.
Yes.

610
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.980
There's plenty of comedians.
Never know.
Like I knew guys that sucked,

611
00:33:32.981 --> 00:33:35.740
man for years.
And I used to have this thought,

612
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.620
either you're funny or you're not funny.
If you find it,
you can get funnier.

613
00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:43.030
Right.
But I knew guys that used to eat shit and now they're murderers.

614
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.410
Keeps coming back to Ari.
Uh,
no,
no,
no,
no kidding.
No,

615
00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.080
I'm zinging.
Ari was always funny.
Yeah.
He always had something like he's,

616
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.050
he was never as funny as he is now,
but he always had something.

617
00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.240
It was always like,
this guy's going to make it.
Yeah.

618
00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.590
It is interesting when people

619
00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.240
<v 3>kind of figure it out,
but I think a lot of those people,</v>

620
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.920
they're trying to be what they think is supposed to be funny and eventually they

621
00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:08.260
figured out to just be themselves.
And that's how it kind of,

622
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.183
I think you're right.

623
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.020
Like they're trying to do Seinfeld or something and then after awhile somebody

624
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:18.290
along the way,
it goes,
hey,
just tell the thing you said in the car.
Right,
right,

625
00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:20.810
right,
right.
I got friends like that,
that never made that flip.

626
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:23.000
Like friends from Boston,
that comics.

627
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.353
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

628
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.550
<v 3>Have like the biggest disparity in funny offstage to funny on stage of anybody</v>

629
00:34:29.551 --> 00:34:30.384
where it's,

630
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.650
<v 4>yeah,</v>

631
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.660
<v 3>it's puzzling.
Where I'm like,</v>

632
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:36.580
you're the funniest person I've ever met and you've been eating shit for 20

633
00:34:36.581 --> 00:34:39.580
years.
And it's like,
why?
How does that not

634
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:42.330
<v 4>that used to translate?
Yes.
Interesting.</v>

635
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.390
Joey Diaz is the funniest guy I've ever seen.
I've never seen anybody funnier.

636
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.610
And Joey Diaz,
when he first started out,

637
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:52.620
I didn't meet him when he first started out.
I met him cheese.

638
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:57.360
I probably met him four years into his career.
I met him in 95,

639
00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:01.200
I think,
or [inaudible] 96,
somewhere around then.
And um,

640
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:06.500
he just couldn't figure it out on stage.
And then around [inaudible] 98,

641
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:10.460
I was,
I used to take them with me on the road around 98.

642
00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:15.470
He just caught this wave and I'm Tom saying within like six months,

643
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:20.490
he went from having rough sets too.
Fucking annihilating.

644
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:25.030
Wow.
He also gained during that time at least 80 pounds.

645
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.530
It's just fun.
Just didn't give a fuck anymore.

646
00:35:28.531 --> 00:35:31.560
Like something clicked where he didn't give a fuck anymore.
Right.

647
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.510
He started eating whatever he wanted to eat.

648
00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:37.200
He was partying like a mad man and he would go on stage.
Just,

649
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.460
just didn't give a fuck.
And he was so funny.

650
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.600
It's like he figured out the formula leaf.
He was trying to do the actor thing.

651
00:35:44.601 --> 00:35:47.710
He got sucked into that thing that we were talking about.
Where

652
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.530
do you want to get on sitcoms?

653
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:53.110
You want to get auditions and you're going out for movies.
And then he,

654
00:35:53.111 --> 00:35:56.550
after a while he just got fucked over too many times and dealt with too many

655
00:35:56.551 --> 00:36:00.730
people and he realized that he was like kind of tailoring his act for those

656
00:36:00.731 --> 00:36:01.564
assholes.

657
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:01.931
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

658
00:36:01.931 --> 00:36:06.931
I love those moments in any artist with the music or whatever it is.

659
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.580
Well,
as I know his music and comedy really.

660
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.030
But when they fucking finally get into that,
uh,

661
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.450
in the rhythm of like figuring out who they are and what they are,

662
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:18.720
and then you're like,
oh wow,
this is special to me.
It's cool to watch too,

663
00:36:18.721 --> 00:36:19.200
for like

664
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.940
<v 4>person who is trying to do it themselves because you really,</v>

665
00:36:20.941 --> 00:36:24.150
you see all the elements in the qualities that they've sort of embraced that

666
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:28.330
have helped them like the authenticity and their real thoughts and you know,

667
00:36:28.331 --> 00:36:28.861
and what they,

668
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:33.861
they're there honest self deprecation and all the things that you see that just

669
00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.600
it sort of fall into place and then you can kind of examine your own self.
Right?

670
00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.550
<v 3>Yeah.
Maybe I can,
maybe I can do that.</v>

671
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.930
<v 4>Well that's the thing about comedy.
I think it was like we,</v>

672
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.330
we don't exist in a vacuum.
We all influenced each other sometimes too much.

673
00:36:49.331 --> 00:36:51.550
Like people do the Italo voice.
Yes.
You know,

674
00:36:51.551 --> 00:36:53.760
there are so many guys that do that voice.

675
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:56.920
<v 3>Yes.
And it's ruthless when you see people doing it.
Like,
God,</v>

676
00:36:56.921 --> 00:37:01.300
you got to pull them aside and go,
hey man,
I'm f uh,
tell fan too,
which right.

677
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.470
Got Him back off the tele voice.
Yeah.
That happens.
It goes in waves too.

678
00:37:05.471 --> 00:37:09.350
Remember when I was like in the early two thousands it was a lot of Dane people

679
00:37:09.351 --> 00:37:13.900
were doing a lot of day and I used to say Adi was my term of another day and

680
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.130
impression.
There'd be all these guys that walk out and they're doing,

681
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.430
they're holding the mic and an impractical way.
It works for him,

682
00:37:19.431 --> 00:37:23.660
but their carnival and doing weird movements and you're like,

683
00:37:23.661 --> 00:37:25.370
I think that's kind of his thing.

684
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.820
Cute young guys and they're trying to put on baseball hats everywhere they go

685
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.920
and they come up with their own way to do a hand stand on the stool.

686
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.200
Dan got mad at a guy and wants,
cause he was wearing a Boston hat.
Oh,
interesting.

687
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.960
Like that's my thing.
Oh Wow.
I'm paused.
I'm wearing a Bruin shirt.

688
00:37:40.961 --> 00:37:42.610
I hope that's okay.
I don't know man.

689
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.990
You got to check in this town so I'll send him an email.
Are you from Boston?

690
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.980
I'm from Whitman,
Massachusetts,
but I started there.
I was there for years.
Yeah,

691
00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.980
I'm from Newton.
Oh Wow.
Yeah,
a lot of comics from Newton.
Really?
Well,
not a lot.

692
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:59.360
John Fish.
I don't know if you know John know he's a New York guy and then Louie.

693
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.030
Oh,
so it's three.
Three is a lot that's come from a relatively small town.

694
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.930
Newton's a weird spot.
It's like a,
it's idealic if you go there right now,

695
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:10.710
it's like,
ah,
this beautiful little cute little sweet little town.

696
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:15.150
When I was growing up there just seemed like a frozen shit hole.
It was,

697
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:16.620
I think I could be wrong on this.

698
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:19.920
I think Newton was once labeled the safest town in America.

699
00:38:19.921 --> 00:38:23.730
They had gone the longest distance without a murder or like a,

700
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.450
I think they were basic enough murder or some crap.

701
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.250
And then shortly after that somebody was killed.
It was like they jinxed it.
Yeah.

702
00:38:29.251 --> 00:38:31.280
They probably wanted to set the record.
Yeah.

703
00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:33.890
And this one would be the person to break it.
Yeah.
Someone's like,
fuck that.

704
00:38:33.891 --> 00:38:34.910
And then they partnered.
But

705
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.580
<v 0>it's a good place.
Yeah.
It's nice.
Uh,
Boston's a great place to grow up,</v>

706
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.720
but I think it wears on you all.
My friends who live there
when I,
I still,

707
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.390
I still have a few buddies that lived there and I talked to him like,
man,

708
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:49.930
I don't know how many more than winters I can fucking take.
Yeah.
I guess when us,

709
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.610
I got a buddy that just moved to Kiwis.

710
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.740
He's moving to key west July 1st and he's like,

711
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.650
I'm tired of shoveling and it's a hard city.

712
00:38:56.651 --> 00:38:59.830
People are fucking angry and the traffic and uh,

713
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.940
there's like an inferiority complexes.
Yeah.
It's a great place to,

714
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:05.230
I think influence you.

715
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:09.170
And then you got to get the hell out of this horrible place to date.
I never,

716
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.260
well,
I mean I did date there,
but was that accent,

717
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.930
you find a woman with that accent?
It's just,
it's a boner killer.

718
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.280
It's not a pleasant accident on a woman.
It's not good,
dude.
It's fun.

719
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:22.010
I hear a dude with that accent.
I said,
ah,
that'd be a good guy to drink with.
Yes.

720
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.650
I agree.
This most definitely a double standard that you turned down,

721
00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:31.000
but as southern,
yeah,
I suppose to Texas.
Yeah.
Woo.

722
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:35.740
That's the best Australian.
I like Australia,
like an Irish,
English,
Irish,

723
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.340
Australian women.
I've only had sex with two Australian women in my life,

724
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.410
but bold stop bragging bro.
But both,
this is what's going to get worse.

725
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.850
Both women individually requested that I come on their face,

726
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.180
so I don't know if that's an Australian thing.
I'd have to call in.

727
00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:53.320
If you're going to fill your woman,

728
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.840
have something to do with the lack of sunscreen out there.
You know,

729
00:39:55.841 --> 00:39:58.840
they have a whole ozone layer.
That's true.
She's looking for a coating,

730
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.040
but 100% of Australian women as far as I've tested,
like enjoy it.

731
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.190
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you think if you were a girl you'd like a guy to come in your face?

732
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.240
I do.
I've talked about this before.
Uh,

733
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.100
I think if I was a girl I would be a fucking dialed animal.
Yeah.

734
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.630
That'd be calm in my eyes because I'm a man and I want come on my face,
you know?

735
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.640
So,
yeah.
So imagine,
uh,
yeah,
I think so.

736
00:40:24.641 --> 00:40:28.090
I think I'd be,
uh,
just,
uh,
just running around.
Yeah.

737
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:31.720
So I can put it up all the Dixon Buddy.
Some something.
Yeah,

738
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.100
some kind of disease and I've got stuff to give them to do.

739
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.750
You've got a bunch of them.
I had HPV that goes away.
I got married.

740
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:42.430
HPV goes away.
No,
you still have,
does he shoot a dirty load in someone?

741
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:45.630
You can give it to him still.
Well I think,
I believe I could be.
I put could.

742
00:40:45.631 --> 00:40:49.300
I got bad info from my ENT,
but I'm pretty sure you did.

743
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.150
I had pretty sure you keep that shit.
Can we look this up over here?

744
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:57.151
I think HPV does go away if you stop having sexual intercourse with different

745
00:40:57.581 --> 00:41:00.820
people,
but I think it goes away for you.

746
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.330
But I think it's still in your blood and I think you could still give it to

747
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:08.800
people.
Oh,
interesting.
Well,
so don't be lying to people and shooting though.
Well,

748
00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:10.840
I've only had sex with one chair and he just put his finger up.

749
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:14.830
I knew it just from the quick,
the quick response.
In most cases,

750
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:17.980
HPV goes away on its own.
It does not cause any health problems,

751
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:20.290
but when HPV does not go away,

752
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:23.290
it causes health problems like genital warts and cancer.

753
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:28.060
Health care provider can usually diagnose warts by looking at the general area.

754
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:29.530
What if we can fucking,
oh,

755
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:34.040
healthcare provider can usually diagnose warts by looking at them.
Yeah.
You

756
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.670
<v 1>can also do that.
Comedians can also diagnose warts.
You Go,
oh,
that's a Dick Ward.</v>

757
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:38.930
Interesting.
Yeah,
I had that.

758
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:42.680
I went to a planned parenthood who do more than abortions.

759
00:41:42.681 --> 00:41:45.500
They'll take your warts right off.
They put a little thing on there and boom.

760
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.280
Here it says there are currently no cure for existing HPV infection,

761
00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:53.090
but for most people would be cleared by their own immune system and there are

762
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:57.380
treatments available for the symptoms that can cause you can get the HPV vaccine

763
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.230
or they have a vaccine.
That's only for young people though.
We're too old.

764
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.970
Problems apparently causing problems.
What does it do?
I don't know.
He's like,

765
00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.350
dude,
you don't lie.
I did not get it.
Oh God.

766
00:42:07.351 --> 00:42:08.900
It just started giving it out recently,

767
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:12.350
I think in the last like maybe less than 10 years.
But you gotta be,
yeah,

768
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:14.960
you've got to get it like before you're 18 makes you really horny.

769
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.360
That'd be ideal.
Right?
I don't know if it cures it.
I guess it cures it,

770
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.300
but I had that,
but so it does go away.
Did you ever hear about,

771
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:28.301
there's a story about a drug called reequip and it was a medication for

772
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:33.671
Parkinson's disease and Glaxo Smith Kline lost a judgment in court.

773
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.660
I think it was in the tune of $600,000 American because it turned a guy into a

774
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:45.140
gay sex and gambling addict.

775
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:50.800
All he wanted to do was hook up with guys online and gamble in.

776
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.610
But listen,
I know it sounds crazy,
but they lost the lawsuit.

777
00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.830
Like a pharmaceutical drug company lost a lawsuit and the jury awarded this guy,

778
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.810
well more than a half a million dollars.

779
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.650
How did he prove that all he wants to do is fuck guys.
That's a good question.

780
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.120
But they did.
They proved it to the point where this guy one money,

781
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.140
because he never had any problems like this before,

782
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.710
took this Parkinson's medication and it just was short circuited his brain.

783
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.650
He started sucking Dick and rolling the dice.
I'm going to sue Starbucks.

784
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:24.940
I've been drinking their tea and now I want to get came on.
Come on.

785
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:30.020
I can't prove,
I don't want to be come down something about their tea.

786
00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:33.800
It's not organic.
There's a fucking roundup in their teeth or something's up.

787
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.860
But I want some loads while they're starting to pass out lawsuits against

788
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:43.400
glyphosates speaking to that roundup,
that,
that fucking that,

789
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.180
that shit.
$2 billion and another guy got five,
5 million.
Well,

790
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.460
he needs a better lawyer because he got his lawyer got him 5 million.

791
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:57.020
The other people's lawyers got them billions.
What?
What is,
what's the drug?

792
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:01.550
Oh,
it's on a drug.
It's a roundup.
It's a that weed killer.
Shit.

793
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:06.170
Monsanto weed killer.
Oh,
I see.
Yeah.
It gives people cancer and they're,

794
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:11.120
they're finally passing down these massive judgements against Monsanto.
Wow.

795
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.440
Yeah.
The weight of it all.
See,
Montana's hold jury hits up,

796
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.890
hits jury with the hits Monsanto with $2 billion judgment.

797
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.210
But there was that one and then there was another one for five plus million.

798
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:26.270
That guy's gotta be pissed right now.
The fuck did I only get 5 million,

799
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.570
2 billion?
Is that exact or are they rounding up that

800
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.650
<v 3>count it.
You should open with that tonight at the Improv.</v>

801
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.500
I will on Hollywood.
Hey folks,
you hear about this,
uh,
this,

802
00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:42.720
this thing called roundup.

803
00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.700
<v 1>Most people don't even know what it is.
No,
I just like serious GMO haters.</v>

804
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.700
They're the people that are like super organic,

805
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.790
don't want any pesticides in their foods.

806
00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.250
That's one thing that people need to understand.

807
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.370
If you're buying vegetables and you eat a lot of vegetables,

808
00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.580
it's very good for you.
But man,

809
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.140
there is a lot of fucking pesticides out there.

810
00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.440
<v 3>This is what's bumming me out.</v>

811
00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:07.780
The more I do cause I didn't always just ate garbage,

812
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.600
whatever without thinking about it.
Now the more I research I do,

813
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.480
the more I'll read about it.

814
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:16.770
Cause I like to read health benefits of the food I'm eating while I'm eating it

815
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:18.940
because it makes it feel like,
oh,
all right,
I'm doing something good.
Right?

816
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.530
But then every one,
the bottom of the page,
like if you eat too much broccoli,

817
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.060
you'll shoot your blood or whatever.

818
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.100
There's always something or this pesticides or whatever the fuck.
Yeah.

819
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.630
You the really,

820
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.390
<v 1>have you heard of a carnivore diet?
You heard of that?</v>

821
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.060
<v 3>I'm sort,
I,
I assume it's just meat.</v>

822
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.480
<v 1>It's just me.
Just steak.
Mm.</v>

823
00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:43.230
There's a lot of people that do it and people with autoimmune issues have huge

824
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:46.810
reactions.
Positive reactions.
Really.
Yeah.
My friend,

825
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:51.580
he was having receding gum disorder went away and they say that that should

826
00:45:51.581 --> 00:45:55.450
never goes away.
Um,
he lost 50 pounds,
Jordan Peterson.

827
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.960
Oh yeah.
He's on that.
Carnivores dye has been on over a year,

828
00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.520
just got his blood work tested.

829
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.770
A lot of people like you shouldn't even recommend that.
It's so irresponsible.

830
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.630
And there's arguments both ways,
man.

831
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:09.850
His arguments that eating only vegetables as irresponsible because large scale

832
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:12.580
agriculture is like terrible for the environment.

833
00:46:12.581 --> 00:46:15.520
It displaces all this wildlife and animals and they,

834
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.790
in most cases they're using something to kill the weeds.

835
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.820
And in most cases they're using glyphosate or something like that.

836
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.230
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
I'll,
fruit to me is always like,
that's healthy.</v>

837
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:27.840
And then people are like,
oh,
it's sugar and you

838
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.180
<v 1>whatever.
Fiber fruits,
fine.
There's nothing wrong with fruit.</v>

839
00:46:31.181 --> 00:46:34.840
It's like everything else.
If you eat too much fruit,
if you like 10 oranges,

840
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.170
right?
Your body isn't what the fuck bro.
But like if you drink orange juice,

841
00:46:38.171 --> 00:46:41.290
that's not good because your body is like,
where is all the fiber?

842
00:46:41.291 --> 00:46:43.810
Like what is this?
What are you doing to me?
Like,

843
00:46:43.811 --> 00:46:46.300
why are you making me drink this sugar water?
Yeah.

844
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.030
Did he drink like a 12 ounce glass of orange juice?
How,
let's,

845
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:51.893
let's guess,

846
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:56.130
how many grams of sugar do you think is in a 12 ounce glass of orange juice?

847
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.570
<v 3>Uh,
I don't know.
I have not good with this.
I would say,
uh,</v>

848
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:00.510
can you give me some scale?

849
00:47:00.511 --> 00:47:05.460
Like how much sugar is in a Cocacola I wish I know buck.
I'm going to say 500.

850
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:10.650
<v 1>No,
no,
no.
It's okay.
Here's,
here's a good scale.
Like,
like I saw one of those,
um,</v>

851
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.620
Gatorades but not a Gatorade.
Uh,

852
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:18.640
it was a smart drink that had some fucking flavor to it or something like that.

853
00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:22.630
You know one of them,
but it was 27 grams of sugar that I was like,
Jesus,

854
00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:25.450
that's a lot of fucking sugar.
So I would say orange juice is more than that.

855
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.730
Yeah.
I would say it's got 35 I'd say 30

856
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.830
<v 0>okay.
I'll say 48 dams going crazy.
What'd he say,</v>

857
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:36.640
Jamie?
For some reason this thing won't do the math.
Right,

858
00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:41.641
but in one ounce there's 2.6 so time is 12 it's roughly 30 cause it's 24 times

859
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:47.310
the one plus to six something like that.
Around there.
Yeah.

860
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.700
It's a lot of sugar.
Not 48 though.
No,
fuck me.
You're,

861
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.950
you're only supposed to look for a healthy diet.
I think they split.

862
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:56.680
You're supposed to be limited to a hundred grams of sugar a day.

863
00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.330
And that's for an active person.

864
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.350
Like you really shouldn't fuck around with more than that.
Right?
Yeah.

865
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:05.890
I feel like I'm finally reaching the age where food becomes a situation.

866
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:10.180
You've got to start to.
Yeah.
It's part of the problem,
man.
Yeah.

867
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:14.830
As you get older,
body starts to fucking fall apart on your brow.
Yeah.
My Buddy,

868
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.710
uh,
John Fish I mentioned earlier,
he has a story about,

869
00:48:17.711 --> 00:48:20.620
he went to his doctor and his doctor was like,
in your thirties,

870
00:48:20.621 --> 00:48:24.640
your body starts to break down and in your forties your body starts to die.

871
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.670
And he was waiting for him to like smile or laugh,

872
00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.970
but he was like just being serious doctors and asshole.
Yes.

873
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.480
Seems doctor's life right now is fucking a personal trainer.

874
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:38.350
Like I was super angry about it.
That's probably what's going on there.
Yeah.

875
00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:42.280
I think he's a bad guy.
He's a terrible guy telling you that your body's dying.

876
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:45.730
Wilson.
I'm alive bitch.
I'll fuck you up right now.
Kill you.
Yeah.

877
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:50.470
Tell me I'm alive and I'm dying and point.
Fuck.
Shut up.
Shut up doctor.

878
00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.160
Doctor Dick Wad.
What kind of doctors that uh,
I don't know,

879
00:48:54.161 --> 00:48:58.690
but some truth to that though specializes in negativity.
Yeah.
No,

880
00:48:58.691 --> 00:49:02.110
you're all alive.
Does it work as good as it does mean you're 20?
No.

881
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:06.040
Does your fucking car work as good when it has 100,000 miles on it?
No.

882
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:10.330
But I think what he's saying is that we're on the back,
the back end.

883
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.510
What he should've said is,
Duh,
everybody knows that.
Right?

884
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.740
If you live to be 100 at 40 you're fucking halfway there basically.
Yeah.

885
00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:21.340
Good point.
And living to a hundred is pretty difficult.
Yeah.

886
00:49:21.341 --> 00:49:24.370
If you live to a hundred men,
you get,
you'd really did something.
Yeah.

887
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.520
And most people are not going to make that.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,

888
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.470
I'm gonna start trying to make it a hundred.

889
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.470
I wish that there was a thing that showed you when you're dying,

890
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:36.160
what took it over,
right?
Yeah.
Well they're like,
yeah,

891
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:41.050
you had one too many cokes in 2007 yeah,
they looked at all the time.

892
00:49:41.051 --> 00:49:41.740
Do you jerked off?

893
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.110
Imagine if like here's an accounting of every time you drove you'd be like,
no,

894
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.170
I think about this all the time.
I wish we could do that.

895
00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:50.140
Cause everything has all these stats now.
You know,
like baseball,
whatever.

896
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.930
I wish you could have all the shifts you've taken,

897
00:49:52.931 --> 00:49:56.020
how many times you've wiped your ass.
How many times do you have jerked off?

898
00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:00.370
How many times you've had sex.
Wouldn't it be fun to have all of those numbers?

899
00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:04.820
It would.
Why can't your phone do that?
It should be how many steps you go.
Yeah.

900
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:08.650
Use my phone to track how far I run.
Exactly.
So we should start the dude.

901
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.430
I guess we could type it into our phone.
Yeah,
you could.
You could add it up.

902
00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:15.850
You could have like an APP.
Every time you jerk off you have to double tap it.

903
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.330
I feel like that would be a fun thing.
I think we just invented something.
Yeah,

904
00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:25.810
it could be a good app.
Like how many times you jerk off in a year,
Jamie,

905
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:28.330
how many times you think you drive?
Thousands.
Just say the Apple Watch.

906
00:50:28.331 --> 00:50:28.761
You might know.

907
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:31.760
Cause one of the last time I got an elliptical it knew I was on the elliptical

908
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:34.700
within two minutes.
It's like,
oh do you want to track this elliptical workout?

909
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.240
It's like how the fuck do you know that motion of the arm moving?

910
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.660
Is that what it is?
It's gotta be cause there.
There's the,
well that's,
you know,

911
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:43.280
that's interesting that my zones,

912
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:45.740
heart rate monitor thing that we were wearing for sober October,

913
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:49.790
that thing syncs up with my elliptical machine and it shows the heart rate

914
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.320
without even holding onto the heartbreak Bluetooth though.
That's pretty nice.

915
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:57.140
But it did it without me asking it.
Yeah,
he just did it.
It's close proximity.

916
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.070
I know,
but it's pretty,

917
00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:02.660
pretty crazy that it did that I under what else is interesting to the fucking

918
00:51:02.661 --> 00:51:06.050
government man,
Don,
Don Da.
Um,

919
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:10.580
are you worried about your phone being tracked?
No.
I have a,

920
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.300
I for some reason I've never cared that much.
I know I should.

921
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:17.780
And people talk about it like the government watching us and tracking all the

922
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:20.090
information.
I don't,
uh,

923
00:51:20.091 --> 00:51:23.900
I'm too busy worried about dying and if people like me or not,

924
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:27.710
I just assume they are.
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't,
it doesn't,
you know,

925
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:31.010
I hate to sound like a,
uh,
like some fucking hassle that's like,
oh,

926
00:51:31.011 --> 00:51:33.890
I'm not doing anything wrong.
So spy like,
but I just don't,

927
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.090
it doesn't connect with me to be concerned about that.
Yeah.

928
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.250
I don't think you sound like an asshole.
All right,
good.
Well,

929
00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:42.230
some people were like,
well,
I'm not doing anything wrong.

930
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:44.150
We want to get the terrorist and blah,
blah,
blah.

931
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.900
Those people are assholes though.
Um,
the people that say that,

932
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:49.820
what do you care if you're not doing anything wrong?

933
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:54.420
That's about tyranny starts you weak,
bitch.
Right.
You'd about,

934
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.860
we've been on that guy.
I appreciate this.
Is fake guy talking about

935
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.890
he needs to go get some fucking guns.
Yeah.
Like stand up for America.
Venezuela.

936
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:08.720
She what's going on first?
Well,
Bro,
they don't have any guns.
It's true actually.

937
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:11.840
Yeah.
I mean they're running over people in the street because people can't,

938
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.970
it's hard to get guns,
man,
as well.

939
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.250
That's another thing that sometimes things just don't like.

940
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:19.030
I'll see that story and be like,
oh,
all right,

941
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.880
and then I just can't register everything.
There's no way.

942
00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:26.300
You'll never get any thought done.
Jamie,
what are you going about?

943
00:52:26.301 --> 00:52:29.450
The story of this guy and Holmby hills,
which is like the Beverly Hills area.

944
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.460
Oh yeah,
I heard about that.
He had guns more than a thousand guns.
Yeah.

945
00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:37.930
Making some of them.
He was making them,
not all of them,
but it,

946
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.880
did he do anything?
Did you just like guns?
Uh,
I don't know.

947
00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.290
Cause to arrest me tip or something.

948
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:50.291
If they decided arrest me and they said Joe Rogan has five bows and 150 arrows,

949
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:54.200
like,
well who the fuck is he planning on killing?
Right.
They could do that.

950
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:56.240
But those are more firearm sales.

951
00:52:56.241 --> 00:53:01.070
I guess those are less alarming numbers to me though.
Bows 150 arrows.

952
00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:03.500
Thousands seems like a lot.
Yeah,

953
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.440
but I think it's one of those things you just get excited when you keep buying

954
00:53:06.441 --> 00:53:09.800
them.
Acting on a tip regarding illegal firearms hills.
Oh,
okay.

955
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:13.970
So He's selling guns.
Guns were strewn throughout several of the homes rooms.

956
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:18.140
Authority said it took about 30 law enforcement personnel more than 12 hours to

957
00:53:18.141 --> 00:53:22.010
remove all the weapons goals,
gun goals,

958
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.980
photos and videos from the scene showed stacks of rifles.
I have a buddy of

959
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.340
<v 1>mine who has so many guns.
He doesn't know how many guns yeahs.
That's impressive.</v>

960
00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.990
That's like us with jerking off.
Yeah,
exactly.
Same thing.
Jerks off too though.

961
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:38.730
He's a real gun nut,
like a legit gun nut.
Like he,
he does long range shooting.

962
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:42.090
He goes enters into competitions and stuff where they shoot like,
you know,

963
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:44.580
they shoot out to like a thousand plus yards.

964
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:48.260
<v 3>I tried to understand cause I try to be a good empathetic person.</v>

965
00:53:48.261 --> 00:53:51.260
I'm not a gun guy and it's easy to be like,
what do you need guns?

966
00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:53.630
You fucking maniac.
Right.
But then I'm like,

967
00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.570
I understand like I had thousands of baseball cards I guess you get,

968
00:53:56.571 --> 00:53:57.530
they're not killing machines,

969
00:53:57.531 --> 00:54:00.080
but I guess you get into something and then you're like,

970
00:54:00.081 --> 00:54:01.880
I want this gun and then I'm going to try to get another guy.

971
00:54:01.881 --> 00:54:04.220
And then you get addicted to the purchasing of things.

972
00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:08.030
<v 1>Yeah,
there's that.
But it's also fun to shoot him.
You go to a range.</v>

973
00:54:08.031 --> 00:54:10.660
Like I went to arrange with Duncan Duncan Trussell who's,

974
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:15.050
well basically a Buddhist and probably one of the most peaceful people I've ever

975
00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:18.920
met in my life and super brilliant guy.
And he's like,

976
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:23.480
this is so fun.
He fucking loved it.
We loved it.
We just shooting pieces of paper.

977
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:28.430
You know,
out at distance and clay pigeons and shit.
It's fun.
That seems like fun.

978
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.390
Yeah.

979
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:34.390
It's also sobering like when you pull the trigger on a rifle and you see that

980
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:40.020
bullet hit that paper and you're like,
that is car or metal to hear clink.

981
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.950
You know when you're shooting at something it's pretty instant,
right?
Instant.

982
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.110
Yeah.
Yeah.

983
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:49.050
Mean does when you get to longer distances is kind of interesting cause you pull

984
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:53.750
the trigger boom and then you hear,
think like there's actually a lag time.

985
00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.400
Right.
I think

986
00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.260
<v 3>what kind of distance are we talking?</v>

987
00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:02.740
<v 1>I've never shot anything further than like 400 yards I think was the longest I</v>

988
00:55:04.041 --> 00:55:07.520
shot anything at the range.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
That's pretty long.

989
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.210
That's what you have taken.
Huge range.
Yeah.
That's four football fields.

990
00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.600
You have to,
uh,
set your,
your scope for that.

991
00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.630
Or at the very least you have to understand the drop of your bullet.

992
00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:22.120
It's all about how fast your bullet's going.
If you had a pencil and a bullet,

993
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:24.790
right.
One in each hand and he dropped them both at the same time.

994
00:55:24.791 --> 00:55:27.850
They both fall exactly the same speed because it's a rate of gravity.

995
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.570
So it's all a matter of how fast the bullet gets to the target,
right?

996
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.050
Cause it's going to drop from the moment it comes out of the,
uh,
out of the gun.

997
00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:38.170
It's dropping,
right?
So it's how fast is it going?

998
00:55:38.171 --> 00:55:41.440
There is going to tell you how fast,
how far it's going to drop.

999
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:46.630
So if you know that you set that use,
you can use ballistics,
um,

1000
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:50.350
uh,
an application,
you take that ballistics information,

1001
00:55:50.351 --> 00:55:55.210
you put it into your phone,
like 400 yards,
hundred and 15 grains,

1002
00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:58.300
whatever your bullet is at a,
you know,
300 win Mag,
whatever it is,

1003
00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:02.680
he enter all that stuff in and then it'll tell you exactly what to do when your

1004
00:56:02.681 --> 00:56:06.550
scope,
and then you turn it and then think of,
go right in the center.
Wow.
Yeah.

1005
00:56:06.551 --> 00:56:09.820
That's what those a long range dorks.
They love it.
They love it.

1006
00:56:09.821 --> 00:56:11.980
They love shooting things that are really,
really,
really far.

1007
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.030
I think they're called snipers.
Well,
it's kind of,
yeah,

1008
00:56:15.031 --> 00:56:18.330
but they're not really snipers.
A lot of them are civilians.
Oh,
they're just like,

1009
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.950
they just said be long range competitions.
Wow.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
They have a,

1010
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:25.810
like a guy will be there with a like a super high powered binoculars,

1011
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:26.644
like you know,

1012
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:31.860
fucking big ass scope binoculars and they'll like high left and then calibrate

1013
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.520
low.
Right.
And I'll calibrate.
They're just trying to like figure out

1014
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:42.110
<v 2>like a,
that film jar head.
Did you see that movie?
I did not.
Oh that's good.</v>

1015
00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:47.300
Isn't that big?
[inaudible] Hall.
I love Jake Gelatin to,

1016
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.070
that's someone I would like to come on my face.

1017
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.250
Did you see when he was in that movie when he played a boxer and he got super

1018
00:56:52.251 --> 00:56:54.620
ripped?
I did not see that movie,

1019
00:56:54.621 --> 00:56:57.740
but someone next to me on the plane was watching it.
So I saw without,

1020
00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.870
did you get hard hearing it?
I didn't know.

1021
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:04.180
<v 1>Go look up Jake global and hall.
Um,</v>

1022
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:07.740
<v 2>it was called a southpaw.
Yes.
Yeah.</v>

1023
00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:12.660
<v 1>You got super shredded.
Yeah.
He's a great look at the actor.
Come on son.
Yeah.</v>

1024
00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:14.650
That's something that is fucking jacked.

1025
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.010
I mean that is about as shredded as a man gets.
Like,

1026
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:19.240
I worked hard to get that body.

1027
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.400
<v 2>No,
he's amazing.
He's great.
And uh,
that Zodiac is one of my favorite movies.</v>

1028
00:57:23.401 --> 00:57:24.920
Broke Back Mountain I love.
And uh,

1029
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.770
what's the one with nightcrawler and then prisoners was great too.

1030
00:57:28.771 --> 00:57:30.930
I love that movie.
Yeah.
He's been in a bunch of great movies.

1031
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.040
He's an interesting cat.

1032
00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.520
<v 1>He's good.
Yeah.</v>

1033
00:57:33.521 --> 00:57:37.330
There's certain people that like you just want to see them act in that weird.

1034
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:38.343
Yes.

1035
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.240
<v 2>You know,
like they just,
they have a thing.
Yeah.</v>

1036
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.710
And then certain people that you like enough of this fucking guy.
Yeah.

1037
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:46.990
There's some people that are famous actors that you're like,

1038
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:50.490
how did this guy get in?
I don't understand what,
drop some names.
Nicholas,

1039
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.920
I'm a friend.
This,
this pockets is too big.
These people could be listening.

1040
00:57:53.921 --> 00:57:56.830
Could be,
but yeah,
that's why some people got it.
Sacrifice.

1041
00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.660
There's a couple of guys whose name I don't know,

1042
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:00.910
but I just see him and then like my wife will just,
I'm sorry,

1043
00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:02.470
I didn't know he was in this and I'm like,
thank you.

1044
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.340
There's a couple of actors that you're like,
this guy sucks.
And he's just a guy.

1045
00:58:06.341 --> 00:58:09.120
I don't get it,
you know,
but most of them are occurring.

1046
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.760
I feel like most people that are doing well,
a pretty good,
yeah.
Connecting.

1047
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.520
Well that's what we would hope.
See this is the thing.
That's

1048
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:15.970
<v 1>all right.</v>

1049
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:20.800
I hope comes out of this whole me too movement besides these criminals getting

1050
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:23.830
busted is that it changes the whole,

1051
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:28.840
it's like there's a sort of,
uh,
the way thing,

1052
00:58:28.841 --> 00:58:32.920
there's an ecosystem out here and I've seen it with women too.

1053
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.610
Like there was a woman casting agent that I knew that fucked all these men and

1054
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:39.800
we'd get them parts and she was gross and she was really aggressive to tread.

1055
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:43.060
Fuck my buddy.
She try to fuck two of my buddies.
Yeah.

1056
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:47.560
She sounds nice to me.
I kind of like her foul.
Alright.
My bad breath,

1057
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.420
everything's wrong.
Okay.
All right.
All right.

1058
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.460
I'll take your word for a long time ago.
She's probably dead.

1059
00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:56.200
He's probably got HPV and she just died.
It didn't go away.
But,

1060
00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:01.080
but I mean,
I've seen it,
I've seen aggressive women.
It's not as many obviously,

1061
00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:04.590
but yeah.
But that people would be judged on their merits because it's,

1062
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:07.710
and not just see it's not out here.

1063
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.660
Like when you're acting and trying to audition,
it's not just sexual favors.

1064
00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:16.200
It's also political leanings.

1065
00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.520
And like Dale ask you questions about things.
Everyone,

1066
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:24.820
everyone falls in with whatever the ideology that you supposed to adopt in order

1067
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:29.020
to be accepted by this community,
uh,
excel.
They're,

1068
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:33.140
they're really looking for people to say the right things and do the right

1069
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:34.610
things.
They want you to like,

1070
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.760
it's not a coincidence that everyone in Hollywood is progressive,

1071
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:42.680
that everyone in Hollywood,
you know,
is super liberal and super left wing.

1072
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:47.420
It's an act for a lot of them,
for good percentage of people out here.

1073
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:48.680
It's a fucking act,
right?

1074
00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:53.160
<v 2>It's a thing that gets you attention and credit,
but couldn't it be part of it?</v>

1075
00:59:53.161 --> 00:59:54.480
The,
I mean,
I don't disagree,

1076
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:58.200
but I do think a lot of people that are naturally a artistic,

1077
00:59:58.201 --> 01:00:01.350
they become open minded and then they ended up going to the places where they're

1078
01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:02.184
very diverse.

1079
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:06.530
And part of becoming progressive I think is meeting a lot of these people that

1080
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:10.790
are,
you know,
gay people and Muslim people and Trans people,
and then you go,
oh,

1081
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:14.120
these people are just like me,
blah,
blah,
blah.
From stress of,
yeah,
there's,

1082
01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.550
that's got to be a part of it.
There's that too,
but

1083
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:21.790
<v 1>there's such a prevalence of fake humans that you got to realize that like most</v>

1084
01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:24.060
of these people have no opinions.

1085
01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:28.890
They're not real opinions on what they're doing is they're just sort of spouting

1086
01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:32.850
out this predetermined pattern or behavior that they feel like would be
accepted.

1087
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:37.720
<v 2>Yes.
Oh,
for sure.
And I think,
yeah,
it's set up that way.
Like you said.</v>

1088
01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:39.460
I mean,
I'm basically just saying what you just said.

1089
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.290
<v 1>Well,
they just want it so bad.
Right.
You want it so bad.</v>

1090
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.810
<v 2>Okay.
Yeah.
Well that's the danger of,
um,</v>

1091
01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.720
being motivated by a fame and success.
It's so bad.

1092
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:56.220
That's where I think what helps a lot of comedians is,
it starts off,

1093
01:00:56.221 --> 01:00:59.850
the seed is not fame or fortune.
It's like I want to be as funny as,

1094
01:00:59.851 --> 01:01:02.490
I want to bring as much joy to the audience as I can.

1095
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.290
So as long as you can keep that,

1096
01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.490
you end up being a a pretty decent person and a good artist.
Yeah.

1097
01:01:08.491 --> 01:01:10.860
You just want to kill.
Yeah.
The thing about,

1098
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.960
<v 1>there's some traps in that too,
right?</v>

1099
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.140
And this is one of the traps that leads to people stealing material is that you

1100
01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:21.880
just want to kill,
you want to kill you.
Wanna you want to feel that feeling,

1101
01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.150
right?
So you want it.
It's not that you want the audience to have it,

1102
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:30.710
so you want to kill in the way you kills.
They have a great time,

1103
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.260
but you will do that at any cost.

1104
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.250
So you'd take other people's work and try to pawn it off at your own as your
own.

1105
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.810
You pretend to be someone you're not,
so they'll like you more so they will,

1106
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:41.780
you'll kill louder.

1107
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.580
<v 2>I'm afraid someone's going to take this clip where you keep saying you and it</v>

1108
01:01:44.581 --> 01:01:47.340
just showing maybe like,
I'm sorry,
someone's definitely gonna be,

1109
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.480
this is like a Colin.
Colin Quinn used to have that old joke.
He's like,

1110
01:01:50.481 --> 01:01:53.210
don't tell you the story.
And they use you as,
he's like,

1111
01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:56.630
you're telling me you sleep with kids and you think that's okay.
And he's like,

1112
01:01:56.631 --> 01:02:01.450
not me,
I'm not the guy.
But,
but yeah,
that,
that is a weird thing that people do.

1113
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.560
The design,
you're telling me you think it's okay to rob Old Lady?
Yeah.

1114
01:02:04.561 --> 01:02:08.660
And just people walking by.
I didn't say that.
No,
I know you didn't say that,

1115
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.070
but they don't hear that part.

1116
01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.970
<v 1>These fucking guys who rob old ladies.</v>

1117
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:17.010
<v 2>MMM.
But yeah,
that,
that definitely is a bit,
but I try to be,
uh,</v>

1118
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:21.570
in tune with that too,
like in a meditative way of that.
Like,

1119
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.930
cause you get so as a community gets so obsessed with just like the sound of

1120
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:25.770
killing,
wanting to kill it,

1121
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:28.140
you forget that they're actually a group of human beings.
Right.

1122
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.730
And then you're like,
you are,

1123
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:34.970
the goal is to bring joy to the people that you're actually trying to get laughs

1124
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:37.830
and trying to,
um,

1125
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:42.230
feel the joy of providing joy as opposed to just like,

1126
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.440
if I kill,
I'll get on TV and if I get on TV I can pitch my show.

1127
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.650
I try to kind of organically walk it back to the room in the moment of making

1128
01:02:50.651 --> 01:02:51.670
these people here at labs.

1129
01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.670
<v 1>That's a great attitude,</v>

1130
01:02:52.671 --> 01:02:56.870
but I think New York is better in that regard in that there's not really a lot

1131
01:02:56.871 --> 01:03:01.560
of industry.
Right.
It's really just about killing since about being funny.
Yeah.

1132
01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.210
Doing well.

1133
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:05.420
<v 2>It feels like a lot of the motivation in New York is to kill,</v>

1134
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:09.170
so you'll get more seller spots the next week.
Yes.

1135
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:12.500
As opposed to I'll kill so I can get in the room with

1136
01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.720
<v 1>true TV or whatever.
Right,
right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
You don't want,
that's a,</v>

1137
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.840
I'm hoping that goes away and I think it is,

1138
01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:24.370
that's one thing that's kind of reinvigorated the Los Angeles scene is actually

1139
01:03:24.371 --> 01:03:26.920
the death of jobs,
believe it or not.

1140
01:03:26.921 --> 01:03:30.440
Like there's no jobs for comedians anymore other than being a comedian.
Right.

1141
01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.410
So because,
and also because of podcasts and the Internet,

1142
01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:38.620
because people can put their clips up on youtube and because people can do

1143
01:03:38.621 --> 01:03:39.460
things on the Internet,

1144
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.840
there is no longer like the really important stuff for your career is no longer

1145
01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:50.020
held by these gatekeepers.
Like the network executives that are constantly there.

1146
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.950
They're never there anyway.
Like if you haven't,

1147
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.210
if you get a show approved by a network executive,

1148
01:03:55.211 --> 01:03:58.450
there's a real good shot that in six months that person won't be there anymore.

1149
01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:01.210
Right,
right.
Real good shot.
Yeah,
that's like that.

1150
01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.720
<v 2>It feels like in the hole industry,
somebody bookers you in comedy starting out,</v>

1151
01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:08.480
you try to impress this booker or get in with them where were like kind of

1152
01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:10.940
hanging out and like having a beer and the next thing you know they're like

1153
01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:14.240
<v 1>in accounting,
they're not even in the business anymore.</v>

1154
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:19.190
The good thing about today though is there's more comradery amongst comedians

1155
01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.930
than ever than ever before.

1156
01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:23.570
And there's more support amongst communities cause comedians do each other's

1157
01:04:23.571 --> 01:04:28.350
podcasts.
And on the podcast you'll talk about each other and sometimes it's bad.

1158
01:04:28.351 --> 01:04:32.300
Like how we're shitting on art should fear cause I'm fucking really tired.
Ari,

1159
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.840
aren't you?
Uh,
I'm,
I'm not.
You have known him a lot longer.

1160
01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:41.680
You know I love him.
I'm just kidding.
But I mean sometimes it is bad though.

1161
01:04:41.681 --> 01:04:43.930
If someone gets exposed,
if someone,
you know,

1162
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:49.020
like someone does piss you off or someone is doing something unethical and you

1163
01:04:49.601 --> 01:04:53.840
find out about it through a podcast.
But for the most part,
most comedians,

1164
01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.120
these podcasts are being like super supportive.

1165
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.570
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
it's the best.</v>

1166
01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.840
I mean I think most things I've gotten in my career from other Comedians,

1167
01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.490
<v 1>yeah.
At this point.
Yeah.
I think that's real normal.</v>

1168
01:05:05.491 --> 01:05:08.990
And it's normal east coast and west coast and it didn't use to be like that.

1169
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:12.440
There wasn't this like really super supportive community out there anymore,

1170
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.333
but there wasn't always,

1171
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.120
I think it's the podcast thing I really do because so many people have podcasts.

1172
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.040
Yeah.
Well.
It's

1173
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.480
<v 2>also contagious when someone does so much for you and brings you on the road and</v>

1174
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:26.320
buys you lunch and tweets your shit,
you're like,
I want to do that for somebody.

1175
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:29.320
And so then it keeps calling for it.
It's a good feeling.

1176
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.740
It's a nice to be nice to the nice,
yeah,
it's a great feeling.

1177
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.150
And you really get to know,
like

1178
01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:37.590
<v 1>Ari's podcasts,
one of my favorite podcasts because he,</v>

1179
01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.740
you get to know him in his podcast,
like he does these,

1180
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:45.840
he'll do an intro that's 40 minutes long for a conversation and it's him stoned,

1181
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:49.770
wandering around his apartment,
cooking salmon and talking about it and like,

1182
01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:52.920
and talking about this and that and something that sucks.

1183
01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:55.850
And this is stupid and that's great.
And you know,

1184
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.190
it's like you get to hear him.

1185
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.590
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
ours is a,
a,
a special,
not to sound like a fucking fruitcake,</v>

1186
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.930
but he's a special human being.
I love that guy.
Yeah.
He's

1187
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:09.450
<v 1>about him more than anything is,
well,
I love a lot of things about him,</v>

1188
01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:14.451
but he figured out who he was and got successful and when he got successful he

1189
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:22.000
gave zero fucks.
Once he got successful,
it's like,
okay,

1190
01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:23.680
I've got a couple of hundred thousand dollars in the bank,

1191
01:06:23.681 --> 01:06:27.040
you can all suck my ass.
And he doesn't,

1192
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.960
he doesn't compromise anything.

1193
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:31.620
<v 2>Yeah.
And he takes care of people in a way that I'm like,</v>

1194
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:34.020
I'm concerned about your fine.

1195
01:06:34.021 --> 01:06:38.750
It like he'll do a show and split the door evenly with everybody.
And uh,

1196
01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:43.140
I'm like,
you should take the money.
You sold it out.
You hosted the show,

1197
01:06:43.141 --> 01:06:46.170
you produce the show.
Like I've done his storytelling show and he's like,

1198
01:06:46.171 --> 01:06:51.000
here's $860.
And I told like an eight minute story and didn't even do great.

1199
01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:53.730
I'm like,
ah,
I'm sorry.
That sucked.
He's like,
whatever,
here's $900.

1200
01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.820
And you're like,
okay,
like you could have paid me 100 bucks.

1201
01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:01.280
It's like a Tuesday and I would have blown you.
Um,
but that's the way he is.

1202
01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:06.200
He come in my face,
right?
Yeah,
exactly.
I'm not going to swallow that you load.
Um,

1203
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:10.340
but then I've produced a show with him.
We did a show together and then sweat.

1204
01:07:10.341 --> 01:07:12.470
It fucks you.
The splitting the money where I'm like,

1205
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:16.310
I don't want to fucking split the money.
Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah,
that does.

1206
01:07:16.311 --> 01:07:19.670
Fuck you.
Especially if it's your show.
But no,
he's a,
he's a great guy.

1207
01:07:19.671 --> 01:07:24.610
We just went out and hiked in,
uh,
Mount Zion and um,
does that Utah,

1208
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:28.890
Zion national,
maybe I might've made the mountain part up Zion national forest.

1209
01:07:28.891 --> 01:07:31.950
Yeah.
I don't know if there's a mountain vault at Utah in Utah.
Yeah.

1210
01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:37.310
But he liked paid for the airbnbs where all the fucking has the wild rock

1211
01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:42.150
formations and shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's pretty,
it's pretty amazing.
Yeah.
But um,

1212
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.070
he got this like airbnb that was like seven bedrooms in a hot tub and he paid

1213
01:07:47.071 --> 01:07:49.350
for the whole thing to him.
And then I got this reflux thing,

1214
01:07:49.351 --> 01:07:53.370
so we made all this special food for me and to you guys.
That's us right there.

1215
01:07:53.371 --> 01:07:55.870
I'll look at that.
That's Mike Vecchio and,
and my wife Sarah,

1216
01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.910
Tele Mush and myself.

1217
01:07:56.911 --> 01:07:59.790
Did you see any mountain lions or any crazy shit when you're out there?

1218
01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:03.380
We saw nothing crazy.
I mean it was,
it was beautiful and amazing,

1219
01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:07.500
but nothing insane is beautiful.
That was the house he got.
It was like their BNB.

1220
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.930
It's like a retreat for like,

1221
01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:14.820
did all these crazy drums in there and a big fireplace,
indoor,
outdoor.

1222
01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:15.740
It was pretty unbelievable.

1223
01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:16.050
<v 0>Oh,</v>

1224
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.470
you know the weird thing about airbnb's as you find like little fucking webcams

1225
01:08:19.471 --> 01:08:22.500
where people are watching you.
24,
seven.
Wow.
That's the backyard.

1226
01:08:22.501 --> 01:08:26.630
And that's the back porch.
Yeah.
Fuck.
That view is amazing.

1227
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.700
<v 2>And then the next day my wife and I drove to Sunnyvale,
California.</v>

1228
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:34.220
We all said goodbye.
I was going to do rooster teeth.
Feathers.
Oh.

1229
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.000
And we went to the mall to eat and uh,
all of our shit got robbed.

1230
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:42.270
Everything I'm wearing,
everything she's wearing is uh,
stolen.
We had this big,

1231
01:08:42.271 --> 01:08:46.980
like meditative xy on hiking three days together and you just feel like,

1232
01:08:46.981 --> 01:08:51.690
man,
fucking life,
Bro.
And then we went to the cheesecake factory.
I was starving.

1233
01:08:51.691 --> 01:08:52.530
I'm like,
I gotta eat something.

1234
01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:56.430
And we came out and 100% of our luggage and computers were stolen out of your

1235
01:08:56.431 --> 01:09:00.360
car.
Yeah.
Which I guess is an epidemic in the,
uh,
what's that called?

1236
01:09:00.361 --> 01:09:01.230
Silicone Valley.

1237
01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.250
Really huge San Jose San Francisco to the point where the cops were like,

1238
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:09.100
oh yeah,
all right,
take care.
Did they break into your car?

1239
01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.270
I guess they went into the trunk,
but I thought maybe I didn't lock the door.

1240
01:09:13.271 --> 01:09:17.320
But a bunch of people have tweeted that may saying they have like fucking

1241
01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:20.220
decoder things.
They can just get into cars now.
Jesus,

1242
01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.950
they pray on rental cars cause they know you have suitcases and shit.

1243
01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.890
They see that little no smoking thing.
Oh,
and that's the thing.

1244
01:09:26.891 --> 01:09:29.500
It's silicone valley.
Yeah.
So that after that happened,

1245
01:09:29.501 --> 01:09:30.930
we noticed every restaurant would go to,

1246
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:34.570
would see at least like one business guy with eating with a suitcase next to

1247
01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:38.350
them were like,
you gotta bring your shit inside.
Oh it was brutal.

1248
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.200
<v 0>Silicone Valley's a weird spot because you have all these really rich people and</v>

1249
01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:46.200
then you have all fucking army of homeless folks.

1250
01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.060
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean that feels like America.</v>

1251
01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:51.870
<v 0>And getting more and more that somebody was telling me this,
Jamie,</v>

1252
01:09:51.871 --> 01:09:54.840
find out if this is true because someone was telling me that there's a woman

1253
01:09:54.841 --> 01:09:59.841
that I know that lives out here and she was saying that they bust people bust

1254
01:10:00.941 --> 01:10:02.630
them in from other cities.

1255
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:05.840
They take their homeless people and give them one way tickets to Los Angeles.

1256
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:08.300
I heard that with Hawaii.
Is that what you said?
No.

1257
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:11.130
<v 2>Oh,
I heard that it happens in Hawaii.
They fly him to Los Lunas.</v>

1258
01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:14.750
<v 0>That's a good move.
If you're in Hawaii,
good luck getting a ticket back.</v>

1259
01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:18.750
Fuck yeah.
But it's,
but if your boss them they could always get back.
Yeah.

1260
01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:22.050
They're on the same piece of ground.
Right.
It's not as effective.

1261
01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.030
That's a good point.
Patient flying to Hawaii.

1262
01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.360
That's what La should send them back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Save a lot of money.

1263
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.570
I think there's a few jumbo jets.
Get one of them.

1264
01:10:29.571 --> 01:10:32.130
Eight 37 tens of crash and make it a,

1265
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:36.720
I think you should make it a night like I'll fucking private like a air force

1266
01:10:36.721 --> 01:10:40.680
one with is like food and uh,
you know,
focus the sizer and then they're like,

1267
01:10:40.681 --> 01:10:43.440
oh wow,
this is going to be great.
And then you're like,
no,
it ain't.
Yeah,

1268
01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:45.480
you fly him in the Molokai.
That's that,

1269
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.050
that island that they used to send the lepers.
So there's an article,

1270
01:10:49.051 --> 01:10:53.760
I just found that that was done by the Guardian and 2017 seems like a pretty

1271
01:10:53.761 --> 01:10:54.840
long in depth article.

1272
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.650
It doesn't say they're being busted specifically to Los Angeles,
but this one,

1273
01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.870
the example they're giving is a purchase,

1274
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:04.350
a ticket purchase to this guy by the city of San Francisco.

1275
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:08.550
And I think this was sending him to Indianapolis.
So he went,
wow,

1276
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:12.150
2100 miles the other way.
How weird is that?

1277
01:11:12.151 --> 01:11:16.140
That should be so illegal to not take care of your homeless problem,

1278
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.430
but rather to send them,

1279
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:22.440
he traveled 2,275 miles over three days to reach his destination in Indianapolis

1280
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:24.390
and then freeze to death.

1281
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:27.570
You don't magically go from San Francisco to Indianapolis.

1282
01:11:27.571 --> 01:11:29.620
You don't have the proper footwear at fuck.

1283
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:33.810
Cities have been offering homeless people free bus tickets to relocate elsewhere

1284
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:37.740
for at least three decades.
What that is gross.
Well,

1285
01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:42.480
if you're just offering them a ticket,
yeah,
but it's not so bad until now.

1286
01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:45.600
There's never been a systematic nationwide assessment of the consequences.

1287
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.190
Where are these people being moved to?

1288
01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:51.720
What is the impact those programs are having on the cities that send and the

1289
01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:55.110
cities that received them and what happens to these homeless people after they

1290
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:58.200
reached their destination?
Well,
the best example of that was a,

1291
01:11:58.201 --> 01:12:01.290
that wild wild country documentary.
Yeah,
I did.

1292
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.990
I mean they've took over fucking talent with homeless folks.
Yeah.

1293
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:04.824
That was one of those ones.

1294
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:08.940
Every cult thing I watched the first half hour I'm like,
this seems pretty nice.

1295
01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.920
I'm kind of,
yeah,
like this sounds kind of awesome.
And then slowly are like,
aw,

1296
01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:18.610
maybe it's poisoning people.
Fuck.
It was a science geology.
It was like that.
Yeah.

1297
01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:21.840
I was watching like a half hour and I was like,
I kind of am into this religion.

1298
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.560
Which one going clear the HBO deliverance,
right?
One.
Alex?
Yeah.
Alex,
give me,

1299
01:12:25.561 --> 01:12:28.890
I think maybe,
yeah,
it's Lawrence Wright's book.
Go and clear.

1300
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.750
The book is even more bizarre because it gets obviously like way more into depth

1301
01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:38.040
about how crazy l Ron Hubbard was and what he essentially did and how he started

1302
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:41.430
this whole thing.
And he's,
he was self analyzing.

1303
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:44.610
It was trying to heal himself because he was fucking crazy.

1304
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.500
And along the way he got really into psychology and self help books and then was

1305
01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:53.250
quoted saying if you want to make real money you start a religion and then

1306
01:12:53.251 --> 01:12:57.920
started a religion.
Well he's not wrong.
He was right.
I did all right.

1307
01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.420
This is right.
Watch this graphic that they used on here.

1308
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:03.100
I'll have to scroll down and make it activate.
But it's,

1309
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:06.810
it shows their data showing all these homeless people get sent around the

1310
01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:09.810
country.
Whoa.
Just like those little dots.

1311
01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:14.940
So there's sending them from Los Angeles in New York primarily look at the loads

1312
01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:18.840
those berms by a year.
I can't show the whole graphics cause we can't see.

1313
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:23.490
It was crazy.
Like,
what is that burst?
Is that burst from,

1314
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.670
was that southern California or that looks like San Francisco,

1315
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.970
San Francisco to be up here.
This would be la,
like San Diego,

1316
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.570
but Florida seems to have the most started in Florida.

1317
01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.150
This graphic starts out in Florida.
Wow.
Would that make sense?

1318
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.050
It's when the hurricanes,

1319
01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:40.800
I think two is around that time period when they got smashed and I liked the

1320
01:13:40.801 --> 01:13:42.540
idea of,
I like one's passing each other though.

1321
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.710
Like there's two homeless guys passing each other like ships in the night cares

1322
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.870
where you don't see him.
Lynn,
Texas,
Texas doesn't give a fuck.

1323
01:13:48.871 --> 01:13:51.750
Those are shoot you,
they'll shoot you.

1324
01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:54.840
They have a whole for homeless people like that they have out in the desert.

1325
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.350
Why not like Wyoming?
They don't have enough people up there.
Bears.

1326
01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:03.830
It's fucking hard to live up there.
They're just not interested in taking it in.

1327
01:14:03.831 --> 01:14:06.810
You're homeless.
Yeah.
That's uh,
you know,

1328
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.050
when you wait by the time you get to be a certain age and you're homeless,

1329
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.340
I guess you just have to accept the fact

1330
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.450
<v 2>that this is just life.
This is the life you've,
no.
Yeah,</v>

1331
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.160
it seems unpleasant.
I enjoy having a home personally.
Me Too.
I like it.

1332
01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:24.880
Yeah.
I like going in there.
I read recommend and one with a lock.
Yeah,

1333
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.200
that's the best.
So you could sleep.
Yeah.
Do you like living in New York?

1334
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:34.120
I love it.
Yeah.
But I'm on the road so much that it's idea where I'm like,

1335
01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:37.780
I'm never home for really more than like 10 days.
Which would,
New York is ideal.

1336
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:41.620
You ever think about moving down here?
Not really.
I mean,
yeah,
the answer is yes,

1337
01:14:41.621 --> 01:14:44.530
but I don't think I will because I'm like a road dog.

1338
01:14:44.531 --> 01:14:48.040
So La is tough because you're behind the eight ball with the Thai,
like most,

1339
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:52.040
you're three hours behind most of the markets.
Oh,
for flights.
Yeah.

1340
01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:54.550
So you've got to get up at like 6:00 AM or leave the day before.

1341
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:56.330
And I liked the comedy cellar.
I like being there.

1342
01:14:56.331 --> 01:15:00.680
I like doing those like quality spots and you can kind of do multiple.
I,

1343
01:15:00.681 --> 01:15:03.010
my family's in New England.
I like going home to see them.

1344
01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.950
Do you work when you're in a new England as well?
Yeah,
I do like laugh.

1345
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:11.250
You laugh Moscow.
Yeah.
It's cool.
Yeah.
I'm there some point in November,

1346
01:15:11.251 --> 01:15:14.320
like Thanksgiving or something to be a hundred fucking comedy clubs in Boston.

1347
01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:18.520
There used to be so many and now there's just slap Austin and like what else?

1348
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:22.000
There's the Wilbur.
Yeah.
The Wilbur and comedy stop still around.

1349
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:25.510
Nix is still around.
Yeah.
That's crazy that that place is still around.
Yeah.

1350
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:29.740
That's been there forever.
But,
uh,
worked there 30 years ago.

1351
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:34.970
That's amazing.
I worked there 18 years ago.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1352
01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:39.070
Um,
but yeah,
the comedy connection was like my home.

1353
01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:41.500
You did that when Faneuil Hall,
right?
Yeah.
That was amazing.

1354
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.960
Is that where you started?
Yeah,
I didn't start.

1355
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:45.610
I started a place called chops lounge,

1356
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:49.960
which was like a true open mic where it was like street people and fucking main

1357
01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.880
people that had been bused in from San Francisco.

1358
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:55.260
It was like a sign up and go on and uh,

1359
01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.730
they'd be like a mixture of comics and then just Weirdos.

1360
01:15:57.731 --> 01:16:02.440
And so I started there and then I went,
uh,
eventually the comedy connection,

1361
01:16:02.441 --> 01:16:03.011
I started working there,

1362
01:16:03.011 --> 01:16:05.980
but that's where I first started opening for people and doing like real comedy

1363
01:16:05.981 --> 01:16:10.480
work and it kind of spawned from there.
I mean it's weird for us,

1364
01:16:10.481 --> 01:16:12.440
but you know where who it's really weird for.

1365
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:17.490
It's really weird if you try to like do open mics and you're like a singer.

1366
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.330
Yeah.
I don't know how that works.
It doesn't work well,

1367
01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:28.060
it works terrible.
Yeah.
It was comics that would go to like music,
open mikes.

1368
01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:29.920
I mean there are music open mics,
right.

1369
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:35.010
I guess I went to a poetry slam open Mike once I've been to comedy shows that

1370
01:16:35.171 --> 01:16:39.400
feel like poetry slams all in New York.
You get a lot of that.
Yeah.
Right.

1371
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:40.121
Where you're just like,

1372
01:16:40.121 --> 01:16:45.121
what I heard there's a lot of like really re re ridiculous sort of like woke

1373
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:49.030
comedy being performed.
Yeah,
definitely.

1374
01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:53.410
There's a thing where it's now become oddly hacky.
They don't realize that.

1375
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:57.580
You're like,
well this is now hack right.
Where you're like,
ah,

1376
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:01.540
Trump or a white male privilege.
Which I'm like,
yeah,
I understand it's an issue.

1377
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.710
Whenever you're like seven other comics started their sentence with that same

1378
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:08.410
thing,
but to be able to say that about me saying sex jokes,

1379
01:17:08.411 --> 01:17:10.070
whatever white male privilege is

1380
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:15.290
<v 1>only a problem because of racism and because of sexism.</v>

1381
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.320
If racism and sexism are out of the picture,
it's not your fault,

1382
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.330
your fault.
You're a white male.

1383
01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:25.570
The problem is that some people are not white males.

1384
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.720
If you're a black woman and you encounter prejudice everywhere you go and

1385
01:17:28.721 --> 01:17:31.420
discrimination everywhere you go,
the problem is the discrimination.

1386
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:35.530
It's not Joe lists being a white male,
they've fucked the whole thing up,
right?

1387
01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:39.070
Because they've really created resistance where there should be none because

1388
01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:41.800
you've made people perpetrators when they've done nothing wrong,

1389
01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:43.900
like you just were born a white male.

1390
01:17:43.901 --> 01:17:47.050
You got unlucky the same way or you got lucky,
I should say,

1391
01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.890
depending on your perspective.
I mean,
they didn't ask to be born a black woman.

1392
01:17:50.891 --> 01:17:54.760
Someone didn't ask to be born a Polynesian man.
You are who you are.
You just,

1393
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:58.840
you are.
The real problem is people that care.
The people that look at you and go,

1394
01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:01.060
oh,
it's a fucking white man.
Great.

1395
01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:04.780
That's what I want the opinion of another white man like that is the real

1396
01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:07.510
problem.
The real problem is that sexism.

1397
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.290
That is what racism and I don't even think it is because they think you're white

1398
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:13.400
and you have white privilege,

1399
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:17.150
but you're discriminating based on something that someone has zero control over.

1400
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:17.690
Yeah,

1401
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:21.460
<v 2>I agree.
It's fucking horse shit.
Yeah,
it's a fun.</v>

1402
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:23.210
I feel bad.
I was like,

1403
01:18:23.211 --> 01:18:26.470
I'm just trying to tell my Dick and shit jokes and get my 25 bucks and get Outta

1404
01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.910
here.
Yeah.
But that,
that's like,
like I said,

1405
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.700
people can look at my act and be like,
he's talking about dicks and shit.

1406
01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:36.640
<v 1>I talk about all kinds of things sometimes Dixon shit too though.
Yeah.</v>

1407
01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:40.900
Well those are funny.
Things can be discussed.
Well Dixon Shits are funny often.

1408
01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.300
<v 2>Yeah,
I have to like,</v>

1409
01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.370
<v 1>yeah.
Okay.</v>

1410
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:46.370
<v 2>Curb myself from having,
I'm like,
I got too many shit jokes now.</v>

1411
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.580
This is like 12 minutes.
I've got a few,
I've got a chunk.
But it's funny.
Shit.

1412
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:52.040
It's shit.
It's funny.
You know,

1413
01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.860
<v 1>sometimes you just get on a run where that's what you're interested in.</v>

1414
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.360
<v 2>Yeah.
Well also once you have a bit that's working,</v>

1415
01:18:58.361 --> 01:19:00.610
you want to extend it and write other things about it.

1416
01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.320
So then that's the way it goes.

1417
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:07.320
<v 1>I had a time period where I had like four bits about aliens.
Yeah.
And I was like,</v>

1418
01:19:07.321 --> 01:19:08.880
God damn,
this is too much.

1419
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:12.050
<v 2>You almost,
once you get to a certain point,
you start going,
what?</v>

1420
01:19:12.051 --> 01:19:15.020
Can I just go all the way and just do a one man show about aliens?

1421
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:19.250
Go to the Edinburgh fringe festival.
I'll just be the alien guy.
Yeah,

1422
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.113
I bet you could.

1423
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.070
<v 1>It could be like,
uh,
uh,
have a slideshow behind you.
Yeah.</v>

1424
01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.540
Seti research.
Oh,

1425
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:30.400
fucking the big dish that you see in the movie contact Jodie foster.

1426
01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:34.080
<v 2>Yeah.
I'm not familiar with that movie.
Well,
I mean,
I'm familiar with,
I never,</v>

1427
01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:38.010
I wasn't into it.
He didn't see that.
Never been a big Italian guy.
No,

1428
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:40.710
you're not a believer.
MMM.

1429
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:44.150
I feel like this is the kind of place where you could produce an alien.
I'm like,

1430
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:47.090
no,
not really.
I'm not a fucking thing comes and raped me.
Why?

1431
01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:49.300
<v 1>We'll show you the aliens,
but you're going to have to not be sober.</v>

1432
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.990
<v 2>Oh.
Oh,
you,
you're fully sober guy.
Yeah.
Did you,</v>

1433
01:19:52.991 --> 01:19:56.840
you said that was not sober guy.
Yeah,
I was,
uh,
yeah,
we'll you a mess.

1434
01:19:57.650 --> 01:19:58.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1435
01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:02.020
<v 2>Mentally I felt like a mess.
I mean,
I wasn't,
I never killed anybody or anything,</v>

1436
01:20:02.021 --> 01:20:07.000
but I was at,
I mean,
I'm an alcoholic.
Yeah.
I shit in the girl's shoe and yeah.

1437
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.560
I had some fun.
Oh yeah.
Girl Shoe.
Why,
what did she do to you?
Uh,

1438
01:20:11.561 --> 01:20:15.060
nothing just invited me to stay at her house.
I don't remember doing it.

1439
01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:18.030
I was in a blackout or whatever,
but um,
yeah,

1440
01:20:18.031 --> 01:20:22.890
I was all fucked up and then I woke up and uh,
I had to Piss so bad.

1441
01:20:22.891 --> 01:20:26.690
Like I just woke up in a bed and I was like,
I got a pen and I was like,
let me,

1442
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:30.090
I don't know where I am.
I actually had a flight.
I had a cross.

1443
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.180
I was going to the Seattle comedy competition.
Do you ever do that?
No.

1444
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:37.860
It was like,
it's like a month long competition and uh,
yeah.
And it's not,

1445
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.490
they call it Seattle,
but it's like actually all over Washington state.

1446
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.890
It's like a,
you drive like three hours a night.
It's pretty crazy.
Yeah.
But,

1447
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:50.490
um,
I had to like be there the next day for a month.

1448
01:20:50.491 --> 01:20:55.491
I had like a 10:00 AM flight and I woke up at like nine 20 in the morning and

1449
01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:58.110
this girl's bed and I was like,
I gotta get the hell out of here.

1450
01:20:58.111 --> 01:21:00.840
But first I gotta Piss.
If I piss in this woman's bed,
it's going to be,

1451
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:05.040
it's going to be horrible.
So I ran to the bathroom,
found the bathroom,

1452
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.870
pissed for like a half hour,
you know,

1453
01:21:06.871 --> 01:21:10.230
those and I've tried to like put my shit to get my,
I'm all fucked up.

1454
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.270
And then I came out into her living room and uh,

1455
01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:18.300
her table had been like smashed like a Chris Farley fucking table mother.

1456
01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.130
And you're that feeling when you're fucked up,

1457
01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:22.920
we are looking at something and you're like,
that was definitely me.

1458
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.460
I can just feel like,
ah,
I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for that.

1459
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:29.190
And then I was like,
I've got to go find my clothes.

1460
01:21:29.191 --> 01:21:31.860
So I went back into her room and uh,

1461
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.270
on the way there I saw like kind of like footprints of poop.

1462
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.680
And then I came in and she had a high top Nike sneaker that just had like a big

1463
01:21:43.221 --> 01:21:47.040
[inaudible] out there.
Yeah.
And there was some little pieces around.

1464
01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:50.610
And then there was like a big puddle of urine too.
Like I didn't just,

1465
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:55.020
cause you never just shit.
So I like pissed and shit,

1466
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:59.580
but I got it in her sneaker.
Like I fucking nailed it.
Purpose.
Well,
I think,

1467
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.860
I mean,
I was in a blackout so by,

1468
01:22:00.861 --> 01:22:04.590
but I think what happened was I thought it was a toilet because that's not like

1469
01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:08.280
my sense of humor.
I'm not like a,
I've never been like a take a shit places.

1470
01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.120
So I think I just saw a cylinder twin.
Well,
if it's dark,

1471
01:22:12.121 --> 01:22:14.010
it looks it's black and it's a whole,

1472
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:18.600
how big is her fucking choose real big feat.
It was um,

1473
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:23.600
it was a big woman.
No.
So I shit in there.
And then what did what,

1474
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.700
did you lose contact with her after this?
No.
So I was like,

1475
01:22:26.701 --> 01:22:28.980
I gotta get Outta here cause I gotta go catch this flight.

1476
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:33.090
So I took my sock and put it on like a,
like a puppet,
like a hand puppet,

1477
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.960
a sock puppet and just kind of picked it up that way and then turn the sock

1478
01:22:36.961 --> 01:22:38.870
inside out.
Right.
Which like,

1479
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.580
like almost like a shit in a sock and threw that away.

1480
01:22:41.581 --> 01:22:45.810
And I tried to wipe up as much of the,
she asleep?
No,
no,
they're gone.

1481
01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.600
Oh my God.
So I thought it's like nine 30 in the morning.

1482
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:52.500
I thought I just went so crazy.
They all fled their own home.

1483
01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.260
So then I get in the cab to go to the airport.

1484
01:22:55.261 --> 01:22:58.290
I'm missing my flight and I texted the girl and I was like,

1485
01:22:58.350 --> 01:23:01.740
I am so I want to kill myself.
Like I can never,
I show sorry.

1486
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:05.740
Did you tell her that I should know?
Well,
I figured she knew.
So wrote back.

1487
01:23:05.741 --> 01:23:06.640
It's okay.

1488
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:10.870
<v 3>Uh,
it was,
it was crazy,
crazy night.
It was fun or whatever and I was like,
man,</v>

1489
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:12.430
this girl must fucking party.

1490
01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:16.930
Like she's just like okay with the shitting I'll say this woman's wild.

1491
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.940
So then I got to the airport,
flew across the country,
miss my flight flood,

1492
01:23:21.941 --> 01:23:23.950
got the next flight out on the plane.

1493
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:27.620
I like crossed my leg at one point and realized I had shit like up my pant leg.

1494
01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.150
It's like subtly put it down.

1495
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:33.800
I was at a middle seat for a full cause I missed my phone side of your pond.

1496
01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:37.360
The panel outside of my pay.
How much?
Shit.
Just like a good streak.

1497
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:39.430
Like I would say ankle to knee.

1498
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.250
He didn't go to the bathroom and tried to clean it up?
No,

1499
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.150
cause I was already on the plane.

1500
01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:46.990
I was in the middle seat and I was like caked on there.

1501
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:50.620
It was like hours later.
Oh my God.
So then I landed,

1502
01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:54.430
took the plane and I phone off of airplane mode and had a text that was like,

1503
01:23:54.431 --> 01:23:59.080
Holy Shit.
We had no idea how bad it was.
And I was like,

1504
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:03.790
that makes more sense.
That is a better reaction cause I thought they must.

1505
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:08.791
So the crazy part is I shit it was like nine in the morning they had left for it

1506
01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.090
was your shit.
Yeah.
They didn't have a dog and I sued,

1507
01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:17.450
they don't just shit in their own shoes.
So,
um,

1508
01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:18.550
I was,

1509
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:22.210
I wanted to post it but then I was late so I had to go straight to the show and

1510
01:24:22.211 --> 01:24:25.780
I ended up with shit on your pants?
Yeah,
with shit in my pants and my leg.

1511
01:24:25.781 --> 01:24:29.430
It was like cake to my leg hair.
And it was the first time they come the fishing?

1512
01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.920
No,
I don't think anybody smelled it.

1513
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:35.980
I don't think they noticed cause I think it would have been,
I don't know.

1514
01:24:35.981 --> 01:24:39.520
No one said anything.
So this is funny because shit,

1515
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:44.260
so then I finished,
I took a shower finally,
like 12 hours later I was actually,

1516
01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.540
I remember pulling little pieces of shit out of my leg hair.

1517
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:52.030
It was the best shower in my life.
It felt,
oh,
how was your set?
Good.

1518
01:24:52.031 --> 01:24:55.420
I killed.
And I ended up winning that night cause they each night you judged.

1519
01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:57.730
I came in like first place.
It was like one of the best sets I've ever had.

1520
01:24:57.731 --> 01:24:59.800
That sounds like a real comedian show,

1521
01:24:59.801 --> 01:25:03.670
but shit on your legs and you win a competition but fucking kill.
I love it.

1522
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.200
It was pretty short.
It was pretty fun.

1523
01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:07.940
And then I ended up sending this message to these women.

1524
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.360
I have the messages on Facebook so it lives forever,

1525
01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.410
but it's about like this law,
it's like a 12 inch.
It just keeps going.

1526
01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:16.570
And I'm like,
I want to kill myself.
I don't know how this happened.

1527
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:19.000
I really wanted to die.
And they were,

1528
01:25:19.001 --> 01:25:21.970
luckily they were like 22 they were like fresh out of college.

1529
01:25:21.971 --> 01:25:24.590
So they were like pretty lol forgiving.
Yeah.

1530
01:25:24.591 --> 01:25:27.880
But they're in their thirties I would have sent you a bunch of crying emojis.
No,

1531
01:25:27.881 --> 01:25:31.420
they were just like laughing,
crying one with the tears.
Yeah.

1532
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:35.770
That's my favorite one.
So I sent 'em 300 bucks in a car.

1533
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:39.970
I called my friend Nate Barr Gatsy and uh,
I was like,
how much is 300 bucks?

1534
01:25:39.971 --> 01:25:43.780
Like a good amount and he's like,
he's from Tennessee.
He's like,

1535
01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.630
I don't think there's an amount you can see the stupid.

1536
01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.590
So I sent him a card with 300 bucks and um,

1537
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:53.580
I didn't really keep in touch with them,
but they were,
they were nice.

1538
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.050
They were like,
hopefully you don't get that fucked up again.
And then by the way,

1539
01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.010
I drank that and I kept drinking for two more years.

1540
01:25:58.011 --> 01:26:01.390
You think that'd be like a bottom?
And then I remember that night being like,

1541
01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:03.230
well,
I'm going to drink again at some point.
I might as well.

1542
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:05.450
So I drank for like two more years.

1543
01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:08.750
Then I got herpes and I tried to stop then to,
and then I just kept going,

1544
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.450
fuck it.
Yeah.
And what made you hit bottom?

1545
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:17.060
I finally just a live fucking hated myself.
I still do a little bit,

1546
01:26:17.061 --> 01:26:21.440
but not as much.
And uh,
I just,
it wasn't fun.
I knew I had to quit.

1547
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.950
It's like same as food at sounds like at some point I've got to stop doing this

1548
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:29.900
isn't a normal amount of drinking.
And then,
um,
it just fucking,

1549
01:26:29.901 --> 01:26:33.010
it kind of happy.
I tried to stop a couple times and,
uh,

1550
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:36.800
I'd go like a few days and then one day it was just like a thing of like,
let me,

1551
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.760
I'm going to,
this is it.
I'm stopping now.
I remember my brother in law,

1552
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:44.040
his father had just died.
It was Christmas is,
and I was like,
making a joke,

1553
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.590
you know,
when you're drunk,
trying to be funny.

1554
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:49.310
And I was like busting his balls about his dad and he was like,
yeah,
I'm upset.

1555
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:54.050
I remember just feeling like such a fucking piece of shit.
And then,
uh,

1556
01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.140
I remember like kind of the day after Christmas,
I was like,

1557
01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:59.720
I kinda just blacked out Chris.
Like I came home and I was like,

1558
01:26:59.721 --> 01:27:03.260
I don't even remember what the fuck.
And I was like,
I gotta stop.

1559
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:07.550
And then I was at field,
uh,
helium in Philadelphia and I stocked up.
Yeah.

1560
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.990
And I was with Gary Gulman is opening for Gary Gulman also.

1561
01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:14.860
My career was like kind of shit.
I was like 16 years at 15 years in whatever.

1562
01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:18.470
Oh actually less than that.
12 years.
And I guess,
um,
and I was like,

1563
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:20.240
I gotta do something.
I'm going to turn this around.

1564
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:24.350
And I just stopped and I got fucking really into it,
into sobriety.

1565
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:28.670
And it's like a new a life.
You're like,
oh,

1566
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:31.580
everything feels new again and fresh again.
I'm like,
I'll go back to this,

1567
01:27:31.581 --> 01:27:35.210
I'll get into sports again,
I'll go to museums.
You're not tired all the time.

1568
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.690
Yeah.
And then you just feel better.
You have the feel better things.
Huge.
That's,

1569
01:27:39.691 --> 01:27:42.260
that's the problem is you're tired all the time.
Like when you,

1570
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:45.530
if you drink a lot,
you're always like a little bit behind the eight ball.
Well,

1571
01:27:45.531 --> 01:27:49.040
I would lose days of my life because I was just hung over.
I felt like shit.

1572
01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:54.041
And then I realized for basically a decade I was drunk or hungover or just

1573
01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:54.620
foggy,

1574
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.740
like where you turn your head and it takes a moment for everything to kind of

1575
01:27:57.741 --> 01:28:02.140
like catch up this fucking foggy.
And um,

1576
01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.280
and just like that deep hatred.

1577
01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:06.950
And I knew I had to go all in and like I gotta I can't,

1578
01:28:06.951 --> 01:28:10.130
I'm not a guy that's like,
I'll have a beer.
And I never had that.

1579
01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:13.220
Even now when I think about,
I've sober almost seven years,
six and a half years,

1580
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.020
even now when I think about a drink,
I'm not like,
that'd be fun to have a beer.

1581
01:28:18.021 --> 01:28:21.710
I'm like,
ah,
I'd be fun to have fucking 500 beers right now.
You know what I mean?

1582
01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:26.600
Just to go whole hog and yeah,
it again.
Yeah.
So I did,
the problem was,
you know,

1583
01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:29.510
when you quit [inaudible] gets still be like the first 90 days.
They're like,

1584
01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:33.410
just don't worry about anything except for not drinking,
just eat whatever,

1585
01:28:33.411 --> 01:28:37.340
do whatever.
And so I started doing that with food.
I was like,
I'm eating cookies.

1586
01:28:37.341 --> 01:28:39.500
And then I just never started.

1587
01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:42.950
So then I just did that for years with food and now that's kind of caught up to

1588
01:28:42.951 --> 01:28:46.370
me.
What do you do you think now and how many years you've been sober now?

1589
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:48.710
About six and a half.
So you're just sober now.

1590
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.070
You're cool with it as who you are.
Yeah.

1591
01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.280
Imagine if he did a show called Joe list gets fucked up where it's like you,

1592
01:28:57.491 --> 01:29:01.380
you have handlers to make sure you don't Shit on anybody shoe if everything

1593
01:29:01.381 --> 01:29:02.040
taken care of

1594
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.700
<v 0>and you go,
look,
I haven't had a drink in six years,
but I'm sober now.</v>

1595
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.050
I'm content being sober.

1596
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:12.051
But for tonight and tonight only we're having a one night Joe list gets fucked

1597
01:29:12.751 --> 01:29:16.950
up special and you just started a bar and start getting hammered.

1598
01:29:18.330 --> 01:29:23.190
I think I would have to perform early and then I'm doing a show.
Uh,
no,
no,
no,

1599
01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:23.551
no.

1600
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:27.880
The show would be just following you around with cameras while you get blasted.

1601
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:30.160
Okay.
Cause I was gonna say if it's a show,
I'd have to do it earlier.

1602
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:33.630
I'd have to have like two beers because then I'd be sobbing and be like,
ah,

1603
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.420
my fucking,
I've found,
uh,
yeah.

1604
01:29:38.230 --> 01:29:42.000
So see she has now been so bad,
no time zero.

1605
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:44.580
That's the motivated one of the motivating,
I mean there's a lot,

1606
01:29:44.581 --> 01:29:49.460
but like the idea of going back to like,
um,
day one,
it's like such a,

1607
01:29:49.461 --> 01:29:52.370
um,
which happens and it's part of getting sober.
Then people go,

1608
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:56.340
I don't want to disparage people that are having that happen,
but like,

1609
01:29:56.430 --> 01:30:00.510
it's such a bummer to fucking walk back in there and be like,
oh one day.

1610
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:03.300
And you know,
it happens.
Of course.

1611
01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:08.480
I knew a lot of guys who had that dude get sober fuck year dive back in and

1612
01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:14.220
yeah,
I went,
well I tried early on I tried to quit drinking and then I was like,

1613
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.580
oh,
I'll smoke pot though cause I don't have,
and then you realize with wheat,

1614
01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:22.290
like I'm like,
oh,
I'm outside of my mind.
This is the same as I'm fucked up.

1615
01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:24.750
Like where you get high enough,
you're like,
well this is not sobriety.

1616
01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:27.070
I'm fucking retarded right now.
Right,
right.
Was,

1617
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:32.580
was your thing just not being in your mind getting outside of your mind or was

1618
01:30:32.581 --> 01:30:36.150
your thing blacking out and ruining your life?
Cause the thing,

1619
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:39.600
the only thing that's good about pot is you don't feel terrible.
Yeah.

1620
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:43.760
Well I think I have like that addictive personality.
So then that'd be high.

1621
01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:48.750
But now it does seem like more,
uh,
appealing.
Cause nowadays,
first of all,

1622
01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:53.130
it's like you can go to store and the guy that's like this weed makes you feel

1623
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:57.850
happy.
This one chills you out.
This one makes you gay.
This one's great.
Yeah.

1624
01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:00.600
Like before when I was,
I just never a big weed guy,

1625
01:31:00.601 --> 01:31:04.410
but I'd get drunk and smoke and sometimes you're just smoke some fucking crazy

1626
01:31:04.411 --> 01:31:07.290
demon weed and be out of your mind.
It was just whatever.
We'd was just weed.

1627
01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.790
Now it feels like there's categories and shit.
Dude,
I did a be real smoke box,

1628
01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:15.180
you know,
be real from Cypress Hill.
I had,
I do now.

1629
01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:18.210
I know Cypress Hill be real is uh,
you know,

1630
01:31:18.211 --> 01:31:23.040
the guy who would talk wraps in the crazy high pitch voice doctor fee.
Oh yeah.

1631
01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:23.874
Okay.
Um,

1632
01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.480
I did his smoke box and you get in this Cadillac and you smoke weed until you

1633
01:31:32.071 --> 01:31:36.330
are no longer even a person.
You are just,

1634
01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:37.880
uh,

1635
01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:42.880
you are a thought that is like a cork that's flowing down a raging river,

1636
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:46.080
headed to a waterfall.

1637
01:31:46.081 --> 01:31:49.710
Like you are so fucked up and you're trying to have a conversation and you're

1638
01:31:49.711 --> 01:31:52.350
being filmed.
And these guys do that every day.
They just,

1639
01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.310
there's people that just get up biliterate it every day.
Yeah.

1640
01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.080
I think that sometimes we'd,
people don't take it sit cause it's like

1641
01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.660
<v 4>it's just weed and it's uh,
it's natural,
whatever.</v>

1642
01:32:02.661 --> 01:32:04.550
But sometimes there's people that I'm like,
yeah,

1643
01:32:04.551 --> 01:32:07.330
but you're fucked up all day every day.
Yeah.

1644
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:10.630
If you have an addictive personality and you have a problem with anything,

1645
01:32:10.631 --> 01:32:12.550
there's a lot of people that get into that Kratom stuff.

1646
01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:15.190
Do you know what that stuff is?
[inaudible] Kratom as um,

1647
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:21.160
it's like a plant based.
I think people are trying to call it an opiate.

1648
01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:23.980
I don't know if it's technically an opiate,
but it's legal.

1649
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:27.130
You can buy it and it helps people and it actually alleviates a lot of the

1650
01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:31.240
symptoms of opiates and it acts as a mild stimulant.

1651
01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.550
When you take a little bit of it,
like if you take two pills,

1652
01:32:33.551 --> 01:32:36.940
it's like a cup of coffee and it's like,
oh,
I like,
this is nice.
But then I said,

1653
01:32:36.941 --> 01:32:37.870
I wonder what it's like.

1654
01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:39.870
And I was asking a friend of mine who takes it all the time,
I go,

1655
01:32:39.871 --> 01:32:43.690
how much do you take?
And he's like,
I take 10 pills,
I got 10 you take 10.

1656
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:47.350
I'm like,
what the fuck is that?
Like?
So I did it.
I tried it.
I think I took eight,

1657
01:32:47.351 --> 01:32:50.680
I don't even think I took 10 and I was fucked up.
I was like,

1658
01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:54.340
oh you guys are getting high.
Like this is your high.
I'm high right now.

1659
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:57.760
Like this is not like you're not sober.
Don't tell me you're sober.

1660
01:32:57.761 --> 01:33:02.310
And you take an eight pills.
A cranium like that stuff gets you high and you can,

1661
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:06.220
you can buy it legally,
but it's weird high.
It's like,
um,

1662
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.320
everything functions like your,
your muscles and your arms.

1663
01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:13.060
And everything moves the way it's supposed to.

1664
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:15.050
It doesn't feel like you're on coordinated or,

1665
01:33:15.051 --> 01:33:19.450
or you're tripping and stumbling or anything like that.
But your brain is like,

1666
01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:21.190
this is not sober.

1667
01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:25.180
<v 0>It's just like screaming.
This is not sober,
but it's a different kind of,</v>

1668
01:33:25.181 --> 01:33:27.670
this is not sober.
Interesting.
Yeah,
you're not,

1669
01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:31.030
you're like I could have a conversation with you and you might not even know

1670
01:33:31.031 --> 01:33:32.950
that it was fucked up on this stuff.
Right.

1671
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:36.490
And I could go lift weights are going to go do something or you wouldn't,

1672
01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:38.590
it wouldn't impair like you'd go running on that stuff.

1673
01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:42.430
So is it like a heady buzzer?
Like a body to anything?
It's a head.

1674
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:45.640
It's a weird one.
Like I was really shocked at how high God.
Hmm.

1675
01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.040
Cause I felt like,
cause that's what someone said,

1676
01:33:48.041 --> 01:33:49.780
they said if you take two pills,

1677
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:52.870
it has a mild stimulant effects and we're in a cup of coffee.

1678
01:33:52.871 --> 01:33:56.520
But if you take multiple pills then it becomes more of like a like a,

1679
01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:00.700
like a Downer or not.
Not a downer.
More relaxing,
more like an opiate.

1680
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:03.700
But I didn't realize how fucked up you actually get.

1681
01:34:03.701 --> 01:34:06.880
Like you get pretty fucked up and then you get a tolerance for it.

1682
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:09.190
So a lot of these guys are taking like 10 pills,

1683
01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:11.800
then going to the gym and they're like,
oh,
I need it for my back.
I'm like,

1684
01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.680
you can't even blasted.
Yeah,
that's like that with booze and all drugs.

1685
01:34:14.681 --> 01:34:18.760
It feels like you kind of chase that yeah.
Thing.
I mean that's,
yeah.
Yeah.

1686
01:34:18.761 --> 01:34:20.050
Well that's the thing,
right?

1687
01:34:20.051 --> 01:34:23.620
It's like we were talking about with smart phones or like we were talking about

1688
01:34:23.621 --> 01:34:26.870
video games,
like things get get away from you.
Yeah.

1689
01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.310
That's part of the problem with being a comic.
Right?
Like all of us,

1690
01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.200
if there's something wrong with your brain,
want to do this,
right?
Yeah.

1691
01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:38.590
I think there's definitely some sort of design this,
some attention.

1692
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:43.480
You didn't get somewhere something went wrong.
You're upset about it.
And so,

1693
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:45.370
uh,
when you're not on stage or when you're honest,

1694
01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.750
you're trying to do something else to make you forget about that attention or

1695
01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:52.780
affection.
You didn't get somewhere along the line.
Yeah.
It's a fucking,

1696
01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:57.950
if you can harness it though,
like that I didn't get enough attention

1697
01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.210
<v 2>can be super beneficial and gives you insight.
Yeah.</v>

1698
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:06.290
It'll give you motivation if you can harness it.
Yeah.

1699
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.170
It's interesting to go,
um,

1700
01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:11.030
that sort of self reflecting and therapy or whatever that,

1701
01:35:11.031 --> 01:35:13.820
whatever your method is,
or people do it with mushrooms or whatever,

1702
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:17.510
but that introspective of like,
oh,
those moments where you're like,

1703
01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:20.980
I'm doing that because of that.
That's neat.
Yeah.

1704
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.880
Then there's the next step of no longer doing the things you don't want to do

1705
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.380
because of that or the habits that you have and the next step,

1706
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:36.260
you go to the rom.center and Malibu start doing acid.

1707
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.770
Oh,
I don't think a malleable they have it.
Where's,
where's the dot?
Oh,

1708
01:35:39.771 --> 01:35:42.650
Maui dunking.
Dunking goes to Maui every year.

1709
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.600
Hangs out when Rahm Dawson.
Wow.
They meditate.
Yeah.

1710
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.070
People come from all over the world to meet this guy and meditate with them.

1711
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:56.090
Yeah.
That's pretty amazing.
I listened to a,
I love a tech,
not Han.

1712
01:35:56.091 --> 01:35:59.990
You know that guy?
No.
Oh,
he's a,
he's a Buddhist monk.

1713
01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.480
I think he's about to die.
I think he's like in his nineties,

1714
01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:05.120
he hung out with like MLK back in the day.
They'll,
okay.

1715
01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:08.150
Nominated for the Nobel peace prize.
He's written like 70 books.

1716
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:11.630
He's a pretty amazing tick.
Not Hot.
It's t,

1717
01:36:11.631 --> 01:36:15.740
H I c h space and h a.
T.
Where's he from?

1718
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:19.940
He's from Vietnam,
but now he's been in,
he's been living in France for like,

1719
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:22.460
I don't know,
30 years.
He's got his own meditation center,

1720
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:25.820
but he writes all these books and there's videos you can find.
Do you meditate?

1721
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:29.060
I do.
I tried.
I tried.
Sometimes I just,

1722
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:32.720
I'm such a fucking anxious guy that it's sometimes hard,

1723
01:36:32.721 --> 01:36:34.460
but I'd read him a lot.

1724
01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:38.190
And Jack Kornfield Buddhists that's tech not,
Huh?
Yeah,

1725
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:41.930
that 90 years old.
He's close.

1726
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.670
He's in is an old picture problem.
Great.
But I also,
yeah,
I mean he's a,

1727
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:50.840
he's a real zen master,
so yeah.
So maybe he's going to live forever or some shit.

1728
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:55.850
Um,
and then Tara Brock,
I listened to her pose.
He's old as fuck now.
Her Dad,

1729
01:36:55.851 --> 01:36:59.630
that makes more sense.
Um,
I'll listen to her like guided meditation.
I'll do that,

1730
01:36:59.631 --> 01:37:03.710
but I use an APP.
I just heard her podcast has like a,

1731
01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.330
she does these guided ones,

1732
01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:09.260
so not an app but a podcast and then sometimes I'll just sit.

1733
01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:13.580
Have you ever done a float tank yet?
No.
Your guy,

1734
01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:16.610
I don't know what the producer I guess was showing it to me,

1735
01:37:16.611 --> 01:37:18.860
but I feel like I'd have a fucking panic attack in there.

1736
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:23.300
He just opened the door anytime you want.
Oh,
okay.
It's not like it closes you in.

1737
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:26.660
Yeah,
it seems terrifying.
The door to school,
like just like that.

1738
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:31.370
Just touch it gently.
It'll open nothing.
That's good to know.
But no,
I've never,

1739
01:37:31.371 --> 01:37:32.750
I've never done it.
I should,
but yeah,

1740
01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:37.400
I've had panic disorder throughout my life and I just for the first time and

1741
01:37:37.401 --> 01:37:38.151
like a long time,

1742
01:37:38.151 --> 01:37:41.090
had a couple of panic attacks last week for the first time in two years.
Yeah.

1743
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.540
What was fucking with you?
I think a lot.
There's like,
uh,

1744
01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.110
well first of all doing this show is anxiety and of now I feel like we're just

1745
01:37:48.111 --> 01:37:50.870
bullshitting.
I'm just trying to pretend there's not.
That's how it always is.

1746
01:37:50.871 --> 01:37:51.870
Lesser of people listening.

1747
01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:55.010
I'm glad that you got there because when we said in the beginning like we almost

1748
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:56.093
start,

1749
01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:59.370
<v 4>do you want to tell people,
you were telling me that you were kind of anxious,</v>

1750
01:37:59.371 --> 01:38:01.110
like,
well let's,
let's just talk.
Let's just,

1751
01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.260
<v 2>I worked at disarming but,
oh well I'm not trying to be,
I appreciate it.</v>

1752
01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:10.500
I appreciate it that you are,
but I think a lot of it is like,
yeah,

1753
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:11.960
this is a huge show.

1754
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:15.800
And then my wife was doing late night last night and then I'm on the road with

1755
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.640
Louie and uh,
you know,
he's this,
I have a lot of,
uh,

1756
01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:21.650
my biggest fears are being like,
you know,

1757
01:38:21.651 --> 01:38:25.040
you've disliked and wanting to be please people.
I'm a people pleaser,

1758
01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.580
as many alcoholics are.
So I feel like,
uh,

1759
01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:32.660
you feel like you're in the fire and these controversial situations in the

1760
01:38:32.661 --> 01:38:33.860
bigger audience,

1761
01:38:33.861 --> 01:38:36.350
the more people who are breaking down what you're saying and being like,

1762
01:38:36.351 --> 01:38:37.460
what's up with this fucking guy?

1763
01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:42.070
What is it like doing the road with you doing the road with Louis now?
Yeah.
Uh,

1764
01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:45.590
well we've done a few dates.
I've done a few dates with them.
Um,

1765
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.200
it's great as the protest died down and there was,

1766
01:38:48.201 --> 01:38:52.550
we just did a acne Minneapolis,
I think that Max out at eight people outside.

1767
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:57.560
Um,
so,
but for the most part was like four or five.
Did you say hi to them?

1768
01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:59.480
No,
I just walked by.
I mean,

1769
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:04.430
I respect them for doing their whatever they're doing.
Um,
but guided.

1770
01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.170
Yeah.
You know what?

1771
01:39:06.171 --> 01:39:11.171
I was really angry and I was really angry at comedians response to his leak set.

1772
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:16.040
That was very angry about that.
Yeah.
It was strange,

1773
01:39:16.041 --> 01:39:19.130
but I think people get pulled up into this thing for some reason.

1774
01:39:19.131 --> 01:39:23.000
There's a thing now where everyone thinks they're supposed to have a take on

1775
01:39:23.001 --> 01:39:25.940
every thing.
Exactly.
No matter what happens,
they're like,

1776
01:39:25.941 --> 01:39:29.510
I better come up with a tweet or my take or anything.
Not actually necessary.

1777
01:39:29.511 --> 01:39:32.540
People ask you,
you,
why don't you have a take on this?

1778
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:37.160
Why haven't you tweeted about this?
Right.
Like,
um,
there was a,
the,

1779
01:39:37.161 --> 01:39:40.640
the Christ church massacre happened and uh,

1780
01:39:40.670 --> 01:39:44.020
I was reading about it and I was like,
God damn,
this is

1781
01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.960
<v 4>fucking crazy and I'm reading about this and this guy was a,</v>

1782
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:51.500
a white nationalist and he said hi to Pooty pie before he went and killed all

1783
01:39:51.501 --> 01:39:54.810
these people.
I'm like,
what the fuck?
Like what is this?
Yeah.

1784
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:59.890
And then I never check my mentions and then I just was,

1785
01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.930
cause I was on Twitter looking at all this stuff.

1786
01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:06.880
[inaudible] I saw something that led to something that someone tagged me and

1787
01:40:06.881 --> 01:40:08.450
then I looked at my mentions for a second and like,

1788
01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.110
how can we not talk about Christ church?
You racist piece of shit.
But

1789
01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:18.020
I get it just happened and I don't have a take.

1790
01:40:18.021 --> 01:40:21.110
Like what the fuck am I supposed to say?
Rest in peace.
Like what is,

1791
01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:25.010
what does anyone want you to say when a massacre happens,
this was horrible.

1792
01:40:25.011 --> 01:40:26.360
Everybody knows it's horrible.

1793
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:30.180
<v 2>Yeah.
It's a weird thing now if you don't denounce something young people,</v>

1794
01:40:30.181 --> 01:40:33.150
you're like done,
you're on your board supporting it.
Yeah.
And you're like,

1795
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:33.984
I'm just trying to,

1796
01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:37.210
<v 4>well,
with me,
there's been situations with just talking to people,</v>

1797
01:40:37.211 --> 01:40:40.360
like they don't want you talking to certain people because those people are

1798
01:40:40.361 --> 01:40:43.690
right wing or those people.
And if,
oh,
you must be secretly white.
Right wing,

1799
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:48.400
right.
I'm not,
I tell you,
I'm not like,
why don't you believe me?

1800
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:49.760
<v 2>It's a weird thing.
Like I'm a,</v>

1801
01:40:49.761 --> 01:40:52.670
I'm a liberal guy who's call myself a nineties liberal,

1802
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.130
held them up for everything.

1803
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:54.963
<v 4>Went sideways.
Yeah.</v>

1804
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.850
I'm not like a whatever is happening.
Yeah.

1805
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.630
I'm a,
you know.
Yeah.
Alyssa Milano is calling for a sex strike.

1806
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.610
Yeah,
I saw that.
I like,
that's good work.
Good luck.

1807
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:08.950
Well that's what you do and no one's who fuck you anymore.

1808
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:11.200
You can start saying crazy shit.
Like want to have a tech?

1809
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:15.790
You guys have a sex strike ladies,
you're going to hold out like that.

1810
01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.130
And Tim Pool had the best take on that.
He's saying,

1811
01:41:18.131 --> 01:41:22.450
so men who agree with you won't get laid.
Right?
Like what?

1812
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:25.570
That doesn't even make any sense.
Like,
but the idea that it's,

1813
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:28.530
it's the same thing we're talking about earlier.
They,

1814
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:31.030
they've lumped men into this category.

1815
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:36.210
Like women are going to go on strike until we respect their reproductive rights

1816
01:41:37.810 --> 01:41:40.660
in Georgia.
First of all,
it's just Georgia.

1817
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.300
He wants to try it for the whole country.
That's not going to help Georgia.

1818
01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:45.700
I don't know if you understand voting,
but that's not how it works.

1819
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.030
There's state politics,
local politics.
Second of all,

1820
01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.870
like most men don't have anything to do with this.

1821
01:41:52.871 --> 01:41:56.290
It's not like we have men meetings where we get together and say,
Hey,

1822
01:41:56.291 --> 01:41:58.670
we've got to stop these women from Deb,

1823
01:41:58.670 --> 01:42:01.000
Debbie exercising their reproductive rights.

1824
01:42:01.110 --> 01:42:04.810
So like you're punishing a bunch of people that have nothing to do with this

1825
01:42:04.811 --> 01:42:08.740
because we also have penises.
Like what?
What,
what's the thought process there?

1826
01:42:08.741 --> 01:42:12.340
This is so,
but it's such an obvious virtue signal.

1827
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:16.070
It's so obvious that this is like pussy hats and the women's mind.

1828
01:42:16.071 --> 01:42:18.940
We're going to do this,
I'm going to do this and the way we're going to,

1829
01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.640
we've got a sex strike and bought a bunch of her friends probably like,
yeah,

1830
01:42:21.641 --> 01:42:25.720
this is gonna work.
Like this is not how to handle things.
It's not us.

1831
01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.250
I've never voted against women's reproductive rights.
Right.

1832
01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:31.510
So if you're telling like my wife,
she can't fuck me because if she does,

1833
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:35.410
she's not down for the cause.
Like wait,
you're orchestrating everyone's sex life.

1834
01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:38.830
That's crazy.
It's just going to make people angry at you.
It's a little strange.

1835
01:42:38.831 --> 01:42:42.150
And I'm like,
is that guy's,
that guy's an asshole.
Can I still get laid?
Yeah.

1836
01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:46.150
Not like he stinks now you can't.
And the,
you know,

1837
01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.950
abortion such a fucking creepy subject too because it's such a minefield.

1838
01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:54.790
Like if you're a man and you even talk about it,
I like,
first of all,

1839
01:42:54.791 --> 01:42:57.040
why are you talking about it has nothing to do with you.

1840
01:42:57.041 --> 01:43:00.580
It's a woman's right to choose and a woman's body like,
okay,
I get it.
Yes.

1841
01:43:00.850 --> 01:43:04.870
But it's a thing.
So if it's a thing,
you're allowed to talk about a thing,
right?

1842
01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:09.930
And this thing happens to be a fetus that could become a Joe list or a Jamie

1843
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.760
Vernon or Joe Rogan or who the,
is it going to be a person?
If it keeps going,

1844
01:43:15.761 --> 01:43:18.910
me Vernon,
that guy right there.
Oh,
hey Jay young Jamie.

1845
01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:23.920
So that if as the feed is grow will become a person.

1846
01:43:23.921 --> 01:43:27.280
Now I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to terminate the pregnancy.

1847
01:43:27.370 --> 01:43:30.550
I'm not saying that,
but that is what it is.
It is.

1848
01:43:30.551 --> 01:43:34.690
It's going to be a person and to pretend anything else,
it's like they don't,

1849
01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:37.600
no one wants you to discuss it that way.

1850
01:43:37.810 --> 01:43:42.810
Like no one wants you to say that this is a viable offspring.

1851
01:43:43.631 --> 01:43:46.900
It's going to be a person someday.
No one wants you to say that.
It's just,

1852
01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:50.320
there's code words like a woman's right to choose.
There's like these,

1853
01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.720
these ways of describing it,
which I agree with.
I'm,
I'm,

1854
01:43:53.721 --> 01:43:57.230
I'm not a pro life person.
I'm pro choice person.
Right?

1855
01:43:57.650 --> 01:44:02.480
But when it gets to be like five months old and then people are saying,

1856
01:44:02.481 --> 01:44:05.660
well that's just a woman's right to choose.
Okay,
okay.
It is,
it is.
It is,

1857
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.050
but that's a baby now.
But that thing could live outside the womb,

1858
01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:13.640
<v 2>but isn't there?
Um,
isn't that law?
And I'm,
I don't,
I haven't read that,</v>

1859
01:44:13.641 --> 01:44:15.960
but Georgia law,
but it isn't,
I don't know the Georgia law,

1860
01:44:15.961 --> 01:44:18.410
but like this thing with now they can late Tang term.

1861
01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.440
Isn't that specifically if the baby or mother is in danger?

1862
01:44:23.610 --> 01:44:27.510
<v 4>No,
no,
not everywhere.
Um,
in some places it is.</v>

1863
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.050
In some places it's not some place you just have the right to have an abortion

1864
01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.840
up until a certain amount of time.
And I think it varies.

1865
01:44:33.841 --> 01:44:35.460
I don't think there's a federal guidelines.

1866
01:44:35.461 --> 01:44:39.180
I think that's one of the reasons why Georgia just instituted this six week

1867
01:44:39.181 --> 01:44:44.040
thing.
Like their thing is the moment that child is a heartbreak,
the heartbeat.

1868
01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.200
And that apparently is six weeks in.

1869
01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:49.620
Sometimes people don't even find out they're pregnant until seven,
eight,

1870
01:44:49.621 --> 01:44:53.220
nine weeks in.
And then you're saying they have to carry the baby.

1871
01:44:54.210 --> 01:44:57.780
Yeah.
It's a fucking minefield.

1872
01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:00.660
<v 2>Yeah.
It's a hard,
and I like many subjects,
uh,</v>

1873
01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:03.290
people want it to be just kind of black and white.

1874
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:07.130
<v 4>Yeah.
Well we need to have a sex strike to suit this out.
Yeah.
That's what it is.</v>

1875
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:08.690
Girls.
We're going to go on the sex track.

1876
01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:12.810
How many women read that and we're like,
yeah,
none.
I'm on CRM at a maybe,

1877
01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:17.270
maybe a few thousand,
few crazy bitches just out of their fee and a few men like,

1878
01:45:17.271 --> 01:45:20.870
yes,
please take it away from me.
Please let me show my picture.

1879
01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:24.440
I'm going to show him.
I have our true,
yeah,
I imagine it's a small amount.

1880
01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:28.130
Imagine being her husband.
She's like,
we're going on a sex strike.
That's it.

1881
01:45:28.131 --> 01:45:29.840
Sex Strike.
And she sees the fucking,

1882
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:32.090
the Twitter post and she made a poster for it.

1883
01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:35.840
Like with the little fucking pink ribbon in Shit and like good Christ.

1884
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:40.490
He's probably like it just,
he's probably talking to his lawyer like what?
Okay,

1885
01:45:40.491 --> 01:45:44.300
what would I lose it?
Okay.
If we left,
if I left right now,

1886
01:45:44.301 --> 01:45:47.750
like how much would have to pay?
Like what if she can test that.
Okay.

1887
01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:50.420
And then how much of the legal fees or how many,

1888
01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:54.200
what is it like an average amount of time you have to spend in court?

1889
01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:03.080
It's all men.
They all did it.
No sex for any man until we get our right.

1890
01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:08.270
<v 2>Well,
it's a very similar,
I mean,
isn't that the mindset of a racism?
Yes.</v>

1891
01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:12.260
That's a very similar mindset of like,
oh,
someone was murdered or these,
you know,

1892
01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:16.310
six guys and the train were yelling at me.
Exactly.
No more Latinos on the train.

1893
01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.970
<v 4>Yeah,
100%.
Yeah.
It's the same things,</v>

1894
01:46:18.971 --> 01:46:23.260
generalizations and the idea that you have anything to do with other males and

1895
01:46:23.261 --> 01:46:27.460
it's even crazier than racism because it's like the whole gender,

1896
01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:32.160
it's the whole gender.
It's like not,
not just like just white guys suck.
No.

1897
01:46:32.161 --> 01:46:35.190
It's like fucking everybody sucks.
Nobody gets any pussy right.
For,

1898
01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.560
until we sort this out.
Yeah.

1899
01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:41.310
<v 2>But I,
but do you think maybe a part of it is just that,
what is it,</v>

1900
01:46:41.410 --> 01:46:46.020
<v 4>Jamie?
Oh,
this is Bridget,
my friend Bridget fantasy until it,</v>

1901
01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:49.830
the mulattoes husband to call me.
But you know what's funny is I liked it.
Yeah.

1902
01:46:49.831 --> 01:46:50.040
She

1903
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.050
<v 1>liked it.
Alyssa Milano liked it.
That's a good joke.
She's gotten,
it is,</v>

1904
01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.520
she's funny.
Bridget fatus.
He is very funny.
Um,

1905
01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.510
but she's got to know that was ridiculous thing to say.

1906
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:01.890
Sometimes you swing and you miss.

1907
01:47:01.891 --> 01:47:04.820
Just like sometimes you have a joke that you try out and it bombs

1908
01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.310
<v 2>and just said,
well,
fuck this joke.
Yeah.
I've been on jokes where I'm like,</v>

1909
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:10.560
oh no one even realized an attempt at humor had just been.

1910
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.920
Those are where you're like,
oh sorry.
No,

1911
01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:17.760
it's weird when a line kills at one show and then dies at the next show.

1912
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:21.840
I swear that's the same joke.
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1913
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:26.490
Sometimes bits just work for like weeks and then they go away and then they stop

1914
01:47:26.491 --> 01:47:28.110
and you're like,
what the fuck happened here?

1915
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:31.200
I think it's your enthusiasm for them.
Yeah.
I think that's part of part of it.

1916
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah,
and it feels more fresh at the beginning and yeah,
you start faking.

1917
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:38.280
The funk in the crowd starts to smell it.

1918
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:43.020
You don't give a fuck about the subject.
They can smell it on me.
What movies?

1919
01:47:43.021 --> 01:47:46.410
This,
they can smell it on me.
Share as that dog can smell it.

1920
01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:51.180
I don't remember anybody.
What is that?
That was a Tim Roth in reservoir dogs.

1921
01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:52.081
Oh really?

1922
01:47:52.081 --> 01:47:55.440
I do one impression and it's Tim Roth and reservoir dogs and it's not even
great.

1923
01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:56.700
<v 1>Fuck you.</v>

1924
01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:01.560
<v 2>Cause he's got British,
but he's doing an American accent.</v>

1925
01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:05.700
So sometimes it kind of sounds weird.
[inaudible] they can smell it on me.

1926
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:10.350
That's what he's in the,
um,
the drug deal.
Oh yeah.
Tell that story.

1927
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:13.530
That was a good fucking movie.
I love that movie.
I met Quentin Tarantino.

1928
01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:17.670
He's an odd fellow.
He's a wonderful artist.
But yeah,
he's still a little bizarre.

1929
01:48:17.671 --> 01:48:22.560
It's very odd.
But he's a fantastic director,
but he had all bombshell with them.

1930
01:48:23.610 --> 01:48:27.750
I was like to be,
oh,
the woman is what that guy looks like to be with,
with her.

1931
01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:30.600
Like,
whew.
Boy Did you figure it out?
Okay.

1932
01:48:31.410 --> 01:48:34.830
<v 1>I'm not good at impressions.
I'm really bad at impressions.</v>

1933
01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:38.880
So will you pissed off when that,
uh,
Lucy Kay,
uh,

1934
01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:41.340
recording got released in comics were denouncing it?

1935
01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:44.820
<v 2>Yeah,
it was weird.
I mean,
it's a bummer of a few.
First of all,
people,</v>

1936
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.770
a lot of people were like,
these aren't even jokes.
He's not even joking anymore.

1937
01:48:49.771 --> 01:48:53.430
And you're like,
no,
no.
They're jokes.
Like,
I understand if you're,
um,

1938
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:56.700
don't like it or you're offended,
but you're like,
they're definitely jokes.

1939
01:48:56.701 --> 01:48:57.660
He's onstage.

1940
01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.990
He doesn't really think that they threw a fat kid in front of them and rent.

1941
01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:03.570
That's not how he feels.

1942
01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.950
<v 1>He's saying something that's fucked up and funny.</v>

1943
01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:10.250
And it's funny because it's fucked up because you're not supposed to say it,

1944
01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:15.340
which is the exact thing he's done his whole career.
Right.
And it's a new bed.

1945
01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.590
It wasn't supposed to be heard outside of this done.
And for these people,

1946
01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:23.150
there's a lot of times you'll say something one way and then you're like,
ah,

1947
01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:23.931
it's not working.

1948
01:49:23.931 --> 01:49:26.530
And then you'll figure out another way to sneak in through the back door.

1949
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:27.403
It works way better.

1950
01:49:27.650 --> 01:49:30.530
And then if they heard the first way and like this joke sucks.
Like,
no,
no,
no,

1951
01:49:30.531 --> 01:49:33.290
I figured out how to say it later.
But now it's already on youtube.

1952
01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:37.140
You've ruined the material.
Yeah.
I mean he dropped the bit.
Um,

1953
01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.880
cause it's just kinda like,
yeah,
it's out there too much.
But,
uh,

1954
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:42.830
I had a fucking hilarious line.

1955
01:49:43.190 --> 01:49:45.380
If you're wanting people to forget about you jerking off,

1956
01:49:45.381 --> 01:49:48.350
make jokes about kids getting shot.
Yeah.
He

1957
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:53.050
<v 2>does.
Also funny line where he's like,
why are you in a suit?
Which is funny.
Um,</v>

1958
01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.190
but yeah,
and then people were talking about how,
um,

1959
01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:00.430
now the parents have to hear this and stuff and you're like,
well,

1960
01:50:00.431 --> 01:50:02.020
they weren't going to,

1961
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:07.050
you took it and put it out and then CBS picked it up and put it on CBS.

1962
01:50:07.181 --> 01:50:08.230
So now they're hearing it.

1963
01:50:08.231 --> 01:50:11.320
But before that there was just 180 people on long island hearing it.

1964
01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.810
<v 4>Mm.
Yeah.
Which is what it was supposed to be.</v>

1965
01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:17.650
But the thing about working on material is if you like comedy,

1966
01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:23.340
you can't release people shit like that because you're never going to get good

1967
01:50:23.351 --> 01:50:27.190
comedy because everyone's getting,
like every time Dave Chappelle does,
uh,
uh,

1968
01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:30.160
you know,
workout set or anybody,

1969
01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:34.930
you're gonna get these half cooked bits and then you're gonna to release them

1970
01:50:34.931 --> 01:50:37.510
and it's going to ruin it for you.
It's going to ruin it for you,

1971
01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:41.020
for the people that listen.
It's like for the people that are in the room,

1972
01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:43.420
that's for them,
right?
If you're taking it out,

1973
01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:47.470
and there's been a lot of talk about Louie making this copyright thing,

1974
01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.630
saying that you know that there was a legal action if you print or you do

1975
01:50:52.631 --> 01:50:56.920
anything to record or do anything to put the material online and someone saying

1976
01:50:56.921 --> 01:50:59.080
he can't do that.
I'm like,
well,
why can't he do that?

1977
01:50:59.210 --> 01:51:02.440
The deal with the difference between that and music.

1978
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:06.100
Like if you go to hear someone sing a song and you write down the lyrics and go,

1979
01:51:06.101 --> 01:51:09.910
oh my God,
uh,
Gary Clark Jr has this amazing new song.
Here's the lyrics.

1980
01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:13.210
That doesn't ruin the song.
Right?
But if you say,
oh,

1981
01:51:13.211 --> 01:51:17.980
he's got this hilarious joke and the twist is he says this,
well,

1982
01:51:17.981 --> 01:51:22.050
you just fucked that bit up for everyone that's ever going to listen to,

1983
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:23.200
to read that,
right?

1984
01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:26.360
<v 2>Yeah.
It's,
uh,
it's frustrating.
It was a frustration,</v>

1985
01:51:26.361 --> 01:51:29.010
but then people start being like,
he's all right now.
He's going to do it.

1986
01:51:29.011 --> 01:51:30.090
He was like,
no,
he's not.

1987
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:31.960
<v 4>People are God damn crazy.
Uh,</v>

1988
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:35.330
but the comedians that denounced it were embarrassing.
It's like,

1989
01:51:35.331 --> 01:51:37.250
do you not know what a workout set is?

1990
01:51:37.251 --> 01:51:39.920
Do you understand this guy was out of comedy for almost a year.

1991
01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:43.340
Do you know that this guy was doing a fucking hour after being out a commie for

1992
01:51:43.341 --> 01:51:44.174
almost a year?

1993
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:48.350
Fuck you full stop pretending that what you do is different.

1994
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:49.470
Stop in.

1995
01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:53.540
So many people were doing it and it turned out that they had a bunch of jokes

1996
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:58.750
that were awful or about a mass shooting or about pulling your dick out in front

1997
01:51:58.941 --> 01:52:01.760
of someone or about anything along those lines.

1998
01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:04.400
<v 2>It's also a bad precedent to start where I'm like,</v>

1999
01:52:04.401 --> 01:52:09.360
do we really want to start publicly shitting on comics?
Unfinished bits.
Exactly.

2000
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:11.530
That seems like cause I don't want that.
No.

2001
01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:15.350
I suppose I saw a list at a fucking seller and he's got this hack and you're

2002
01:52:15.351 --> 01:52:16.850
like,
oh,
give me a moment.

2003
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:20.480
Tell me behind the closed doors that like my piss hacky or something.

2004
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:21.310
How long is it,

2005
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:25.060
<v 4>you're a bit ready before like do you have a comedy central special?</v>

2006
01:52:25.061 --> 01:52:25.894
You have something,
right?
Right.

2007
01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:29.740
<v 2>Did I have a Netflix half hour and I did a comedy central half hour.
Okay.
So</v>

2008
01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:35.590
<v 4>how long did you have to work on those bits before you were ready to put them on</v>

2009
01:52:35.591 --> 01:52:36.970
comedy central or Netflix?

2010
01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:41.680
<v 2>Quite a while.
I like to do a bit at least three months before it's somewhere.</v>

2011
01:52:41.970 --> 01:52:45.140
Yeah.
W as at the very least.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it

2012
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.010
<v 4>depends on the bit,</v>

2013
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.660
<v 0>right?
Some bits are pretty fucking good.</v>

2014
01:52:47.661 --> 01:52:51.050
A couple of weeks in and other bits or I've got a couple of bits of my act now

2015
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:51.441
I'm,
I'm like,

2016
01:52:51.441 --> 01:52:54.370
this mother fucker needs an overhaul and I don't even know where to start.
Yeah.

2017
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:57.320
I've had bits that I did for,
I've done for two years.

2018
01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.010
And then you finally find a line,
you're like,
ah,
there we go.
That was it.

2019
01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:04.460
And then you're like,
now it's more of a bit,
exactly.
Cause it takes,

2020
01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.930
it takes time to figure it out.
And uh,
but yeah,
it's comics should,

2021
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:12.110
but I understand people,
people hate Lou and they're going to hate them.

2022
01:53:12.111 --> 01:53:15.440
And so whatever he does or says they're going to believe,
believe it.

2023
01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:17.120
You know what?
I think a lot of it is,

2024
01:53:17.121 --> 01:53:22.121
I think people are justifiably upset at the idea of him jerking off in front of

2025
01:53:22.671 --> 01:53:26.770
women that didn't want him to.
Here's,
there's a couple factors that though,

2026
01:53:26.771 --> 01:53:30.590
one is that he asked,
you know,
yeah,
it's a weird thing to want to do,

2027
01:53:30.591 --> 01:53:33.620
jerk off in front of people,
but he asked and a lot of these stories,

2028
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:38.150
the way you're getting the version of it,
it's like worst case scenario,

2029
01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:41.600
it's like he blocked the door,
he didn't block any doors,
you know,

2030
01:53:41.601 --> 01:53:46.601
and they were laughing like people were joking around like it became this

2031
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:48.230
traumatic thing years later talking about it after the fact.

2032
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:52.150
But then on top of that,
it's like,
God,

2033
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:55.430
don't you think the guy has suffered enough?
Like when,

2034
01:53:55.431 --> 01:53:57.230
when is he suffering enough?

2035
01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:00.680
You see this lack of empathy with people where they don't even want to respect

2036
01:54:00.681 --> 01:54:02.360
that he's a human being.
They don't,

2037
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:06.540
they don't want to appreciate any of his old work.
They don't want,

2038
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:12.010
they don't have anything that he could do that would make them just go,

2039
01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:15.670
all right,
well I know you're not going to do that again.
And uh,

2040
01:54:15.710 --> 01:54:19.790
you seem like a reasonable person.
It's like we look,
you can't be your past.

2041
01:54:19.791 --> 01:54:23.150
You're not the guy who shitting that sneaker,
right?
You're Joe list today.
Yeah.

2042
01:54:23.230 --> 01:54:27.170
Right.
Nobody wants to be remembered for the worst thing they did.
It's,

2043
01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:31.430
and it's,
I think it's just a thing where they know it's an easy target.

2044
01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:32.151
I really do.

2045
01:54:32.151 --> 01:54:35.570
I think at a certain point in time people just decide that this is a guy that

2046
01:54:35.571 --> 01:54:40.010
you can take a free shot at and you can shit on him and you can attribute things

2047
01:54:40.011 --> 01:54:42.170
to him that aren't true.
You can attribute,

2048
01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:45.980
attribute a bunch of things to him that are not accurate and it's easy like,

2049
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:49.490
like calling them outright or saying Lucy Kay,
showing his true colors.

2050
01:54:49.491 --> 01:54:53.550
Now Jesus Christ,
go back and watch his bit about hitting a deer.
Okay.

2051
01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:57.920
It's a fucking ridiculous,
really funny material.

2052
01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:01.730
And that's what I enjoyed about his act,
this,
that,

2053
01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.180
that bit if left alone,
I mean it's an out of his act now,

2054
01:55:05.181 --> 01:55:08.150
but if left alone in x amount of time,

2055
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:12.350
he would have crafted that into a great bit,
I'm sure of it.
Yeah,
I agree.

2056
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.861
And there was,

2057
01:55:12.861 --> 01:55:17.810
so there was a bunch of Shitty fucking halfass comics that came out and were

2058
01:55:17.811 --> 01:55:19.220
talking trash about it and I was like,

2059
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:22.730
you guys should shut the fuck up because this,

2060
01:55:22.731 --> 01:55:26.300
this whole art form is about trial and error.

2061
01:55:26.301 --> 01:55:28.930
This whole art form is about being able to war.

2062
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:33.200
It's one of the rare things that we need a crowd to in order to,

2063
01:55:33.201 --> 01:55:36.500
for these things to come alive.
We need it and you have to take chances.

2064
01:55:36.501 --> 01:55:38.130
I just thought,
ironically with Louie,
I wait,

2065
01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:43.130
we went and saw apocalypse now during the Tribeca film festival and a Francis

2066
01:55:43.130 --> 01:55:43.560
Ford Coppola there.

2067
01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:46.590
And he came out and he spoke about the film beforehand and after.

2068
01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:50.700
And Robert Duvall was also there and he came out and went,
Charlie don't surf.

2069
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:53.580
It was amazing and it was really unbelievable.

2070
01:55:53.581 --> 01:55:58.320
But a couple of was talking after the film and he was like,
I don't have,

2071
01:55:58.321 --> 01:55:59.790
you know,
the whole story about apocalypse now,

2072
01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:02.370
that documentary hearts of darkness,
which is amazing.

2073
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:06.960
And like he put like his house up for sale to like put everything on the line to

2074
01:56:06.961 --> 01:56:07.890
make the movie himself.

2075
01:56:08.190 --> 01:56:11.610
And he was just talking about you have to take chances with art.
He's like,

2076
01:56:11.611 --> 01:56:16.140
there's no art without taking big chances.
And,
uh,
I mean that's,

2077
01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:21.300
you're taking a chance by doing a joke.
I mean,
I wouldn't do a joke about,
uh,

2078
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:25.680
parkland shooting by wouldn't either,
but um,
but you know,
it's a,

2079
01:56:25.681 --> 01:56:30.480
it's a risk and it might go bad and it went well.
He got laughs,
got laughs.

2080
01:56:30.570 --> 01:56:34.950
Um,
but certainly if you take anything outside of,
um,
a comedy,

2081
01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.430
comedy club,
we put it out in the public.
It's not for those people,

2082
01:56:37.450 --> 01:56:38.850
for the people that bought the ticket.
Well,

2083
01:56:38.851 --> 01:56:42.720
it's also in context of the experience of being in a comedy club,

2084
01:56:42.721 --> 01:56:45.840
having a couple drinks of watching a hilarious guy talk some shit.

2085
01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:50.820
Especially a guy coming back after a national scandal worldwide.

2086
01:56:50.850 --> 01:56:54.300
Worldwide scandal.
Yes.
You know,
and it's just,
look,

2087
01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:57.060
I wouldn't joke around about them getting shot either,

2088
01:56:57.270 --> 01:57:01.680
but one of the things that made that bit work was that yes,

2089
01:57:01.710 --> 01:57:04.800
it was a horrible tragedy.
Yes.
Those kids went through that.
Yes,

2090
01:57:04.801 --> 01:57:05.910
they're teenagers.
Yes.

2091
01:57:06.210 --> 01:57:10.770
They're trying to figure out life and they're being interviewed on CNN and some

2092
01:57:10.771 --> 01:57:14.550
of them were changing their opinions and they're developing and growing as we

2093
01:57:14.551 --> 01:57:16.830
speak,
but like one of them,

2094
01:57:16.831 --> 01:57:21.270
like the David Hogg Guy broke fuck the Patriarchy on his Twitter the other day.

2095
01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:25.620
Like that was his tweet like,
and not even as a joke,
like that's an 18 year old.

2096
01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:30.230
That's what kids do.
They say silly shit.
That's why the bit worked.
Right.

2097
01:57:30.250 --> 01:57:32.580
He was like,
why are you interesting,
right?
I'm like,

2098
01:57:32.581 --> 01:57:34.200
why do I have to hear from you?

2099
01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:37.860
But well you have to hear from them because their friends got shot.
I mean,

2100
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:42.150
but no one obviously like that's not it.
This is not a conversation.

2101
01:57:42.210 --> 01:57:43.350
This is stand up comedy.

2102
01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:46.770
It's an art form and saying things that are funny that are fucked up,

2103
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:48.090
that's part of the art form.

2104
01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:53.230
And if you deny that just either that's not the kind of comedy you like or you

2105
01:57:53.431 --> 01:57:57.180
don't appreciate what comedy is.
Yeah,
and also it's a weird thing where I'm like,

2106
01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:59.970
I'm for those kids.
I'm like,
yeah,
it's great.

2107
01:57:59.971 --> 01:58:01.800
Like this horrible thing happened and you're like,

2108
01:58:01.801 --> 01:58:05.400
we're going to use what power we have.
I'm like,
I think that's great.
Yes.

2109
01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:07.770
And they might actually fucking do something.

2110
01:58:07.771 --> 01:58:09.900
I mean it's like they're making changes and I'm like,
Eh.

2111
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:12.330
It's like fucking power to the people.
God bless you.

2112
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:16.200
But I can still laugh at a joke about it.

2113
01:58:16.201 --> 01:58:18.670
It's still funny to me to see someone be like,
why are you in a suit?

2114
01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.520
You can both things can exist.

2115
01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.710
You can have empathy for murder victims and even be like rude and be like,
wow,

2116
01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:29.250
that's amazing what these kids are doing or these still people at job and still

2117
01:58:29.251 --> 01:58:33.810
be like,
ah.
It's funny.
It's funny.
It's not as best joke,

2118
01:58:33.811 --> 01:58:36.960
but this wasn't done.
You fucks.
And here's the other thing,
like,

2119
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:40.050
do you know Brian Holtzman is?
I don't think so.

2120
01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:41.950
Got to see him when you're in town if you can.

2121
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:45.820
<v 4>He's fucking hilarious.
He's legitimate maniac.</v>

2122
01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:47.710
He's a legend in Los Angeles.

2123
01:58:47.711 --> 01:58:50.710
Started when I started the comedy store in [inaudible] 94 he was already there

2124
01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:53.180
and really fucking funny.
But he had it.

2125
01:58:53.190 --> 01:58:55.270
You remember when Susan Smith drowned her kids at lady,

2126
01:58:55.271 --> 01:58:59.890
she pushed her fucking car into the river or something and drown her kids.
No,

2127
01:58:59.891 --> 01:59:04.030
but it sounds like he was on stage a very short amount of time afterwards going,

2128
01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:07.480
ladies,
gentlemen,
I heard those were bad kids.
He goes,

2129
01:59:07.481 --> 01:59:10.540
I heard they sat that close to the TV.
They never put away that blocks.

2130
01:59:10.690 --> 01:59:14.110
They always spilling the fucking milk was those kids will not be missed.
Yeah.

2131
01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:17.200
Had you were just like,
why it's not,

2132
01:59:17.201 --> 01:59:19.290
he didn't really think those are

2133
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:23.500
<v 3>bad kids.
It's a fucked up thing to say.
That happens to be funny.
Yeah.</v>

2134
01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:26.930
You might not be into that kind of humor.
That's okay.
Well.
That's part of,

2135
01:59:26.931 --> 01:59:29.750
I think what comedy is or has always been,

2136
01:59:29.751 --> 01:59:32.000
is saying a thing you're not supposed to say.
That's like,

2137
01:59:32.001 --> 01:59:34.490
to me the very idea of comedy.
Yes.

2138
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:39.240
Is you're saying abnormal things like you talking about coming in your own face

2139
01:59:39.241 --> 01:59:41.270
and whatever,
or someone coming in your friends.
Yeah.

2140
01:59:41.271 --> 01:59:44.150
You're not supposed to express your sexual desires so openly.

2141
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.730
It's not that you really mean that.
I do not so funny.
Right,

2142
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.240
right.
I think so

2143
01:59:51.250 --> 01:59:52.083
<v 4>can be funny.</v>

2144
01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:58.460
It's an art form that is often cited or quoted as if it's a statement,

2145
02:00:01.050 --> 02:00:03.680
you know,
like he said this like yet needed.

2146
02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:08.700
He said that on stage in a comedy club as a part of a big giant chunk about this

2147
02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:14.250
and you're taking out of context and you do it in the worst possible way.

2148
02:00:14.251 --> 02:00:16.770
You put it in print.
Of course it looks terrible.

2149
02:00:17.010 --> 02:00:19.650
Of course looks terrible in print because it's not in a comedy club and it's not

2150
02:00:19.651 --> 02:00:20.484
in context.

2151
02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:24.870
It's like that has no relationship to the actual bid itself.

2152
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:28.410
Your print version of it.
It's not,
it's a lie.

2153
02:00:28.411 --> 02:00:32.520
You should go to jail for saying that's the joke.
You're a liar.
You're a liar.

2154
02:00:32.521 --> 02:00:33.840
You're defaming someone.

2155
02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:37.230
You're taking what they're doing and you're pretending that what they were

2156
02:00:37.231 --> 02:00:40.530
saying is what they mean.
You know,
that's not what they mean.

2157
02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:44.520
<v 3>That's,
I don't care.
Remember that,
uh,
Lenny boots and that's in the movie Lenny,</v>

2158
02:00:44.521 --> 02:00:48.630
I think we talked about,
they were like reading his act.
Yes,
exactly.

2159
02:00:48.631 --> 02:00:49.590
You're not saying it right.

2160
02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:54.360
<v 4>Clean.
It's the same thing.
It's,
look,</v>

2161
02:00:56.490 --> 02:01:00.570
no one thinks school shootings are a good thing.
No one does.

2162
02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.470
No one does.
They,

2163
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:07.470
they're doing jokes about it because we know it's a horrible tragedy.

2164
02:01:07.650 --> 02:01:09.990
That's why jokes work and they don't,

2165
02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:12.900
they don't work because you're mean they don't work because you're horrible.

2166
02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.970
They work because everyone knows you're joking.

2167
02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:18.600
If everybody really thought you are a horrible person and you were happy that

2168
02:01:18.601 --> 02:01:21.450
people get shot,
they wouldn't laugh at a God damn thing.
He said,
right.

2169
02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:26.550
That's it's uh,
it's a fucking weird art form.

2170
02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:27.720
It's a weird art form.

2171
02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:32.760
And for it to be dismantled and disrespected the way it is where people are.

2172
02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.260
When people break down people's bits and,
and take them out of context like that,

2173
02:01:37.261 --> 02:01:37.800
it's,

2174
02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:42.200
it's so foolish and the fact that people don't stand up for it that are in the

2175
02:01:42.201 --> 02:01:47.150
art form itself,
that drives me fucking crazy.
It drove me angry.

2176
02:01:47.151 --> 02:01:49.610
These are a bunch of people that won't even talk to anymore.
I'm like,

2177
02:01:49.611 --> 02:01:52.070
I'm not talking to you anymore.
Like,
this is what you're going to do.

2178
02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:55.750
If I do a bit that's half cooked and then you're gonna talk shit about me.
Right?

2179
02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:58.580
Like this,
you're doing this for your own favor.

2180
02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:02.000
You're not doing this for the art form.
You're not doing,

2181
02:02:02.001 --> 02:02:03.410
you're not an empathetic person.
You know?

2182
02:02:03.570 --> 02:02:07.430
You don't looking at him as a human being saying,
well,
clearly the guy fucked up.

2183
02:02:07.431 --> 02:02:09.550
He made some mistakes.
Oh,
I bet it was okay,

2184
02:02:09.590 --> 02:02:13.220
but look that if you listen to that set,
that's a good set.

2185
02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:17.030
Especially for a guy who's been at a comedy for almost a fucking year,

2186
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:21.860
it's gotten a lot stronger.
I'm sure he's a hilarious comedian.
I mean,

2187
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:26.630
he's going to get to a point where he's got a real motherfucker have an hour and

2188
02:02:26.631 --> 02:02:29.840
then someone's going to have to figure out whether or not they're willing to

2189
02:02:29.841 --> 02:02:33.110
take a chance and put it on.
Well,
it's like you're talking about earlier too.

2190
02:02:33.111 --> 02:02:35.110
I mean,
you can also just put it on youtube.

2191
02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:39.260
There's website or youtube or witness.
I hope he does that.
You know,
I mean the,

2192
02:02:39.261 --> 02:02:41.240
it's this idea that you should be punished for eternity.

2193
02:02:41.241 --> 02:02:44.660
So like what do we Catholics,
like what's going on here?
Like what is this?

2194
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:47.420
Did you know?
What did he do?
I mean,

2195
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:50.690
he did something that caused one of crossing them $35 million.

2196
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:54.350
A massive public shame.
Still to this day,
more than,

2197
02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:59.750
it's almost like two years later.
Was it like a year and a half now?
November,

2198
02:02:59.750 --> 02:03:04.280
2017 yeah.
Let me,
what the fuck?
Like what do you want them to do?
You know,
I mean,

2199
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:07.690
we're not talking about Harvey Weinstein here and this idea that you're,

2200
02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:11.810
you know,
you're not even supposed to compare offenders.
You know,

2201
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:14.390
you're not supposed to make judgment calls.
Well of course you are.

2202
02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:17.660
That's why some people go to jail for life and some people go to jail for two

2203
02:03:17.661 --> 02:03:18.494
years.
And this is,

2204
02:03:18.650 --> 02:03:21.590
this is the reason why we have lessor punishments for lesser crimes.

2205
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:24.860
There's a system.
Yeah,
please.
If you ask people,

2206
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:26.780
if you can jerk off in front of him and they say no,

2207
02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:30.260
and you don't check off in front of them,
good for you.
You've got some restraint.

2208
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:34.100
If you ask people if you can jerk off in front of it and they say yes and you do

2209
02:03:34.101 --> 02:03:37.740
it,
look,
maybe it's a weird thing to do,
but you're,

2210
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:39.710
you're not bill Cosby okay.

2211
02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:43.490
To say that you're not supposed to make these comparisons and be like,

2212
02:03:43.491 --> 02:03:45.030
this is a loaded subject too,
right.

2213
02:03:45.031 --> 02:03:49.210
We were talking about this and I see you're nervous.
Oh yeah.
I'm terrified.
Um,

2214
02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:54.170
but yeah,
no,
I love Louie.
I love Louie too.
He's a great comic.
Yeah.

2215
02:03:54.171 --> 02:03:58.430
He's a great guy also.
But yeah,
I understand.
People are upset.
I get it,
I get it.

2216
02:03:58.431 --> 02:04:02.600
But I think it's disproportionate.
I really do.
You know,
I have a degree.

2217
02:04:02.630 --> 02:04:05.540
Agree wholeheartedly.
But yeah.
Um,

2218
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:09.800
how long do you think it's going to be before people just let it go?
Well,

2219
02:04:09.801 --> 02:04:11.990
I think,
I think there's actually,
um,

2220
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:14.300
the group of people that are really upset about it.

2221
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:19.580
I think it's probably like a quarter of a million people.
That's a lot of people.

2222
02:04:19.610 --> 02:04:23.330
It's a lot of people,
but there's like 300 million people in the country.

2223
02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:25.780
Maybe it's less than a quarter of a million.
It's,
I thought,

2224
02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:29.090
I think it's the minority.
So you think most people like,
ah,

2225
02:04:29.091 --> 02:04:31.040
he did something crazy.
But the other thing is like,

2226
02:04:31.041 --> 02:04:33.260
you want to kind of see the guy that jerked off in front of women,

2227
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:36.260
so people want to go see him.
I mean,
he's a great comic stuff,

2228
02:04:36.261 --> 02:04:38.040
but I mean the shows,
I mean

2229
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.590
<v 2>I,
I'll read Twitter and stuff.
I sometimes I'll go on to got,</v>

2230
02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.390
we'll hang out and I'll just search his name to see.

2231
02:04:42.570 --> 02:04:46.290
Like one time we went out to eat in New York and there was a kid,
you know,

2232
02:04:46.291 --> 02:04:49.350
like a hipstery.
It looks similar to me actually.
Um,

2233
02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:54.400
but like a young kid and he stopped and just like stared at us and was like I,

2234
02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:58.740
they started taking photos and then he left and then I looked up Louise name on

2235
02:04:58.741 --> 02:05:01.860
Twitter and I found the kid and he wrote just all caps.

2236
02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:05.790
Just gave Louis the finger,
which he didn't,
didn't give us the liquor areas.

2237
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.980
And then he wrote,
she's signaling and then he wrote attention.
Nyu students,

2238
02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:15.540
there's all caps.
Louis Ck is in the neighborhood.
Make him uncomfortable.

2239
02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:19.130
Exclamation point.
We were like,
that's like psychotic.
You're a,

2240
02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.160
but that's what I was talking

2241
02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:21.890
<v 1>come on earlier that I think he's a target.</v>

2242
02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:24.830
I think they just decided that this is what they're going to do now.

2243
02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:29.210
Like that guy was saying that he gave me the finger when he did and that's the

2244
02:05:29.211 --> 02:05:33.020
virtue signaling aspect of it is one of the weirdest parts about social media

2245
02:05:33.021 --> 02:05:37.670
because it's people that ordinarily,
like in a,
in a real world scenario,

2246
02:05:37.671 --> 02:05:40.820
you have an opportunity to say something if you really feel so compelled to guys

2247
02:05:40.821 --> 02:05:42.260
right in front of you,
you don't say shit.

2248
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:45.270
And then you get online and tell other people to do it right.

2249
02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:47.030
Other people to make them uncomfortable.

2250
02:05:47.130 --> 02:05:50.760
<v 2>Well,
for the most part,
yeah,
we'll,
we'll go around and it is,
everything is,</v>

2251
02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:52.050
it's the weird thing about online,

2252
02:05:52.051 --> 02:05:54.960
most people are much different in person cause you realize it's a human being.

2253
02:05:54.961 --> 02:05:58.800
I think the natural thing is like,
oh,
this is a person.
Exactly.
And then,
you know,

2254
02:05:58.801 --> 02:06:03.000
we'll go to like these kinds of hipstery coffee shops where you think that that

2255
02:06:03.001 --> 02:06:06.390
kind of person would be.
And he goes,
hi,
how are you?
Can I get a,
uh,
cotton?

2256
02:06:06.391 --> 02:06:08.840
They go,
oh sure.
Yeah,
that nobody,
I mean,

2257
02:06:08.841 --> 02:06:10.870
people would get dirty looks and stuff here on their books.

2258
02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:15.120
Well that's way more online than,
than not online.
But that's a shows.

2259
02:06:15.121 --> 02:06:19.820
All the shows are all selling out and there's a few people outside.
Um,

2260
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:22.320
has he ever talked to those people outside or does he just get in?
No,

2261
02:06:22.321 --> 02:06:24.920
I don't think so.
How does he get in this kind of a backdoor?

2262
02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:29.910
We just went in the back and,
um,
you know,
good for them.

2263
02:06:29.911 --> 02:06:32.820
I think that they're misguided.
Like you said,

2264
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:33.780
<v 1>but yeah,
I,</v>

2265
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:38.990
I think they want him to be this evil person they should be protesting against.

2266
02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:43.490
But I think if you look at it on paper,
what he did was just not good.
It's like,

2267
02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:44.780
it's,
it's,
you know,

2268
02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:48.980
the worst that I had heard was that some people's careers it suffered because

2269
02:06:48.981 --> 02:06:51.320
they were talking about it right.
At someone.

2270
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:54.830
But I don't know how much of that is accurate.
I know.
I,

2271
02:06:54.850 --> 02:06:56.300
I'd need to find out about that.

2272
02:06:56.370 --> 02:06:58.210
<v 2>Yeah,
I don't,
I don't know either.
I don't know the whole thing,</v>

2273
02:06:58.430 --> 02:07:02.320
but I always feel like I love Louis.
He's one of my best friends now.
Uh,

2274
02:07:02.370 --> 02:07:04.320
which is weird to say,
but,
uh,
we're close.

2275
02:07:04.530 --> 02:07:07.410
But I don't really begrudge the women,

2276
02:07:07.411 --> 02:07:10.830
I think that two different people can have the same experience and take

2277
02:07:10.831 --> 02:07:15.090
different things from it feel different ways.
That's true.
And I understand.
Um,

2278
02:07:15.630 --> 02:07:16.830
sexuality is weird.

2279
02:07:16.831 --> 02:07:20.730
So like they could in the moment and his perception might be where they said
yes.

2280
02:07:20.731 --> 02:07:23.760
And I think he kind of talks about this a little bit on state and I don't want

2281
02:07:23.761 --> 02:07:26.010
to tell his feelings,
different stories to tell,

2282
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:30.130
but I think one person can be like,
I thought they were into it.

2283
02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:33.030
I thought they were saying yes and they're into it and those women can say,

2284
02:07:33.930 --> 02:07:36.070
can feel,
yeah,
we kind of said

2285
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:36.311
<v 0>yes,</v>

2286
02:07:36.311 --> 02:07:39.640
but we felt fucked up and pressured to people can have the same experience and

2287
02:07:39.641 --> 02:07:41.710
have different perspectives.
So I don't of course,

2288
02:07:42.070 --> 02:07:44.560
but grudge any of the women I understand that they are um,

2289
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:49.960
hurt and feel mistreated that say yes,
you're still,

2290
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:52.830
and you see something you didn't want to see like whoa.

2291
02:07:52.930 --> 02:07:56.890
And then you can never unsee it.
Yeah.
It's like it's in your head.
Yeah,

2292
02:07:56.891 --> 02:08:01.660
I understand they're affected by it,
but um,
jerk off in front of,
you know,

2293
02:08:01.661 --> 02:08:06.610
I keep asking,
I'll do it.
No,
no.
I asked him to come [inaudible] to ask first.

2294
02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:08.920
Maybe that's his thing.
Bob,
maybe I initially I blew it.

2295
02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:11.020
Maybe you have to like pretty shy.
Yeah.
It's like,

2296
02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.930
you know what I would hate if you jerked off in front of me.
So like drop pins.

2297
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:17.080
Yeah.
Maybe I will.
But he's a,
but he's a,
he's a,

2298
02:08:17.081 --> 02:08:21.820
he's a good person and I'm a great dad and I,
I love him.
I love the guy.
Yeah.

2299
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:24.040
Everybody wants to erase everything he's ever done.

2300
02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:28.690
It's so like they'll didn't FX,
like not just cancel it,

2301
02:08:28.691 --> 02:08:33.010
but they made the show unavailable.
Yeah.
I think you can get on iTunes,
but yeah,

2302
02:08:33.011 --> 02:08:37.960
it's done.
And then,
um,
I think he's still on Netflix though.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.

2303
02:08:37.961 --> 02:08:40.840
You could still see,
but they canceled the new one that he was gonna do.

2304
02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:46.340
And then pets too.
Uh,
they tried,
they got rid of them.
Yeah.
So it was a,

2305
02:08:46.341 --> 02:08:49.450
it was a bummer,
but it's weird.
But people,
I mean,

2306
02:08:49.451 --> 02:08:53.080
shouldn't we be empathetic to all people?
Yes.

2307
02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.830
I think we should.
And I think,
you know,

2308
02:08:56.831 --> 02:09:01.630
maybe it would serve him if he went out and talked about it extensively,

2309
02:09:01.631 --> 02:09:05.400
like had a conversation about like maybe videotaped it or something.

2310
02:09:05.490 --> 02:09:09.880
I don't know if people had his take on it other than that little letter that he

2311
02:09:09.881 --> 02:09:12.790
wrote right after adapting.
Yeah.
Maybe that would help.
Yeah.

2312
02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.170
Which I thought was a good,
um,
apologetic,
good statement.
I thought,

2313
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:18.183
yeah,

2314
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:23.380
some people will never be happy and some people were happy with it and some

2315
02:09:23.381 --> 02:09:26.980
people just felt like it wasn't enough that,
you know,
he didn't specifically say,

2316
02:09:26.981 --> 02:09:30.100
I am sorry.
You know,
I feel horrible.
I'm sorry I did this.

2317
02:09:30.101 --> 02:09:34.630
He basically said he did it and those stories are true and that he fucked up and

2318
02:09:34.631 --> 02:09:39.490
he thought that they,
you know,
he thought that by them saying yes,

2319
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:43.510
that that was okay.
But meanwhile he took advantage of the fact they admired him.

2320
02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:48.520
Yeah.
And he's very,
yeah,
he expressed regret.
People are like,
but like you said,

2321
02:09:48.521 --> 02:09:50.530
just going,
people are going to be unhappy no matter no matter what.

2322
02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:53.080
No matter what.
Even if he said,
I am sorry,
that's not good enough.

2323
02:09:53.081 --> 02:09:55.780
You're only sorry cause you got caught.
Like people,
they're always going to have,

2324
02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:59.710
there's some people that are just not empathetic.
And,
um,

2325
02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:06.630
this is what I really got very angry about with the,
the,

2326
02:10:06.631 --> 02:10:09.820
the leak of the recording.
I'm like,
yeah,
it's not as best material.

2327
02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:13.090
Of course it's not,
he hasn't done comedy in 10 months.

2328
02:10:13.091 --> 02:10:15.900
Like when I was hearing it from other Comedians,
I'm like,
do you,
how do you,

2329
02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:18.820
how do you do this?
Right.
Don't you do the same thing we do?

2330
02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:23.680
Like what are you doing?
He's a fucking person.

2331
02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:24.820
He's a human being.

2332
02:10:25.170 --> 02:10:29.950
He's a year and a half of him being stared at everywhere he goes.

2333
02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:34.070
Yeah.
And fucked with he gets it and losing friends.
Yes.

2334
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:38.960
<v 4>I'm sure.
Yeah.
But he,
those friends,
if he lost some friends,</v>

2335
02:10:38.961 --> 02:10:43.490
he's better off if he lost friends because of that.
Like if that was Ari,

2336
02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:44.510
I would call them up.

2337
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.240
Like if there was a New York Times article about Ari jerking off in front of

2338
02:10:47.241 --> 02:10:50.810
people,
I be like,
Bro,
I'm a little hurt.
You never jerked off in front of me.

2339
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:54.550
Like I feel like I wouldn't,
I would if he's like,
I fucked up.
Like,

2340
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:58.040
I've had conversations with Ari about things where,
you know,
he's like,
oh,

2341
02:10:58.041 --> 02:11:01.250
I fucked up.
I shouldn't have done that.
It was a bitch move.
Like he'll tell you.

2342
02:11:01.290 --> 02:11:05.780
Yeah.
You know,
like you can't do anything once you're my friend.

2343
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:09.230
Like let's hear out there murdering kids or something or doing something really

2344
02:11:09.231 --> 02:11:13.370
fucked up or actually raping someone.
Any friends that Louie loss for that,
like,

2345
02:11:13.371 --> 02:11:16.580
come on man.
What did you think?

2346
02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:20.300
Did you think it was a perfect person?
He's a nut.
He's a maniac.

2347
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:25.130
Goddamn professional comedian.
Right,
right.
You know?
Yeah.
We're flawed people.

2348
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:27.770
Yeah.
That's how it all comes out.
Good.

2349
02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:33.460
It's like there's gotta be something fucked up about your head where you can

2350
02:11:33.530 --> 02:11:34.880
come up with these.

2351
02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:39.200
And the another one that drives me crazy is these guys who,

2352
02:11:39.201 --> 02:11:43.970
you know are freaks and they're out of their fucking mind offstage,
but onstage,

2353
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.570
they have like sort of a more squeaky clean thing and their public thing is more

2354
02:11:47.571 --> 02:11:50.840
squeaky clean and they're judgemental about it and like,
oh my God,

2355
02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:54.140
like please stop.
You're fucking crazy as anybody.

2356
02:11:54.141 --> 02:11:57.050
You just have a good squeaky clean act.
So shut your hole.

2357
02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:01.170
<v 0>Yeah.
Sometimes I think the people with the cleanest acts of the wildest animals,</v>

2358
02:12:01.410 --> 02:12:05.550
it's often the case.
Yeah.
It's often the case.
Yeah.
Which is fine man.

2359
02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:08.520
Like perfect example is Brian Regan in a good way.

2360
02:12:08.850 --> 02:12:13.500
He is so fucking funny and so clean.

2361
02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:16.770
The funniest you go.
This guy's gotta be fucked up.

2362
02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:19.650
There's gotta be something wrong with you.
Nothing.
Hang out with them.

2363
02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:24.150
Super normal friendly guy.
Nice to everybody.
Great Guy.
The nicest guy.

2364
02:12:24.330 --> 02:12:27.180
Why is in your dungeon,
sir?
What time?

2365
02:12:27.181 --> 02:12:30.030
We were hanging out and he was smoking a cigar and I thought it'd be funny to

2366
02:12:30.031 --> 02:12:32.700
say,
Hey,
can I get a little bit of that Ciga?
Cause it's such a ridiculous,

2367
02:12:32.730 --> 02:12:34.920
and he was like,
oh sure.
And I was like,
what?
No,
I'm kidding.

2368
02:12:35.490 --> 02:12:37.530
I wouldn't put my mouth on yours.
The car.

2369
02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:41.780
But you didn't want to do with the joint,
which I thought was strange too.

2370
02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:44.970
And a blunt.
You do it with a blunt,
which is kind of half joking,
half cigar.
Yeah.

2371
02:12:44.971 --> 02:12:48.240
Maybe.
Actually I'm the asshole in this story.
Maybe he's not even that Nice.

2372
02:12:48.241 --> 02:12:49.310
That's just a normal,
no,

2373
02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:53.190
that is a weird thing to ask a cigar feels very personal to too.
And you're like,

2374
02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:57.870
it's yours for like an hour.
Exactly.
It's just kind of a quick,
well,
yeah,

2375
02:12:57.871 --> 02:13:01.410
joints to hits.
Like if you have a whole joint yourself,
you're greedy.
Yeah.

2376
02:13:01.590 --> 02:13:01.951
There's also,

2377
02:13:01.951 --> 02:13:05.250
there's like a camaraderie thing that comes from smoking joints together.
Yeah.

2378
02:13:06.630 --> 02:13:11.250
Yeah.
I'll do it.
I'm back.
Ready?
I've got some right here.
It's all over the place.

2379
02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:14.220
This is all filled with,
we'd see that chest over there.

2380
02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:18.000
That's a full chest filled with weed.
Wow.
Isn't that a,

2381
02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:21.270
can you get in trouble for that?
No,
it's legal,
but with that much,

2382
02:13:21.271 --> 02:13:25.500
couldn't they get you for intent to distribute or something?
No,
it's legal here.

2383
02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:29.520
Really?
You can just the case.
Yeah.
Marijuana is legal,
but like guns are illegal,

2384
02:13:29.521 --> 02:13:31.980
but that guy had a thousand.
They guy had illegal

2385
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.390
<v 2>sales.
He was selling.
I gotcha.
I see.
They got tipped off that he was a dealer.</v>

2386
02:13:36.391 --> 02:13:40.350
He's probably selling it to gang members and drug dealers and such.
Oh No.

2387
02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:44.970
Oh by [inaudible] do you think about having just a little weed,
just a little,

2388
02:13:46.070 --> 02:13:47.580
just a little touch touch,

2389
02:13:47.581 --> 02:13:50.610
but would you just go start shooting heroin like immediately?

2390
02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:53.100
I don't think I would do that,
but I don't,
uh,

2391
02:13:53.101 --> 02:13:57.630
I don't think weed does not as much,
um,
excite me or anything.

2392
02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:02.130
What does drinking?
Yeah,
I mean I love Drake shot drink.
I mean,
uh,

2393
02:14:02.131 --> 02:14:05.140
I drank,
I mean I still,
I joke about it like I love,
uh,

2394
02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:09.750
my sobriety but like one and a half Vicodin and three beer was like the best

2395
02:14:09.751 --> 02:14:14.370
I've ever felt in my life.
Yeah.
And like a cigar.
What time I went to Baghdad?

2396
02:14:14.371 --> 02:14:18.810
I did like a USO thing with they park Etsy.
Um,
and uh,

2397
02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:22.920
we had like,
we bought Cubans and I had some bike.
I took like a Vicodin.

2398
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:26.230
I don't know if he did.
I don't want to,
I don't think he did a,

2399
02:14:26.250 --> 02:14:28.290
but I had like a Vicodin and we had a couple beers and a cigarette.

2400
02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:31.620
We were at Saddam Hussein's palace in the moment.
I was like,

2401
02:14:31.710 --> 02:14:35.430
this is the best I've ever felt.
Did you do stand up over there?
Yeah.

2402
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:38.010
What is it like doing stand up for the troops over there?
It was fine.

2403
02:14:38.011 --> 02:14:38.350
It was amazing.

2404
02:14:38.350 --> 02:14:42.280
I was the most grateful audience there was like so nice and kind and uh,

2405
02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:43.140
it was really cool.

2406
02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:47.140
I mean some of it suck cause some of it was like two in the afternoon and uh,

2407
02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:51.000
there's like 12 guys.
It's fucking 100 degrees.
They're holding rifles being like,

2408
02:14:51.001 --> 02:14:54.570
what the fuck is this?
That was the show.
A couple of them.
Yeah.
Some of them,

2409
02:14:54.571 --> 02:14:58.200
some of them were like the ones in Kuwait or better cause that was like not a

2410
02:14:58.201 --> 02:15:01.650
war zone.
Um,
and you're on a base and they be like a hundred people,

2411
02:15:01.651 --> 02:15:04.890
but some of them were like just in the middle of like 11 o'clock in the morning

2412
02:15:05.550 --> 02:15:09.180
in the middle of fucking Baghdad.
Wow.
Uh,
but it was pretty amazing.

2413
02:15:09.181 --> 02:15:13.170
Like we got to a fly on these black hawks and we were in Baghdad.
We went by the,

2414
02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:17.610
those cross swords and stuff where uh,
the statute was pulled down and shit.

2415
02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:19.920
What did you do when you were in Saddam Hussein's palace?

2416
02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:24.120
That became like an American base.
We stayed there.
Wow.
Yeah.

2417
02:15:24.121 --> 02:15:27.570
It's kind of stayed in Saddam Hussein's palace.
Yeah.
It's pretty true.

2418
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.640
Profits on the same spot.
I don't think I did.

2419
02:15:29.641 --> 02:15:33.810
I think Nate and I shared a room and uh,
I asked and he said no,
I would have to,

2420
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:36.330
uh,
I think I'd feel compelled.
I'd be like,
Bro,

2421
02:15:36.331 --> 02:15:38.940
you're going to have to leave the room.
I got a,
I got a goal.

2422
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.270
I got to check something off the list.
It's,
it's a bizarre feeling because,

2423
02:15:42.271 --> 02:15:44.720
you know,
we'd like,
it was like,
um,
yeah,

2424
02:15:44.730 --> 02:15:47.580
we took over and then just made this palace into him pace and it's like a

2425
02:15:47.581 --> 02:15:50.850
driving range.
She can like hit until like his prayer pond or whatever.

2426
02:15:51.490 --> 02:15:53.390
Whatever the fuck it is.
Like reflection pool.

2427
02:15:53.410 --> 02:15:56.310
You got pray upon fill with golf balls.
Yeah.
That's lately.

2428
02:15:56.820 --> 02:16:00.150
And they sell Cubans in like the lobby America.
Yeah.

2429
02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:04.230
Where some where we're particularly our fucking something.
Yeah.
Um,
but no,

2430
02:16:04.231 --> 02:16:07.860
it was amazing.
It was awesome.
One time we were on the Black Hawk helicopter.

2431
02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:11.280
They shoot flares out for whatever.
I can't remember why on every flight,

2432
02:16:11.281 --> 02:16:13.920
but they didn't tell us that.
So all of a sudden you just hear like,

2433
02:16:15.170 --> 02:16:17.880
and you feel the heat.
And I thought we were in a fucking battle.

2434
02:16:18.230 --> 02:16:20.520
Like I almost shit my,
like it felt like,
you know,

2435
02:16:20.521 --> 02:16:22.140
when you don't have to shit and all of a sudden you're like,

2436
02:16:22.141 --> 02:16:23.580
this is shit I could shit right now.

2437
02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:27.120
It was that feeling your body tries to evacuate anything in there because it

2438
02:16:27.121 --> 02:16:29.990
thinks it's in danger.
Yeah.
So like with Spiel,
want to be able to run with.

2439
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:32.990
<v 1>Yeah.
When you get really nervous like that,</v>

2440
02:16:33.170 --> 02:16:34.880
you immediately have to piss and shit.
Yeah.

2441
02:16:34.881 --> 02:16:37.810
I just took a huge hit right before this show.
Did you use the,
uh,

2442
02:16:37.811 --> 02:16:40.670
the little buttons on the toilet that shoot water up your asshole?

2443
02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:43.120
It wasn't here.
I was afraid you'd beat me up if I shit.

2444
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:46.610
So it was that the Starbuck who did do that?
James Brown.
When you,

2445
02:16:46.730 --> 02:16:51.500
that's one of the ways he got arrested.
He shot at someone who,
uh,
uses toilet.

2446
02:16:52.130 --> 02:16:56.420
Oh Wow.
Shoot out with the cops.
And I wish there's a picture of him,

2447
02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:59.750
his mugshot right out there,
and it was from that arrest.

2448
02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:03.770
<v 3>Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I should,
at Starbucks,</v>

2449
02:17:03.771 --> 02:17:06.950
I was at the Starbucks across the street by the way,
and homeless cooties.

2450
02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:10.040
I was in line and like,
uh,
a dude,

2451
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:15.070
a white dude with a skateboard just cut in front of me in the lines.

2452
02:17:15.170 --> 02:17:19.670
Very bizarre.
And I said,
what I'm in,
I'm in the,
I'm next.
And he's like,

2453
02:17:19.671 --> 02:17:24.260
can I just buy some gum?
He was buying Starbucks gum,
which is already a red flag.

2454
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:27.840
And I was like,
I guess,
I mean,
it was in la.
He's like,
um,

2455
02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:30.800
I didn't even work in five minutes.
Wow.
What a Dick.

2456
02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:34.600
I didn't know you could do that.
You can't do that.
I was like,
all right.

2457
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:37.760
I don't have to be anyway.
Talk to you like that.
That was early.
But yeah,

2458
02:17:37.761 --> 02:17:41.300
he looked at me like I was an asshole.
He's a Dick.
And I was like,

2459
02:17:41.301 --> 02:17:42.650
maybe you shouldn't be buying gum.
Awesome.

2460
02:17:42.651 --> 02:17:45.210
Maybe you might want to find a different means of transportation than a

2461
02:17:45.211 --> 02:17:48.260
skateboard.
Yeah.
You late.
Fuck.
Yeah.
You fucking late loser.

2462
02:17:48.310 --> 02:17:50.980
<v 1>I'm going to be at work in five minutes and I need gum.
What do you do?</v>

2463
02:17:50.981 --> 02:17:54.290
Do you talk close for a living?
Yeah.
You fucking jerk if you're listing off.

2464
02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:56.800
He probably listened to.
He doesn't Mcdonald's.
He didn't know where I was going.

2465
02:17:56.810 --> 02:17:59.080
Didn't know.
He's probably like,
I'm so sorry bro.

2466
02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:01.930
I didn't want to get knocked at work.

2467
02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:07.600
<v 3>We gonna get in trouble man.
Yeah,
I hate that was the last time you had a job?</v>

2468
02:18:08.890 --> 02:18:13.120
Um,
2007 which do,
I worked at Sears.

2469
02:18:13.121 --> 02:18:17.110
I did loss prevention.
It was amazing.
It was one of the best day jobs ever.

2470
02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:19.000
Really?
Well my cousin was the boss,

2471
02:18:19.001 --> 02:18:23.140
which helped and he let me work from 10 to six,
which is great comedy hours.

2472
02:18:23.890 --> 02:18:27.850
And then we were like playing closed,
I guess.
Just uh,
oh,

2473
02:18:27.851 --> 02:18:29.890
so you just walked around and busted people stealing?
Yeah,

2474
02:18:29.891 --> 02:18:32.230
it had like a little radio on the,
uh,
the belt.

2475
02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:36.490
And then we had a crazy camera system for 2007 like it was at like,

2476
02:18:36.510 --> 02:18:39.810
I think we had 82 cameras and you could zoom and shit.

2477
02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:41.020
And you just watch people the whole day,

2478
02:18:41.021 --> 02:18:43.340
and then you'd walk around the store and be like,
we've got,

2479
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:47.440
have to keep an eye on the camera.
11.
Let's see,
like a secret agent.
It was fun.

2480
02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:51.010
It was really fun.
And we got to stop shop lifters and shit.
It was amazing.

2481
02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:54.160
I miss,
I actually miss it.
It was really fun.

2482
02:18:55.930 --> 02:19:00.640
<v 1>I used to work for a private investigator and a similar,
yeah,
it was,</v>

2483
02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:04.780
it actually turned out,
it was one of those people where you meet and you go,

2484
02:19:04.810 --> 02:19:07.840
this guy should be comedian.
He was hilarious.
His name's Dave Dolan.

2485
02:19:07.841 --> 02:19:10.390
He's dead now.
And,
uh,
I keep a,

2486
02:19:10.391 --> 02:19:13.630
a voicemail message from him just because he was such,

2487
02:19:14.350 --> 02:19:17.440
he was such a character who was just such a fucking character.

2488
02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:22.260
And he was hilarious.
And he got a Dui and a,

2489
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:25.090
they took away his license and what he really needed was not an assistant and

2490
02:19:25.091 --> 02:19:30.050
you needed a driver.
So I decided a good,
have a good driver's license.
So,

2491
02:19:30.051 --> 02:19:33.940
uh,
but I was working as an assistant and then we became friends and we bused

2492
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:37.880
people,
mostly people that were stealing,
uh,
insurance money.

2493
02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:41.750
They were like doing things like pretending they were injured and they take

2494
02:19:41.751 --> 02:19:44.290
another job on the side and then we'd catch him.

2495
02:19:44.310 --> 02:19:46.340
We'd have to get there at like five o'clock in the morning and wait for them to

2496
02:19:46.341 --> 02:19:48.890
get up and go to work and then follow them,
take pictures of them and shit.

2497
02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:51.320
That's fun.
It was fun Gig.
Yeah,
it was fine.

2498
02:19:51.321 --> 02:19:55.670
It was real fun too because he was actually cousins with bill downs who was one

2499
02:19:55.671 --> 02:19:58.580
of the owners of the comedy connection.
Nobody downs.
That's it.

2500
02:19:59.460 --> 02:20:04.280
Worked for that guy.
A couple of tap me too many times.
And uh,
uh,
that was,

2501
02:20:04.281 --> 02:20:07.010
Dave was his cousin,
so it was like just dumb luck.

2502
02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:10.130
I became friends with this guy,

2503
02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:13.450
but from driving him around and his cousin was the god,

2504
02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:16.220
one of the guys that own the comedy connection.
Wow.
Yeah.

2505
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:18.620
<v 3>I loved working at Sears.
It was fun.</v>

2506
02:20:18.621 --> 02:20:21.620
I feel like Canadians are actually good at that job because we're aware and

2507
02:20:21.621 --> 02:20:22.910
we're doing a lot of judging anyways.

2508
02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:24.560
You want you to like an audience come in and you're like,

2509
02:20:24.561 --> 02:20:27.410
that guy's gonna hate me.
This woman's too drunk,
that guy's fat.

2510
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:31.070
And I think it's similar to a shoplifter.
He like,
something's up with this guy.

2511
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.720
What's also

2512
02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:36.040
<v 1>you like?
It sounds like a job that doesn't suck.
Like you can wander around.</v>

2513
02:20:36.041 --> 02:20:37.450
No one's telling you what to do.

2514
02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:40.690
It's not like you're stuck at a fucking desk going over stupid numbers or

2515
02:20:40.691 --> 02:20:42.130
something you don't give a fuck about.

2516
02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:44.270
<v 3>Yeah.
And it's low maintenance physically.</v>

2517
02:20:44.271 --> 02:20:47.510
I know guys in New York that are like movers for their day job and I'm like,

2518
02:20:47.511 --> 02:20:49.880
you can't have a fucking manual labor job.

2519
02:20:50.090 --> 02:20:52.520
Like you get up and you're carrying couches.

2520
02:20:52.521 --> 02:20:55.980
Like you're not gonna hit an open mic at 8:00 PM is going to be exhausted.
Yeah.

2521
02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:58.250
But I loved it.
And having your cousins,
the boss is great.

2522
02:20:58.370 --> 02:21:02.600
I streaked through a series at the,
my last day.
You took your clothes off?
I,
yeah.

2523
02:21:02.601 --> 02:21:04.340
We decided,
well I didn't want to,

2524
02:21:04.341 --> 02:21:06.320
I couldn't go naked cause it's like a sex crime.

2525
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:10.100
So I covered my face with a brown paper Bag and bought like a candy thong

2526
02:21:10.101 --> 02:21:12.650
necklace at the spark candidates on a necklace.

2527
02:21:12.651 --> 02:21:16.670
It's a candy Thong at Spencer's gifts.
No War that I got videos,
my fund,

2528
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:18.770
my buddy just sent it to me.
I hadn't seen it in like 12 years.

2529
02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:22.850
It's a sex crime if you take your clothes off.
Yeah.
If you run through naked.

2530
02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:26.960
Yeah.
Hilarious.
That's a sex crime.
So I was like,
I better have no clothes on.

2531
02:21:26.961 --> 02:21:31.250
Which is how you are naturally when you're born,
you are walking sex crime.

2532
02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:34.340
I get it.
You can't have people running around naked in a storm in it.

2533
02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:36.830
Wait a minute,
but why not?

2534
02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:41.060
What is the problem from living in a society,
Joe,

2535
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:45.230
if a woman walked through restore naked,
do you think she should go to jail?

2536
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:49.010
I don't think she,
I should think,
I would assume she has mental problems.

2537
02:21:49.011 --> 02:21:52.070
I think she just likes to be naked.
If a,
if a gal

2538
02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:55.330
<v 1>goes through a place like,
uh,
maybe you're a target and some,</v>

2539
02:21:55.390 --> 02:21:59.620
some gouts I just take off her clothes and walk as far as she can through target

2540
02:21:59.621 --> 02:22:00.454
before they arrest her.

2541
02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:03.560
[inaudible] are you in support of her being arrested and taken to it

2542
02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:07.950
<v 3>a jail and hit with a sex crime?
No,
I'm not in support of that,
but I,</v>

2543
02:22:07.951 --> 02:22:11.250
there's a lot of things that rules and laws that I'm not in supportive that it

2544
02:22:11.251 --> 02:22:15.390
seems like it's okay if a guy gets arrested doing that.
Well,

2545
02:22:15.391 --> 02:22:17.190
it depends on what he's doing I suppose.

2546
02:22:17.191 --> 02:22:19.920
So I feel if a guy's running around naked,

2547
02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:23.160
if you just running and jogging flopping around inside target,

2548
02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:25.890
that guy's a criminal.
I don't need to see

2549
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:28.950
<v 0>is he hard or not?
It's a good question.
It's very interesting.</v>

2550
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:32.310
Is the harboring criminals.
Yeah.
If he's hard,
he goes straight to jail.

2551
02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:37.400
Well that's like a right to the electric chair with particular sexual cock.

2552
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:39.870
They,
yeah,
it's electric condom.

2553
02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:44.430
What if he's got all his clothes on except for his cock and balls and he's just,

2554
02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:48.380
he's just riding out,
you know,
he's got a just coming out of the,
uh,
in,

2555
02:22:48.390 --> 02:22:50.910
in a rural,
in San Francisco,
like you can walk around naked.

2556
02:22:50.911 --> 02:22:54.750
You just can't have a hard on.
Is that true?
Really?
That's fine.
I just heard,
uh,

2557
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:56.490
Brian Callan say that.

2558
02:22:56.610 --> 02:23:00.300
Why don't you Google that Google that we need to find out this true in New York.

2559
02:23:00.301 --> 02:23:02.610
I know in the park you can be naked.
I think naked.

2560
02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:05.190
I can walk around topless Taco.
I've seen a couple of women,

2561
02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:08.670
women are allowed to go topless because men used to be able to go top.
Well,

2562
02:23:08.671 --> 02:23:12.210
men could go topless forever,
but there was a rule that said the women couldn't.

2563
02:23:12.211 --> 02:23:14.070
And women are like,
well this is bullshit.
And they're right.

2564
02:23:14.071 --> 02:23:16.650
And I think a lot of them didn't even want to be topless.
Right?

2565
02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:19.850
But they were like,
well,
this is fucked up.
People telling us that our nip,

2566
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:20.850
like Sarah Silverman,

2567
02:23:21.090 --> 02:23:25.170
Sarah Silverman just posted on Instagram of a photo of her mirror,

2568
02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:27.630
like her bathroom mirror.
And you can see your tits in the mirror.

2569
02:23:28.050 --> 02:23:30.600
She did it on purpose to like make a point.
Like why,

2570
02:23:30.690 --> 02:23:32.960
first of all she did it because she has great tits.
Okay.

2571
02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:35.550
She wanted everybody to see your grade tests.
They're pretty fantastic.

2572
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:40.410
I missed it.
I'm bummed.
But also like,
why is it okay if you could see my tits?

2573
02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:43.410
Why is it okay to see my nipples?
But you can't see her nipples.

2574
02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:48.120
Like what do we babies?
I agree.
That's free.
The nipple.
I'm for it.

2575
02:23:48.210 --> 02:23:52.560
Instagram is really hardcore on that.
But Twitter,
you can do porn.

2576
02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:56.760
Yeah,
they'll have porn on fucking Twitter.
There's porn olds.
I fall porn stars.

2577
02:23:56.761 --> 02:24:00.750
They watch them.
Fuck.
Maybe that's important.
You think so?
Yeah.
Why not?

2578
02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:05.790
I got a dick.
You do have a deck.
It's right here.
Yeah,
it's nice.

2579
02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:10.290
Do you think that uh,
you should be arrested if you just walk around naked?

2580
02:24:11.310 --> 02:24:16.020
Um,
if I was making the rules,
I don't know.
It's hard because it's,

2581
02:24:16.021 --> 02:24:20.170
uh,
it's all on what you do with it if you'll rub it on people.
Yeah.
Yes sir.

2582
02:24:20.290 --> 02:24:24.570
That's walk around naked and kids kids point at you and laugh and you go,
Huh.

2583
02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:25.570
That's the thing.
It depends.

2584
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:28.530
There should be a delt areas where you can walk around naked.

2585
02:24:28.531 --> 02:24:33.210
I think like a nude beach.
Yes.
They have those,
have those but arrested.

2586
02:24:33.211 --> 02:24:37.080
I don't know.
I would just assume someone is a little off mentally.
Exactly.

2587
02:24:37.081 --> 02:24:41.430
Walking around naked or are um,
societal Terry,

2588
02:24:41.730 --> 02:24:46.440
uh,
norms and forth since I don't think so.
That sounds like a guy.

2589
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.160
Society Terry.
Like a horse that wins the Kentucky Derby.

2590
02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:55.560
It says that they changed the public nudity law and San Francisco and like 23rd,

2591
02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:00.330
19,
I think.
But we were there when you shot your special,

2592
02:25:00.331 --> 02:25:04.650
and I'm 100% I was at the top of Lombard Street and there was a large gathering

2593
02:25:04.651 --> 02:25:08.760
of naked people,
so I don't know what the fuck that was about nonsense.

2594
02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:10.830
So that was,
they didn't get it stopped.
There's cops right there.

2595
02:25:10.831 --> 02:25:12.780
They didn't stop him from doing anything.
I pictures of it.

2596
02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:15.420
So I don't know what that was about.
What are we going to do?

2597
02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:18.510
I've got to wrap this up,
Joe.
Last.
You're funny,
motherfucker.

2598
02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:21.780
Thanks for having appreciate.
Comedy is very funny.
I hope it was okay.

2599
02:25:21.970 --> 02:25:25.540
You were great.
And people see your Netflix special.
Uh,
it's available.

2600
02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:28.240
And comedy central,
they have it online too,
right?
Yeah,
it's online.

2601
02:25:28.241 --> 02:25:32.220
That Netflix thing is,
uh,
the standup season.
Two of the standups.

2602
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:34.510
It's a half hour,
and I've got a couple of albums online and stuff.

2603
02:25:34.511 --> 02:25:37.090
Joe Lists would be with me tonight at the Improv.

2604
02:25:37.091 --> 02:25:42.091
It's sold out two shows with Bert Kreischer and Andrew motherfucking Santina.

2605
02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:47.050
No,

Bye everybody.
Thank you.
Say Bye Jo.
Liz.
Thanks Joe.

2606
02:25:47.051 --> 02:25:49.480
