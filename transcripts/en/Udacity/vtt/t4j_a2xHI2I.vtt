00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.400
When starting your business,
it's important to find a balance between

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.080
the time and
resources you have available.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.760
Have a look at this scale.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.140
On one end is the resources you have and

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.260
on the other is the time it
takes to complete your goals.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.600
You'll need to find the right balance
on the scale to manage your time and

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.260
resources effectively.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.750
So, what happens over here?

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.840
If you're not careful
how you use your time,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.260
you can end up trying to
do everything yourself.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.300
This could save you resources but
it forces you to focus on daily tasks

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.080
rather than the growth and
stability of your company.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.590
In this situation,
you probably need to go out and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.000
find people with the right skills
to help you build your business.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.030
Now, what happens if you don't
manage your resources effectively?

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.540
There are many ways you can run low
on resources, but here's one example.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.200
Maybe you've done a great
job building your team and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.150
have plenty of time to work
on growing your company.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.700
While building a great team is
necessary, overextending your resources

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.659
can become unsustainable and
cause other problems for your business.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.280
In this situation you may need to cut
back on the resources you're spending

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.550
by managing a few jobs yourself, or
finding cheaper ways to get it done.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.330
Your goal is to stay
somewhere in the middle.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.125
If you can find a way to manage both
your time and resources effectively,

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:17.275
you build a much better foundation for
your business to grow on.

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.905
Coming up,
you'll learn to manage this balance.

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:23.545
As we go through each of the options you
have for your business, keep in mind how

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:26.375
you plan to balance your resources
with the time you have available.
