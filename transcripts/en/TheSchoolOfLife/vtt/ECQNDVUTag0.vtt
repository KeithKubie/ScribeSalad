00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.680
In lots of ways grown ups can seem very impressive.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.520
But there is a big secret about them: they don't know everything.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.980
Usually an adult only knows about a few things.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.180
One adult might know a lot about trees or car engines,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.480
but know very little about how a phone really works or what happened long ago.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.480
Another might know a lot about books or electricity - but very little about Antarctica or sport.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.240
In fact there are lots and lots of things - even quite important things - that no grown-ups know.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.580
No-one really understands how to make cities very nice, for instance. If they did know all the cities in the world would be lovely.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.900
But most of them are not.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.960
No-one knows the best way to run a school - that's why there are lots of schools in the world that aren't very nice and why not every teacher is wonderful.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.100
This isn't because grown-ups are stupid but because the problems are so difficult.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.600
If you want to see a grown-up looking confused you could ask them what time is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.980
- not what is the time (they will probably know that!) - but what is time itself?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.120
or why are some jokes funnier than others or does a dog know that it's a dog?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.160
They just won't really know. No one knows too well!

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:34.320
Grown-ups disagree about a lot of things. How should the country be run? What should we do about pollution? Who should get the biggest salaries?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.600
You can yourself have conversations about these things and it doesn't matter if you don't know for sure - because grown-ups don't know either.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:55.020
Grown-ups do know a lot. But - and it's important to keep reminding yourself of this - they're often very unsure about a lot of really important things in their own lives.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:04.320
They can seem very impressive: they've got a job, they are married to someone, maybe they go on work trips to other countries in huge planes.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.780
But maybe inside they don't really know why they got married to this person (maybe it would have been better with someone else);

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.040
they wonder if they should be doing a different job; they feel confused about how they've ended up having to work so hard so much of the time.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.320
Perhaps they don't know if this would be a good time to move house or where it would be good to go on holiday.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.480
They feel they have to make a lot of big decisions but they don't know if they are making the right ones.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.100
That's why they frown a lot, and get snappy.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.840
One day, you will be a grown up too. And the strange thing is that you won't feel so very different from the way you do now.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.040
You'll still be you - though you'll have big shoes and will have learnt how to drive a car and will be able to stay up till very late.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.620
But there will still be lots of things you don't know.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.920
It's good to have a little part of your brain that constantly keeps in mind that there a lots of important things that grown-ups don't know.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.160
This doesn't mean that adults are silly. But it's quite nice to imagine they they have thinking-problems too.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.460
It can make some of them seem a little less frightening. It makes you feel a bit sorry for them.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.720
It makes you see that actually you're not so different - and that you too have things to contribute.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.940
We can actually be quite nice to each other when we realise that we're all faced with similar problems.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.600
And we can all have a go at thinking - which is what ends up making the whole world cleverer.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:43.520
Our perspective cards feature tools for a wiser calmer perspective on life they help to restore calm and clarity even during difficult times.
