Speaker 1:          00:00          We'd love to hear tips for moving to wake up earlier alarms and not disturbing your spouse. Keeping alert throughout the day. You know, when you wake up early, this is, these are, yeah, these are things. So tips for managing the implications around making that change to get up earlier while keeping the space or the keeping the speed or keeping the peace at home and work and work. He work. He either made a typo or he's, he's on the inside. Shit. What that is, is that's an homage to the Portuguese accent. Yes. It's a homage to the fake Portuguese accent. No, it's the real one. Worki well, anything adding like e at the end, like it'll come out. Oh yeah. Yeah. It can be exaggerated though by certain people, myself included. Yeah. Okay. So, so how to wake up in the morning, number one, let's, let's talk about, oh, one important piece of this.

Speaker 1:          00:58          How do you do it without disturbing the spouse? Because we don't wanna we don't wanna make the spouse angry. No adversarial relationships with this bus at four 30 or four 30. So one of the things, real, real easy, one out of the gate get an escalating alarm. So what that means is it starts off quiet. Sure. And it gets louder. It gets progressively louder. I am a much lighter sleeper than my wife. So this is not that big of a deal to me. And I can't answer, but I've, I've, I've slept with roommates at wanting to sleep, you know, like in the military, you know, you got, you got bunked together or whatever. So I've dealt with this a little bit, but it's really no factor. Did an escalating alarm. And then when that thing goes off, um, you wake up before it gets too loud to wake your spouse, it should be on your side of the bed so you can make it happen or you can pick a song that starts off nice and mellow and that kind of builds.

Speaker 1:          01:54          And for a long time, for this particular reason, I used to have, um, there's a band called the sword. Sure. And they have a song called Iron Swan. And it starts off nice and mellow. And if you don't get up in time, it's common. So you got it. So it's like a Kinda like a game within the game right there where you got to beat the clock too. Yes. Yes. You gotta beat the clock. You've got to get up and turn that thing cause otherwise it's an event and then you're too late. What is it? Black Swan? No Iron Swan. What's the source? Yeah, cause there's, there's times in my life where I will put like the ultimate shocker of a tune in my, um, in my playlist that if I need to get up and I need to get up and get on it, like there's a song called re repeat process by 100 demons.

Speaker 1:          02:53          That song will get you out of bed. It will get you out of bed. When it kicks in, it just comes, it comes to, it's like, it's like getting, it's like an explosion happens in your room and it's a great song by a great band. But anyways, so if, but in this case you don't want to go with a hundred demons. No, you don't want to go with repeat po process. You want to go with the sword iron song or on escalating alarm. Now once you do that, you kind of have the gear pre-staged the gear has the morning gear has to be pre-staged so, so we're not in the dressing, we're not pulling open drawers are not flipping on lights are not searching for stuff. No, we get up, we walk out of the room. Yeah, quietly. Stealth mode. Then you get to either the bathroom. Now if you have the bathroom on sweet, maybe you have some stuff staged in the other bathroom in the house.

Speaker 1:          03:43          So you just walk right out of the room, shut the door and you're good. You made your escape, you know. Oh and I'll tell you another thing, little heads up. Make sure that you set off your secondary, I mean that you turn off your secondary and your tertiary alarms. So if you're like me and you sleep with multiple alarm clocks, if you leave cause they go off sequentially, right. You know you've got your first one iPhone, then you've got your second one battery powered, or then you get your third one wind up. The windup is the gnarly last one with the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:13          Right, right. If you leave that thing, if you forget to shut that thing off before you walk out, you can hear about it. You hear about, cause now when it goes off, it's a startle duller cause it doesn't go off. I mean most of the, you know, 50% of the time I'm up before the alarms but, but if you leave that one on there, it's a starter and then then your, your spouse's waking up in a panic mode because now they don't know where it is. There's effort, they're being attacked. It's, it's, it's a gnarly situation. So shut off the secondary and tertiary alarms and then get out of the room and then you know, maybe even have your toothbrush and your toothpaste staged and another in another bathroom or in the kitchen or whatever. Get your workout gears. Not in a drawer by the bed where you're pulling that open, making that racket. No, you just get up and you leave. So then, um, that's, that's how you do it. That's how I do it. And again, I have an advantage because my wife is a pretty heavy sleeper.

Speaker 1:          05:13          She gets mad that when I come home from a trip and late at night, I do some unpacking in the night. That can be a little frustrating for her. But anyways, that's what you do. Now, the next piece of this question was for alertness throughout the day. What do you do to stay alert throughout the day? I think one of the things you gotta do is check your diet, right? Check the Diet, make sure, in my opinion, make sure you're not ingesting a tone of carbohydrates because those are going to make you tired. They're going to make you excited or make you fired up for about 20 minutes. I don't know, haven't had them in a long time for like 20 minutes before you eat them. Like right when you actually, that's really what they're for. Or currently instant energy. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and they put you to sleep. So when when you, when you eat it, it's basically the really basic sequence is I'm going to do some output, you know, in the wild.

Speaker 1:          06:11          I'm going to go hunting and whatever you, I'm going to gather whatever, do some output that expended some energy. I'm going to need some energy and I'm going to need some rest. When you get the, the energy, carbohydrates, food in any way, Serotonin, all these other chemicals that induce you to go rest, that's the sequence. That's the process. Don't forget about insulin. Yeah. Cause the insulin all squared away then was gonna make you tired too. So check your diet, check your dying. I just had a guy on Twitter. Ah Man, he, he's, he's like, hey man, I'm tired during the day. I'm dragging. I was like, well we'll check your diet. And he's like, well I think it's okay. I'm drinking a lot of energy drinks. No, not good. The energy drinks are addictive. Yeah, they're tasty. They're addictive. And they're, they're filled with sugar most of the time.

Speaker 1:          07:02          So you're going to get a major sugar rush and then you're going to crash. So you gotta be careful that they also, you don't want to be on, on the crazy amount of caffeine all day. And that's gonna mess up your system as well. Does the same thing as the sugar, the caffeine rush, and then the crash, that's the same thing. Oh yeah. You have more than sugar. Yeah. In, in, well, I'll tell you right now, people ask me all the time and they're surprised that I work out without caffeine in the morning. But I'm telling you, give it a try. Yeah. Because it'll be harder. Maybe it's harder for you to get out of bed. Maybe it's harder for you to get ready. Maybe it's harder for you to get into the gym with no caffeine and maybe it's harder for you to start your workout with no caffeine, but once you start the workout, yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:52          I don't think it's going to be that big of a deal. Yeah. And if it is good, make your workout harder. You know, I don't think it's that big of a deal. So don't become addicted to the caffeine and that's going to be cause that can get problematic. And then, um, power nap talked about this before. If you need to, you take a little power nap. You take six to eight minutes, you set your alarm clock, you elevate your feet above your heart. You lay down and you black out. If you're really tired, you six to eight minutes of your feet, like you feel like a rock star after one of those. Nope, I agree in another thing you can do if you're tired during the day, no big deal. Just find a little corner somewhere. Go Bang some pushups out. Go Bang out 10 burpees.

Speaker 1:          08:36          Yeah, I get the blood flowing and get the blood flowing. Yeah. There's no way it's, it's, it's physiologically impossible to do burpees and, and remain tired. Whatever. Burpees, you can tell you since you turned into a physiology major over here tonight, if you want to tell me what that does physiologically, I don't know, but I do know this. If you knock out 10 burpees, it's a small purse, Paul, small prescription. You will not be tired for at least a half an hour. You're not going to be 10 burpees and then feel tired. It does. He can't do it. I can tell you why physiologically endorphins get released. This stuff adrenaline, like when you know you're going to do physical activity, when you know it, you have it. I'm not saying a huge adrenaline, just a little bit, little, yeah, a little bit. She's still going part of it. So that's, those are some tips I guess for alertness throughout the day that I use.

Speaker 1:          09:31          Yeah. Go and forgetting that a better early in the morning. Hey and by the way, go to bed earlier at night, go to bed earlier at night. I go to bed like I'll usually around 11. Um, I don't recommend that. I don't run. Recommend going to bed at 11 and getting up at four 30. No, I don't recommend that. I recommend going to bed when you get tired, shut your computer off. Stop looking at the Inter webs and go to sleep and you know what? Go read an actual book because that made you tired. Yeah, that will make you tie. That's like the opposite of burpees. Go read, go read a book, you know, and just sit there and you will get more tired. Yeah. Unless like a real exciting or interesting book. Whoa. And read some more. Of course, of course. Don't read blood Meridian because when you go to bed and you're, cause you're a fast sleeper.

Speaker 1:          10:17          Fast sleeper. Well you don't need that much sleep, but yeah, yeah, yeah. The no sleep thing that'll get you so quick. It'll promptly put you into a crash the next day. Yeah. I don't know where you can power through. Well I dunno. I, if I can go to the next man. I've even when you had the latest little baby, you came in here on a couple hours sleep, you look rolled in here ready to record. You sat here, you got after it. Yeah. It's true. And there's all these different, does that make you realize? Yeah. It makes you realize how much more you can do. I think a lot of people, it's like this, and I don't want to go into this full subject right now, but the other day I did a 72 hour fast, right? No food for 72 hours and there's a bunch of reasons we could talk about it.

Speaker 1:          10:59          Maybe we'll do it on a later podcast. I will say this though, one small thing, if you go 72 hours without eating it recalibrates your hunger meter because we just think, oh, I haven't had a donut in two hours. I'm starving like, no, you're not starving. You're not even hungry and I'm close to hungry, so recalibrate that thing. Do a fast. Even if you just don't eat for 24 hours, you realize that most of your hunger signals that are coming to your brain are lies, and I'm not saying they're lies like, oh, don't eat, but I'm saying you don't need to eat. And how liberating is it that I was, I was having so much fun. I was, I was on this fast and I'm just like, don't even need food. I don't eat food. I don't need to eat. That's the ultimate control, right?

Speaker 1:          11:48          What I don't need food, food is food is for fruit is if you're weak. You know what I mean? It's that of you get that mentality going in. Then guess what? Now you go on a travel day and you go, Oh man, I'm going to be in the airport all day today and I dunno what I'm going to eat. Don't eat anything. Yep, you're capable. You're totally, you can go 72 hours. As a matter of fact, you can go 30 days without food. So going three days is not that big of a deal. It's not even that big of a deal. Yeah, I did when I just did this 72 hour fast. He was just not like I did everything normal. I went to Jujitsu, I did worked out, I did squats and pull ups. Everything was normal, everything was normal. It's not that big crazy deal.

Speaker 1:          12:27          Just we just get so accustomed to to just feed the machine all the time. And you could have a, you know, you've got to have a meal every six hours and it's so at our fingertips. It's so, but it's also you. This is what I realized is so inconvenient to have to eat all I know man. You know flack. You're right. So it's kind of Nice to just eating know once a day this happened. Boom, put a big old steak on and get after it. Yeah, I mean, and again, I hate, there's all kinds of people mean there's people that know this is, this is one of the reasons I don't like talking about this particular topic, um, is cause there's, there's a lot of people didn't like study this and know a bunch about this Nepal, all these facts. So if I go and do the research, well I know the facts too, but I don't, I can't, I'm considering quote them.

Speaker 1:          13:10          Right. I don't have the in depth knowledge that Peter a Tiaa has on fasting. You know what I mean? Or Dom D'agostino, those guys, their Ph, they're doctors. I'm not a doctor. I'm a knucklehead. That was, and another thing is people, you know, what did you do to prepare for your faster? I was like, oh, I didn't eat. Yeah, I was, I was with leaf and we were on a trip and we had like a lunch and then we did a Gig that night and I don't like to eat before I do a gig. And then after that we stayed up a little bit and did some work and then woke up in the morning at an early flight. And then I came home and I wanted to train. So I worked out and I got done with that and I went and did something else. And next thing I knew it was 24 hours, I guy, you know what?

Speaker 1:          13:51          And the next day I didn't feel too hungry. So I was, I just held on. So it wasn't no preparation, just got after it. Again, people don't do this anecdotal check with a physician or whatever you gotta do. Don't listen to me. Yeah. As far as like a recommendation you should do because you know you are different and 17 hour fast, hey Dee, I dig it man. But I think really kind of the point that you're making or one of them anyway I think is absolutely true. So you're, you know, a lot of it is habitual hunger, but it goes beyond just like psychological, habitual. It's like physiological. It's like, okay, I'm used to getting food every four hours. So when the four hour mark comes around physiologically, your, your stomach going to be like, word of my food. Yeah. Your, you're malting me where my food.

Speaker 1:          14:34          And then after a while, if you're like, hey, you don't get food this time, your songs, you're okay. Sometimes we don't get food. Yeah. So let's kind of act right. You know? And then when the food comes, okay, we'll do that. When that happened, recalibration is real low because then after I started eating again and then the next day I go, oh, I'm, I'm feeling hungry. I'm gonna eat something now. I'm actually not hungry, so why am I eating? Why am I eating if I'm not hungry? Mm. Yeah. That's, it's my mind is controlling me when I should be controlling my mind. Yeah. You know, so, and that's another thing where, um, you're, you're, uh, this nothing new, right. Your mind is so strong or whatever, so you can trick yourself into schools. For sleep too. So if you think that you got nine hours of sleep, you'll be way less tired then.

Speaker 1:          15:13          Okay. Let's say two people, exact people, they're identical twins, identical life experience, whatever. One guy believes the next morning they both got eight hours sleep. One guy believes he only got four hours sleep and one guy believes he got 10 hours sleep placebo scenario. Yeah, but that's how your mind it knows like basically it's your mind accommodating what it thinks the stimulus is. So, so the other twin, the four hour sleep believer, he's going to be way more tired and he's gonna be like, Dang, where's that nap I was looking forward, I need or whatever the other one. Imagine if you woke up every day and you were like, I only got four hours of sleep and I'm going to crush to exactly right. I actually believe I work better on less sleep. How you like them apples. Exactly, exactly. And that's, that's what was going to be my point there.

Speaker 1:          15:55          Where you're like, you told you, I've told you that before. Yeah, I've, I've, so I've told the echo before that when we're getting ready to record the podcast, the day before I record the podcast, that night, I like to sleep less like four hours because I feel like it sharpens, I'll tell you what, to be quite honest, what I think it does, it, it brings it, it brings my emotions a little closer to the surface. So like you feel like we're, I'm kind of under attack, so I better wait. I bet are like, pardon up right now. I better like get my two notes that it's like, no, this is what it is. I can get more. Like when I'm reading something, I'm more focused on it. I'm more into it, like actively, like, yeah. Because I think when I'm well rested, I'm like, like, uh, like rock solid, right? I'm just like, Oh yeah, we're not, the went on a little where I sleep less, I'm a little bit more exposed. I'm a little bit more vulnerable. Right. Mentally. Right. And I need that, right. Because otherwise I'd just become very,

Speaker 2:          17:08          mmm mmm.

Speaker 1:          17:10          Detached. I become very detached and it's, it's, I know. So I want it when I come in here, I want to be on though. I want to be on the fringe a little bit. Right. You know what I mean? That's what I want to be exposed. I want to be walking in here and being like, man, this is going to be, this is an intense, this thing, not a walk in the park today. This is going to be hard to let me. Yes. I want to be stressed a little bit. When I come in here, I can dig it and I feel, I always feel that way. Like it's the same thing in Jujitsu. I feel better when I'm stressed and when I'm a little bit more, yeah, a little bit more stressed, a little bit more attention, a little bit more pressure on myself. I want to be there, don't want to be there all the time. And I'll tell you what, just so everybody knows, there's some days I'm tired where I'm just tired and I just, sometimes I just need a power nap so bad at Mocad I'm going up, I'm literally falling asleep, you know? And I hate that. That's a horrible feeling, which, you know what? Elevate your feet. Set an alarm clock for eight minutes, boom, you're going to wake up field next superman.

Speaker 1:          18:08          It's Kinda like when people hit themselves before they go live because it weighed, you mean they're like slap themselves. Yeah, for sure. So on the surface it looks like, oh, he's getting fired up, but yeah. Why is he getting fired up for the exact same reason that you're talking about? Because if it's like [inaudible] like I'm getting these things where I got to kind of bounce back from, right. I'm under attack. Legitimate root adrenaline rush too. Right. So physiologic. That's the same exact sequence right there. But you're just doing it consciously and instead of slaps it's lack of sleep. Yes.

Speaker 1:          18:38          Or what have you. There you go. That's um, yeah. Answer in. Everyone's going to attack me on social media for not sleeping, not eating and all that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, sorry, I don't know what to tell you. What? Hey tacos. I appreciate your advice. I know I should. I do know I should sleep more. I do know I should eat, you know better. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, what does that even mean? Should the word should, what does that even mean? You should, it's, yeah. Anyway, that's the whole [inaudible] don't be you anymore. Well that's true. Be Different than you. That's what that, well, I actually actually the point, oh, what I was gonna say earlier is just like what you're saying, the f like you're not citing all this science and making claims about like how this is going to benefit you or nothing like that.

Speaker 1:          19:29          That's not what you're doing. It's, it is anecdotal. And I think the point is that if you push yourself through certain situations and you prove it to yourself that you can function just fine with, I don't know, five hours sleep rather than eight one or two times or whatever, or however many you know that you can do that. Like really, you know, we'd talked about this before where you get kind of dependent on certain things and then to the point where you believe that you can't function without it. Whether it be sleep, whether it be coffee in the morning, w w you know, whatever. Or eating every four hours. Like when I was really into like weightlifting and bodybuilding type stuff, I remember thinking, man, I gotta, I gotta hurry up and eat. It's four hours or whatever. And then kind of later on in life, man, I've got like, I haven't eaten yet today and it's late in the day.

Speaker 1:          20:15          I'm fine, you're not, I'm not losing my gaze. Yeah, whatever games. But Games game, whatever. Yeah. So once you prove it to yourself, it's like if you stay up all night when you have work the next day and you do your work when you go to bed you can be like, hey, if I had to, I could do that again. That is another thing that I enjoy about pushing those envelopes is it feels really good to go to bed when you've been awake for a long time. It feels really good to eat a meal once you haven't eaten for for awhile. You appreciate it more. Yeah, that's good. That's true. But that's kind of a cycle wave of invoking appreciation. In my opinion. Understood.
