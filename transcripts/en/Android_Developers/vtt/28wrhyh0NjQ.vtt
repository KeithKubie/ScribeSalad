Aggarwal: WYSA's an emotional
resilience tool for mental health.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.320
People talk to WYSA when they don't want
to talk to another human being.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.640
Originally, what we were trying to do

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.240
was detect depression using sensidata
from a phone.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.560
We found that very few people had actually
been able to access help,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.480
but many of them had been using
the chat bot and had found it helpful,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.720
and that's when the idea
of WYSA came about.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320
Detection isn't enough.
You have to actually help people.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.040
Selby: I've been using WYSA
with my patients

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.360
for two, maybe two and a half years now.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.120
WYSA really helps people to reflect
and learn more about themselves,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.800
their own well-being, and the things they
can do to strengthen their well-being.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.960
Initially,
there's this chat-based function

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.280
that allows you to be really reflective

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.840
in quite a safe and secure way,
'cause you know it's anonymous

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.800
and you know there's no judgment, but
then it also offers modules and support.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.440
We had a mum and a young girl
who came to see us

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.080
who were both quite anxious.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.880
Everyday things would start
a bit of a worry

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.160
and it was starting to feel
really overwhelming for them.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.240
We got them both to use WYSA.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.600
The young girl learned a lot about things
to help her feel less anxious.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520
So she got in the habit
of sitting in her seat,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.360
having maybe 30 seconds, a minute
mindfulness moment

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.640
before she'd give a class presentation,
and that really helped her.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.560
And mum particularly noticed a massive
improvement.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.720
Colleagues at work were commenting
on how much more relaxed she was.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.240
Her life had completely changed

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.040
and she felt much more able
to do things with her daughter

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.400
and really achieve what she wanted to do.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.360
Technology can be a huge enabler
in helping people understand

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.000
that you can support
your own mental health,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.920
and technology will change the way
we look after ourselves.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440
Aggarwal: We're trying to make the world
more mentally resilient.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.040
Technology's always been seen
as a part of the problem,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.400
and now we want to make it the solution.
