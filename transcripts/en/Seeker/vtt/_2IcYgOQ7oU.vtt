00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:04.665
Holiday excess
might be inevitable,

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:06.275
but it doesn't have
to be bad for you.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:06.865
Here's how.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.370
Hey this is Annie Gaus
guest hosting for D News.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.328
One of the best things
about the holiday season

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:17.985
is the excuse to sit around
and eat tons of good food,

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.316
drink tons of nog,
and just do nothing,

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:22.565
which is part of the reason
why it's so common to pack

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:24.445
on a couple pounds
during the holidays.

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:26.485
According to a 2000
study by the New England

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:28.495
Journal of Medicine,
people can gain an average

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.975
of just over a pound
over the fall and winter.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.145
And not surprisingly,
even short term periods

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:35.835
of overeating and inactivity
can have negative effects

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.595
on your blood sugar
and metabolism.

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:39.355
But don't worry,
there is good news.

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:41.675
A new study shows that
exercise can counteract

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.365
those negative
effects, even if you

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:44.835
are gaining a little
bit of weight.

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:46.725
Physiologists from
the University of Bath

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:48.365
tested groups of
young men, having

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:50.795
them consume more
calories than normal,

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:52.715
the equivalent of
quality overeating.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:53.465
One was sedentary.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.895
The other exercised on a
treadmill for 45 minutes a day.

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:59.245
And in just over a
week, the inactive group

00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:01.205
saw a whole range
of negative effects,

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:03.145
like a decrease in
blood sugar control

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.915
and changing gene
expression in fat cells

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:07.525
linked to poor metabolism.

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:10.135
But the exercising group showed
normal blood sugar levels

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:11.827
and less undesirable
gene activity.

00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:13.285
But what's interesting
is that they

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:15.205
matched the excess
calories according

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:16.445
to your level of activity.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:18.585
They had the active
group consume even more.

00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:21.175
So everyone was at a
similar level of excess.

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:22.815
So the implication
of the study is

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.495
that even if you're stuffing
your face with ham and fruit

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.045
cake during the Christmas
week, exercise doesn't just

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:29.670
burn off some of those calories.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.585
It can also have a
protective effect

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:34.085
against some of the bad things
that can happen in your body.

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:36.075
So in summary, eat,
drink, be merry,

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.625
don't forget to move
sometimes, and more importantly

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:39.777
have fun over the holidays.

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:41.485
