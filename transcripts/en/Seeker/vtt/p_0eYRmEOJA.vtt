00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.570
Ads tell us milk, does a body good.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.460
But are we talking whole milk or 2%?

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.720
It’s not what you think.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.710
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.209
If you were a child of the eighties or nineties
your parents likely poured you some low fat

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.279
milk - it was all the rave.

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.810
In fact in 1985, the United States Department
of Agriculture officially recommended a switch

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.140
to skim milk - three glasses of it a day.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.910
But, more recently, we’ve begun collecting
evidence that says the USDA might be missing

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.770
an important piece of the story.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.430
In a recent study published in the journal
Circulation, researchers looked at data that

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.340
spanned about 15 years.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.740
They were specifically interested in how dairy
fat biomarkers in the blood are related to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.790
diabetes.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.600
What they found might surprise the USDA.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.260
Higher concentrations of dairy fat biomarkers
were associated with lowered risk of diabetes.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.110
And whole milk has been tied to more than
just a decrease in diabetes.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.930
Another study published in the Journal of
American Nutrition looked at its relation

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.239
to obesity in more than 18,000 women over
the course of about 11 years.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.079
They found that high dairy fat intake was
associated with less weight gain and lowered

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.450
risk of obesity.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.649
In fact, a meta-review of 25 different studies
published in the European Journal of Nutrition,

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.590
supports these findings.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.499
Researchers found that there are no benefits
linked to low fat dairy compared to whole

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.499
fat.

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:28.090
When it comes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
disease, people who consume either products

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.999
come out about the same.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:35.319
What’s more, their data indeed indicated
that full-fat dairy is associated with lower

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.920
obesity rates.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.600
Eighteen of the 25 studies showed that participants
were either at lower risk for obesity, experienced

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.520
less weight gain, or weighed less overall
than those who consumed low fat dairy.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.270
The results for the other seven were inconclusive;
but, altogether these studies suggest that

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.109
at the very least, full fat milk is on par
with skim milk.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.299
But, this isn’t really a story about milk.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.979
We’re not suggesting you go chug down a
glass - in fact, if you’re like two thirds

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.189
of the population, the lactose in it will
cause some nasty side-effects.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.420
And it’s not really a story about fat, either.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.370
Rather, it’s more about what we do when
we cut the fat.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.000
See, what some scientists think ends up happening
when we drink low fat milk, is that our bodies

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.410
try to make up for the lost calories.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.720
Simply put we stay hungrier than if we were
to drink whole milk.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.010
And rather than reaching for, say a zucchini
or cooking up a chicken breast, we tend to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.500
load up on carbs.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.840
Our body then turns excess carbohydrates into
sugar, which then gets stored in our bodies

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.580
as fat - yes, those fluffy love handles.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.540
It’s sort of ironic that cutting fat in
our diets leads to more fat on our bodies

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.860
- but this is exactly what’s happening.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.910
In short, all these associations between milk
fat and its benefits may be due to our behavior

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.860
- not what milk fat does to our bodies specifically.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.160
So before you go inhale a glass of whole milk
hoping to be healthier, you might instead

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:31.870
want to pay attention to the variety of foods
you’re eating and drinking.
