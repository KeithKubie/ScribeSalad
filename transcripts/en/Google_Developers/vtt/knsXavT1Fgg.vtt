TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:01.888 --> 00:00:03.060
for The Developer Show.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.010
Today we're at the
Chrome Dev Summit

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.840
at the Yerba Buena
Center for the Arts

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.930
in San Francisco, California.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.740
Now, all the sessions are
recorded and available online,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.650
but let's say you just
want the highlights.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.740
Well, that's why I'm here, to
give you the Chrome Dev Summit

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.480
top five.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.790
Number one on our list is speed.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.630
Now, this isn't so much a new
feature as an increasing focus

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.960
we should all share.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.280
Ben Galbraith, who leads product
for the Chrome Platform Team,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.700
cited HDTV Archive
and said that sites

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.270
are using an average of
eight times more JavaScript

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.070
since 2011.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.630
He and Dion Almaer, who leads
product for the developer

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.890
ecosystem, later discussed
performance budgets,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.250
which are a great practice
for ensuring our performance

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.874
stays on track while
still enhancing our sites.

00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:52.290
There is a lot of
great supporting

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.710
data from Wayfair and
Pinterest, so this is definitely

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.150
a thing to try.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.400
Also helpful for
speed is, of course,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.740
the Page Speed
Insights Tool, which

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.170
is now powered by Lighthouse
and has real world

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.270
data from Chrome UX and more.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.750
Super useful.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.040
Next up at number
two, the Squoosh.app.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.130
This is demo that uses
WebAssembly to power the image

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.790
codecs and service
workers to work offline,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.650
and all the code is
available on GitHub.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.780
Seriously, the link is just
at the bottom of the page.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.680
It's also a really useful app
for image compression that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.470
allows you to dive pretty
deep into the advanced options

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.057
for image compressors.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:31.890
The keynote took a quick
look under the hood

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.720
of this app with
Chrome DevTools to see

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.880
how the UI stays
fluid by keeping

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420
most of the heavy lifting
off the main thread.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.960
It was really cool.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.490
Number three, Web.dev.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.880
Web.dev is a new
learning website

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.240
that includes principles,
guides, tutorials,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.672
and plenty of sample code.

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:52.380
There's also a couple
of killer features.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.210
First, Lighthouse is integrated.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.920
And it lets you track the scores
of your websites over time,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.750
as well as giving
instructions on how

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.940
to resolve specific issues.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.780
Now second, Glitch is embedded
so you can remix and test

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.180
example code right in the site.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.150
Number four had to
be Project VisBug.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.860
This experimental
Chrome extension

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.340
is meant to change how
developers and designers

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.530
interact with web pages
by providing a point,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.420
click, and tinker interface,
which is actually really cool.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.000
In the keynote demo,
UX engineer Adam Argyle

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.470
was able to use guides,
edit positioning and color,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.790
edit text, and
even drag and drop

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.070
image replacements
all without pulling up

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.170
a code window or Dom Viewer.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.290
Oh, and of course,
it's open source, too.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.600
Number five, Frameworks.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.670
The Day Two keynote
did a great job

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.000
of explaining just how important
web frameworks have become,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.790
as well as conceptualizing
them within the web

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.630
stack next to web primitives,
built-in modules, and web

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.950
components.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.020
And they talked
about how Chrome is

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.080
investing in them by including
web frameworks in the Chrome

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.990
Intent to Implement
Process, funding

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.710
for improving performance
best practices in Frameworks,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.770
and increased collaboration
with Frameworks

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.570
from the Chrome team.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.190
OK, one more highlight.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.530
Number six, Jake Archibald
dropping Chrome's birthday

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.030
cake.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.940
And that's it, your
Chrome Dev Summit Top 6.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.910

and updates,

the description below.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.770
And on your way there, take
a moment to share this video

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.520
with your friends.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.730
They'll thank you for it.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.890
And we'll thank you
by doing more of them.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.950
I'm Timothy Jordan for
The Developer Show,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.730
and I'll see you
at the next summit.
