how is it going to divide out into
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.050
how is it going to divide out into
different pieces research tells me a lot

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
different pieces research tells me a lot
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.929
different pieces research tells me a lot
about those other three areas as well so

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
about those other three areas as well so
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.350
about those other three areas as well so
it tells me about the users

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360
it tells me about the users
 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.730
it tells me about the users
you know a little bit more about who

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740
you know a little bit more about who
 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.070
you know a little bit more about who
they are it tells me about the context

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080
they are it tells me about the context
 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.800
they are it tells me about the context
that they use these products in and

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810
that they use these products in and
 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.510
that they use these products in and
that's both kind of environments and

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520
that's both kind of environments and
 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.550
that's both kind of environments and
just kind of state of mind and a lot of

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560
just kind of state of mind and a lot of
 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.950
just kind of state of mind and a lot of
different factors come into play there

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960
different factors come into play there
 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.510
different factors come into play there
and importantly it tells me about their

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
and importantly it tells me about their
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.330
and importantly it tells me about their
goals not just kind of get this thing

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
goals not just kind of get this thing
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.130
goals not just kind of get this thing
done but why do they want to get that

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
done but why do they want to get that
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.450

reason for this product cool
so nas well what do you think of when

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530
so nas well what do you think of when
 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.410
so nas well what do you think of when
you hear the term user research like

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
you hear the term user research like
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.000
you hear the term user research like
what's the picture in your head so I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010
what's the picture in your head so I
 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580
what's the picture in your head so I
think about a lab in an office I think

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590
think about a lab in an office I think
 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.550
think about a lab in an office I think
about being part of a usability study

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560
about being part of a usability study
 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.590
about being part of a usability study
where other people watch me actually use

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600
where other people watch me actually use
 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.240
where other people watch me actually use
a product that's already been built to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
a product that's already been built to
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.370
a product that's already been built to
see whether it makes sense to me or not

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
see whether it makes sense to me or not
 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.740
see whether it makes sense to me or not
is that right it sounds like you're kind

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
is that right it sounds like you're kind
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.970
is that right it sounds like you're kind
of describing what that scene and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
of describing what that scene and
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.760

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870
students come into his lab in University
 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.690
students come into his lab in University
and doesn't ESP test and radio

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700
and doesn't ESP test and radio
 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.840
and doesn't ESP test and radio
electroshocks a few of them um I mean

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850
electroshocks a few of them um I mean
 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.370
electroshocks a few of them um I mean
but that is basically right I mean

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380
but that is basically right I mean
 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.990
but that is basically right I mean
that's one form of testing that's what

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000
that's one form of testing that's what
 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.360
that's one form of testing that's what
we'd call usability testing or in lab

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370
we'd call usability testing or in lab
 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.580
we'd call usability testing or in lab
usability studies and that's a very

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590
usability studies and that's a very
 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.900
usability studies and that's a very
common type and it's probably the one

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910
common type and it's probably the one
 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.180
common type and it's probably the one
that most people think of right as kind

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190
that most people think of right as kind
 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.550
that most people think of right as kind
of research when they think of it in a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
of research when they think of it in a
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.810
of research when they think of it in a
canonical form and those focus on kind

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820
canonical form and those focus on kind
 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.100
canonical form and those focus on kind
of tools and tasks that we just talked

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110
of tools and tasks that we just talked
 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.199
of tools and tasks that we just talked
about so you know there's a tool there

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209
about so you know there's a tool there
 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.900
about so you know there's a tool there
where asking can the user use this tool

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
where asking can the user use this tool
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.199
where asking can the user use this tool
to complete the task we give the use of

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209
to complete the task we give the use of
 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.940
to complete the task we give the use of
the task when they step into the lab and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950
the task when they step into the lab and
 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.850
the task when they step into the lab and
we just kind of see well did they do it

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860
we just kind of see well did they do it
 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.920
we just kind of see well did they do it
successfully if they did how long did it

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930
successfully if they did how long did it
 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.660
successfully if they did how long did it
take them to do it so time on task and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670
take them to do it so time on task and
 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.090
take them to do it so time on task and
task completion great there's a lot more

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100
task completion great there's a lot more
 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.830
task completion great there's a lot more
that we can do in research than than

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840
that we can do in research than than
 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.280
that we can do in research than than
just that and it's not just testing

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290
just that and it's not just testing
 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.960
just that and it's not just testing
that's really important to kind of

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970
that's really important to kind of
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.170
that's really important to kind of
remind people about the broader goal is

remind people about the broader goal is
 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.390
remind people about the broader goal is
is bigger than just kind of validating

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
is bigger than just kind of validating

marketing data and that's a little bit

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950
marketing data and that's a little bit
 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.700

that they'll use but it is really just
 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.540
that they'll use but it is really just
one of many a lot of the techniques rely

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550
one of many a lot of the techniques rely
 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.790
one of many a lot of the techniques rely
on observation as opposed to direct

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800
on observation as opposed to direct
 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.050
on observation as opposed to direct
questioning and so that um you know it

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060
questioning and so that um you know it
 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.580

may be going to users home into a
 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.060
may be going to users home into a
workplace it may be kind of bringing

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070

just seeing how they how they behave
 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.960
just seeing how they how they behave
it's like watching them in their native

set up a study to find the answer to
 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.630
set up a study to find the answer to
this question how do I pick which

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640
this question how do I pick which
 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.640
this question how do I pick which
participants I should be bringing in to

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650
participants I should be bringing in to
 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.940
participants I should be bringing in to
answer this and I mitigate the bias you

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950
answer this and I mitigate the bias you
 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.310
answer this and I mitigate the bias you
know based on this artificial situation

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320
know based on this artificial situation
 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.980
know based on this artificial situation
I'm putting them in or based on which

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990
I'm putting them in or based on which
 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.800
I'm putting them in or based on which
users say I select analyze the data and

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810
users say I select analyze the data and
 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.750
users say I select analyze the data and
collect it right and then once I've

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.760
collect it right and then once I've
 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.940
collect it right and then once I've
gotten those findings together how do I

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950
gotten those findings together how do I
 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.380
gotten those findings together how do I
actually bring those back to my team to

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.390
actually bring those back to my team to
 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.540
actually bring those back to my team to
my designers to my engineers and really

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550
my designers to my engineers and really
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.370
my designers to my engineers and really
convince them of the importance of these

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380
convince them of the importance of these
 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.530
convince them of the importance of these
findings those are all critical skills

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:38.540
findings those are all critical skills
 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.360
findings those are all critical skills
that have a really good researcher can

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370
that have a really good researcher can
 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.100
that have a really good researcher can
bring to bear that makes sense sounds

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110
bring to bear that makes sense sounds
 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.630
bring to bear that makes sense sounds
like researchers are awesome and they

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:43.640
like researchers are awesome and they
 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.230
like researchers are awesome and they
should be an integral part of every team

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240
should be an integral part of every team
 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.900
should be an integral part of every team
definitely um throughout my career which

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:49.910
definitely um throughout my career which
 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:56.820
definitely um throughout my career which
is and yours I've been most proud of

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:56.830
is and yours I've been most proud of
 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.340
is and yours I've been most proud of
products that I've shipped where design

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.350
products that I've shipped where design
 

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.200
products that I've shipped where design
and research have had a really strong

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:02.210
and research have had a really strong
 

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.510
and research have had a really strong
collaboration you know one just makes

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520
collaboration you know one just makes
 

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.320
collaboration you know one just makes
the other better right

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.330
the other better right
 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.450
the other better right
when you have a designer who really gets

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460
when you have a designer who really gets
 

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.930
when you have a designer who really gets
research and is an active participant in

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940
research and is an active participant in
 

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.520
research and is an active participant in
that process you know whether that's

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:13.530
that process you know whether that's
 

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.890
that process you know whether that's
they're helping to set up the experiment

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900
they're helping to set up the experiment
 

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.659
they're helping to set up the experiment
or they're taking notes or capturing

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:17.669
or they're taking notes or capturing
 

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:20.600
or they're taking notes or capturing
video building a prototype now they just

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.610
video building a prototype now they just
 

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.950
video building a prototype now they just
get more and more of that immediate

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960
get more and more of that immediate
 

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.719
get more and more of that immediate
information by being involved right

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:23.729
information by being involved right
 

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:24.920
information by being involved right
instead of just kind of waiting for the

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:24.930
instead of just kind of waiting for the
 

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.469
instead of just kind of waiting for the
findings of the report and seeing things

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479
findings of the report and seeing things
 

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:29.240
findings of the report and seeing things
firsthand is always more powerful than

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.250
firsthand is always more powerful than
 

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.890
firsthand is always more powerful than
just kind of you know reading about it

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900
just kind of you know reading about it
 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.610
just kind of you know reading about it
after the fact

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620
after the fact
 

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.819
after the fact
it puts a human context to it yeah and

00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:34.829
it puts a human context to it yeah and
 

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:36.259
it puts a human context to it yeah and
it's it's definitely the kind of thing

00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:36.269
it's it's definitely the kind of thing
 

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:38.569
it's it's definitely the kind of thing
that as a designer I will can it be in

00:08:38.569 --> 00:08:38.579
that as a designer I will can it be in
 

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:41.269
that as a designer I will can it be in
working on something and I will think

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279
working on something and I will think
 

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.219
working on something and I will think
back to Waiver particular experience I

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:43.229
back to Waiver particular experience I
 

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:45.500
back to Waiver particular experience I
write oh I remember when this user came

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:45.510
write oh I remember when this user came
 

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.540
write oh I remember when this user came
in and they did this thing right that

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:47.550
in and they did this thing right that
 

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.850
in and they did this thing right that
surprised me and I definitely dropped on

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860
surprised me and I definitely dropped on
 

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.970
surprised me and I definitely dropped on
that cool and likewise a really great

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980
that cool and likewise a really great
 

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.069
that cool and likewise a really great
researcher and will have a good

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:55.079
researcher and will have a good
 

00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:56.810
researcher and will have a good
understanding of the design process and

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820
understanding of the design process and
 

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.630
understanding of the design process and
they'll be really expert at kind of

00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640
they'll be really expert at kind of
 

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.740
they'll be really expert at kind of
thinking about well if this is the

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:00.750
thinking about well if this is the
 

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.480
thinking about well if this is the
process I know how to plug in here or

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:02.490
process I know how to plug in here or
 

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.610
process I know how to plug in here or
here or here and I know for each of

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620
here or here and I know for each of
 

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.560
here or here and I know for each of
those opportunities what method is the

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.570
those opportunities what method is the
 

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.500
those opportunities what method is the
right one that I should employ cool so

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:09.510
right one that I should employ cool so
 

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.730
right one that I should employ cool so
now speaking of plugging into the

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740
now speaking of plugging into the
 

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.260
now speaking of plugging into the
process where the ways you've seen

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:12.270
process where the ways you've seen
 

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.120
process where the ways you've seen
research conducted at different parts of

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.130
research conducted at different parts of
 

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.340
research conducted at different parts of
the product development lifecycle yeah

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:16.350
the product development lifecycle yeah
 

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.500
the product development lifecycle yeah
so this probably is a topic that

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.510
so this probably is a topic that
 

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.470
so this probably is a topic that
deserves its own episode but at a really

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480
deserves its own episode but at a really
 

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.790
deserves its own episode but at a really
high level I think when you're when

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800
high level I think when you're when
 

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.910
high level I think when you're when
you're starting out on a project you

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920
you're starting out on a project you
 

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.190
you're starting out on a project you
want to go out and observe users kind of

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200
want to go out and observe users kind of
 

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.400
want to go out and observe users kind of
in their natural environment right the

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.410
in their natural environment right the
 

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.750
in their natural environment right the
kind of things that you're looking for

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760
kind of things that you're looking for
 

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.519
kind of things that you're looking for
here are to challenge the assumptions

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:34.529
here are to challenge the assumptions
 

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:36.290
here are to challenge the assumptions
that you may already have so you may

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300
that you may already have so you may
 

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.970
that you may already have so you may
think users do this one thing but by

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980
think users do this one thing but by
 

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.010
think users do this one thing but by
observing them you see ok they do do

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.020
observing them you see ok they do do
 

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.329
observing them you see ok they do do
that but they also do this other thing

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339
that but they also do this other thing
 

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:42.860
that but they also do this other thing
or they do this thing in a slightly

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:42.870
or they do this thing in a slightly
 

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.660
or they do this thing in a slightly
different way than I thought they would

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:44.670
different way than I thought they would
 

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.470
different way than I thought they would
and so those kind of little surprising

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480
and so those kind of little surprising
 

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.090
and so those kind of little surprising
insights can be really valuable and they

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100
insights can be really valuable and they
 

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.380
insights can be really valuable and they
may even shift the direction of your

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:51.390
may even shift the direction of your
 

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.530
may even shift the direction of your
product as soon as you see those you can

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540
product as soon as you see those you can
 

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.699
product as soon as you see those you can
also just kind of learn about what

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:55.709
also just kind of learn about what
 

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:58.189
also just kind of learn about what
already exists and so you can look at

00:09:58.189 --> 00:09:58.199
already exists and so you can look at
 

00:09:58.199 --> 00:10:00.110
already exists and so you can look at
other studies that you've done or that

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120
other studies that you've done or that
 

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.660
other studies that you've done or that
are kind of published in the

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:01.670
are kind of published in the
 

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.070
are kind of published in the
you know academic literature and things

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.080
you know academic literature and things
 

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.830
you know academic literature and things
like that and you're asking this

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:05.840
like that and you're asking this
 

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.170
like that and you're asking this
question what's already been done but

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:08.180
question what's already been done but
 

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.880
question what's already been done but
really kind of the second-order question

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:09.890
really kind of the second-order question
 

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.640
really kind of the second-order question
is well how did that work out when

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.650
is well how did that work out when
 

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.520
is well how did that work out when
people did that so a little bit of that

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:15.530
people did that so a little bit of that
 

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.530
people did that so a little bit of that
is like competitive evaluation looking

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.540
is like competitive evaluation looking
 

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.360
is like competitive evaluation looking
at other applications that make sense so

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:19.370
at other applications that make sense so
 

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.150
at other applications that make sense so
is this like testing a competitor's

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160
is this like testing a competitor's
 

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.650
is this like testing a competitor's
product before actually building your

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:23.660
product before actually building your
 

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.860
product before actually building your
own yeah I think a lot of us do that

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:26.870
own yeah I think a lot of us do that
 

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.630
own yeah I think a lot of us do that
already and people that are really

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640
already and people that are really
 

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.280
already and people that are really
involved with technology we just kind of

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:30.290
involved with technology we just kind of
 

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.500
involved with technology we just kind of
do this casually as a user I mean we use

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:32.510
do this casually as a user I mean we use
 

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.330
do this casually as a user I mean we use
lots of different products and there's a

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:34.340
lots of different products and there's a
 

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.310
lots of different products and there's a
lot of input coming to us from just our

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320
lot of input coming to us from just our
 

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.320
lot of input coming to us from just our
day-to-day behavior and we're thinking

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.330
day-to-day behavior and we're thinking
 

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.170
day-to-day behavior and we're thinking
about an area sometimes it's because

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:41.180
about an area sometimes it's because
 

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.150
about an area sometimes it's because
we've used something similar and or

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160
we've used something similar and or
 

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.830
we've used something similar and or
maybe it's news we do something that

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:44.840
maybe it's news we do something that
 

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.600
maybe it's news we do something that
isn't satisfying for us and we know we

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:46.610
isn't satisfying for us and we know we
 

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.100
isn't satisfying for us and we know we
think we can do something interesting or

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.110
think we can do something interesting or
 

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.770
think we can do something interesting or
different in that space right this is

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:50.780
different in that space right this is
 

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.840
different in that space right this is
just kind of taking that natural

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:52.850
just kind of taking that natural
 

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.400
just kind of taking that natural
instinct to go and learn and making it a

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:54.410
instinct to go and learn and making it a
 

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.020
instinct to go and learn and making it a
little bit more rigorous that makes

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.030
little bit more rigorous that makes
 

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.350
little bit more rigorous that makes
sense

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360
sense
 

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.390

so now after you've gotten started and
 

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.920
so now after you've gotten started and
you've chosen a direction or

interactively doing development how does
research come into play at that point

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760
research come into play at that point
 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.730
research come into play at that point
well I think research is best served

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:06.740
well I think research is best served
 

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.340

kind of the most typical time that
 

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.190
kind of the most typical time that
you'll see in lab testing so you get the

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.010
at the end of course like launching
isn't really the end once you get the

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:47.020
isn't really the end once you get the
 

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.350
isn't really the end once you get the
product launched and you can observe how

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360
product launched and you can observe how
 

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.930
product launched and you can observe how
live users you know use the product in

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:51.940
live users you know use the product in
 

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.860
live users you know use the product in
the wild you know not just how does

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:55.870
the wild you know not just how does
 

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.240
the wild you know not just how does
somebody use it two minutes after

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.250
somebody use it two minutes after
 

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.740
somebody use it two minutes after
they've been to introduced but you know

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:58.750
they've been to introduced but you know
 

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.420
they've been to introduced but you know
two days later two weeks two months

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.430
two days later two weeks two months
 

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.730
two days later two weeks two months
later right how is that changed what are

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:02.740
later right how is that changed what are
 

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.290
later right how is that changed what are
they what are they needed what do they

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:04.300
they what are they needed what do they
 

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.900
they what are they needed what do they
want what don't they use so you can look

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:06.910
want what don't they use so you can look
 

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.610
want what don't they use so you can look
at logs you can look at comments on the

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:08.620
at logs you can look at comments on the
 

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.000
at logs you can look at comments on the
Playstore right you can start at this

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.010
Playstore right you can start at this
 

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.170
Playstore right you can start at this
point thinking about well what's the

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.180
point thinking about well what's the
 

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.970
point thinking about well what's the
next release like what should what is

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:14.980
next release like what should what is
 

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.770
next release like what should what is
really really critical that it I need to

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:16.780
really really critical that it I need to
 

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.540
really really critical that it I need to
have in there because it's still missing

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:18.550
have in there because it's still missing
 

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.660
have in there because it's still missing
this for users what did I think was

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:21.670
this for users what did I think was
 

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.040
this for users what did I think was
going to be a big thing that I was going

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.050
going to be a big thing that I was going
 

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.410
going to be a big thing that I was going
to do more work on yeah now it's just

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:25.420
to do more work on yeah now it's just
 

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.060
to do more work on yeah now it's just
not important to users so maybe I pull

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.070
not important to users so maybe I pull
 

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.890
not important to users so maybe I pull
back from that exactly ya know because

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:28.900
back from that exactly ya know because
 

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.120
back from that exactly ya know because
it's not like your applications that

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.130
it's not like your applications that
 

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.290
it's not like your applications that
were finished like just because you've

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:31.300
were finished like just because you've
 

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.580
were finished like just because you've
launched a current version doesn't mean

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:32.590
launched a current version doesn't mean
 

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.960
launched a current version doesn't mean
you're going to not do upgrades and

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:33.970
you're going to not do upgrades and
 

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.130
you're going to not do upgrades and
doesn't mean there's not going to be

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:35.140
doesn't mean there's not going to be
 

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.810
doesn't mean there's not going to be
another version so it's never never the

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:36.820
another version so it's never never the
 

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.970
another version so it's never never the
end no no your work is never done

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:38.980
end no no your work is never done
 

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.010
end no no your work is never done
if you do it right it never ends that's

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:41.020
if you do it right it never ends that's
 

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.750
if you do it right it never ends that's
right exactly so what are some things

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760
right exactly so what are some things
 

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.730
right exactly so what are some things
that designers in particular are looking

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:47.740
that designers in particular are looking
 

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.640
that designers in particular are looking
to get out of user research yeah I mean

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:50.650
to get out of user research yeah I mean
 

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.670
to get out of user research yeah I mean
for me it's always just great to hear

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680
for me it's always just great to hear
 

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.680
for me it's always just great to hear
users kind of talk in their own language

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:55.690
users kind of talk in their own language
 

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.450
users kind of talk in their own language
and just kind of pay attention to the

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:57.460
and just kind of pay attention to the
 

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.970
and just kind of pay attention to the
particular vocabulary that a user makes

00:14:59.970 --> 00:14:59.980
particular vocabulary that a user makes
 

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.520
particular vocabulary that a user makes
use of right when going through your

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:02.530
use of right when going through your
 

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.710
use of right when going through your
product or even separate from your

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720
product or even separate from your
 

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.090
product or even separate from your
product when just doing their tasks

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:06.100
product when just doing their tasks
 

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.660
product when just doing their tasks
without it you can take that language

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:09.670
without it you can take that language
 

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.580
without it you can take that language
and you can borrow it and include into

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:11.590
and you can borrow it and include into
 

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.560
and you can borrow it and include into
the UI so that might be how you label an

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:13.570
the UI so that might be how you label an
 

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.920
the UI so that might be how you label an
action or what you choose to depict as

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:16.930
action or what you choose to depict as
 

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.050
action or what you choose to depict as
an icon or things like that it just

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.060
an icon or things like that it just
 

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.640
an icon or things like that it just
reduces the need for the user to

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:20.650
reduces the need for the user to
 

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.890
reduces the need for the user to
translate between their world and your

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:22.900
translate between their world and your
 

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.380
translate between their world and your
world yeah it may it reduces the

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:25.390
world yeah it may it reduces the
 

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.700
world yeah it may it reduces the
cognitive load and it makes it more

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:26.710
cognitive load and it makes it more
 

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.340
cognitive load and it makes it more
intuitive yes and I think that's a lot

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:29.350
intuitive yes and I think that's a lot
 

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.800
intuitive yes and I think that's a lot
of what intuitive to user means is it's

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:31.810
of what intuitive to user means is it's
 

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.900
of what intuitive to user means is it's
familiar to me either it's in the

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:33.910
familiar to me either it's in the
 

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.790
familiar to me either it's in the
language I understand or it's doing

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800
language I understand or it's doing
 

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.530
language I understand or it's doing
things that I expect it to do based on

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:37.540
things that I expect it to do based on
 

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.940
things that I expect it to do based on
other context right I think that's what

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:38.950
other context right I think that's what
 

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.850
other context right I think that's what
intuition is for users exactly and you

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:41.860
intuition is for users exactly and you
 

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.550
intuition is for users exactly and you
know an example might be if the users

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560
know an example might be if the users
 

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.680
know an example might be if the users
might use the word settings you might

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:46.690
might use the word settings you might
 

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.240
might use the word settings you might
want to use the word preference because

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.250
want to use the word preference because
 

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.200
want to use the word preference because
you think it's

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.210
you think it's
 

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.500
you think it's
kind of correct correct right some form

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:51.510
kind of correct correct right some form
 

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.940
kind of correct correct right some form
but if that's not the language the user

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:53.950
but if that's not the language the user
 

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.470
but if that's not the language the user
uses they have to do the translation

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480
uses they have to do the translation
 

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.600
uses they have to do the translation
work to come to your product right you

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:57.610
work to come to your product right you
 

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.550
work to come to your product right you
can instead do the design work to bring

00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560
can instead do the design work to bring
 

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.870
can instead do the design work to bring
the product closer to what the user

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880
the product closer to what the user
 

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.700
the product closer to what the user
understands and just kind of spare them

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:02.710
understands and just kind of spare them
 

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.930
understands and just kind of spare them
that effort and the last thing about

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:06.940
that effort and the last thing about
 

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.610
that effort and the last thing about
language is it can also be a bit of a

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:08.620
language is it can also be a bit of a
 

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.420
language is it can also be a bit of a
doorway into understanding the users

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.430
doorway into understanding the users
 

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.900
doorway into understanding the users
thought process so like if you talk to a

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:15.910
thought process so like if you talk to a
 

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.970
thought process so like if you talk to a
designer for more than like two or three

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:17.980
designer for more than like two or three
 

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.290
designer for more than like two or three
minutes you're going to hear the phrase

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:19.300
minutes you're going to hear the phrase
 

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.650
minutes you're going to hear the phrase
mental model and then I got it I think I

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:22.660
mental model and then I got it I think I
 

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.940
mental model and then I got it I think I
earned my badge you know we love to talk

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:26.950
earned my badge you know we love to talk
 

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.670
earned my badge you know we love to talk
about that all that really means is how

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680
about that all that really means is how
 

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.390
about that all that really means is how
the user understands a process to work

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:33.400
the user understands a process to work
 

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.230
the user understands a process to work
in the world right and and I've seen

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240
in the world right and and I've seen
 

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.260
in the world right and and I've seen
users construct both kind of vastly

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.270
users construct both kind of vastly
 

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.720
users construct both kind of vastly
simpler mental models in the real model

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:42.730
simpler mental models in the real model
 

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.330
simpler mental models in the real model
and you know much much much more

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:45.340
and you know much much much more
 

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.760
and you know much much much more
complicated things as well right

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:47.770
complicated things as well right
 

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.580
complicated things as well right
so I mean one example is for a mobile

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:50.590
so I mean one example is for a mobile
 

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.800
so I mean one example is for a mobile
device battery usage

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:52.810
device battery usage
 

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:57.270
device battery usage
I see users in research who engage in

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:57.280
I see users in research who engage in
 

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.360
I see users in research who engage in
all kinds of bizarre ritualistic

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:00.370
all kinds of bizarre ritualistic
 

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.670
all kinds of bizarre ritualistic
behaviors because they have a mental

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680
behaviors because they have a mental
 

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.200
behaviors because they have a mental
model that says if I do these things I

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.210
model that says if I do these things I
 

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.130
model that says if I do these things I
will get more bad real

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:05.140
will get more bad real
 

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.700
will get more bad real
exactly so they swipe away recent

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:08.710
exactly so they swipe away recent
 

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.350
exactly so they swipe away recent
applications that they're not using how

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360
applications that they're not using how
 

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.530
applications that they're not using how
do they you did both Thera now I've

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:13.540
do they you did both Thera now I've
 

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.910
do they you did both Thera now I've
talked to you that it's all over now

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:16.920
talked to you that it's all over now
 

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.590
talked to you that it's all over now
yeah or they put the device in airplane

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600
yeah or they put the device in airplane
 

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.830
yeah or they put the device in airplane
mode and of course as they're doing all

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:22.840
mode and of course as they're doing all
 

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.630
mode and of course as they're doing all
of this they're driving the screen at

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640
of this they're driving the screen at
 

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.520
of this they're driving the screen at
the highest brightness and keeping the

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:26.530
the highest brightness and keeping the
 

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.860
the highest brightness and keeping the
display active and actually possibly

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:28.870
display active and actually possibly
 

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.720
display active and actually possibly
being contrary to their goals because

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:30.730
being contrary to their goals because
 

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.060
being contrary to their goals because
the mental model doesn't match the real

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.070
the mental model doesn't match the real
 

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.130
the mental model doesn't match the real
model right and when there is that

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:35.140
model right and when there is that
 

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.460
model right and when there is that
mismatch like I get very excited as a

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:38.470
mismatch like I get very excited as a
 

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.540
mismatch like I get very excited as a
designer because that's a huge

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:39.550
designer because that's a huge
 

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.610
designer because that's a huge
opportunity know that make sense once I

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:41.620
opportunity know that make sense once I
 

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.380
opportunity know that make sense once I
see oh the user doesn't understand this

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:43.390
see oh the user doesn't understand this
 

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.510
see oh the user doesn't understand this
but if they could understand that they

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520
but if they could understand that they
 

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.100
but if they could understand that they
would be

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:46.110
would be
 

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.320
would be
effective or their battery would last or

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.330
effective or their battery would last or
 

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.130
effective or their battery would last or
things like that

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140
things like that
 

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.049
things like that
so those points of difference are really

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059
so those points of difference are really
 

00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:52.220
so those points of difference are really
interesting no definitely another

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:52.230
interesting no definitely another
 

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.630
interesting no definitely another
example this point is a refresh button

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640
example this point is a refresh button
 

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.630
example this point is a refresh button
where folks that are not familiar with

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640
where folks that are not familiar with
 

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.940
where folks that are not familiar with
push basically data being pushed

00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:58.950
push basically data being pushed
 

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.650
push basically data being pushed
directly in a device might think that oh

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660
directly in a device might think that oh
 

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.030
directly in a device might think that oh
there's no refresh buttons the data

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:02.040
there's no refresh buttons the data
 

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.010
there's no refresh buttons the data
they're seeing is stale right but

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.020
they're seeing is stale right but
 

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.510
they're seeing is stale right but
actually it's being updated in real time

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520
actually it's being updated in real time
 

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.000
actually it's being updated in real time
and they just don't have an awareness of

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.010
and they just don't have an awareness of
 

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.530
and they just don't have an awareness of
that and then that can actually be

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:09.540
that and then that can actually be
 

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.650
that and then that can actually be
contrary to their sort of perception and

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660
contrary to their sort of perception and
 

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.330
contrary to their sort of perception and
expectation from the software like it

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340
expectation from the software like it
 

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.460
expectation from the software like it
feels like oh it's not performing as

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:16.470
feels like oh it's not performing as
 

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.900
feels like oh it's not performing as
well as it should because it doesn't

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:17.910
well as it should because it doesn't
 

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.549
well as it should because it doesn't
have a refresh button but in reality it

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559
have a refresh button but in reality it
 

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:21.020
have a refresh button but in reality it
is performing well because it doesn't

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.030
is performing well because it doesn't
 

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.659
is performing well because it doesn't
have a refresh button yeah I mean we try

00:18:23.659 --> 00:18:23.669
have a refresh button yeah I mean we try
 

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:26.659
have a refresh button yeah I mean we try
to be really careful as designers not to

00:18:26.659 --> 00:18:26.669
to be really careful as designers not to
 

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:28.850
to be really careful as designers not to
kind of create the opportunity for false

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860
kind of create the opportunity for false
 

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.760
kind of create the opportunity for false
rituals like by removing a refresh

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:31.770
rituals like by removing a refresh
 

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.140
rituals like by removing a refresh
button that doesn't do anything

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.150
button that doesn't do anything
 

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.510
button that doesn't do anything
exactly I'm hopefully moving a user away

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520
exactly I'm hopefully moving a user away
 

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.760
exactly I'm hopefully moving a user away
from just kind of doing things to no

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:37.770
from just kind of doing things to no
 

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.539
from just kind of doing things to no
benefit or take an end result and

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:40.549
benefit or take an end result and
 

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:43.310
benefit or take an end result and
ideally I'm freeing up space to take a

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320
ideally I'm freeing up space to take a
 

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.710
ideally I'm freeing up space to take a
meaningless action away and put a

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720
meaningless action away and put a
 

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.539
meaningless action away and put a
meaningful action in its place because I

00:18:47.539 --> 00:18:47.549
meaningful action in its place because I
 

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:48.860
meaningful action in its place because I
leave so much space for all of these

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:48.870
leave so much space for all of these
 

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.080
leave so much space for all of these
actions anyway at exactions I put the

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.090
actions anyway at exactions I put the
 

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.880
actions anyway at exactions I put the
less emphasis any one of them gets and

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:52.890
less emphasis any one of them gets and
 

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.570
less emphasis any one of them gets and
so yes this is you know very much what I

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580
so yes this is you know very much what I
 

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.950
so yes this is you know very much what I
do on a daily basis it's fantastic so

00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960
do on a daily basis it's fantastic so
 

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.169
do on a daily basis it's fantastic so
how does user research help other folks

00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179
how does user research help other folks
 

00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:04.430
how does user research help other folks
in a team because we've talked about the

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440
in a team because we've talked about the
 

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.930
in a team because we've talked about the
benefit of designers what about benefits

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:05.940
benefit of designers what about benefits
 

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.850
benefit of designers what about benefits
to PM's product managers and also

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860
to PM's product managers and also
 

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.240
to PM's product managers and also
engineers I think everything you do to

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.250
engineers I think everything you do to
 

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.039
engineers I think everything you do to
kind of better understand your your

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:13.049
kind of better understand your your
 

00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:17.000
kind of better understand your your
users can help and I'm saying help

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.010
users can help and I'm saying help
 

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.740
users can help and I'm saying help
that's not the same as make your job

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:18.750
that's not the same as make your job
 

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.590
that's not the same as make your job
easier because sometimes it's very easy

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600
easier because sometimes it's very easy
 

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.120
easier because sometimes it's very easy
to make an ignorant decision without

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.130
to make an ignorant decision without
 

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.270
to make an ignorant decision without
kind of knowledge of your users research

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280
kind of knowledge of your users research
 

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.030
kind of knowledge of your users research
often will reveal that there's a lot

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:29.040
often will reveal that there's a lot
 

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.549
often will reveal that there's a lot
more variability in your audience and

00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559
more variability in your audience and
 

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:33.590
more variability in your audience and
then you've probably had in mind and

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600
then you've probably had in mind and
 

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.030
then you've probably had in mind and
that can complicate some of your

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:35.040
that can complicate some of your
 

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.730
that can complicate some of your
decision making so this kind of like how

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740
decision making so this kind of like how
 

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.610
decision making so this kind of like how
user research allows us to it's it's

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620
user research allows us to it's it's
 

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.409
user research allows us to it's it's
kind of like we get to create our own

00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419
kind of like we get to create our own
 

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:45.140
kind of like we get to create our own
mental models off actual users and our

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.150
mental models off actual users and our
 

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.870
mental models off actual users and our
mental models might be overly simplistic

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880
mental models might be overly simplistic
 

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.419
mental models might be overly simplistic
and and not actually match the reality

00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:50.429
and and not actually match the reality
 

00:19:50.429 --> 00:19:52.789
and and not actually match the reality
of our actual users that's exactly right

00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799
of our actual users that's exactly right
 

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.409
of our actual users that's exactly right
I mean the mental model we may have

00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419
I mean the mental model we may have
 

00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:56.140
I mean the mental model we may have
maybe just kind of

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:56.150
maybe just kind of
 

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.150
maybe just kind of
with our own bias right in a lot of ways

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160
with our own bias right in a lot of ways
 

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.280
with our own bias right in a lot of ways
that mental model of the who the user is

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:00.290
that mental model of the who the user is
 

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.740
that mental model of the who the user is
could just be well they're me exactly

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:02.750
could just be well they're me exactly
 

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.530
could just be well they're me exactly
because I know that person is and I want

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:05.540
because I know that person is and I want
 

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.630
because I know that person is and I want
to use this product right exactly I'm

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640
to use this product right exactly I'm
 

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.770
to use this product right exactly I'm
obviously everyone is just like me um

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:10.780
obviously everyone is just like me um
 

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.310
obviously everyone is just like me um
that's not true at all right so by doing

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320
that's not true at all right so by doing
 

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.220
that's not true at all right so by doing
research you can help release yourself

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:18.230
research you can help release yourself
 

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.780
research you can help release yourself
and release the whole the rest of the

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:19.790
and release the whole the rest of the
 

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.610
and release the whole the rest of the
team from those types of biases and

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:21.620
team from those types of biases and
 

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.780
team from those types of biases and
getting away from that kind of

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:22.790
getting away from that kind of
 

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.950
getting away from that kind of
monolithic model of the user is me you

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960
monolithic model of the user is me you
 

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.070
monolithic model of the user is me you
know this is also helpful in kind of

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080
know this is also helpful in kind of
 

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.920
know this is also helpful in kind of
making some of the debates about the

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:32.930
making some of the debates about the
 

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.550
making some of the debates about the
decision and those compromises less kind

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:36.560
decision and those compromises less kind
 

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.200
decision and those compromises less kind
of confrontational yes you're not

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.210
of confrontational yes you're not
 

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.000
of confrontational yes you're not
talking about I want this and you want

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.010
talking about I want this and you want
