1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,720
The Joe Rogan experience. All
right. Let me ask you this,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,180
because you're all in the technology. Go
ahead. What do you think about aliens?

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,860
It's doesn't seem tech related at all.
Yeah. Um, do you think they exist?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,600
Do you think they've ever
visited here? Oh God, no.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,430
No, I don't think so. I think
they would've destroyed us.
Brilliant. Yeah, but why?

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,040
When we visit primitive tribes,
we don't destroy them necessarily.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,320
Like we try to leave them alone.
Do we try,

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:28,230
but we end up destroying him one way
or the other. Anyways, I was a few.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,100
Even when people do for sure. Even when
we try to be nice, it's like, yeah,

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,270
look that tribal, let's analyze them,
sent a few photos, let's give them food,

11
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,400
and they nearly die pretty
much. Yeah. There's always that.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,730
There's that image of famous
image of these tribes,

13
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:45,840
people in Brazil and uncontacted tribe
and they're painted their body paint and

14
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:50,050
then the arrows drawn at the
helicopter. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,090
Now they know about helicopters and
slowly and surely the freaking house,

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,000
the new song, God, yeah. Now they worship.
Any religion can see you think about it.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,850
Imagine if you were an uncontacted
tribe and all of a sudden you saw the

18
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,540
helicopter shows up. Whenever I see a
helicopter show, I freak out in general.

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,110
Yeah. In general. You know what I mean?
So like imagine that's, that's insane.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,600
Have you ever been in one helicopter?
Yes. So weird. Right? Right. It's weird,

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,450
but yeah, around like, okay,
we're in the sky way. It makes
noise. Absolutely. But no,

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,620
I think, um, I don't know
man. I think they would've
destroyed us. They'd be like,

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,730
these guys are stupid.

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,040
Don't you think it would want to watch
look like if you go to the zoo, right?

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,470
You go to the, the chimpanzee exhibit
and you watch them swing around and shit.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,030
People love to watch the chimps.

27
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:34,620
It's probably one of the most popular
parts of the exhibit and we love watching

28
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:36,060
them like, oh, look at them, look at them.

29
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,800
And if you could go someplace where
you could wash them in the wild. Yeah.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,780
Like if there was like a Webcam or you
can tune in to the Congo right now,

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,920
you would definitely. How do we, how do
we know they're not watching us right now?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,570
Exactly. That's the thing. They
probably are. They probably are,

33
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,580
but wouldn't they just like
watch and observe? So we just,

34
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:53,414
we don't blow ourselves.

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,100
So we would never know that in general
they can live among us. We wouldn't know.

36
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,300
I mean,

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,590
I would imagine that if there was a
civilization that's on the cusp of some

38
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,100
major breakthrough as far as artificial
intelligence goes, which is where we are.

39
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,470
Right?

40
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,420
And in many ways I think that we're all
super fortunate to be alive right now.

41
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,690
Absolutely. Because even though this
is a time of incredible turmoil,

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,580
it's also a time of an amazing potential
and change. I'm greedy as hell though.

43
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,250
I want to see more. I know I
want to see more. I want to see,

44
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,930
I really want to see a robot uprising.
I, I'm dead serious. What don't I do ask.

45
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,500
I really do.

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,270
And I want to be like 90 ish years
old and I want there to be this super

47
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:34,260
advanced AI robot just to take
over and that shooting shit.

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,020
And I also want, I will,
cause Ilan mosque has head,

49
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,540
he'll still be alive because it had
to be in a jar and he'd be like,

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,600
I told you so.
I told you a little robot hand.

51
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,540
I told you what I want to say because
it's like, it's the, it's a cool,

52
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,720
it's like Terminator Shit. I'm going to
shit. I want to see that. Why at all.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,100
I want to see the aliens come in and stop
us. Right. And we're about to hit the,

54
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,320
the green switch to turn on
artificial intelligence on what?

55
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:59,490
The aliens to come down with their little
legs greenhand hand go, hey, hey, hey. No,

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,880
no, no, no. They weren't. They were this,
the robot gave this dynamic. Yeah, it's,

57
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,700
it's wrestling with him, right? Yeah.
It's going to grab your Dick like that.

58
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,590
I might like it.

59
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,990
You're going to be beating off that
things gonna come and let me help you.

60
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,430
But the thing is,
what's,

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,880
what's stopping that from not wrapping
around his neck and just crushing it.

62
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,890
There's nothing stopping it.
If you get hacked,

63
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,770
think about the same people that
helped you make your Tesla work, right?

64
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,090
They're going to hack
into this fucking thing.

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,820
It's going to run right through your
walls. Skynet, it's going to eat your dog.

66
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,530
If you've seen the ones that flip they,

67
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,500
they didn't have them on trap pieces
like Cirque de Solei actually,

68
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,680
have you seen the part where they actually
beat the robots and less like, yeah,

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,850
you know what my favorite
part of that is? Well, they,

70
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:38,260
they beat the robots to find
out the robots fall over,
right? Kick them and shit.

71
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,540
Hida released a statement saying it's
not cool. You can't do the robot.

72
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,630
Get involved in everything. You know what
I mean? It's not cool. Wait, how about,

73
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,500
how about a robot coalition should
be a robot coalition. We're like,

74
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,980
we stand with robots to say, listen, we
built these things but we can't hit them.

75
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,170
Like, let me ask you this.
Here's the real question.

76
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,660
If you're 90 years old and you're still
lucid in your put, your body's failing,

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
you've got and your
knees are gone and your,

78
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,350
your hip's bad and your back
hurts all the time and your,

79
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:12,970
your shoulders are all torn apart. You
can't pick things up and they say, rich,

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,520
we can download your consciousness,

81
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,800
not this into this artificial body.
It's like you,

82
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,690
if you were Anderson Silva when he
was 30 years old, Black Mirror Shit.

83
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,850
Yeah. They give you the super
powerful body, right? It's, it's,

84
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,900
you're going to feel it just like that,

85
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:36,130
but now you're going to be like a super
elite athlete and it's going to be you

86
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,830
and we'll put your consciousness or
you can just go to black and see what

87
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:42,640
happens in the afterlife. He had to just
let, let this 90 year old body dies.

88
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,950
The silliest question ever.
You're going to take the course.

89
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,560
I would shake it bird in
the hand, right? Yeah.

90
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,890
What's APP to let my might be bullshit,
right? I can just myself right now.

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,490
When you do that, fuck yeah. Fuck
yeah. If you want to do it right now.

92
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,710
I'm not even at 90 well I think
that's how they're going to get us.

93
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,490
I think slowly but surely they're going
to replace parts like there's already

94
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,810
amazing,
um,

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,730
artificial hands that you're creating
and you know limbs that are articulating

96
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:10,240
rems. He's a thing. Would you want one of
the limbs that looks like a human limb?

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,400
Would you want like a robotic limb?
I can terminate her.

98
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,710
I don't want to terminate her limb for
sure. What'd you for sure. I want to,

99
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,020
you want to stare at me?
But what if it was a nice and soft?

100
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,890
Do you think we're close to Robo cop then?
Like would that be maybe the first,

101
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,930
first step? Yeah, that's probably right.

102
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,850
They'd probably going to
do that with like soldiers.

103
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,420
Chefy all the money's in the military.
Yeah, they'll drop the skeleton.

104
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,880
Drop 10 billion on that.
I met social robots,

105
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,190
I saw was at Pachanga casino at the mall.

106
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,620
It's the most ridiculous thing I've
ever weird. I'll fuck that thing up.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,170
The one in the middle, the one in
the middle. I want. So like I said,

108
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,610
I put my hat on it and it said freaking
out. They get mad at you. Yeah.

109
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,370
It just that it's going around
in circles. I would, if it had,

110
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,050
I wish it had a gun on it. Oh No.
Then people will take it seriously.

111
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,510
Well that's the worry
about those dog things.

112
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,420
Those dog like robots that they just
put guns in those motherfuckers.

113
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,370
That is an episode of Black Mirror
episode. No, I didn't see that one. Yeah,

114
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,570
it's called heavy metal. Really? One of
the best episodes. This lady's run out,

115
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,290
the spoiler alert. This ladies running
from these robots had dogs not to have,

116
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,780
I wrote it on something. The dog
looks like one of those things. Yeah,

117
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,990
I gotta check that out.
Yeah.

118
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,210
And it has potential like actual
real technology that it's using.

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,470
So like it's not outlandish things
about black mirror. Everything is, yeah,

120
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,250
that could happen. That's
100% but yeah, even a whole,

121
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,710
the thing where they implant memories
and you like live this crazy fake life.

122
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,200
Right. That's all that's on
the horizon. So you know,

123
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,840
the interesting part about Black Mirror
is that there's a pro and a con to

124
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,520
everything.
So there was a,

125
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,850
an episode where a woman wanted to
keep better track of her daughter.

126
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,140
So she implanted that ship so she could
see whatever her daughter sees, right?

127
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,710
Then her daughter got older and older and
she started to see some wild shit that

128
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:46,580
the kid was doing. Right?
But then to your example,

129
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,610
what would be the downside of putting my
consciousness in someone with a jacket

130
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,370
and like ripped body? Well,
the downside would be,

131
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,230
would you even really be a human anymore
or would you be some sort of a thing

132
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:03,830
that we've created that keeps your
brain alive? Right? But who cares?

133
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,170
Who does care? Yeah.
Well, here's the thing.

134
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,320
Would you want to live
a whole nother life?

135
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,770
Like how much time do you want in this
fake body? Do you want to be a mortal?

136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,470
Do you want to keep going forever?
Not Forever now. I mean, what do well,

137
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,300
at 200 years, you know, there's an
old story about that, about a guy,

138
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,220
God dammit.
It's like an old legend about um,

139
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,150
a man who kept killing his son's
in order to live longer like that.

140
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:31,370
God came to him and told
him if you kill the son,

141
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,230
and he lived to be like
thousands of years old,

142
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,630
but he just had no one around him.
They cared about him and love somebody,

143
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,340
a job in the Bible or something like that,
whatever.

144
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,890
Keep going since from something.
Yeah, I don't remember.

145
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,420
But but point is like when you got
to 200 years, if you said, okay,

146
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,730
I'm going to take this body
and I live in it for 200 years,

147
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,570
200 years I'll be done. That's it. Right?

148
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,330
198 years comes along and you still
like a 30 year old Anderson Silva.

149
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,970
I couldn't do it. You're having
a great time. It's a good point.

150
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:59,360
But you might be like super wise. That's
the other thing. If you think, if you've,

151
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,630
if you think of how smart a person is,

152
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,300
they keep their shit together and they
become like a mature older man who's just

153
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,230
wise and understands
the way the world works.

154
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,660
He was well read and it really is taking
the time to do the work on themselves

155
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:14,360
personally. They know themselves better
than they did when they were young.

156
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,810
Foolish man. That's hopefully
most of us as we get older.

157
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,900
But what if you could live 300 years,
how wise would you be done?

158
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,300
My biggest concern isn't
necessarily about being wise.

159
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:27,290
I think it's about my loved ones cause
like I'll watch, you know what I mean?

160
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,220
Cause you see a lot in 300 if you see a
lot of shit like that's like three wives

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,070
actually maybe four six on who knows.
Right.

162
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,460
But like as they pass you'd be like you
have your kids and like your kid will

163
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:41,240
live to be 80 years old and you're just
like hey you know you your kid a new

164
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:44,660
body. Yeah that's more tend to
want to go on forever though.

165
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:47,510
Cause I feel like what's the world gonna
look like in 300 years? Maybe the dope,

166
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,210
maybe it would be the shit.
Maybe people would be,

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,400
maybe it would you want it done?
You don't mind.

168
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,320
The most fascinating thing I keep
thinking about is us going to and know Eli

169
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,700
Musk really wants that. Do you want to go?
Would you go? Nope. Why not interested?

170
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,190
It's a one way trip. I know. Look, I
don't want to go to Antarctica. Really?

171
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,420
Fuck what I want to go to Mars.

172
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,100
I don't want to go anywhere
where people can't live.

173
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,130
You go to Utah and the woods and
shoot deers and stuff. People live,

174
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,280
they're beautiful. The streams
and trees. It's gorgeous.

175
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,080
But you were just saying that you don't
like when people come up to you at a

176
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:15,720
restaurant,
harass you so like you're living alone.

177
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,960
I like being around people though.
That's why I go to a restaurant.

178
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:22,560
I'm not like in a cave somewhere and
trying to eat. You know what I mean?

179
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,020
I mean there's nothing wrong.
I feel like you would want to do that.

180
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,080
I feel like all this,
all this manly shit that you do,

181
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,100
like men want to just go and just like
light fires and caves and shit and just

182
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:35,010
like do go on. Mars is
stupid. You can't come back.

183
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,950
That's like going to the shittiest
neighborhood in the known universe.

184
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:42,300
Even get to one way. Guess what your
name? Oh yeah, we'll live forever.

185
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,840
We'll live on with doesn't
mean Shit. Assholes. No one
cares. No. What's his name?

186
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:49,140
Lives forever. Hitler. Fuck.
