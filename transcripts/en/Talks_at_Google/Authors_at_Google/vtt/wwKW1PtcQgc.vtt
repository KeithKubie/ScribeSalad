[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:08.300
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Jonny, I
just wanted to ask you first,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.758
can you tell us a little bit
about the genesis of your book

00:00:10.758 --> 00:00:12.980
and your alter ego on the
screen there, Jonny Sun?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.700
JONNY SUN: Sure, yeah.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.158
First of all, thanks
for having me.

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:16.550
And thanks for coming, everyone.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.430
Yeah, sure.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.220
I guess it's inspired
by my work on Twitter.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.420
I started my Twitter account
when I moved to the US.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.670
In Toronto, I was involved
in the comedy scene.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.980
And I had a lot of
friends who were comedians

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.100
and writers and stuff.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.070
And when I moved to the US, I
lost touch with that community,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.790
I guess.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.998
And so I turned to the
internet, and I found Twitter.

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:46.130
And I found this weird
subculture of Twitter comedy

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.920
called "weird Twitter,"
which was just

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.940
a bunch of anonymous accounts
posting surreal jokes

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.530
and poetry and stuff.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.520
And I sort of turned to that
as a place to be creative

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.710
and to continue writing
humor and telling jokes when

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.090
I was in architecture school.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.000
And I've been doing that
for the first six years now,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.590
and I've sort of treated
Twitter as my writer's notebook,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.540
in a sense.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.180
And after a while, I moved here.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.530
I started my PhD at MIT.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.610
And I got really
anxious and depressed

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.340
and overwhelmed with
the program here.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.305
And I needed some sort of
creative outlet, I think,

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.040
to sort of center myself.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.760
And so I turned to Twitter,
and I looked at the notes

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.120
that I put on there.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.810
And I started realizing
that all those tweets start

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.650
to create a story and start
to create a narrative that

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.965
eventually became this book.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:46.340
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
Your alter ego

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.490
specifically-- how did
that vision of that alien

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.165
come about?

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:52.790
JONNY SUN: Well, it kind of goes
to the Twitter anonymity thing

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.530
as well.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.670
In weird Twitter, this
place that I started,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.340
a lot of the accounts
were anonymous.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.910
And there were things like
famous crab or a cool ghost

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.050
or a ghost with sunglasses
or something like that.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.290
And I found that an
alien sort of made sense

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.450
as a natural character for
me because I had always

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.520
felt like an outsider
my entire life.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.490
I think a lot of my
comedy and my perspective

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.390
is based on this
sense of outsiderness.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.750
And I think that's a great
comic perspective to have

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.080
and a very fruitful one.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.940
And so it sort of just
happened naturally.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.980
And I was a literal alien
being a Canadian the US.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.460
And so I think all of
that got wrapped up

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.250
into this character
pretty neatly.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.280
And then, by the time
the book came around,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.020
I had realized that the story
of outsiderness and alienness

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.090
was something really
important to talk about.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.330
And so I wanted to tell like
an alien invasion story,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.610
not from the perspective
of the Earthlings,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.260
but from the alien
who is invading,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.480
and draw a lot of
empathy, and tell

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.500
the internal story of a
visitor coming to a new place,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.150
and relate that to
my own experiences

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.880
and what was going
on at that time.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.240
SANDERS KLEINFELD: I know it's
billed as a work of humor,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.760
but it's very emotionally
resonant and poignant

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.557
throughout.

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:28.640
And I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.220
about striking that balance
between being funny,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.010
but also tugging at
emotional heartstrings

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.250
when you're writing.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.790
JONNY SUN: Right, yeah.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.550
One of the biggest reasons
why I love comedy so much

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.910
is because I think
it's a way in to having

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.710
these other
conversations and to be

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.500
able to speak to other
emotions and speak

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.700
to other sides of the human
psyche and of humanity.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.870
And so I think my
favorite comedy growing up

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.770
has always been the
ones that balance humor

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.250
and a little bit of darkness,
or humor and other things,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.250
and use humor as a tool
to talk about other ideas.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.730
And so for me, I've always been
really excited about the fact

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.029
that you can get someone
on your page with a joke

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.750
and then start to have
another conversation.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.370
The humor works as a tool
to disarm and to empathize

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.310
with someone else.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.520
And then once you sort of
Trojan horse your way in,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.350
you're able to talk
about other things.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.870
And so for me, the
internet was a place

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.710
where I learned to be open about
mental health, for example.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.560
And I learned to talk
about a lot of my anxiety

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.140
and depression in open ways.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.510
Because on Twitter, I had
found these communities

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.070
that were talking
about this stuff

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.230
in open, constructive ways.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.380
And it was kind of a
totally different experience

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.272
than "the real world,"
quote unquote, where

00:05:00.272 --> 00:05:02.480
a lot of, I think, these
conversations around anxiety

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.210
and mental health are
still stigmatized.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.130
People sort of tiptoe
around it, and it's

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.580
a strange conversation,
whereas online, I

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.200
think there were
places and there

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.658
were people and
communities that we

00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:18.090
were talking about this openly
and using humor as a tool,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.450
I think, to address it.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.660
And so I wanted to bring
a lot of that sensibility

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.330
into the book.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.580
On one page, you'll
get a really dumb pun.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.150
And on the next page, I hope
that it explores these deeper

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.240
ideas.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.781
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
What's interesting

00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:38.130
is that Jonny the
alien comes to Earth

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.900
to learn about the humans.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.460
But we don't see any
humans in the actual--

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.190
spoiler alert-- no humans
in the actual graphic novel.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.080
But what you do see is all these
different animal characters

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.590
that are dealing with very
human emotional issues

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.960
around anxiety, imposter
syndrome to a certain degree,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.150
the anxiety of an artist with
the otter who's also an auteur.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.080
JONNY SUN: That's one of
the dumb puns, by the way.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.140
SANDERS KLEINFELD: But
it's sort of interesting

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.630
that, in some ways, it becomes
even more resonant when

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.120
you put it through personas
because all this stuff is

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.550
so stigmatized.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.500
So I was wondering if you had
any thoughts about exploring

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.060
human emotions in that way.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.680
JONNY SUN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.350
In essence, the book is
extremely autobiographical.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:42.420
And each animal becomes a
symbol of each thread of stuff

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.650
that I'm working through.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.040
And so there is a character
that I split off that talks

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.160
about my feelings of
imposter syndrome being here

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.350
in Cambridge and being at
MIT and being surrounded

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.210
by all these brilliant
people and feeling

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.043
like I don't belong.

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:59.100
One of my favorite
characters is a hedgehog

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.730
because the hedgehog
struggles with the idea of how

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:09.210
to make art or how to make
something while feeling totally

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.810
unable to do so.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.692
And I wrote that
character in while I

00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:14.400
was writing the book
because I was trying

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.260
to grapple with my feelings
of writing the book as I

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.440
was writing the book.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.670
And so that became the character
that went through that.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.430
I think the power of
using animals and using

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.140
symbols and characters
and metaphors is--

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.430
it kind of goes back to this
idea of what humor does, too.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:39.570
I think both of these are
ways to filter conversations

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.770
that are more difficult to have
and filter them into easier

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.060
ways to digest them and allow
those conversations to be had

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.700
in ways that doesn't make
someone immediately step back

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.560
and become guarded.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.350
I think it's easier
to talk about anxiety

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.075
through a cute alien character
than to walk up to someone

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:06.660
and be like, I'm really anxious.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.900
Help me.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.260
I need to unload all
this stuff, which

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.550
is I think part of why
I'm interested in using

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.509
these symbols and these
characters in this way.

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.674
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Are any
of the themes in the book

00:08:18.674 --> 00:08:21.510
the same things you're exploring
in your doctoral research?

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.829
JONNY SUN: Sort of, yeah.

00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:25.620
The other element of
the book that I really

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.610
love talking about
is structurally,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.130
I'm really interested
in the book as this way

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.630
to distill a social media
narrative or this idea of how

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.220
we read the internet.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.620
And I wanted to think about--

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.440
this book, for example,
it's about an alien

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.055
who comes to Earth
and then meets

00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:46.680
all these different
characters and gets

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.990
little updates from each of
the characters interspersed

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.230
throughout.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.550
So on one page,
there's a beaver.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.450
On one page, there's a tree.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.320
On one page, there's an egg.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.310
And then it goes
back to the beaver.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.170
And then it jumps
to the egg again.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.220
It's kind of this very
scrambled timeline, which

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.000
if you think about a traditional
kid's book in this form,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.230
I always think about "Winnie the
Pooh," where all the characters

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.760
are divided into chapters.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.497
And so there is a
chapter for the owl,

00:09:10.497 --> 00:09:11.830
and you get the whole owl story.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.204
And there's a
chapter for Eeyore,

00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:14.910
and you get all
of Eeyore's story.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.100
But in this book, I wanted
to do away with the chapters

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.230
and think about how
you could scramble

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.770
all those different pieces of
the story amongst each other.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.600
And to me, that's how we
read social media now.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.450
That's sort of the
Twitter timeline,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.410
in an essence, where
I go on Twitter,

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.520
and I follow 100 people.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.240
And then I get all their
updates interspersed throughout.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.120
And the book was
this test to see

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.030
if that type of narrative
format could still

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.360
work in a traditional medium.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.760
So that was really fun.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.760
And that kind of relates to
my dissertation research,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.380
which is primarily about how
social media forms community

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.800
and how different people
can come together and find

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.110
each other online.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.430
And I think that's sort of
what the book, both formally

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.579
and content-wise, is about.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:14.620
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Right.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.600
So you talked a lot about
the positive aspects

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.210
of finding community online.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.560
There's an anonymity
aspect to it

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.690
where you can sort of
create your own persona.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.540
But there's also obviously
a dark side to that as well.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.380
So do you have
thoughts on that--

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.620
where things are going
well in terms of community

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.560
and how we can ameliorate
some of these issues?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.350
Twitter-- it's this
timeline of positive stuff.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.860
And then all of
a sudden, there's

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.414
this toxic brew underneath the
surface that comes bubbling up.

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:45.080
JONNY SUN: Yeah.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.890
I think it's something
that anyone on Twitter

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.910
has to grapple with
and has to deal with.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.990
I've seen it firsthand.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.410
And I've seen a lot
of my friends deal

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.520
with the dog piling and
the bad side of Twitter

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.400
and the alt-right and the white
supremacists and the Nazis.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.870
And if I keep
talking about this,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.060
I'll get really depressed.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.000
But I think it's
absolutely something that

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.940
needs to be addressed.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.940
One of the things I've
been thinking about a lot

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.050
recently is how a lot of
the community-forming tools

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:22.250
and the ways that a lot of the
good stuff happens on Twitter

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.070
is sort of almost
the same technique

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:34.020
that the bad side will take and
use to do their work as well.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:39.440
And so I think a lot
right now about this idea

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.690
that platforms and
technologies are neutral.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:48.962
And this way that Twitter steps
back from any of the problems

00:11:48.962 --> 00:11:50.420
going on in the
platform by saying,

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.466
oh, we don't have a say
in how people use it.

00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:56.090
We're just going to
let people use it--

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.530
that's a political
stance in itself.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.050
And I think it caused
a lot of problems.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.300
And I think the next step for
this mentality about technology

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.540
is to say that these
platforms are not neutral

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.680
and that we need
to take a stronger

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.295
stance in how people use them
and what they're used for.

00:12:20.295 --> 00:12:21.920
SANDERS KLEINFELD:
To a certain extent,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.220
too, the platforms
and the technology

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.140
set the rules of engagement.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.620
So on Twitter, for example,
because most people choose

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.857
to do public feeds in order
to get their message out,

00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:35.690
and these systems that
are in place that let

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.300
anybody mention each other--

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.650
it creates an environment
where you can have

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.630
those sorts of interactions.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.540
So I'm wondering
if in your research

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.800
you looked into any ways
that technology mediates

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.870
the interactions
that we have and what

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.425
are good choices to make
in order to support that.

00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:55.550
JONNY SUN: Well, it's
something that I'm definitely

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.110
interested in researching.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.030
Just off the top
of my head, I've

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.760
been really interested
in how Twitter

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.561
seems to be the place where all
this conversation is happening

00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:05.060
now.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.601
And it's sort of a place where
all of this community building

00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:10.280
is happening now as opposed
to the other big social media

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.420
platforms, like
Instagram and Facebook.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.360
If you look at
Instagram, for example,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.870
there's not really a way for
two people to interact directly.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.696
Instagram is a much more
broadcast-type platform,

00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:26.570
where you post a thing,
and then other people

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.440
can comment on the thing.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.114
It's much harder to have
a one-to-one conversation

00:13:32.114 --> 00:13:33.530
on Instagram, which
is why I think

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.310
community doesn't form in the
way that it does on Twitter.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.190
But on Twitter, you're right.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.940
It's all public.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.530
And now with the
quote tweets, I think

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:51.140
there's a way to broadcast ideas
in ways that are not strictly

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.350
one-to-one.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.410
If I quote tweet someone,
I've noticed actually a lot--

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.690
I've stopped doing
this for this reason.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.580
Because if I quote tweet
someone who I don't like

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:11.205
or has said something
mean to me in some way,

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:12.830
I've noticed that a
lot of my followers

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.330
will then take
that as permission

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.180
to start dog piling this
critic of mine, for example.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.310
And it creates a more
toxic environment

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.880
where if I say, oh, you
can all see this person

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.760
and you can now respond to
this person, a lot of people

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:34.280
will start to
respond badly, right?

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.330
I've stopped doing it because
I think it's not the right way

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:37.830
to do it.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.290
I don't know what the right way
to have a good discourse is.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.070
But I know plenty of wrong
ways from experiencing

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.510
both sides of it.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.510
SANDERS KLEINFELD: I was
talking to some friends

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.970
late last week about
when we're interacting

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.790
with each other in person,
there are certain rules

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.790
of etiquette and
certain moral standards

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.320
that we uphold just by nature of
seeing a person in front of us

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.286
and recognizing their humanity.

00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:07.160
And it's interesting.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.970
When we go online, we
can craft our own persona

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.560
and our own humanity
the way we want.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.360
But we sometimes
fail to recognize

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.440
other people's humanity.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.900
We think it's OK to
talk in a certain way

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.140
that we would
never do in person.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.990
So I'm wondering
if there is a way

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.980
to bring that aspect of humanity
into these virtual communities

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.110
where it's really up in your
face, hey, this is a person.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.230
JONNY SUN: Right, yeah.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.390
I've been thinking a
lot about that, too.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.280
I think Twitter gets a lot
of criticism because of its

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.640
short-handedness and
the fact that in 200--

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.320
it used to be 140, now 280--

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.300
characters, it's still hard for
people to get a full story in.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.460
I think people are
trying really hard

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.550
to work within those
confines to be nuanced

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:02.292
and to have more of a full
picture to what they're saying.

00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:03.500
And that's through threading.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.490
And that's through these
longer conversations

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.820
that they're having
on the medium.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.500
But I think it's
really difficult.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.650
And I think it's a
lot easier to not

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.902
recognize the person
you're talking

00:16:17.902 --> 00:16:20.360
to on the other side of the
screen is a person, because you

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:27.020
just see a text handle
and a bio and an image,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.700
as opposed to a person
sitting on a screen typing

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.350
this stuff out.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.100
And I don't know how to
address that, really,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.480
because I don't know if the
solution is to give everyone

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.642
pictures of who they are and
allow everyone to see exactly

00:16:45.642 --> 00:16:46.850
who it is they're talking to.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.550
Because they think
anonymity has been

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.930
really powerful in a lot of good
ways in terms of, for example,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.220
political dissent, where the
most marginalized communities

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.120
and the most targeted members
of certain communities

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.849
can't put their real
identities out there

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:09.079
and can't speak against
power by putting

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.089
their real faces online.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:16.160
And so I think anonymity is a
great way for those communities

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.109
and for members of those
communities to have a voice

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.760
and to have a say.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.700
And so I don't know.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.187
I think it's such a big problem.

00:17:26.187 --> 00:17:28.020
And I think we're right
in the middle of it,

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.060
and I think it's super messy.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm just as curious
as to anyone on how

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.877
it's all going to turn out.

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:37.710
SANDERS KLEINFELD: You
recently put together

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.510
Tiny Care Bot, which
is just a bot that

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.080
tweets self-care
messages for people

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.170
to engage with them
on that human level.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.730
It's interesting
that in some ways,

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.190
technology can even be more
humane than the people using it

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.867
when applied.

00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:56.450
I'm curious what
kind of uptake you've

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.720
seen on that and
response from people.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.227
Do they like a bot
tweeting at them

00:18:01.227 --> 00:18:03.560
saying you should drink more
water and things like that?

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.226
JONNY SUN: Yeah.

00:18:04.226 --> 00:18:09.390
So Tiny Care Bot is this
really simple bot that I made.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:13.580
It sends hourly reminders of
little actionable self-care

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.150
tools.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.710
And I built it, actually,
for me personally to use.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.970
I built it in November
of 2016 because something

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.320
happened during that time
that made me really upset.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.210
And it kept me on Twitter a lot.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.880
And I found that days after,
for the whole week or a while

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.690
after the election, I was glued
to Twitter because I thought

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.360
that getting updates and
seeing all this stuff

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:48.380
would somehow help me
understand what was going on.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.190
I was caught in this cycle of
just being stuck to my phone

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.780
and stuck to the
news and everything.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.060
And at some point, I
realized I needed to get off.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.340
And I needed to take
care of myself better.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.430
And so ironically, I built
this thing on the platform

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.420
that I was using to tell
me to get off of it.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.330
And I built it
because I wanted it

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.780
to show up in between
all the other updates.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.260
I thought the best
way to enact change

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.680
was to have an agent
on the same platform

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.170
that I was sort of
stuck on right now.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:29.270
And I built that, and
then I tweeted about it.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:33.980
I think it was the right time
and the right sort of types

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.640
of self-care actions
that it related

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.230
to a lot of other
people as well.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.440
And it's absolutely not the
first self-care bot on Twitter.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.010
And it's not the first
one that anyone's done.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.430
But I think at that point
and the specific types

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.730
of tweets it was
tweeting made it really

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.652
resonate with a lot of people.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:55.860
SANDERS KLEINFELD: It's good.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.414
We need more messages telling
us when we should engage,

00:19:59.414 --> 00:20:00.830
when we should
disengage, I think,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.612
because it can really
be overwhelming.

00:20:05.612 --> 00:20:07.070
You want to read
some of your book?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.750
JONNY SUN: Sure, yeah.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.622
Let's do a reading.

00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:10.455
Do people have copies
of the book right now?

00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:12.610
I like to do it as a
read-along for anyone who

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.484
has a copy of the book.

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:16.150
And if not, the slides
are up here, too.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.590
So we can do that as well.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.960
But let's start
on the first page

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.080
if you have a copy of the book.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.570
It's the page with
the four UFOs on it.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.350
Whoosh.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.890
In comes a spaceship, carrying
the night sky with it.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.820
Wobble wobble, screech, thump.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.752
The spaceship lands.

00:20:38.752 --> 00:20:41.265
Out come a bunch of aliens.

00:20:41.265 --> 00:20:43.015
Please find out about
the Earth creatures,

00:20:43.015 --> 00:20:44.800
says the first alien.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.010
Humans, says the second
alien, pointing to a bird.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.230
Yes, humans, says
the third alien,

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.540
pointing to a tuft of grass.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.410
Take your time.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.190
Really, take as much time as
you need, says the fourth alien.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.892
So you're leaving me here
all alone, asks Jomny.

00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:03.100
Well, we'll check up on you
in case you mess anything

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.430
up, says the fifth alien.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.611
OK, says Jomny, still worried.

00:21:07.611 --> 00:21:09.860
Can we go already, says the
sixth alien, already bored

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.447
of this planet.

00:21:12.447 --> 00:21:14.530
And so off they go, taking
the night sky with them

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.640
as they leave.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.120
"Everyone's a Aliebn
When Ur a Aliebn, Too--

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.280
A Book."

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.790
Jomny walks along and
happens upon a tree.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.390
Hello.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.730
Are you a Earth
creature, Jomny asks.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.920
Yes, says the tree.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.070
I have met a human, says Jomny,
contentedly walking away.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.700
Jomny sees a snail and
kneels down and says,

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.590
tell me about yourself, to which
the snail responds, oh, gee.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.550
Well, nobody's ever
asked me about myself.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.050
Well, I guess
everybody tells me I'm

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.420
too small and too slow to make
a difference in this world.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.253
But I'm making a
difference in my own world,

00:21:52.253 --> 00:21:54.652
and I hope that's enough.

00:21:54.652 --> 00:21:57.860
Jomny comes up to a bear
and starts poking the bear.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.950
Wow, you're big, says Jomny,
not knowing what a bear is.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.070
Are you going to run screaming
from me then, asks the bear.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.160
No, says Jomny, continuing
to poke the bear.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.830
Oh, thank you, says the bear.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.509
Meanwhile, all the
other Earth creatures

00:22:12.509 --> 00:22:13.800
are running away from the bear.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.960
And the turtle screams, run!

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.310
Run as fast as you can!

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.940
Faster!

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.840
Save yourselves!

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.670
Leave me behind and
save yourselves!

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.970
Run, R-U-N, run, says
one particular bee.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.470
Jomny keeps walking
and comes across a dog.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.720
And the dog says a word that
can roughly be translated

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.730
to the symbol of a heart.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.560
I do not understand that
word, says Jomny, but OK.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.170
Jomny comes across an egg.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.600
Hello, what are you, asks Jomny.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.280
I don't know yet, says the egg.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.810
OK, says Jomny.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.820
Isn't that exciting, says the
egg, shaking with excitement.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.910
Jomny comes across a hedgehog
and asks, who are you?

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.550
Oh, I'm an introvert, which is
different from an extrovert,

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.720
says the hedgehog.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.430
What's that, Jomny asks.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.620
Well, introverts
enjoy people-watching.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.480
Extroverts enjoy
people watching.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.796
It's a grammar joke.

00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:09.150
[LAUGHING]

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.080
OK, says Jomny, looking
at a flower, who he

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.300
decides must be an extrovert.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.190
The flower has the
attention of all the bees

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.160
and is saying, oh, yeah,
bees, you like this?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.070
You like what I got?

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.140
You like what you see?

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.750
Because there's plenty
of me to go around.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:26.880
And one particular
bee says, hi, H-I, hi.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.950
Jomny comes across a pond.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.020
Swim, splash.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.660
You swim very nicely,
says Jomny to the otter.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.260
Of course.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.090
I'm an auteur, says the otter.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.160
Hello, otter, says Jomny.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.140
Swim, swim.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.530
The otter rises.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.030
No, wait.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.370
I'm an auteur, says the
otter, trying to clarify.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.300
Jomny comes across
a smaller pond

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.100
and sees a bunch of
smaller creatures.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.290
Hello, who are you, Jomny asks.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.500
It's not about who we are.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.130
It's about what we will
become, says the caterpillar.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.740
That's the gift of being
a baby, says the tadpole.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.850
Isn't it exciting, says the egg
again, shaking with excitement.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.730
Jomny thinks of the idea of a
gift and goes up to the tree

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.410
and asks, what is a gift?

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:09.810
Can I have a gift?

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.892
And the tree says,
oh, I actually

00:24:11.892 --> 00:24:13.600
learned to stop giving
things to somebody

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.306
just because they
want something.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.662
The tree frowns knowingly.

00:24:21.662 --> 00:24:23.370
I don't think that
would end well for me.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.760
Jomny asks, what if
I give you a hug?

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.590
And the tree says,
oh, I love hugs.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.506
But really, you don't
have to give me anything

00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:34.860
to be my friend.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.310
What's a friend, asks Jomny.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.860
A friend is anyone or anything
who shares a life with you

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.200
that you would never be able
to experience without them,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.610
says the tree.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.370
Jomny thinks about this and
walks up to a bird and says,

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:48.090
hello, friend.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.899
You used to be a dinosaur.

00:24:49.899 --> 00:24:51.690
Then Jomny walks up to
a skeleton and says,

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.290
hello, friend.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.360
You used to be a baby.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.360
The tree pulls Jomny
aside and says, maybe

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.160
stay away from that friend.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.460
OK, says Jomny.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.780
Jomny comes across an onion.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.595
And the onion says,
I'm like an onion.

00:25:05.595 --> 00:25:08.220
Peel back the layers, and you'll
see that deep down inside, I'm

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.860
just a smaller,
more afraid onion.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.100
But you are an onion,
says Jomny helpfully.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.160
Yes, I know that.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:20.630
But now I want to cry, says the
onion, feeling misunderstood.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.210
Jomny comes across an owl
and says, hello, friend.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.540
Who are you?

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.830
Who, who who, asked the owl.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:28.910
Who am I?

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.110
I don't really know.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.820
Everybody calls
me wise, and I've

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.800
tried to learn very
much about the world.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.210
But I don't feel very wise.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.310
And I know that owls
are supposed to be wise,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.440
so then I don't feel
owl enough to be an owl.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.480
I feel like one day,
I'll meet another owl.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.000
And they'll take one look
at me and say, oh, somebody

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.050
made a mistake.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.960
You're not supposed
to be an owl at all.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.922
Anyway, who are
you, asked the owl.

00:25:54.922 --> 00:25:57.260
I'm Jomny, says Jomny.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.470
Oh, lucky, says the owl.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.720
Jomny comes across the
bees again and asks,

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.680
will you be my friends?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.480
And the bees say,
sorry, we can't.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.560
We're afraid we'll
accidentally sting you.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.090
Jomny comes across the
beaver and shouts, wait!

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.190
Hello, friend, as
the beaver runs by.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.660
And the beaver
responds, I'm sorry.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.501
I'm sorry.

00:26:16.501 --> 00:26:17.250
I have work to do.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.360
I don't have time
to be your friend.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:18.860
I'm sorry.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.730
Can't you see I'm
in a hurry here?

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.060
The beaver's Canadian,
hence all the apologies.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.620
The beaver runs past the tree.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.660
And the tree says, oh, don't
bother with that dam beaver.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.240
But I need to work,
says the beaver.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.060
Please stay out of
my dam business.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.820
Then please stop stealing my
branches, shouts the tree.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.560
They're not yours,
shouts the beaver.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.160
Yes they are, shouts the tree.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:42.660
I'm sorry.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.240
They're my dam branches
now, shouts the beaver.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.680
Those are my arms,
shouts the tree.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.742
What if I never
hatch, shouts the egg.

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:53.200
Or what if I do hatch, and it's
the best moment of my life,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.970
but then I never
get to hatch again?

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.180
What if I want to hatch
but also never hatch?

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.207
Can I do both or neither?

00:27:00.207 --> 00:27:01.165
Why are you so worried?

00:27:01.165 --> 00:27:04.560
You're an egg, says Jomny.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.580
That's not fair.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.550
You already know who
you are, says the egg.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.880
But your an egg, says
Jomny, trying to help.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.890
The egg rolls over on its side.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.620
You just don't get
it, says the egg.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.892
Oh, says Jomny, sadly.

00:27:19.892 --> 00:27:21.600
Jomny walks along and
sees the dog again.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.099
And the dog says another word
that can roughly be translated

00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:25.621
to the symbol of a heart.

00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:27.120
I still do not know
what that means,

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.954
but I know that I'm
happy now, says Jomny.

00:27:29.954 --> 00:27:31.620
Meanwhile, the spaceship
flies in again,

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.170
carrying the night sky with it.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.790
Jomny runs up to the aliens
and says, I like the humans.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.600
They're all so different, and I
wish I could be more like them.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.150
You're not supposed to like
them, says the first alien.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.880
You're supposed to research
them, says the second alien.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.340
I do not like them,
says the third alien.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.610
He should be more like
us, says the fourth alien.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.040
He's already too weird,
says the fifth alien.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.860
Yeah, says the sixth alien,
agreeing with the fifth alien.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.530
The humans are weird,
says the seventh alien.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.240
Yeah, says the eighth
alien, agreeing

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.310
with the seventh alien.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.170
And so off they go
again, leaving Jomny

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.080
alone with the night
sky to contemplate.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.387
And that's where we'll
stop the reading.

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:10.095
Thanks, everyone.

00:28:10.095 --> 00:28:12.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.620
SANDERS KLEINFELD: So we'll
open things up to questions now.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.870
AUDIENCE: I liked what
you said about mixing

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.184
humor and darkness.

00:28:24.184 --> 00:28:25.600
And that immediately
made me think

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.917
of "A Softer World" and maybe
a few other Canadian artists

00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:32.050
specifically.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.830
So I was wondering, you
mentioned the Canadian beaver

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:36.400
in here.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.720
Do you feel, especially having
a bit of an outside perspective

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.320
spending a lot of time in the
US at this point, anything

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.950
particularly Canadian
about the work that you do

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:52.180
or the milieu that
you find yourself in?

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.080
JONNY SUN: Because I've grown
up Canadian and I am Canadian,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.300
it's hard for me to sort of
see outside of myself a bit

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.270
to understand what it
is about the work that--

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.260
and people do respond
and say this makes sense

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.570
that someone Canadian wrote it.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.990
And I'm not entirely sure
what element of it it is.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:18.000
I think there is a bit more of
a kindness and a bit more of a--

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.880
I've heard this metaphor used
across Canada and the US,

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:27.340
where the US is a melting
pot, and Canada is a salad.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.300
The idea in the US is that
everyone comes and is expected

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.300
to ameliorate into this
single American identity,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.025
whereas in Canada, I think
that the approach is more

00:29:39.025 --> 00:29:40.650
of a celebration of
all the differences

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.490
and of all the diverse pieces.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.074
And I think
ultimately, the story

00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:45.490
that I wanted to
tell in this book

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.110
is a celebration of all the
differences and the idea

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.290
that all these different
personalities and creatures

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.430
and personas can all
coexist and get along--

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.820
not by becoming the
same, but by celebrating

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.420
what's different about them.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.580
So I think maybe
that's part of it.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.860
And yeah, I really do
love "A Softer World."

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.280
And I grew up reading
that webcomic.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.470
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.290
I think there is a bit
about perhaps Canadian--

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.280
I don't want to speak to a broad
thing, so I'm not going to.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.560
But yeah, I don't know.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.800
I'm not sure.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.645
Thanks.

00:30:29.645 --> 00:30:30.575
AUDIENCE: Hey, Jonny.

00:30:33.346 --> 00:30:35.290
I just wanted to say
I really appreciate

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.130
how open you've been about
talking about mental illness.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.120
But once your private
persona became more public,

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.600
did that change the way you
talked about it or the way

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.020
people in your life or
professional people treated you

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.120
or your own stigma
around your experience?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.160
JONNY SUN: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.940
I think I definitely got--

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.440
let's see.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.370
I think for a while, I didn't
have the right language

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.090
to talk about it.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.860
And I didn't grow up
knowing that I, too, could

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.020
have anxiety and depression.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.300
And I didn't know that
therapy, for example,

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.000
was an option for me until I
started reading about it online

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.200
and until I started befriending
people on the internet who

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.120
were talking about
therapy and talking

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.060
about mental health a lot.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.580
So I think for me, a
lot of why I really

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.060
care about talking about
this stuff in a public way

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.510
is because I know
how much it helped me

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.520
when I didn't know
about it and when

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.680
I had a stigmatized internal
idea of what mental health was.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.490
And so I think I'm trying
now to give back to--

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:52.750
I know a lot of people follow
me and see what I'm saying.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:57.040
I'm trying to in my own
way continue to pass it on

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.980
and to continue to
destigmatize and normalize

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.170
these conversations.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.780
But I definitely
think it's become--

00:32:10.557 --> 00:32:12.140
because I'm so public
with it, I think

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.570
it's become something I have to
be really careful about, too.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:21.560
And I never want to
say anything that

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:27.896
brings up any sort of
false stigmas or biases.

00:32:27.896 --> 00:32:29.270
I think for the
most part, people

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:36.340
are really open and
kind about it in person,

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.440
because you asked about how
it affects me now in person.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.560
And I think part of that is
self-selecting in the sense

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.520
that I don't want to be friends
with someone who is going

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.380
to be like, well, that's dumb.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.480
Pull yourself up.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.410
And I think it's
sort of interesting,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.750
because I think the more
I've been open about it,

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:02.270
the more people
know that about me.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.960
I think just the fact that
I am open about it opens up

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.770
the conversation
for other people.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:12.530
And I think if I'm setting the
stage of how to talk about it,

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:18.560
I think it allows others to
come into that conversation

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.430
in a different way.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.760
So I found it really
helpful for the most part,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.891
but it's also really
scary all the time.

00:33:25.891 --> 00:33:26.390
Thanks.

00:33:29.277 --> 00:33:29.860
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.440
So I was checking out
your Twitter earlier,

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.730
and I saw that you tweet
a lot of funny stuff.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.960
JONNY SUN: Thank you.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.170
AUDIENCE: I also used to try
to tweet funny stuff on Twitter

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:47.750
with some success and
a lot of failed tweets.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.940
And I was just interested
in your perspective

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:56.570
on the tweet writing process
and when you think of a joke

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.920
or think of something that
you think could be funny--

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.370
because it also has
to fit the format.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:06.225
And you have to phrase it
correctly and things like that.

00:34:06.225 --> 00:34:08.600
And that makes a big difference,
especially when you have

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.670
so many followers and stuff--

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.600
how many people even see it.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.120
So I was wondering
if you could just

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.280
comment on your methodology
and maybe give me some tips.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.699
JONNY SUN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:24.360
First, to start off, I've
been on Twitter for so long.

00:34:28.218 --> 00:34:29.960
Six or seven years
ago, I was tweeting

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.670
jokes with hashtags
at the end of it,

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.750
like so-and-so, #joke, #pun.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.889
And it took me a while
to understand or fall

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:44.480
into a community
and understand how

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.130
to tell these jokes in a
way that suits the format

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:55.520
and works with the medium.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.530
And I think the thing
that really switched

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.850
for me was when I stopped
just trying to tell

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.980
jokes to get jokes out there.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.410
And it switched when I started
seeing this group of writers

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.970
that I looked up
to as a community.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.860
Twitter became really fun for me
when I started realizing, oh, I

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.790
just want to make jokes with
these other people I admire.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.750
And it sort of
became much more of--

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.250
it wasn't about getting views
or getting likes or whatever.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:29.172
It was about, well, let's
riff off each other.

00:35:29.172 --> 00:35:31.130
And let's treat this as
this big writer's room.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.040
And I think that's when
I started really loving

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.990
it and finding that
all of us together

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.990
had come across
this type of joke

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.860
telling that people
appreciated in a way.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.070
I think now, I'm very
conscious about how

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.890
Twitter humor is very different
from other forms of humor

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:53.750
and other mediums.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.660
And even in trying to adapt
some of the jokes I wrote

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.700
on Twitter into the
book, there were a lot

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.540
that I just
immediately struck off.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.160
I think on Twitter,
there's a lot

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.904
of value in the
real-time nature of it.

00:36:06.904 --> 00:36:09.320
And I think that's one of the
strengths of Twitter humor--

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:14.780
is that you can comment on
stuff as it happens right away.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.410
Easily, that's political
humor and stuff about politics

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.580
and current events.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.550
But it's also just being
part of the conversation

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.680
as it's happening
and taking a meme

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:33.340
and restructuring it and
playing on it as it's fun

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.400
and in the ethos.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.515
So one joke that I wanted
to put in the book was Jomny

00:36:40.515 --> 00:36:42.890
looking at a cloud and being
like, how do I make friends?

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.640
And then a bigger cloud
shows up and says,

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.570
don't talk to me or
my son ever again.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.190
And that obviously
doesn't make sense now

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.210
because that was like two
years old at this point.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.760
Yeah, this guy gets it.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.030
I think I wanted to make
sure that the book was less

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:12.180
connected to this real-time,
fast paced, constantly updating

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.250
type of humor that
Twitter is good at.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:20.940
I also think Twitter has made
me a more conscious writer

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.560
in terms of
structure and format.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.090
And I turned to
Twitter originally

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.580
because of the short format.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.151
And it really allowed me
to strip away the extra

00:37:29.151 --> 00:37:30.900
and to really figure
out what the joke was

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.472
and how to tell it properly.

00:37:33.472 --> 00:37:35.680
And I think it's made me a
better writer in the sense

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.360
that I get to the
idea quicker, and I

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.615
get punchier and punchier.

00:37:42.615 --> 00:37:45.240
I think one of the downfalls is
that now when I try to sit down

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.630
and write a longer piece, I
can write three tweets' worth

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.372
of ideas and be like, that's it.

00:37:50.372 --> 00:37:51.330
That's the whole essay.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.070
I don't need to write more.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.382
But yeah, I hope that answers
part of your question.

00:37:56.382 --> 00:37:57.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
definitely does.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.520
I'll take some of
your tips to heart.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.186
JONNY SUN: Cool.

00:38:00.186 --> 00:38:02.302
Awesome.

00:38:02.302 --> 00:38:04.080
Hey.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.830
AUDIENCE: How's it been being
a creative, artistic person

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.900
with your art out there
and then also dealing

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.080
with the professional
world of graduate school?

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.930
How did your advisor or
colleagues or whatever

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:19.530
receive that you're writing
a book, being a Twitter

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.880
humorist, all of that stuff?

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.588
JONNY SUN: Right.

00:38:21.588 --> 00:38:24.600
I think luckily, I've found--

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.560
again, it's like that
self-selecting idea.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.990
But I think I found
advisors who understand

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.690
what it is that I'm
trying to do on Twitter

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.150
and are deeply supportive of it.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:44.700
My thought in terms of how do
I merge this creative pursuit

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:49.620
with an academic pursuit is what
sorts of learning experiences

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.678
do I have in this
online world in practice

00:38:54.678 --> 00:38:57.300
that I can look at
in an academic way

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:04.180
or that helps inform
me on how to have

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.400
an academic
conversation about it.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.760
I'm sure there are a lot
of professors and people

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.630
in the academic world who
are like, this is dumb.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.920
They don't get it.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.900
But I've been lucky enough that
my advisors really understand

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.960
it and are really
supportive of it.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.092
So yeah, that's
been really great.

00:39:27.092 --> 00:39:28.050
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.580
JONNY SUN: Thanks.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.300
Actually, I do want to add, too.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.200
I think this type of
study, the sociological

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.550
study of the internet and of
internet culture and media

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.580
studies, that type of thing, is
getting more and more traction

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.400
now.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.120
When I started at MIT, I wanted
to look at data-driven cities

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.450
and understand like
urban processes

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.300
through big data, which is
totally different than where

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.630
I've ended up, which is network
cultures and the study of media

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.010
and internet and community.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.490
And it really is
because at MIT, there

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.390
were a few comparative media
studies classes that directly

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:14.280
talked about internet culture
and memes and all the stuff

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.630
that we're talking about now.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.520
And it was just cool to me that
there were people studying it.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.890
And I think there's been a
huge community I found that has

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.110
been really interested.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.285
I'm part of the
Berkman Klein center.

00:40:29.652 --> 00:40:31.860
It's the Berkman Klein Center
of Internet and Society

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.526
over at Harvard.

00:40:32.526 --> 00:40:35.430
And they're really interested
in the confluence of internet

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.250
and society and politics
and activism and AI

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:43.821
and all these human elements
that compose the internet.

00:40:43.821 --> 00:40:45.570
And so I think it's
really cool that there

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.850
are people and pockets that are
really interested in this type

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.350
of stuff.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:52.610
Thanks.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.790
AUDIENCE: You were talking
about anonymity on Twitter

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.770
and some of the
other social media

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:04.130
networks and its
influence on poor behavior

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.520
and how maybe humanizing
it would help with that.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.116
I'm curious why you
believe that's the case.

00:41:12.116 --> 00:41:13.490
Here at Google,
we've got a bunch

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.100
of internal social
networks, and it's

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.930
100% known who everybody is.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:19.940
People still opt out
of showing faces.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.902
They still shitpost.

00:41:20.902 --> 00:41:21.610
They still troll.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.260
Even face-to-face, I think
about watching conversations

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.760
around here.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.410
And you like to think that
you'll treat people as more

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.970
human because its face-to-face.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.790
And people will still treat
each other pretty badly

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.060
on an ongoing basis--

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.540
the coworkers they spend
all their time with.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.600
So why do you think humanizing
the internet would help?

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.090
JONNY SUN: I think
being able to see

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.910
that the people you're
interacting with

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:57.590
are three-dimensional people
is the basis of any sort

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:02.005
of empathetic conversation
and empathetic connection

00:42:02.005 --> 00:42:02.630
to that person.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:08.000
And I think that
forms the basis of how

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.080
I believe we can move forward.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.530
I think there's such
a divide right now.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:16.580
And I'm not saying
go make friends

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.990
with someone who is targeting
you and who wants you

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:26.810
and everyone who you identify
with to be killed or something.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.650
But I think on a
day-to-day level,

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:34.820
it helps build community.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.940
The communities that
I've found on Twitter

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.420
have been really helpful
for me because of the fact

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.450
that they are just
a lot of people

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.330
humanizing and empathizing
with each other.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:48.950
I think the question
of anonymity

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:55.370
is different when you talk
about a general completely

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.530
accessible-- or not
completely accessible,

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:01.160
but a general platform
like Twitter where

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.460
anyone from anywhere could
have a voice as opposed

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.290
to somewhere like
Google, which is

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.010
a self-selected kind of group.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:16.820
In a place like a workplace,
I think anonymity is still

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.930
valuable in certain ways.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:23.810
But I think there's less
of a danger associating

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:27.440
what you say with your face.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.470
I think if you're
online and you're

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.850
like a member of a
very persecuted group,

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:37.460
you can't really put your
face on what you're saying,

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:42.620
or else people will find
you and identify you.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.240
And I think that
sort of danger isn't

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:51.840
present in a place of employment
perhaps, or less dangerous.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.490
AUDIENCE: So it seems
a tenant of faith

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.210
that humanizing the internet
will somehow solve this.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:00.940
We've tried the
experiment and found--

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.570
I don't think it did.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.840
So I'm curious, since you're
doing PhD research on this,

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.310
was there any evidence?

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:09.650
Or is it just a tenant
of faith at this point?

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:14.340
JONNY SUN: Right now it's an
unsubstantiated hypothesis.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:19.001
I'm super curious to
see how it plays out.

00:44:19.001 --> 00:44:20.750
And I'd love to talk
to you more about it.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.370
I've just finished my
PhD exams, and so I'm

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:29.789
going into the research mode.

00:44:29.789 --> 00:44:30.830
And so this is actually--

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:31.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:31.845
Thank you.

00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:32.580
Thank you.

00:44:35.415 --> 00:44:38.030
So actually, this is
the right point for me

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:40.880
to really figure out what
the research is going to be.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.358
And so I'm excited and
happy to talk more about it.

00:44:44.358 --> 00:44:46.402
Thanks.

00:44:46.402 --> 00:44:47.360
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jonathan.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.020
Thank you so much for taking the
time to answer our questions.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:55.540
I'm Snow, and I do
drawings and some painting.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.850
And so I'm curious about
your artistic work process.

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:04.370
So you mentioned that you
are an artist slash a writer.

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:07.190
So could you just talk
about your experience

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.880
with art, what led
you to this project,

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.710
and what kind of
artistic inspiration

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:16.220
or creative decision
you made that were

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.404
fundamental to this project?

00:45:18.404 --> 00:45:19.070
JONNY SUN: Sure.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:20.270
Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:21.860
I'd love to talk about that.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:29.160
I've grown up drawing and
being involved in visual design

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.010
and trying to learn different
methods of communication

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.720
through a visual medium.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:42.230
And for a while, I was really
into painting and street

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:48.020
art and these very lush,
detailed drawings and graphics

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.150
and processes.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:51.860
And when I went to
architecture school,

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.693
I actually got really
into technical drawing

00:45:53.693 --> 00:45:59.550
and like these very detailed 3D
axonometric intricate things.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.700
And so I had all
that under my belt

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.800
and in my head when I
started thinking about what

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.250
this book would look like.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.300
And I really wanted to
make a conscious effort

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.570
to step back from that
and to minimalize it

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:17.090
as much as possible and
to make the characters as

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:20.930
simple as possible--

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.510
almost resembling icons
more than characters--

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.760
and finding the
balance between how

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.280
do you make this
simple, relatable icon

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.950
image while still
giving that icon enough

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:38.120
character and enough humanity
and enough relatability,

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.660
I guess, to be a character.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.695
And so that's sort
of where I landed.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.840
For example, the aesthetic
language of this book

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.020
is no corners.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.640
Everything is curves, right?

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.920
And I really tried to
make it as bubbly and as

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.940
soft-looking as possible.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.630
And some of the fun details,
like even Jomny the character--

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.350
I'm just looking at it now--

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:10.550
there is a little bit of
formal structure to him

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:14.900
because he's three circles, the
belly and the two circles that

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.430
comprise the bean.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.680
And the rule that
I used internally

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.170
was the two circles
that comprise the head--

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.260
the distance that they
overlap is the same distance

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.200
that the body circle is
away from the second circle.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.935
And so there's a little bit
of a math formula involved

00:47:29.935 --> 00:47:32.060
in that, which is my
architecture background coming

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.340
out.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.140
But for the most part,
I tried to keep it

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.290
as simple-looking as possible.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:40.949
And I found that's
been really cool.

00:47:40.949 --> 00:47:42.740
And black and white
thing has been cool too

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.400
because people on Twitter
have started coloring the book

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.340
and sharing with me.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:52.070
And for me, seeing how other
people interpret the book

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.560
and how they color it
has been really cool,

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.590
because it sort of makes it
theirs as much as it is mine.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:02.960
It sort of creates
this cool connection.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.763
So yeah, thanks.

00:48:07.194 --> 00:48:07.860
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.276
I'm just making notes here on
the geometric deconstruction

00:48:10.276 --> 00:48:11.370
of the alien.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.500
No, actually, I'm
just here to thank you

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.770
for leaving us this book as a
timeless artifact as opposed

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:21.090
to Twitter, which is this, as
you said, very in the moment

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:21.590
artifact.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:23.696
And they both provide
different benefits.

00:48:23.696 --> 00:48:25.320
But this at least is
something that you

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.830
can return to later without
necessarily all that context.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.925
And I wanted to pass
along the best book

00:48:31.925 --> 00:48:33.300
review of this
which I've gotten,

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.090
which I got from my
kids, specifically

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.560
my daughter, who
was 6 at the time.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.474
After we had read a
few pages together,

00:48:39.474 --> 00:48:41.640
and then I'd let them each
go off with it for a bit,

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.098
she came back to me and very
earnestly, very urgently said,

00:48:44.098 --> 00:48:47.452
Dad, this book is
full of feelings.

00:48:47.452 --> 00:48:49.410
And so I just wanted to
pass that along to you.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:50.040
Thank you so much.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:50.840
JONNY SUN: Thank you.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.340
Thank you.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.220
Thank you so much.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.350
That's so sweet.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:57.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.640
Thank you.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.200
AUDIENCE: So just
from the way you talk,

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.020
I imagine Canada is
such a wonderful place.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.540
So why did you leave?

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.260
And what do you have to say
to people like me who actually

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.760
want to move to Canada?

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.560
What kind of advice
could you give me?

00:49:19.165 --> 00:49:21.540
JONNY SUN: I never want to
fall into the danger of saying

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.660
Canada's this perfect
utopia, because it isn't.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.570
There are a lot of
things that Canada

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.070
needs to work on as well--

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.045
for example, its treatment
of indigenous peoples.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.920
I find myself asking
that question a lot--

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.180
why did I leave Canada--

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:47.410
especially in these
last two years.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:51.030
And I think I'll always
see Canada as my home.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.430
And I've always intended
to go back there.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:57.090
I think myself and a lot of
Canadian students who end up

00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:00.960
in the US have
done it because we

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.680
want to go to a school in
the States, essentially.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:09.990
That's the strongest reason
I can come up with for now.

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:14.201
I need to be here because
I'm going to school here.

00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:16.200
But at the same time,
I've been here long enough

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.530
that I've really made a
lot of American friends

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.280
and seen what is
happening in the US.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:30.870
And I've become really
invested in the politics here

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:35.580
and in everything
that's happening.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.660
And I really care
about my friends

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.570
who are people of color who are
getting persecuted in the US

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:47.110
and who have to live
in fear all the time.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:52.740
And so it's given me a lot
to empathize with here.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:57.070
It's become a place where
I've fallen in love with

00:50:57.070 --> 00:51:01.620
but also am deeply
critical and sad about.

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.850
But I think, ultimately,
it's become a country that

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:07.740
used to just be like,
oh, this is the country

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.469
south of where I am.

00:51:09.469 --> 00:51:11.010
Now it's sort of
like my second home.

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:13.830
And now I really care
about what happens here

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.770
and about my
friends who are here

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.850
and the people who are here.

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:22.830
So now I feel this weird
split between understanding

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:24.660
that I'm Canadian
and being Canadian,

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.440
but also deeply being invested
in the outcome of this country.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.680
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
thanks for being hopeful.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.280
You ever want to no
longer be an alien?

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.850
JONNY SUN: Do I ever want
to no longer be an alien?

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.591
No, I don't think so.

00:51:46.591 --> 00:51:48.590
First of all, I don't
know if that's my decision

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.740
to make, first of all.

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:57.860
But I think I've been
really happy with

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:04.070
or I've grown comfortable with
being placed as an outsider

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:07.440
and seeing myself
as an outsider.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.790
And I think there is a
lot of value in that.

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:18.620
I think being an
outsider to most things

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:23.540
allows you to be critical in a
way that is harder to see when

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.150
you're ingrained in that thing.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.300
Yeah, I don't know.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.880
I kind of like it for now.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.640
And I think the best
thing about it is that--

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.170
I think someone
once described me

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:43.880
as a public lonely person
or something like that.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.680
And I think the kind of
beauty about publicly

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.250
saying that is that I
find other people who

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:54.800
also feel like aliens and
who feel like outsiders.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.920
And together, we form this
community of outsiders,

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.420
and we find a connection.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.590
And that's really sweet.

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:06.530
It never goes from
a group of outsiders

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.200
to one group of insiders.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.010
It's always just this lovely
diverse group of other people.

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:19.670
And I think that's really
nice, and I really value that.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.479
So yeah, I think
we should all be--

00:53:22.479 --> 00:53:23.270
that sounds cheesy.

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:24.478
I'm not even going to say it.

00:53:24.478 --> 00:53:28.060
I'm not even going to say I
think we should all be aliens.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.960
But I think there's
a value to that.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:34.760
And I think I'm really happy
with my place within that.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.010
SANDERS KLEINFELD: So I heard
you made an announcement

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.715
about an upcoming next project.

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:39.010
JONNY SUN: Oh, yeah.

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.640
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Do you
want to tell everybody

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.723
about that really quickly?

00:53:41.723 --> 00:53:43.070
JONNY SUN: Sure.

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:44.720
The next book I'm
working on is a book

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.240
with Lin-Manuel Miranda, who
is the creator of "Hamilton"

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.150
and "In the Heights,"
among other things.

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:52.880
And I'm actually really
excited about it.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.120
It's called "Gmorning,
Gnight," and it's

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.180
a compilation of Lin's good
morning and goodnight tweets

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.860
that are from Twitter.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.050
And basically, we compiled them.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.110
And I've done illustrations
for each good morning

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.180
and good night tweet.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.870
And it's this very
sweet, cute book

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:15.950
that hopefully does something
similar to what this book does

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:19.760
in the sense that it creates
this object that people can

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:26.090
really hold onto and
that is full of feelings

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.790
and that I think
is this hopeful,

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:32.390
kind of empathetic object.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:35.150
And yeah, I'm really,
really excited about it.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:39.185
It comes out
October 23, so yeah.

00:54:39.185 --> 00:54:41.060
SANDERS KLEINFELD: We
will be on the lookout.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:41.870
JONNY SUN: Absolutely.

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.640
SANDERS KLEINFELD: Thank you so
much for coming again, Jonny.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.080
JONNY SUN: Thank you.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.050
Thank you for having me.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:45.758
Thanks, everyone.

00:54:45.758 --> 00:54:48.700
[APPLAUSE]
