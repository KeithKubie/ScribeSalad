00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.950
For years now, astronomers have been looking
at the sky to try and find dark energy -- energy

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.710
that mathematically should exist, but that
we’re not sure how to detect, or where to

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.710
find.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.989
To detect the undetectable, scientists build
increasingly sensitive telescopes and point

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.820
them at the sky to do a survey.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.970
And one of those had an unexpected side-effect...

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.119
The Milky Way has billions of stars, the Dark
Energy Survey just uncovered a bunch of them

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.820
weren’t born here.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.199
Instead, they migrated to our shores and are
now living their lives as productive members

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.470
of our galactic society!

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.680
We know this because in the hunt for dark
energy, the Dark Energy Survey.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.480
Very clever name, gang.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.480
Good work.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.410
imaged these…

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.129
See those dim paths?

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.550
Those are called ‘stellar streams.’

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.079
They’re the little paths migratory stars
took when coming to our galaxy!

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.079
I KNOW!

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.390
We’re looking at the galactic version of
Ellis and Angel Islands!

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.100
Stellar Streams are formed when smaller dimmer
galaxies wander too close to the Milky Way.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.269
The collective gravity of the two galaxies
cause little tendrils of stars on the outskirts

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.670
of the passing galaxy to stretch out…

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.260
Once the tendrils of the Milky Way and the
passing galaxy meet, stars start to flow into

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.780
the Milky Way’s gravitational field and
form halos!

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.750
We’ve known about the stellar streams for
a while, but to see them is pretty incredible.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.560
Stars are commonly formed in regions dense
of gas and dust.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.720
When this cosmic detritus gets dense enough,
its collective gravity collapses on itself

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.610
forming a baby star.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.070
As we’ve covered on Seeker before, astronomers
are just learning about the family tree of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.780
stars, based on where they’re from.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.140
These stellar nurseries exist all over the
Milky Way, and it’s where most of our stars

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.890
(including the sun) were born.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.700
But there are billions of other galaxies out
there of all shapes and sizes.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.770
With their own stellar nurseries…

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.900
These stellar streams may alter the border
regions of the Milky Way, bringing stars with

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.860
different combinations of elements or other
unknown benefits

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.700
The next Dark Energy Survey is slated to start
in 2023, and will be even more sensitive,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.590
looking even harder at our sky.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.380
I wonder what they'll find.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.660
