00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.970
A couple of videos ago, we
learned that if we started

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.850
with solid water or ice at a
reasonably low temperature--

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.160
maybe this temperature
right here is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.380
minus 10 degrees Celsius.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.670
And we can deal with Celsius
when we're dealing with these

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.610
phase changes, because we really
just care about the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.930
difference in temperature, and
not necessarily the absolute

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.670
temperature.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.450
So one degree in Celsius is the
same thing is one degree

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.680
in Kelvin so the differences
are the same whether you're

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.300
dealing with Celsius
or Kelvin.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.640
So we're starting with minus
10 degree Celsius

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.770
ice or solid water.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.420
And we learned that as you heat
it up, as you add heat

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.170
energy to the water, the
temperature goes up.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.940
The molecules, at least while
they're in that ice lattice

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.840
network, they just
start vibrating.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.510
And their average kinetic energy
goes up until we get to

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.980
zero degrees.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.670
Which is the melting
point of water.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.620
And at zero degrees, we already
learned something

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.910
interesting happens.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.990
The added heat in the system
does not increase the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.440
temperature of the
ice anymore.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.720
At least over that little
period right here.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.019
What's happening is that heat
energy is being used to kind

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.620
of break the lattice
structure.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.440
To add potential energy
to the ice.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.080
Or essentially melt it.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.350
So for it here, right
here, we're ice.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.010
Right at this point, we're
zero degree ice.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.110
And then as we add more and
more heat we get to zero

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.270
degree water.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.590
So at zero degrees, you can
either have water or ice.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.960
And if you have water, to turn
it into ice, you have to take

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.090
heat out of it.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.470
And if you have ice, and you
want to turn it into water,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.830
you have to put heat into it.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.910
And then the heat is used
again to warm up the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.490
water at some rate.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.310
And then at 100 degrees, which
is the boiling point of water,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.480
right here, a similar phase
change happens.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.200
Where the increased heat is
not used to increase the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.150
temperature of the water, it's
used to put potential energy

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.150
into the system.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.900
So the water molecules are
forced away from each other.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.260
The same way that if I'm forced
away from the planet

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.280
Earth, I have potential
energy because I can

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.770
fall back to the earth.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.820
Similarly, they have the
potential energy of falling

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.100
back to each other.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.970
But this energy, right here
is the energy necessary to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.169
vaporize the water.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.800
Right here you have 100 degree
water, 100 degree liquid.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.150
And here you have 100 degree
vapor, water vapor.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.970
And then as you add more and
more heat, once again it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.120
increases the temperature.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.560
But you, Sal, I already learned
this a few videos ago,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.030
I have the intuition.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.710
But I want to deal with
real numbers.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.310
I want to know exactly how
much heat is required for

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.090
these different things
to happen.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.900
And for that, we can
get these numbers.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.120
And these are specific to the
different states of water.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.460
If you looked up any other
element or molecule, you would

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.100
have different values for these
numbers we're going to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.510
be dealing with right now.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.400
But this first number right here
is the heat of fusion.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.000
And this is the amount of heat
that's required to fuse 100

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.250
degree water into
100 degree ice.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.160
Or the amount of energy you have
to take out of the water.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.130
So this distance right
here, or along this

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.140
axis, is 333 joules.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.320
If you're going in the the
leftward direction, you have

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.000
to take that much out of the
system to turn into ice.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.850
If you're going in the rightward
direction, you have

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.600
to add that much to
turn into water.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.910
So heat of fusion.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.900
It's called the heat of fusion
because when you fuse

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.350
something together you
make it solid.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.990
So it could also be considered
the heat of melting.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.280
Just two different words for the
same, thing depending on

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.220
what direction you going.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.500
The important thing is
the number, 333.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.860
Similarly, you have the
heat of vaporization.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.800
2257 joules per gram.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.420
That's this distance along
this axis right here.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.040
So if you had one gram of 100
degree liquid water and you

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.750
wanted to turn it into
one gram of 100

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.200
degree liquid vapor.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.620
And in all of this, we're
assuming that nothing silly is

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.770
happening to the pressure,
that we're

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.010
under constant pressure.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.830
You would have to put 2257
joules into the system.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.660
If you had 100 degree vapor and
you wanted to condense it,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.210
you would have to take that much
energy out of the system.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.080
OK, fine, you know how much
energy is required for the

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.810
phase changes.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.330
But what about these
parts right here?

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.250
How much energy is required to
warm up a gram of ice by one

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.030
degree Celsius or Kelvin?

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.720
And for that we look at
the specific heat.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.010
It takes 2 joules of
energy to warm up 1

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.880
gram 1 degree Kelvin.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.800
When water is in the
solid state.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.460
When it's in the liquid state,
it takes about double that.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.210
It takes about 4 joules
per gram to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.080
raise it 1 degree Kelvin.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.660
And when you're in the vapor
state, it's actually more

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.020
similar to the solid state.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.920
So given what we know now, we
can actually figure out how

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:04.120
much energy it would take to go
from minus 10 degree ice to

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.600
110 degree vapor.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.380
Let's work this out.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.200
So the first thing we're going
to be doing is, we're going to

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.025
be going from minus 10 degree
ice to zero degree ice.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.110
So we're going to
go 10 degrees.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.090
We have to figure out how much
heat does it take to warm up

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.850
ice by 10 degrees.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.360
So the heat is going to be
equal to the change in

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.470
temperature.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.110
So actually let me write the
specific heat first. So 2.05

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.160
joules per gram Kelvin.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.000
Oh, and I should tell you, we
can't different values for the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.400
amount of ice we're warming up
to vapor, so let's say we're

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.390
dealing with 200 grams.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.060
So it'll be the specific heat
times the number of grams

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.900
we're warming up of ice times
the change in temperature that

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.660
we're trying to get.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.610
So, times 10 degrees Kelvin.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.480
Le'ts just say it's a 10 degrees
Kelvin change, it

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.170
doesn't matter if we're using
Kelvin or Celsius.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.750
I could have written
a Celsius here.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.180
Let's put Celsius right there.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.750
So what is that equal to?

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.070
Get the calculator.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.130
Clear it out.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:40.625
2.05 times 200 times times 10
is equal to 4,100 joules.

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:42.690
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.810
This is 4,100 joules.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.770
Fair enough.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.300
Now, so what we've done is just
this part right here.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.620
This distance right here
is 4,100 joules.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.870
Now we have to turn that
zero degree ice

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.120
into zero degree water.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.850
And for that we use the
heat of fusion.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.900
We're adding that
amount of heat.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:20.030
It's 333.5 joules per gram.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:27.530
So that's equal to 335.55 joules
per gram times, we have

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.880
200 grams of ice that we're
trying to melt.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.700
So that is what?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.940
So let me get the
calculator out.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:49.280
So I have 335.55 times 200
is equal to 67,110.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.150
Let me do it in that color so
can sum them up at the end.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:58.640
67,110 joules to
melt the water.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.860
Or take it from ice to water.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.310
Now, we have to go from, and
this is the big one.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:09.480
We have to go from zero degree
water to 100 degree water.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.000
Or liquid water.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.780
This is in the liquid state.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:22.210
So now we take the specific heat
of water which was 4.178.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.160
For some reason I'm thinking
it's 4.176

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.960
but it doesn't matter.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.540
So it's 4.178.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.640
I might off a little bit on that
number, but that digit is

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.720
not that significant.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.299
Joules per gram Celsius
times 200 grams

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.929
times 100 degrees Celsius.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.450
And notice, the Celsius and
the Celsius cancel out.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.010
The grams and the grams
cancel out.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.520
So we are left with joules,
which is what we want.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.140
We want to know how much heat
or how much energy we're

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.140
adding to the system.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.010
Let me get the calculator out.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:11.970
So this stage is going to be
4.178 times 200 times 100 is

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:35.240
equal to 83,560 joules.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.230
Does that look about right?

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.490
Let's see.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.650
4 times 200 is 800, 800 times
100; yeah, that's about right.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.150
Now, we're dealing with 100
degree water vapor, and we

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:51.250
have to turn that 100
degree water vapor

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.410
to 110 degree vapor.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.140
So we use the specific
heat of vapor.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:06.980
1.89 joules per gram Kelvin.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.790
Multiplied by the amount of
vapor we're dealing with, 200

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.290
grams. That obviously
doesn't change.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.900
We're not adding or taking away
mass from the system.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.280
Times the temperature
change, times 10.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.180
So what is that?

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.750
Let me get the calculator
out again.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.590
So we're dealing with
a 10 degree change.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:43.270
10 degree Celsius times 200
times 1.89 is equal to 3,780.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.385
And I just realized, I made
a horrible mistake.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.090
It's not an irrevocable mistake,
otherwise I would

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.330
rerecord the video.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.530
But I just figured out the
amount of energy to take it

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.020
from zero degree water to 100
degree water, which is this

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.720
energy right here.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.000
And now I just calculated how
much energy to go from 100

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.970
degree vapor to 110
degree vapor.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.470
Which is this right here, that
distance right here.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.680
I forgot to figure out how much
energy to turn that 100

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.440
degree water into 100
degree vapor.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.000
So that's key.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.440
So I really should have done
that up here before I

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.360
calculated the vapor.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.720
But I'll do it down here.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:30.600
So to do 100 degree water
to 100 degree vapor.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.580
That's this step right here,
this is the phase change.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.710
I multiply the heat of
vaporization, which is 2,257

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.730
joules per gram times
200 grams. And

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:57.865
this is equal to 451,400.

00:11:57.865 --> 00:11:59.970
I'll do it in that blue color.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:06.560
451,400 joules.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:14.850
So this piece right here is
451,000 for our sample of 200

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:20.650
grams. This piece right here
was 83,000 joules.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.580
This piece right here
was 3,780 joules.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.470
So to know the total amount of
energy, the total amount of

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.580
heat that we had to put in the
system to go from minus 10

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.890
degree ice all the way to 110
degree vapor, we just add up

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.170
all of the energies we had to
do in all of these steps.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:41.800
Let's see.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.280
And I'll do them in
order this time.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:53.080
So to go from minus 10 degree
ice to zero degree ice.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.860
Of course we have
200 grams of it.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.940
It was 4,100.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:05.530
Plus the 67,000.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.850
I'm just doing this
off the screen.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:12.710
So plus 67,110.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.780
Plus 83,000.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.450
That's to go from zero degree
water to 100 degree water.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.210
Plus 83,560.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.360
So we're at 154,000 right
now just to get

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.130
to 100 degree water.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.950
And then we need to turn that
100 degree water into 100

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.090
degree vapor.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.280
So you add the 451,000.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.330
So, plus 451,400 is
equal to 606.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.840
And then finally, we're at 100
degree vapor, and we want to

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.360
convert that to 110
degree vapor.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.030
So it's another 3,700 joules.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:14:00.430
So plus 3,780 is equal
to 609,950 joules.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.840
So this whole thing when we're
dealing with 200 grams, when

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.400
you're going from
minus 10 to 110.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.910
And remember, this is
for 200 grams. It

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:16.070
took us 609,950 joules.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.650
Or 609 kilojoules to do this.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.470
So that by itself is an
interesting thing.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.340
You might think, wow, this
is a huge number.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.830
But actually, it turns out
joules isn't a lot of work.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.580
Kilojoules starts to become
a little bit interesting.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.570
You might realize, 200 grams
of ice, that's about half a

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.410
pound of ice.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.650
So to take half a pound of ice
and warm it up on your stove

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:43.600
would take 609 kilojoules
of heat to do that.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.890
So that's something that you
probably could do on your

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.010
stove at home.
