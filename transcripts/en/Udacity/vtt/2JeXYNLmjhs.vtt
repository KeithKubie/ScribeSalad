00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, we've already learned a lot about electricity.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We know that negative charges like to be with positive charges.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We know four methods to charge an object,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we've learned that the earth is both a source and a sink for electrons.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But one thing we haven't talked about at allâ€”

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
one of the most important concepts in physics is energy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Why don't we go back to Professor Fregonese and see what he has to say

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about energy as it relates to electricity.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
One of the most evident effects of electricity are attractions and repulsions

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of electrified bodies and this is important because you can use these forces

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to produce work, to produce energy.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We can start understanding it with an analogy with gravity, which is simple

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because we have only attraction and electricity is much more complicated because

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you have also this complication of repulsion.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If I have a body of mass, there is an attraction between the body and the earth

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and there is potential energy.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If I drop this body, it has the capacity to produce some work

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
maybe to break a neck down there.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It goes down and the potential energy diminishes

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and it acquires kinetic energy, movement, velocity,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and which is proportionate to the square of velocity.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
With electricity, it's more complicated because of repulsion but the idea is similar.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You can use the interactions between electrified borders between charges

00:01:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to produce work so to have energy to produce something.
