00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:04.705
Okay, who would you rather
have go down on you?

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:08.709
Michael Buble
or Janet Jackson?

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.811
Oh, okay.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.146
What Buble are we
talking about, though?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.948
I don't know, the optimal
Michael Buble.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.383
His weight fluctuates.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.818
Yeah.
So does hers.

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.319
Yeah.
So does mine.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.021
Yeah.
But then again,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.956
Michael Buble is,
like, such a crooner.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.058
I feel like he could do
stuff with his mouth that,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.261
like, most people
couldn't.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.266
Somebody call
a locksmith?

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:38.172
Yeah.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.474
I'm gonna look disgusting
for tonight is all.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:43.410
No, you're gonna
look hot and cool.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.412
Your shower is just
a lockpick away.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.914
Very hot.

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.483
Very cool.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.285
What's your name,
sweetheart?

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.020
Uh...

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.922
Yolanda.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.124
Yolanda.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.725
So where is it
you sleep?

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.260
What?

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.362
Which apartment's yours?

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:03.931
Um...

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.899
Do you have any, like,
credentials?

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.868
Or, like, a license to be
a locksmith that you could

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.436
just show us?

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.405
No, the only thing you
need to be a locksmith is

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.774
you gotta want it.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.475
Real bad.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.647
That one.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.082
Yeah, it's this one,
the 6--

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.117
6C.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:34.695
(amorous groaning)

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.900
They call this
a whore door.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.769
'Cause it's so easy.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.271
Okay.

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:48.842
Thank you for your
terrifying services

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.111
and don't call us,
we'll call you.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.746
Oh yeah.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.718
Oh, you'll call me, huh?

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.624
(whistling)
