00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:07.220
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.070
Welcome to Talks at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.330
Today it's my great privilege
to introduce Frank Wilczek.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.630
Dr. Wilczek is kind of a
one-man who's-who in physics.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.150
He's the Herman Feshbach
Professor of physics at MIT.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.430
And his research spans condensed
matter physics, astrophysics,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.220
and particle physics.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.160
He was one of three recipients
of the Nobel Prize in physics

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.760
in 2004 for the discovery
of asymptotic freedom

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.590
in the theory of the
strong interaction.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.000
In 2012, he proposed the
idea of a space-time crystal.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.990
He's written numerous books
for professional and general

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.650
audiences.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.210
He joins us today to
discuss his newest

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.860
book for general audiences,
"A Beautiful Question,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.460
Finding Nature's Deep Design."

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.870
In this book, he shows us
how groundbreaking work done

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.230
by scientists
throughout the ages,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.240
including himself, has always
been inspired by the idea

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.380
that the universe embodies
beautiful forms characterized

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.620
by symmetry, harmony, balance,
proportion, and economy that we

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.330
find aesthetically
pleasing and inspiring.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.990
The book explores how
intertwined our ideas

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.110
about beauty and art are with
our scientific understanding

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.540
of the cosmos.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.060
Please join me in
welcoming Frank Wilczek.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.312
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:40.353
FRANK WILCZEK: Thank you.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:45.470
Thank you.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.120
It's very interesting to be
here and to have the chance

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.500
to talk to you.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.670
In this presentation, I'm
going to do three things,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.050
and then we'll open
it up to questions.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.170
I'm going to first present
the central line of argument

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.590
in the book.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.760
Then I'll do a brief reading.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.040
And then I'll talk through one
particular scientific chapter

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.690
that's a central part
of the exposition, which

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.410
I think is very well suited
to a visual presentation.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.490
It's going to be about color
and how our perception of color

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.040
relates to the concept
of extra dimensions.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.210
So let's get going.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.700
This is the beautiful question
to which the title alludes.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.920
Does the world embody
beautiful ideas?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.950
That may sound very vague and
woolly or hopelessly visionary,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.780
but it actually is
something one could

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.210
make precise and investigate
empirically, I would argue.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.410
I will look.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.700
So this question has two sides.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.160
What is the world, which we
investigate scientifically?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.330
And what is beauty?

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.930
Beauty we can also
investigate empirically.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.930
We can look to the
historical record

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.573
and see what kind of things
people have found beautiful.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:28.240
There's a record of
art and decoration

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.380
that tells us what people
have found beautiful.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.280
And then we can compare to
see if there's non-trivial--

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.230
I think I can use that
word here-- nontrivial

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.810
overlap between these two
conceptions, what we find

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.920
runs the world, what is the
deep structure of the laws,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.490
and what people find
beautiful on the other.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.420
From our examination of
the fundamental laws which

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.700
has reached a remarkable
state of perfection

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.280
over the course of
the 20th century,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.810
we can identify
what the themes are.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.070
And I would claim that there
are two basic themes that

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.769
overwhelmingly emerge from the
fundamental laws of nature,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.839
the so-called standard
model or core theory

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.980
that we've come to understand.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.410
One is symmetry, and
the other is exuberance.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.320
Now, both of these come with
asterisks because the words

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.880
as used by me and used
generally in science

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.190
have special meaning that's a
more precise version and more

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.760
limited version than their
used in common language.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.240
So the best
definition of symmetry

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.500
sounds at first sight
kind of mystical,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.300
but it actually means
something very precise and very

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.020
flexible and important.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.130
Symmetry is change
without change.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.550
So for instance, a circle
is a very symmetric object,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.430
because you can rotate it around
its center and every point

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.320
on it moves, so changes, but
the circle as a whole does not.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.330
And therefore, a circle
is a very special object.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.640
If you took, say, any old
triangle and did a rotation,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.770
it would not come back
to the same thing.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.100
If you take an equilateral
triangle, which

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.480
is the most symmetric
version, you

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.670
can rotate it, not by any
angle, but if you rotate it

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.190
through 120 degrees, it
comes to the same thing.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.890
So it has some symmetry,
but less than a circle.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.200
The virtue of this
definition and what

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.210
makes it become
extremely fruitful

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.820
is that you can apply
it not only to objects

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.190
but to physical laws.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.390
You can ask, for instance,
whether the physical laws

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.000
look the same if you move past
an object at constant velocity.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.510
That's the key concept in
the theory of relativity.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.710
Or you can ask about the
symmetry of equations.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.960
Do you have equations that
you can make transformations

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.060
of that might have changed
their content but in fact don't?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.300
So they change the
appearance of the equations

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.440
but not their
consequences or content.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.722
Exuberance is not
usually a technical word.

00:06:25.722 --> 00:06:27.180
The more technical
version would be

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.000
something like
"economy of means"

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.360
or "emergent complexity."

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.370
And this is best
shown by example.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.440
The fundamental laws
are conceptually simple

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.670
and based on high
degrees of symmetry,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.950
as I've already mentioned.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.380
But their consequences
are extremely rich.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.900
The basic ingredients
of nature, we learn,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.650
are sort of like LEGO blocks,
but very intelligent LEGO

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.920
blocks that you
can stack together

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.430
in many creative, interesting
ways, and nature does it.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.290
This is how chemistry,
metabolism, genetics, and also

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.940
nuclear physics and
astrophysics all

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.740
can be run by the same basic
equations and concepts.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.640
Now, turning to the concept
of beauty, what have people

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.660
found beautiful?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.350
Well, take a look.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.750
This is a mosque
interior from Shiraz.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.035
And you see lots of
symmetrical elements.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.010
You see many triangles.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.950
You see circles.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.150
But not only is there
symmetry, but there's even

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.280
the more advanced
kind of symmetry

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.710
that we use in physics,
where you make symmetry

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.290
where different
transformations are

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.190
made at different places
in space and time.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.660
Here, if you have a
triangle over here,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.850
its symmetry is a rotation
over here around its center.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.590
You have a triangle over there.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.370
Its symmetry is rotation
around its center.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.870
To do full justice
of the symmetry

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.630
that people have
found beautiful,

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.820
you have to have this gigantic
concept of local symmetry,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.540
which is, as documented
here in great detail,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.240
the fundamental principle
that allows us to construct

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.410
the basic laws of nature.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.940
Another concept that
we find is extremely

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.470
central to our understanding
of the physical world

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:32.289
and is a sort of hidden
embodiment of symmetry

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:36.179
is the concept of relativity.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.460
So relativity, I've
already alluded to,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.880
is centrally the
concept that you

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.930
can move past a scene
at constant velocity

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.580
and it will obey the
same laws of physics.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.870
Perspective in
art is the science

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.080
of how things look from
different viewpoints,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.920
different viewpoints
meaning, in that case,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.080
different places you
can stand to look.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.040
But it's the same
basic idea that you

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.530
can look in different
configurations, places,

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:14.490
or velocities and see the
same underlying structure.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.080
This is change without change.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.020
Let's talk about it in the
context of perspective,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:25.090
because if you consider all
the possible representations

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.340
of a scene as it's looked at
from different viewpoints,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.840
that's what the science of
perspective is all about.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.980
How can you realize
the same scene

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.060
from many different viewpoints?

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.720
Then if you have that
whole understanding,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.290
that whole collection of
possible representations,

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.120
moving the object,
rotating it or moving it,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.280
although it changes
the object, does not

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.480
change the entire collection
of ways it could look.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.640
So you have, in this
broader perspective,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.110
a change without change, a
symmetry, and the science

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.660
perspective and art
and the discipline

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.210
of projective geometry
and mathematics,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.070
which are basically the
same thing, or the study

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.210
of that kind of symmetry.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.730
And people found it beautiful.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.640
Just look.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.650
Shortly after the
science of perspective

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:28.250
was discovered by
Brunelleschi around 1430,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.540
it played a big
role in triggering

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.590
the painting revolution of
the Italian Renaissance.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.700
This is one of the earliest
masterpieces in that tradition.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:44.130
And you can see the joy that
Perugino took in experimenting

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:49.520
with perspective and how the
town square is accurately

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.230
represented, and
the people are so

00:10:51.230 --> 00:11:00.080
happy to be part of an
accurately portrayed town

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.230
square, and the
buildings are meant

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.750
to point in
interesting directions

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.380
with parallels converging at
different vanishing points.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.440
And you can see that Perugino
had a great time with this,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.870
and people found it beautiful.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.700
And I find it-- I think
you will find it beautiful.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:23.170
And here's one more example,
which is a little more exotic.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.190
This is a portrait
by Matisse, and it

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:32.150
exhibits another really strange
kind of change without change.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.310
Perspective is the idea
that you can look at scenes

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.860
from different places.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.040
Here, the idea is that you can
make transformations and color

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.320
space, so changing
blue into red or red

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.360
into green, at different places.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.700
You still have the
same underlying image,

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.110
but it can be a
beautiful thing to look

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:01.710
at it from this kind of
very general perspective,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.280
now not only in the sense
of changing things in space

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:10.160
and time, but also changing
things in color space.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.860
And that's another
version of local symmetry,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.630
now changing things and their
properties that turns out

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.140
to be fundamental
in constructing

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.870
our understanding of the world.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.200
So that concludes the
proof, the demonstration,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.730
that what people find beautiful
has a remarkable overlap,

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.210
remarkable concordance,
with what we

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.130
find are the basic principles
that run the world.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.320
Now I'd like to
read a little bit

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.390
so you can be assured as to the
quality of prose in this book.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.080
This comes towards
the end, so it

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.660
alludes to some things
that came before.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.425
But I think the meanings will
be clear from the context.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.640
"Trust in beauty has often,
in the past, paid off.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.740
Newton's theory of
gravity was challenged

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.610
by the orbit of Uranus, which
did not obey its predictions.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.460
But Urbain Le Verrier and
also John Couch Adams,

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.160
trusting in the beauty
of the underlying theory,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.040
were led to propose the
existence of a new planet,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.020
not yet observed, whose
influence might be responsible.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.030
Their calculations told
astronomers where to look,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.730
and that led to the
discovery of Neptune.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.960
Maxwell's great
synthesis, as we've seen,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.230
predicted new colors of
light, invisible to our eyes,

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.270
also not yet observed.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.020
Trusting in the
beauty of the theory,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.770
Hertz both produced and
observed radio waves.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.870
In more recent times,
Paul Dirac predicted,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.870
through a strange and beautiful
equation, the existence

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.330
of antiparticles, which
had not yet been observed

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.620
but soon thereafter were.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.600
The core, anchored in symmetry,
gave us color gluons, w and z

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.040
particles, the Higgs
particle, the charmed quark,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.890
and the particles
of the third family,

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.700
all as predictions prior
to their observation.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.840
But there have
been failures, too.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.610
Plato's theory of atoms
and Kepler's model

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.420
of the solar system
were beautiful theories

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.180
that, as descriptions of
nature, utterly failed.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.560
Another was Kelvin's
theory of atoms,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.220
which proposed that they are
knots of activity in the ether.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.720
Knots come in different forms,
and they're not easily undone,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.220
so they have, it might seem,
the right stuff to make atoms.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.170
But they aren't.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.210
Those failures were
not without fruit.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.940
Plato's theory inspired deeper
study of geometry and symmetry.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.870
Kepler's model inspired his
own great career in astronomy.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.130
And Kelvin's model
inspired Peter Tait

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.960
to develop the theory of
mathematical knots, which

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.410
remains a vibrant subject today.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.020
But as theories of
the physical world,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.020
they are hopelessly wrong.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.000
The fate of supersymmetry
is not yet decided.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Its discovery would,
as I've described,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.750
reward our trust in beauty
as a guide to deep reality.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.750
There are good reasons
to think that discovery

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.200
may be imminent and
beautiful reasons to hope so,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.320
but it has not yet occurred.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.580
We shall see.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.390
According to the story
of Doubting Thomas,

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.560
the apostle Thomas was skeptical
of Jesus' Resurrection,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.510
withholding his belief in
the absence of evidence."

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.780
And now we have a quotation.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.360
"'Except I shall see in his
hands the print of the nails

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.990
and put my finger into the print
of the nails and thrust my hand

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.360
into his side, I
will not believe.'

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.670
When Jesus did
appear to Thomas, he

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.100
allowed Thomas to examine his
wounds, and Thomas believed.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.110
Jesus said, Thomas,
because thou has seen me,

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.500
thou hast believed.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.770
And blessed are they that have
not seen and yet have believed.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.120
That story has inspired
many works of art,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.640
including Caravaggio's
'Incredulity of St

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.250
Thomas,' which I find resonant."

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.580
That's what you're seeing here.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.930
"To me, Caravaggio's rendering
conveys two profound messages

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.010
that go beyond the words
of the Gospel's text.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.210
One sees first
that Jesus does not

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.770
resist Thomas'
inquisitive examination

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.520
but rather welcomes it.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.260
And one sees that Thomas
is fascinated and excited

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.050
to discover that reality
conforms to his deepest hopes.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.660
Doubting Thomas is a
hero and a happy man.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.660
Those who believe without
seeing are blessed

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.410
with the joy of certainty.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.310
But it is a fragile
certainty and a hollow joy.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.450
Those whose faith is not
passive but engages reality

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.590
will receive a second,
more fulfilling blessing

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.350
in the harmony of
belief and experience.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:02.340
Blessed are those who
believe what they see."

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.480
Thus endeth the second part.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.380
And now I'd like to talk
about a specific subject that

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.030
is well suited to brief
presentation and very visual.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:19.450
This is my favorite
physicist in his prime.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.829
This is James Clerk Maxwell.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:26.079
You can see a kind of playful
expression on his face,

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:31.130
a gleam in his eye,
and a toy in his hand.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.190
What is that strange toy?

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.960
Well, it turns out
that toy is actually

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.600
a scientific instrument
and one that Maxwell

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:44.460
used to elucidate the nature
of human color perception.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.260
This explains the principal.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.280
You can have two bands,
two angular bands,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.390
if you like, and put
colored strips of paper

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.130
around them with different
lengths and different colors

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.250
and then twirl them
around, taking advantage

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.670
of the persistence of vision
to see if the colors match,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.220
to see if you can reproduce
how one band looks, say,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.440
the yellow band out there,
if you can reproduce

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.630
the yellow band by suitable
mixtures of red and green.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:24.310
And what Maxwell found in a
meticulous set of experiments

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.670
extending over many
years that he did largely

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.590
with his wife's help,
is that he could

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.390
match any color on the outside.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.990
So he try strips of many
different colors, all

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.900
that he could find, by
using just three colors

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.510
in different proportions
on the inside.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.570
We call that trichromicity,
that humans can

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.410
sense three different colors.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.250
That's the basis of computer
displays, of color television,

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.740
of color photography.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:03.190
You use three inks or three
kinds of LEDs or three kinds

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.300
beams in general in
different proportions

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.050
to make any color you like.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.520
And here's an iconic
representation of that.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.730
And you can see
that very different

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:21.680
looking things, for instance
a mixture of red and green,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.950
pure red and green,
spectral red and green,

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.640
can give you something that's
yellow even though that's

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.050
very different from the
yellow of the rainbow, which

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.980
is a pure spectral yellow
as a physical phenomenon.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.920
We can represent
that situation more

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.810
abstractly in a suggestive
way, using a color cube.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.420
So in one direction, you
have the intensity of blue,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.540
in another the
intensity of green,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.990
and another the
intensity of red.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.590
And by mixing them in
different proportions,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.360
you'll find on the
inside of the cube

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.450
all possible colors, ending
in white at the far corner,

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.290
each represented uniquely.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:04.520
So in this precise sense, the
space of perceptible colors

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.090
is a three-dimensional space.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.250
Now, there's no denying
the mystical appeal

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.060
of the concept of extra
dimensions, its appeal

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:19.850
to mystics and people interested
in science and popular science

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.060
ever since there have
been those things.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.540
Here's a lovely image of
what extra dimensions might

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.420
be conceptually in terms of,
OK, there's physical space

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.990
and you have little
spaces on top.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.910
It's really very
appealing, very pretty.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.370
If only we could
experience them, though.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.480
Well, we can and we do.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.516
Remember, here's our color cube.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:48.140
Now think about what
you're seeing when

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.570
you look at a computer screen.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.190
At every point, you're getting
a sample of the color cube.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:00.140
So it's almost literally that
previous picture except better,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.960
because now it's colorful.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.470
And if you want to think
about this more formally,

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.210
if you're programming
a computer and you

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.670
want to tell it what to do,
what kind of instructions

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.300
do you have to give?

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.110
You have to tell it at
each point on the screen,

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:24.330
at each position x and y, at
each time t, how much red,

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.790
how much green, and how
much blue to output.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.110
So these are six numbers.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.390
And inside the program, they
look pretty much all the same.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.720
It's very hard to tell that two
of them are space, one is time,

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.020
and three of them are colors.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.160
So you are, in that
very tangible sense,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.340
also in that mathematically
precise sense,

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.380
exploring a space
of six dimensions,

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.680
two space in the ordinary
sense, time, and three colors.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.250
So the answer to
the question, "What

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:05.160
do extra dimensions look like?"
is you're looking at them.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.990
So that was the little
chapter of science

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.260
that I wanted to show you.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.090
And now we can take questions.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.425
Thank you.

00:22:14.425 --> 00:22:18.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you for talk
and the interesting book.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.580
So you pointed out
a number of examples

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.510
where human intuitions
about symmetry and beauty

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.810
lead us to
non-physical theories.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.000
What about the flip side?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.625
I mean, there's a
lot of things that we

00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.580
find beautiful that
are not particularly

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.730
symmetric or beautiful.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.980
FRANK WILCZEK: Oh, absolutely.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.604
AUDIENCE: There's
entire schools of art

00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:52.800
founded on dissonance and
disorder and things like that.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.270
FRANK WILCZEK: Yes, the claim
is not that all forms of beauty

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.080
are embodied in nature or that
everything in nature or even

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.780
in the fundamental laws,
which is the focus here,

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.050
is beautiful.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.380
There are lots of loose ends
in our understanding, lots

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.890
of things whose beauty is
not apparent at present

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.480
and may never be apparent.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.100
And on the other
hand-- your question

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.810
is even more to
the point-- there

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.020
are many forms of beauty that
don't seem to be embodied

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.740
in the fundamental laws.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.800
The beauty of the human
form, moral beauty,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.260
things that dominate,
really, most of art, are not,

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.930
as far as we can
tell, represented

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.970
in the fundamental laws.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.630
But the remarkable
thing is that there

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.730
are things that people
have found beautiful,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:54.630
some central elements of the
realization of beauty and art,

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.610
not all by any means,
not even most of it,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:01.130
but some central
elements are exactly what

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:08.620
we find runs the world in
the central fundamental laws.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.170
AUDIENCE: Sort of
along the same lines,

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.990
are you trying to
imply a causality here?

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.751
Or is it just correlation?

00:24:18.751 --> 00:24:21.250
It seems like you're sort of
cherry picking beautiful things

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:26.844
here, beautiful things there,
and sort of ignoring the rest.

00:24:26.844 --> 00:24:28.254
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:28.254 --> 00:24:30.795
FRANK WILCZEK: Well, I guess if
there's not complete overlap,

00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:32.500
I have to ignore something.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.670
But I will stand by the
claim that the aspects

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.110
of physical law that I've
chosen are not cherry picked.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.910
Those are absolutely central to
our fundamental understanding

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.410
of the basic laws.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.850
Now, you might ask-- I think
the spirit of your question

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.650
is, is that a coincidence,
or does that go deeper?

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.790
I don't think it's an
entire coincidence.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.930
So where does our sense
of duty come from?

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.960
Well, certainly part of it
is we find beautiful things

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.980
that evolution wants to
encourage us to enjoy and get

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.020
more of.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.450
That's part of the
feeling of pleasure

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.260
that we get from
beautiful thing.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:25.736
Now, we as human beings
have quite a challenge

00:25:25.736 --> 00:25:31.470
to get our sensory act
in order, so to speak.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:35.560
When you look out at the world,
you want to interpret it,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.260
or evolution wants
you to interpret it,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.220
as a world of three-dimensional
objects you can move around in,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.367
possibly threatening
things, possibly

00:25:43.367 --> 00:25:44.950
things you want to
mate with, possibly

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:45.908
things you want to eat.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.880
But the signal that
arrives on our retina

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.820
is a two-dimensional
image, scrambled often.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:02.180
It's a very non-trivial task,
as some of you may be exploring,

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:07.610
art of computer vision know,
it's a very non-trivial task

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.630
to figure out how we do it.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.810
Part of it has to be that
we're intuitively very

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.310
good at projective geometry.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.800
We could go back from
a two-dimensional image

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.110
to the three-dimensional
thing it might have produced.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:28.040
But to actually codify the
rules of projective geometry

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.370
and perspective
was very difficult.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.330
We don't know how we do
it, but a very large part

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.340
of the human brain is
devoted to precisely

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.950
this visual processing.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:41.040
And part of it
has to be learned.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.520
And so in the
process of learning,

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.590
when we make successful
generalizations,

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.490
I think that's something
we want to get rewarded for

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.990
and find beautiful.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.080
Now, if you can
identify patterns

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.280
that nature actually
conforms to, if you can say,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.440
for instance, symmetry,
if an object a symmetric,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.260
you can infer how some of it
behaves that you haven't seen

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.480
from parts that you have
seen or you can anticipate

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.230
the parts you haven't seen yet
from the appearance of things

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.150
you have seen.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.640
So symmetry, I
think, is something

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:22.735
we're naturally inclined to find
beautiful because it's useful.

00:27:22.735 --> 00:27:25.990
And so it's not
entirely a coincidence.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.210
And of course, the
idea that things

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.850
can be built up
from simpler pieces

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:37.500
is also a very useful thing
in understanding the world

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.320
and in interacting with it.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.140
And so that kind of
exuberance is also something

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.250
that we are naturally
inclined to find beautiful

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.210
because it's useful.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.850
Now, I thought about
that by myself,

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:56.560
but I'm told that's a kind
of Kantian explanation.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.620
It's sort of in the
theory of how we have

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.190
to interact with the world.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.340
There are apparent
facts about the world,

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.350
like its beauty,
that could explain.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:15.320
But it sort of doesn't matter
if their properties-- it's not

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.440
a coincidence that
we find it beautiful,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.880
that the way the world
works we find beautiful.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.110
AUDIENCE: So thank
you again for coming.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.490
This may be an oddly
specific question,

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.815
but I don't know if you've
seen the recent articles,

00:28:29.815 --> 00:28:32.137
but the LAC just announced--

00:28:32.137 --> 00:28:33.220
FRANK WILCZEK: Pentaquark.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:33.610
[LAUGHS]

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.318
AUDIENCE: Yes,
[INAUDIBLE] of pentaquark.

00:28:35.318 --> 00:28:38.645
And so as an advanced
particle physicist,

00:28:38.645 --> 00:28:41.020
I was wondering if you had
any particular thoughts on it.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.478
It looked interesting
to me that it

00:28:42.478 --> 00:28:44.830
was I think exactly
what we expected, right?

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.840
There's no loose color
or charge or non-integer.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.110
FRANK WILCZEK: Oh, it's not
revolutionary in the sense

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.080
of upsetting the
fundamental theory.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:58.300
In fact, in a way it's like a
phoenix rising from the ashes.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:04.580
There was, about 10 years
ago, a purported observation

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.220
of a particle also that
would be a pentaquark.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.220
Let me backtrack a little,
because I don't think

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.105
all of you know about
what pentaquarks are

00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:14.780
or maybe even what quarks are.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:21.460
But in our understanding of the
strongly interacting particles,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.770
of which protons and neutrons
are the simplest and most

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:29.440
familiar representatives, this
is quantum chromodynamics.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.720
It's the thing I got
the Nobel Prize for.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.745
So it must be right.

00:29:32.745 --> 00:29:33.429
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:33.429 --> 00:29:34.720
It's very precise and detailed.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:44.740
The two kinds of body plans that
hundreds of existing particles

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.570
conform to-- so I should say
in addition to the proton,

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.660
neutron, there are hundreds,
maybe by now thousands,

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.600
of other, unstable
particles that

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.365
arose in the exploration
of the strong interaction

00:29:57.365 --> 00:30:00.170
at accelerators.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:04.740
So to organize this
zoo, originally

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.410
Murray Gell-Mann
and George Zweig

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:10.460
invented something
called the quark model.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.490
And according to
the quark model,

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.450
which later got
largely validated

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:20.300
by a real theory, Quantum
Chromodynamics, or QCD,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.420
there are two basic body plans
that you can understand all

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.930
these particles in terms of.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:32.080
One body plan is three
quarks, and that, by the way,

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.400
is how quarks got their name.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.620
There's an obscure quote
in James Joyce's "Ulysses,"

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.980
"Three quarks for
Master Mark," right?

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:47.270
That Murray, who's a big
show-off, picked up on.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.340
And those things
are called baryons

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.730
that have that that body plan.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.050
And protons and
neutrons are baryons.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.730
Then there are
also mesons, which

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.560
are made from a quark
and an antiquark.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.160
There are also
antibaryons, which

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.060
are three antiquirks,
basically two body plans.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.020
And as I said,
hundreds of examples

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.840
of realizations of those
two body plans are known.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.110
And a fundamental principle
is that you shouldn't

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.280
be able to find a single quark.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.930
That's not allowed to QCD.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.090
You can have multiples of three.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:30.590
So modulo three,
it has to be zero.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.270
So both the baryons
and the mesons

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:37.160
conform to that, because quarks
have one, antiquarks minus one.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.890
Now, another possibility that
does obey the rule of three

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:46.970
but is more complicated than
either mesons or baryons

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.660
would be to have four quarks
and one antiquark, so five

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.200
altogether.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.190
That's penta, pentaquarks.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:59.320
And about 10 years ago, there
was a purported observation

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.000
of a pentaquark that caused
quite a kerfuffle, an outburst

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.190
of theory, ambulance-chasing
trying to explain

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.600
this, which I participated in.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.420
But it was a sad story.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.980
Anyway, the experimental
observation kind of evaporated.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.040
Now all of a sudden,
I think last week

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:33.832
or even just a few days
ago, the CERN laboratory,

00:32:33.832 --> 00:32:37.790
the LHCD group, so-called,
that has announced

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.410
the discovery of not
that same old particle,

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:46.050
but another thing, which
is a pentaquark, which

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.340
would have to be made out of
four quarks and one antiquark.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.370
This evidence looks
much more reasonable.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.580
We had a hard time accommodating
the purported observation

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.080
before.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.770
This one really looks good.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.080
The paper looks really solid.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.940
It's a collaboration
with thousands, literally

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.936
thousands of members.

00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:07.060
So they can't all be wrong.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:16.470
Anyway, so very likely, this
is a legitimate discovery

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.660
of a new kind of body plan.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.566
If so, it will be great fun.

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:23.190
It doesn't change
anything fundamental.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.570
It doesn't change QCD.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.920
But we can't really solve
the equations well enough

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:34.330
to know in advance what
these unstable, highly

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:39.720
excited, massive particles
should look like.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.120
So it's possible.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.970
We can't derive it.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.210
We have to use sort
of approximate models.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.090
But it looks very reasonable.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:52.800
And if it is correct, because
the possibility of this body

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.390
plan can be realized in
many, many different ways,

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.410
there should be years of
fun and additional insight

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.530
into how the strong interactions
work from investigating

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.750
this new world of pentaquarks.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.340
AUDIENCE: Is it even
possible for science

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.692
to discover anything about
really asymmetric things?

00:34:17.692 --> 00:34:18.650
FRANK WILCZEK: Oh, yes.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.130
AUDIENCE: Given that
it relies on being

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.670
able to change the time
and place of an experiment

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.071
without changing the outcome.

00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:29.110
FRANK WILCZEK: [LAUGHS]
Yeah, that kind of symmetry

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:36.159
is called time translation
symmetry, that you can change

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:40.460
the origin of time, if you
like, when you count times for,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.260
without changing
the consequences

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.719
for physical behavior.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:50.290
That may seem like
an odd way of stating

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.159
the fact that the laws
just don't change,

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.940
but it's the most
profound way just

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.590
to rephrase it as a
statement of symmetry

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.845
and similarly spatial symmetry.

00:34:59.845 --> 00:35:02.330
And the fact that the laws
are the same everywhere

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.770
is embodied in a
symmetry principle

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.385
called translation symmetry.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.450
So those look pretty
good just empirically.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.080
You can look out at the
sky, and because stars

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.640
are very far away and light
travels at a finite speed,

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.470
you can see into the
past, what behavior

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.550
was like in the distant past.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.070
You can see, not just in a
vague way, but very precisely,

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.450
say for instance, whether
the spectral lines are

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.475
in the same place for
different elements

00:35:38.475 --> 00:35:40.650
and whether the same
elements are out there.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.470
And so yeah, you can
make very detailed checks

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.050
that the same laws
to great accuracy

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:52.030
worked back then and also
over there, as we find today.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.990
So those symmetries
look really good.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.910
But it's not a question
of us imposing them.

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:59.240
They're just true.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:05.630
There are other parts of physics
where asymmetry is actually

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.560
quite significant.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.330
But we have a fallback position,
which is called spontaneously

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.890
broken symmetry.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.080
And I didn't want to
go there, because it's

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.880
a little-- I wanted to keep
things-- but since you asked,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.240
let me give you a beautiful
example of spontaneously

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.560
broken symmetry.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.050
Spontaneously broken
symmetry is the idea

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:37.940
that your fundamental
description, equations or laws,

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:43.670
have symmetry, but their stable
realizations can't have that.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:48.020
Stable realizations have
to have less symmetry.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:53.420
So I think a wonderful
example is traffic patterns.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.250
So you could either
drive on the right

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.490
or you can drive on the left.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.500
And either choice is just
as good in principle.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.820
But everybody better pick
one or the other, OK?

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.770
And on this side of the
Atlantic, we pick one.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.270
In England, they've
chosen another.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:14.590
Both systems work well, but
you can't mix them, all right?

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.840
So the symmetry
between different sides

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.020
of the road is fundamentally
correct in the laws

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:28.370
but in its stable realizations
can't be maintained.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.780
So we have spontaneous
symmetry breaking.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.110
In much more
sophisticated versions,

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.430
we find that is a
powerful principle that

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:42.010
allows us to use
symmetrical equations that

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.540
appear on the surface to
be too good for this world.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.980
They have too much symmetry
to describe the world.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.540
But their stable solutions
have less symmetry.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.380
This is the line of
thought that led people

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:01.090
to pollute beautiful
equations that

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:05.380
could have been true of the weak
interactions with a Higgs field

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.870
that fills the universe
that spoils the symmetry

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.980
and allows it to agree with
what we actually observe.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.270
And then years
later, people found

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.675
manifestations of this
Higgs field, the quanta,

00:38:19.675 --> 00:38:21.590
the excitations of it.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.580
So spontaneous
symmetry breaking has

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.160
been a nice fallback
position that

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.990
allows us to use
equations that are

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:34.005
more beautiful than the
world superficially looks.

00:38:34.005 --> 00:38:34.838
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:34.838 --> 00:38:36.690
FRANK WILCZEK: OK.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:42.000
Well, I'll just mentioned
that this concept of color

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.640
res and extra dimension
is very flexible,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.600
and you can have a
lot of fun with it.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.890
Dogs see two dimensions.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:54.410
And so you can imagine what a
dog's perception looks like.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.590
There are also creatures
that see many more.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.490
The champion is
the manta shrimp,

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.510
which, depending on which
variety of manta shrimp,

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:10.430
can have between 12 and 16
different kinds of color

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.937
receptors, including
things that extend

00:39:12.937 --> 00:39:14.520
into the infrared
and the ultraviolet.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.240
This is what a manta
shrimp looks like to us.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.870
You can only imagine what
they look like to each other.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.840
And presumably that's
the point, that they

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.550
can make impressive
displays and communicate

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:36.370
by changing their colors.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.850
Wouldn't it be nice if we
could enhance our own color

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:40.410
perception?

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.450
Well, we can, and I'm doing it.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:51.060
But I'd have to get you to
sign NDAs to go further.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.890
So I'm going to stop there.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.750
OK, thank you very much
for your attention.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.300
[APPLAUSE]
