00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.928
At the end of last hour,
we had just gotten to the point

00:00:18.928 --> 00:00:22.714
of having developed the
molecular orbital energy level

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:27.142
diagram for the BH three
molecule, this trigonal planar

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:29.571
entity.
And I had not had time last

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.714
hour to show you what these
molecular orbitals look like in

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:38.071
their calculated form.
And so, I am going to start off

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.480
today by doing that,
and then will proceed to answer

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.624
a quadrangle of questions that
we can attack regarding diatomic

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:48.298
molecules using molecular
orbital theory.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.974
Remember that the BH three
MO problem is a seven

00:00:51.974 --> 00:00:55.048
orbital problem.
And so, we will go through and

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:58.724
just look at these seven
molecular orbitals in ascending

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:02.000
energy from the lowest energy on
up.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.990
This one is the lowest energy
molecular orbital for BH three

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.151
as calculated using a
modern quantum chemical package.

00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:16.803
And what you can see is that
since we are indicating the

00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:21.794
phase of the wave function by
color, there is only one phase

00:01:21.794 --> 00:01:24.078
to be seen.
This, of course,

00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:27.800
is a characteristic property of
an s orbital.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.722
Remember that?
And what we have here,

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:36.183
at the center of the molecule,
is the 2s orbital on boron.

00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:40.567
And in this molecular orbital
theory, effectively what is

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:44.951
happening is that 2s orbital on
boron is reaching out and

00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:49.882
simultaneously overlapping with
the three 1s orbitals on each of

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:52.857
the hydrogens.
And the way that we have

00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:57.866
orthogonalized it and normalized
it amounts to a single molecular

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.136
orbital that can,
if you will,

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:03.894
house a pair of electrons in
this orbital that is

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:10.000
simultaneously bonding between
boron and the three hydrogens.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.846
You have one electron pair in
here.

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:17.953
Two of the six electrons in the
valance shell of this molecule

00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:21.553
are in this lowest lying,
most tightly held,

00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:24.734
most electronegative molecular
orbital.

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:28.000
Let's look now at the next one.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.475
You should be thinking in your
mind just what was the next

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:49.107
highest lying orbital that we
had, and you will realize that

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:53.896
this is an orbital formed from
one of the boron p orbitals and

00:02:53.896 --> 00:02:59.000
a linear combination of two of
the hydrogen wave functions.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.117
And let's see if you can
recognize it based on what we

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:08.462
did last time.
Maybe I can reorient it to help

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:12.517
in that regard.
Here is a molecular orbital

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:17.731
that can house a pair of
electrons, one spin-up and one

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:22.944
spin-down, and that is
simultaneously bonding from that

00:03:22.944 --> 00:03:27.000
boron to this hydrogen,
up here.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.566
And then there is a nodal
surface, here,

00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:33.383
that is coincident with the
nodal surfaces of the boron 2px

00:03:33.383 --> 00:03:36.872
orbital, using the same
coordinate system that we were

00:03:36.872 --> 00:03:39.570
using last time.
And so, the wave function

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.334
changes sign as you pass through
the boron.

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:46.217
And then the opposite phase
lobe of the boron 2px orbital is

00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:49.244
able to overlap with these two
hydrogens, here.

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:52.009
If you will remember,
when I wrote down the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.299
normalization constants for this
molecular orbital,

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.919
we had double the coefficient
on the hydrogen up here as

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.000
compared with the two hydrogens
down here.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.693
And they were opposite in sign.
And that leads to a really nice

00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:11.705
overlap, as you can see here.
This is BH bonding here,

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:13.597
and BH bonding,
down here.

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:16.474
And it involves that boron 2px
orbital.

00:04:16.474 --> 00:04:20.940
One way you can think about
this molecular orbital theory is

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.179
that this 2px orbital on the
central atom is reaching out

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:29.266
with its intrinsic plus-minus
phase combination that is

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:33.581
intrinsic to a 2px orbital
simultaneously reaching out and

00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:38.123
bonding with all three hydrogens
in the only way that it can,

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:43.544
being a 2px orbital.
And so, we created that linear

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:46.427
combination with that idea in
mind.

00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:50.922
And then, if we go up one more
in energy, strike that.

00:04:50.922 --> 00:04:55.756
Not one up more in energy,
but to the other orbital in the

00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:58.724
molecule that is at the same
energy.

00:04:58.724 --> 00:05:02.286
What we will find is that we
are involving,

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:06.867
now, the 2py orbital.
And it will reach out and

00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:10.303
interact with hydrogens in the
only way it can,

00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:14.262
given its intrinsic nodal
properties as a 2py orbital.

00:05:14.262 --> 00:05:18.371
Remember that a 2py orbital has
the x,z-plane as a nodal

00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:21.284
surface.
And there is a hydrogen up here

00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:24.944
on that x,z-plane,
namely the one that lies on the

00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:27.783
plus x-axis.
And because it lies on the

00:05:27.783 --> 00:05:32.339
intrinsic nodal surface of this
2py orbital, it can contribute

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:36.000
nothing to this molecular
orbital.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.370
All we are seeing up here at
the top is an arbitrarily sized

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.000
sphere, just to show the
location of that nucleus,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.481
the hydrogen nucleus that is on
the plus x-axis.

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:50.814
And then here,
what you see is the 2py orbital

00:05:50.814 --> 00:05:55.333
oriented along y and overlapping
simultaneously with a plus 1s

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:59.851
wave function here and minus 1s
wave function here so that you

00:05:59.851 --> 00:06:03.925
see a beautiful bonding
molecular orbital that is at the

00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:08.000
same energy at the one we just
looked at.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.463
And so, as you step up in
energy, looking at the energy

00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:14.606
level diagram for BH three
from last time,

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:17.749
that is what you see.
We have now six electrons in

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.314
the molecule,
two in this orbital and two

00:06:20.314 --> 00:06:24.419
each in the two orbitals we just
looked at that provide the three

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.947
BH bonds that we represent in
the valance bond theory as

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:32.253
electron pair bonds.
But this is a totally different

00:06:32.253 --> 00:06:36.906
way of looking at the electronic
structure that is very appearing

00:06:36.906 --> 00:06:41.485
because it just takes advantage
of the atomic orbital properties

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.829
that you would calculate for
your central atom.

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:48.028
Now, let's go up one more.
The very next one,

00:06:48.028 --> 00:06:51.953
I will skip showing to you for
purposes of saving time,

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:56.024
here, but you know that the
next orbital up is simply the

00:06:56.024 --> 00:07:00.023
2pz orbital on the boron,
which is our lowest unoccupied

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:03.221
molecular orbital,
as well as being an atomic

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:07.292
orbital in this system and
responsible for the Lewis acid

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:12.559
characteristics of this species.
And one up above that,

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:16.742
one higher in energy than the
LUMO is the orbital that I did

00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:20.287
show you last time,
the out-of-phase combination of

00:07:20.287 --> 00:07:24.115
the boron 2s with the three
hydrogens all with the same

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:26.384
sign.
It is sort of a round nodal

00:07:26.384 --> 00:07:30.000
surface intersection each of the
BH bonds.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.572
And then, finally,
orbitals number six and seven

00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:40.605
are the antibonding counterparts
to the ones that I just showed

00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:45.275
you involving boron's 2px and
2py wave functions.

00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:49.362
Here is what these look like.
And this one,

00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:53.059
you will see,
involves the 2px orbital.

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:58.508
Here is our x-axis pointing up.
And the blue lobe of 2px,

00:07:58.508 --> 00:08:02.205
the positive lobe here,
as you can see,

00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:07.698
is squished out and down.
These pictures can be a little

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:11.094
bit more complicated than what
we are used to looking at from

00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:14.037
just sketching it out on the
board or the qualitative

00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:16.754
pictures that you sometimes see
in your textbook.

00:08:16.754 --> 00:08:20.207
But what we do find here that
is the important feature is that

00:08:20.207 --> 00:08:22.981
as we go from the 1s
contribution on this hydrogen

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:26.320
over here to the positive lobe
of 2px we are going through a

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.584
nodal surface.
And that is antibonding in

00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:31.694
character.
And you can see that this

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:35.217
deformation of this lobe of the
p orbital, of course,

00:08:35.217 --> 00:08:38.063
looks like a high energy type
of phenomena.

00:08:38.063 --> 00:08:41.248
And indeed it is.
This is one of the two highest

00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:45.246
energy orbitals in the energy
level diagram for the BH three

00:08:45.246 --> 00:08:47.753
molecule.
And then, similarly,

00:08:47.753 --> 00:08:51.616
here is the other lobe of the
2px orbital, the minus lobe.

00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:55.342
And, as you try to go from it
to the adjacent hydrogens,

00:08:55.342 --> 00:08:59.408
remember, in the bonding one we
were allowing this to overlap

00:08:59.408 --> 00:09:03.000
with the same sign on the
hydrogens.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.403
Now we have the opposite sign
on the hydrogens,

00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:10.694
so that we have a beautiful
antibonding node indicated here

00:09:10.694 --> 00:09:15.133
and here between the minus phase
lobe of 2px and the adjacent

00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:17.945
hydrogens.
So, this antibonding orbital

00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:22.088
has lots of internuclear nodes,
nodes that appear between

00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:26.305
nuclei and indicate that we are
not getting overlapped and

00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:30.596
bonding, but rather we are
getting a high frequency orbital

00:09:30.596 --> 00:09:36.187
that is likewise high in energy.
Finally, I will show you the

00:09:36.187 --> 00:09:39.468
counterpart to this one,
that involves 2py.

00:09:39.468 --> 00:09:44.000
It is a little easier to
understand from inspecting it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.411
And it also evinces the
internuclear nodes that you

00:09:55.411 --> 00:10:00.000
would expect for an antibonding
molecular orbital.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.017
And I am orienting it so that
you will be able to understand

00:10:04.017 --> 00:10:07.762
it with reference to our
coordinate system as introduced

00:10:07.762 --> 00:10:10.486
last time.
And so, you have the boron and

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:12.461
the hydrogen along x,
up here.

00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:15.661
Here is our 2py.
It is sort of bending away from

00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:19.815
these two hydrogens whose wave
functions have opposite sign to

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:23.015
the lobes that are directed into
their vicinity.

00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:27.237
You can see that we have here a
nodal surface between boron and

00:10:27.237 --> 00:10:30.778
this hydrogen wherein the
bonding counterpart that we

00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:35.000
looked at had the same sign and
a nice bond.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.235
And then over here,
once again, the mirror image.

00:10:38.235 --> 00:10:42.078
So, this is one of our final
orbitals in looking at the BH

00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:44.370
three energy level
diagram.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.943
It is the case that if you
start to put electrons into

00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:51.247
antibonding orbitals,
they will cancel the bonding

00:10:51.247 --> 00:10:53.808
properties of the bonding
counterparts.

00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:57.516
And we will explore that in
quite a bit more detail here

00:10:57.516 --> 00:11:02.432
shortly.
Let me leave that up there for

00:11:02.432 --> 00:11:09.756
now and tell you what quadrangle
of problems it is that I hope to

00:11:09.756 --> 00:11:15.134
answer for you today using more
MO theory ideas.

00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:22.000
First of these will be why He
two is so stable?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.420
And so, today's lecture is
predominantly devoted to

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:39.712
diatomic molecules.
And He two will be the

00:11:39.712 --> 00:11:44.848
first of these.
Let's make this unstable.

00:11:44.848 --> 00:11:52.295
Let's do stable here in just a
moment, but first let's say,

00:11:52.295 --> 00:12:00.000
next, why does O two
have unpaired electrons?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.526
Certainly, if we draw the
valance bond picture for O two,

00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:14.900
like that,
it does not give us any

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.591
indication that this diatomic
molecule would have unpaired

00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:22.965
electrons.
And so, we are going to see how

00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:26.503
MO theory can shed some light on
this issue.

00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:30.947
And then, the final two
questions that I will fold into

00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:36.214
one line here given the way I am
using up space on this board is,

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:40.000
why is N two so stable
--

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
-- and CO poison?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.904
MO theory can shed very clear
light on all of these questions.

00:12:55.904 --> 00:12:59.423
And so, that is what we will
work on for the rest of the

00:12:59.423 --> 00:13:01.055
hour.
In MO theory,

00:13:01.055 --> 00:13:05.925
there are a couple things you
should keep in mind when trying

00:13:05.925 --> 00:13:11.038
to grasp all the subtleties of a
given energy level diagram with

00:13:11.038 --> 00:13:15.909
which you may be confronted in
your textbook or on an exam or

00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:20.535
just through reading papers in
the Journal of the American

00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:25.000
Chemical Society,
wherever you may find these.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.748
You should keep in mind that,
number one, interaction is

00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:36.165
strong.
That is, when atomic orbitals

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:43.159
interact to form molecular
orbitals, the AO interaction is

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:45.000
strong --

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
-- when there is good spatial
overlap.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.188
Overlap is a central concept in
molecular orbital theory.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:19.452
The idea is that if you have
atoms that are far apart from

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:23.192
each other in space,
then their wave functions have

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:27.456
dropped off exponentially and
are not interacting much and

00:14:27.456 --> 00:14:32.254
there is not good overlap.
But when orbitals are close in

00:14:32.254 --> 00:14:36.689
space and if their orbitals are
directed in space toward one

00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:40.598
another, then there may be
overlap that leads to good

00:14:40.598 --> 00:14:43.454
bonding.
And also I can echo this first

00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:47.062
part, AO interaction is strong
when, and say two,

00:14:47.062 --> 00:14:50.970
AOs are close in energy.
The interacting orbitals are

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.000
close in energy.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.076
When I talk about where atomic
orbitals are in energy,

00:15:17.076 --> 00:15:21.461
I am going to really want you
to think about your periodic

00:15:21.461 --> 00:15:26.076
table and the properties that
appear with periodicity and are

00:15:26.076 --> 00:15:30.000
organized and collated in the
periodic table.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.948
We are going to be talking
about properties like

00:15:33.948 --> 00:15:37.728
electronegativity as it relates
to the energy.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:42.181
And I will get to that a little
bit on the next board,

00:15:42.181 --> 00:15:45.878
but let's first make a small MO
diagram here.

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:51.170
And this will be a diagram that
we may use both for H two

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.203
or He two.
This is the simplest of all MO

00:15:55.203 --> 00:16:01.000
diagrams and one with which you
should be quite familiar.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.099
We have a bonding molecular
orbital at low-end energy.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:14.234
And notice that if this is a 1s
orbital over here and this is a

00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:20.448
1s orbital over here for H two
or He two 

00:16:20.448 --> 00:16:25.857
systems, then when these come
together and bond,

00:16:25.857 --> 00:16:30.000
here are your two nuclei,
--

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.963
-- and here is a probability
density isosurface that I am

00:16:33.963 --> 00:16:37.785
drawing around that shows
in-phase combination of those

00:16:37.785 --> 00:16:42.031
two 1s orbitals merging with
each other, giving good overlap,

00:16:42.031 --> 00:16:45.429
and the interacting AOs being
of the same energy.

00:16:45.429 --> 00:16:49.817
Because the H two and He
two molecules have such

00:16:49.817 --> 00:16:52.577
symmetry we have a good bonding
orbital.

00:16:52.577 --> 00:16:55.762
And then, up here,
we must find there to be an

00:16:55.762 --> 00:16:59.301
internuclear node in that
corresponding antibonding

00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:03.653
orbital.
And so, it will look something

00:17:03.653 --> 00:17:05.863
like this.
And, therefore,

00:17:05.863 --> 00:17:10.639
I am going to associate with
this high-lying orbital an

00:17:10.639 --> 00:17:14.707
asterisk to indicate the
antibonding character,

00:17:14.707 --> 00:17:18.068
the presence of this
internuclear node,

00:17:18.068 --> 00:17:23.108
the change of sign as we go
from one nucleus to the other,

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:27.000
the absence of bonding
character.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.787
Here we have the buildup of
electron density in the

00:17:30.787 --> 00:17:34.500
internuclear region,
electrons being stabilized by

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.818
being held simultaneously by
more than one nucleus that is

00:17:38.818 --> 00:17:42.530
positively charged.
And here, the exact inverse of

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:47.227
that, constructive interference
and destructive interference in

00:17:47.227 --> 00:17:50.409
the H two or He two
systems.

00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:54.121
And then we can ask,
how many electrons do we have

00:17:54.121 --> 00:18:00.099
to put into the diagram?
If it is the H two case,

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:04.000
then, to figure out the bond
order, --

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.616
-- what we do is populate the
diagram according to the same

00:18:18.616 --> 00:18:23.154
kind of Aufbau principle that
you would for generating the

00:18:23.154 --> 00:18:27.611
energy level diagram for an
atom, and taking into account

00:18:27.611 --> 00:18:32.075
things like Hund's rule.
If it is H two,

00:18:32.075 --> 00:18:37.641
we have two electrons that we
can put in, which in here with

00:18:37.641 --> 00:18:39.905
opposing spin,
like that.

00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:43.396
That is our bonding molecular
orbital.

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:48.679
We have two bonding electrons.
Zero antibonding electrons

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:52.547
divided by two equals a bond
order of one.

00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:57.924
We have an H-H single bond in
the case of the H two

00:18:57.924 --> 00:19:02.658
molecule.
But if we have He two,

00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:07.354
then in the He two system,
we have two more electrons,

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:12.582
and the only place they can go
is up here in the antibonding

00:19:12.582 --> 00:19:16.746
molecular orbital.
We have two bonding minus two

00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:22.240
antibonding over two is equal to
zero for a bond order of zero.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.291
And so, the idea is that if two
He atoms collide with each

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:31.987
other, when they do so,
their orbitals may overlap and

00:19:31.987 --> 00:19:36.455
give rise to bonding.
But, simultaneously,

00:19:36.455 --> 00:19:40.167
you get antibonding.
And the net bond order is zero,

00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:44.169
and so He two is not
bound, but these atoms just

00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:47.663
bounce off each other.
There is no stabilization.

00:19:47.663 --> 00:19:51.301
And you can certainly
understand that if we were in

00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:55.086
the middle somewhere,
as we would be if we had He two

00:19:55.086 --> 00:19:58.288
plus,
missing one electron up here,

00:19:58.288 --> 00:20:02.000
then our bond order would be
one-half.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.666
It is going to get a lot more
complicated than this,

00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:11.607
but this you have to know
because this is a really nice

00:20:11.607 --> 00:20:16.732
starting point for thinking
about bonding in all kinds of

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:20.666
scenarios where you may need to
consider it.

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:24.875
And so, let's look at some
periodic properties.

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:30.000
This will be with reference,
again, to energy.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.879
And I am interested in how some
of the properties of the atoms

00:20:36.879 --> 00:20:41.278
vary as we go across the
periodic table,

00:20:41.278 --> 00:20:48.045
lithium to beryllium to boron
to carbon to nitrogen to oxygen

00:20:48.045 --> 00:20:52.894
and over to fluorine.
And I will stop there.

00:20:52.894 --> 00:21:00.000
We won't worry about any more
of the noble gases today.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.496
As we go from left to right,
one of the things that you know

00:21:03.496 --> 00:21:07.170
from your study of the periodic
table is that electronegativity

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.000
increases.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.910
This increases from left to
right across the Periodic Table

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.000
in concert with increasing Z.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.892
That is, the increasing atomic
number.

00:21:36.892 --> 00:21:41.738
That is, the increasing number
of positively charged protons in

00:21:41.738 --> 00:21:46.194
our nucleus, as we go across.
Each time we are adding more

00:21:46.194 --> 00:21:50.258
protons to that nucleus.
The nucleus is becoming more

00:21:50.258 --> 00:21:53.619
and more positively charged as
we go across.

00:21:53.619 --> 00:21:58.231
And an important consequence of
that has to do with the fact

00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:03.000
that s orbitals don't have a
node at the nucleus.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.637
Whereas, p orbitals do.
Since these elements are in the

00:22:08.637 --> 00:22:12.708
so-called p block of our
periodic table,

00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:18.241
well, lithium in the s block,
but we will consider the

00:22:18.241 --> 00:22:24.230
properties all the way across.
And the energy issue up here

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:29.249
that I am going to be concerned
with is the energy of the atomic

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:33.949
2s versus 2p orbitals as we go
from left to right across the

00:22:33.949 --> 00:22:37.375
periodic table,
systematically adding to the

00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:42.473
number of protons in our nucleus
in a way that does not affect 2s

00:22:42.473 --> 00:22:46.377
orbitals the same way that it
affects 2p orbitals.

00:22:46.377 --> 00:22:50.599
It turns out that by the time
we get over to fluorine,

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:55.220
where we have essentially our
most electronegative element,

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.000
the 2s orbital has sunk to a
very low energy.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.769
And the 2p orbital has gone
down in energy as well,

00:23:05.769 --> 00:23:12.000
but just not by nearly as much.
And so, it is nearly an

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.807
isotonic function as we go
across.

00:23:15.807 --> 00:23:22.500
2p is decreasing in energy in
response to this increased Z,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.692
but not as much as 2s is
decreasing in energy,

00:23:27.692 --> 00:23:34.615
having to do with the fact that
2s electrons see much more of

00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:41.884
the nucleus than 2p electrons do
because 2s electrons don't have

00:23:41.884 --> 00:23:47.954
a node there.
They spend a lot more time in

00:23:47.954 --> 00:23:52.641
close to the nucleus than do
your 2p electrons.

00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:57.837
This has a really important
influence on that set of

00:23:57.837 --> 00:24:02.932
diatomic molecule MO theory
problems, eight orbital

00:24:02.932 --> 00:24:09.249
problems, that we call homo or
heteronuclear diatomic molecules

00:24:09.249 --> 00:24:14.639
of these elements.
And that has to do with the

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:20.603
fact that in between nitrogen
and oxygen, a fundamental change

00:24:20.603 --> 00:24:24.416
takes place in the energy level
diagram.

00:24:24.416 --> 00:24:28.717
And that change,
that results from the atomic

00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:33.997
structure of the elements,
ends up with the result that

00:24:33.997 --> 00:24:38.689
the MO diagram is much easier to
draw for oxygen,

00:24:38.689 --> 00:24:41.231
O two,
and fluorine,

00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:45.044
F two,
than it is for the earlier

00:24:45.044 --> 00:24:48.714
ones.
And it is much easier to

00:24:48.714 --> 00:24:53.000
understand for O two and
F two than it is for N

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.714
two, C two, B two,
Be two, Li two.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
So, let's just see what that
means.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.367
First of all,
when we are going to draw an

00:25:14.367 --> 00:25:17.982
energy level diagram for a
diatomic molecule,

00:25:17.982 --> 00:25:23.075
if it is a homonuclear diatomic
molecule, meaning the two atoms

00:25:23.075 --> 00:25:27.099
that are going to be bonded
together are the same,

00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:31.617
that means that the atomic
orbitals for the contributing

00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:36.787
atoms are the same.
Here, on the left,

00:25:36.787 --> 00:25:44.529
what I am drawing is,
let's say, an F or an O atom.

00:25:44.529 --> 00:25:49.483
We have the 2s and the 2p,
x-y-z.

00:25:49.483 --> 00:25:58.000
That is four of the eight
orbitals in our problem.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.617
And then, over here,
we have the other identical F

00:26:03.617 --> 00:26:10.840
or O atom, with its 2p x-y-z and
2s orbitals at exactly the same

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.426
energy as for the counterpart,
over here.

00:26:15.426 --> 00:26:18.980
So, this is another F or O
atom.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:25.630
And then we are going to ask,
how can these atomic orbitals

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:31.477
combine to give molecular
orbitals in these diatomic

00:26:31.477 --> 00:26:35.897
molecules?
This is unlike the BH three

00:26:35.897 --> 00:26:40.396
problem because there is
no atom at the center of gravity

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:43.278
of our system,
but the ideas are the same.

00:26:43.278 --> 00:26:47.637
And the ideas are very much the
same as what we have here for H

00:26:47.637 --> 00:26:51.995
two, where also we could
make molecular orbitals despite

00:26:51.995 --> 00:26:56.142
the fact that there was no atom
at the center of our system.

00:26:56.142 --> 00:27:00.079
We can pretend that there is,
and we can use that pretend

00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:05.000
atom to identify what linear
combinations we should make.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.124
A simpler way to do it,
at this point,

00:27:09.124 --> 00:27:14.809
would be to say that our
molecule has the two nuclei

00:27:14.809 --> 00:27:20.495
oriented along the z-axis.
And then you have x and y

00:27:20.495 --> 00:27:25.957
perpendicular to z.
And so, if we take this choice

00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:32.422
of coordinate system that the
molecule is oriented along z,

00:27:32.422 --> 00:27:39.000
the two nuclei lie one on plus
z, one on minus z.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:47.464
Then we can immediately
classify our atomic orbitals as

00:27:47.464 --> 00:27:55.459
being either sigma or pi with
respect to the z-axis.

00:27:55.459 --> 00:28:02.670
I will say AO is sigma or pi
with respect to z,

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:10.818
which is the molecular axis.
And remember what that means in

00:28:10.818 --> 00:28:15.909
terms of the nodal properties.
If something is sigma with

00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:19.818
respect to z,
that means if you view it down

00:28:19.818 --> 00:28:25.090
z it will look like a cylinder.
It will look like a sphere,

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.090
actually.
It will be cylindrically

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:32.363
symmetric about the z-axis.
If it is sigma then,

00:28:32.363 --> 00:28:37.000
if you are viewing down z,
you see that.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.066
That could be either an s
orbital or it could be a pz

00:28:43.066 --> 00:28:47.616
orbital.
They would look the same if you

00:28:47.616 --> 00:28:52.049
were viewing right down z.
And then pi,

00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:56.250
viewing down z,
would look like this.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:03.016
And that would be a px or a py
orbital perpendicular to the

00:29:03.016 --> 00:29:07.473
z-axis.
And this would be an s orbital

00:29:07.473 --> 00:29:11.101
or a pz orbital.
What I can say right away is

00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:15.882
that we can separate out the
molecular orbitals that we are

00:29:15.882 --> 00:29:20.994
going to form from these atomic
orbitals into their sigma or pi

00:29:20.994 --> 00:29:24.127
characteristics relative to the
z-axis.

00:29:24.127 --> 00:29:28.909
And because we are in the O or
F atom case, very far on the

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:33.444
right-hand side the periodic
table, we have a large gap.

00:29:33.444 --> 00:29:36.000
This gap is large.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.409
We can make the approximation
that this 2s orbital here,

00:29:47.409 --> 00:29:53.606
which could in principle form a
sigma bond with this 2pz orbital

00:29:53.606 --> 00:29:59.213
over here, that would be an
interaction looking like that,

00:29:59.213 --> 00:30:02.372
--
-- that that does not occur.

00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:07.372
Because remember here I said
you get strong interaction when

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:10.677
the interacting AOs are close in
energy.

00:30:10.677 --> 00:30:15.084
When you are talking about
these very electronegative

00:30:15.084 --> 00:30:20.000
elements, the s manifold of
orbitals is very well separated

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.169
in energy from the p manifold.
That leads to simplicity in the

00:30:25.169 --> 00:30:30.000
case of the diagram that we are
about to draw.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.512
Because we say that this
interacts with this in a sigma

00:30:34.512 --> 00:30:39.443
fashion, giving rise to bonding
and antibonding interactions

00:30:39.443 --> 00:30:43.789
that look exactly like what we
have drawn over there.

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:46.798
I will draw the bonding orbital
here.

00:30:46.798 --> 00:30:51.227
Actually, the antibonding
orbital here and the bonding

00:30:51.227 --> 00:30:54.737
orbital here.
And I will show the parentage

00:30:54.737 --> 00:30:59.000
of this molecular orbitals in
this way.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.691
And you will recognize that
this is our in-phase combination

00:31:03.691 --> 00:31:08.383
and this is our out-of-phase
combination, analogous to the H

00:31:08.383 --> 00:31:12.200
two problem.
This is like the H two

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.493
problem built into the F two
or the O two

00:31:16.493 --> 00:31:19.436
problem.
And next what we find is that

00:31:19.436 --> 00:31:24.048
we can also make a sigma bond by
interaction of pz with pz.

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:27.944
This is going to be a nice
strong directed bonding

00:31:27.944 --> 00:31:32.000
interaction that will look like
this.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.962
You see we have overlap here in
the center, a nice strong

00:31:42.962 --> 00:31:47.835
bonding interaction in the
center with 2pz orbitals that

00:31:47.835 --> 00:31:52.354
are directed at each other.
And this is a sigma bond

00:31:52.354 --> 00:31:57.227
because you view that down z,
it is going to look like a

00:31:57.227 --> 00:32:02.134
round thing.
You are not going to see any

00:32:02.134 --> 00:32:06.611
nodal surfaces.
And then it has up here a

00:32:06.611 --> 00:32:11.649
corresponding antibonding
orbital right there.

00:32:11.649 --> 00:32:14.000
So far I have --

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.972
-- two pair-wise combinations
that give us two sigma bonding

00:32:27.972 --> 00:32:34.000
orbitals and two sigma star
antibonding orbitals.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.047
So, that is pretty
straightforward.

00:32:37.047 --> 00:32:40.991
And, once again,
I can say that we have the H

00:32:40.991 --> 00:32:46.459
two problem built into
this energy level diagram twice,

00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:50.851
with the s interactions,
with the pz interactions.

00:32:50.851 --> 00:32:56.319
The only thing I have left is
to do my px and py interactions.

00:32:56.319 --> 00:33:00.801
And we can make a pair of pi
bonds and a pair of pi

00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:06.000
anti-bonds that corresponds to
those pi bonds.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.906
This one is pi.
This one is pi star.

00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:12.810
And what do they look like?
Well, they look like

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:16.631
side-to-side bonds between pairs
of p orbitals.

00:33:16.631 --> 00:33:21.697
This is just like what I showed
you for the ethylene molecule.

00:33:21.697 --> 00:33:25.186
The pi bond,
in fact, has this nice overlap

00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:28.176
on one side and up here on the
other.

00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:33.545
There is your pi bond.
And you have one of those that

00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:38.890
lie in the x,z-plane and one of
those that lie in the y,z-plane.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:43.048
You have two of them,
and they are at equal energy

00:33:43.048 --> 00:33:44.915
here.
And then up here,

00:33:44.915 --> 00:33:47.545
what does the pi star look
like?

00:33:47.545 --> 00:33:51.193
Well, the same,
except we turn around one of

00:33:51.193 --> 00:33:54.842
the p orbitals,
introducing a nodal surface,

00:33:54.842 --> 00:33:59.000
like that.
And we have two of those.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.261
And here is our nodal surface.
Now it is an internuclear

00:34:04.261 --> 00:34:09.523
between the nuclei nodal
surface, indicating antibonding

00:34:09.523 --> 00:34:14.020
character there.
That is the easy case because s

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.517
and p are very well separated.
What you can see,

00:34:18.517 --> 00:34:23.683
though, is that type of
interaction of a 2s on our left

00:34:23.683 --> 00:34:29.328
atom with a pz on the right
atom, that might start to become

00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:34.876
important as you are over here
in this part of the diagram,

00:34:34.876 --> 00:34:41.000
where s and p are pretty close
together in energy.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.737
And that is what happens,
in fact.

00:34:43.737 --> 00:34:48.384
And that is what happens as
soon as you go to the left of

00:34:48.384 --> 00:34:53.030
oxygen and to nitrogen or
anything lighter than nitrogen.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.676
Suddenly, you cannot ignore
interactions of s on one side

00:34:57.676 --> 00:35:00.000
with p on the other.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.221
And so, I am going to draw here
the diagram that you would use,

00:35:14.221 --> 00:35:17.757
say, for N two.
And, for simplicity,

00:35:17.757 --> 00:35:21.042
I am just going to draw the
middle part.

00:35:21.042 --> 00:35:26.094
This part here in the middle is
that which corresponds to the

00:35:26.094 --> 00:35:29.378
molecule.
This one is what you would use

00:35:29.378 --> 00:35:33.000
for O two or F two.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.523
And let's just go ahead and
draw that diagram for the

00:35:39.523 --> 00:35:44.291
molecule.
This one would be this set of

00:35:44.291 --> 00:35:49.686
energy levels corresponding to,
for example, N two.

00:35:49.686 --> 00:35:54.955
And we have increasing energy

00:35:54.955 --> 00:36:00.726
on the vertical axis.
We are going to find that

00:36:00.726 --> 00:36:07.000
again, we have a sigma and a
sigma star.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.930
And then, the difference comes
right here where we find that as

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.330
we go up in energy we next get
to our pi bonds.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:22.400
And then, the next sigma
orbital is slightly higher in

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:29.000
energy than the pi system rather
than slightly lower in energy.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.163
And then we will encounter up
here our pi star.

00:36:34.163 --> 00:36:38.765
And then, finally,
that highest in energy,

00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:41.346
sigma star.
This switch,

00:36:41.346 --> 00:36:48.306
this sigma going up relative to
that pi is really a consequence

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:55.040
of all of the sigma orbitals
being responsive to the value of

00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:02.000
the electronegativity of the 2s
orbital of the atom.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.856
You can really almost consider
the pi system independent from

00:37:06.856 --> 00:37:09.770
the sigma.
These four sigma orbitals,

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.684
sigma, sigma star,
sigma, sigma star,

00:37:12.684 --> 00:37:16.164
I can call them one sigma,
two, three, four,

00:37:16.164 --> 00:37:20.130
just to show you that we have,
in ascending order,

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.639
four orbitals of sigma
symmetry.

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:26.443
That whole manifold,
when you can start mixing a

00:37:26.443 --> 00:37:31.462
little bit of very low energy s
into it, sinks down relative to

00:37:31.462 --> 00:37:34.833
pi.
In the case over here,

00:37:34.833 --> 00:37:39.916
we are basically pulling down
the four sigma orbitals relative

00:37:39.916 --> 00:37:42.333
to pi.
And here, because our s

00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:47.000
orbitals are higher in energy
relative to our p orbitals,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.666
they go up a little bit and
bumps three sigma up over pi.

00:37:51.666 --> 00:37:56.416
And what it means is that these
orbitals are not so simple

00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:59.996
anymore.
Any one of them is a linear

00:37:59.996 --> 00:38:02.584
combination of four atomic
orbitals.

00:38:02.584 --> 00:38:06.059
This orbital here,
one sigma, will not look like

00:38:06.059 --> 00:38:09.387
it looks in the H two
problem, anymore.

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:12.714
This one sigma will have some p
mixed into it.

00:38:12.714 --> 00:38:16.633
And so, one way we can
represent that through a simple

00:38:16.633 --> 00:38:19.000
drawing is like this.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.556
You see the difference between
that sigma bonding orbital and

00:38:29.556 --> 00:38:33.505
the one up there?
We have some extra little nodes

00:38:33.505 --> 00:38:37.464
in here that are an inherent
characteristic of the

00:38:37.464 --> 00:38:40.535
contribution of 2pz orbitals
into this.

00:38:40.535 --> 00:38:45.464
This is a linear combination of
the 2s and the 2pz orbitals on

00:38:45.464 --> 00:38:49.666
the two atoms we have.
There are four atomic orbitals

00:38:49.666 --> 00:38:54.191
that go in with different
coefficients to these different

00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:57.828
parts of the sigma manifold.
And then up here,

00:38:57.828 --> 00:39:03.000
the other bonding orbital,
we can draw it this way.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.742
And this molecular orbital,
this one here,

00:39:11.742 --> 00:39:14.846
three sigma,
has diminished bonding

00:39:14.846 --> 00:39:20.414
character between the two nuclei
and enhanced character on the

00:39:20.414 --> 00:39:25.618
outside, the part of the p
orbital that is contributing to

00:39:25.618 --> 00:39:30.000
it that points away from the
other atom.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.356
And so, while this has bonding
character, it also has what we

00:39:34.356 --> 00:39:37.478
might think of as lone pair
characteristics.

00:39:37.478 --> 00:39:40.310
In MO theory,
some orbitals are not that

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.996
simple.
They might be at the same time

00:39:42.996 --> 00:39:46.554
a little bit bonding and a
little bit lone pair in

00:39:46.554 --> 00:39:49.095
character.
Let's look at a couple of

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:52.000
orbitals like that,
briefly.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.546
And here I have done this for
the C two molecule.

00:40:08.546 --> 00:40:12.184
I have done the calculation for
C two,

00:40:12.184 --> 00:40:17.226
so now we are over here on the
left-hand side of that dividing

00:40:17.226 --> 00:40:20.864
line where s and p are a big
closer together.

00:40:20.864 --> 00:40:25.162
And I am opening up this
orbital, this one down here.

00:40:25.162 --> 00:40:30.122
It is a little more complicated
than the way I drew it on the

00:40:30.122 --> 00:40:35.000
board, but what you should be
able to see is --

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.685
Think back, now,
to the first orbital I showed

00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:41.265
you today, which was the lowest
lying orbital in the BH three

00:40:41.265 --> 00:40:43.055
molecule.
You remember,

00:40:43.055 --> 00:40:46.039
no matter which way we turned
it, we only saw blue,

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:48.187
which was the positive wave
function.

00:40:48.187 --> 00:40:50.514
It looked like an s orbital,
everywhere.

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:53.438
It had the same sign
everywhere, and you could not

00:40:53.438 --> 00:40:56.660
see any nodal properties.
Well, that would be true also

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.121
for this one down here in the
case of O two or F two

00:41:00.121 --> 00:41:04.000
because it is not mixing
in p character.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.240
Because the atomic s and p
orbitals are so far away in

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.441
energy.
But now, when they are closer

00:41:09.441 --> 00:41:13.109
in energy, this orbital down
here, the s over here sees the p

00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:15.615
over here and they mix in,
and vice versa.

00:41:15.615 --> 00:41:19.039
And, if I turn this around,
what you are going to see are

00:41:19.039 --> 00:41:22.768
these little negative lobes here
that I am indicating that are

00:41:22.768 --> 00:41:24.969
mixing in.
But this is hugely bonding

00:41:24.969 --> 00:41:27.781
orbital, still,
because look at how much of the

00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:32.000
orbital is centered in the
region between the nuclei.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.811
This is a very strongly bonding
orbital in this system.

00:41:37.811 --> 00:41:44.269
Let's now visualize the three
sigma, the third sigma symmetry

00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:50.511
orbital, as we ascend in energy.
And it will look hopefully

00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:56.000
something like what I drew here.
There it is.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.573
You see this is a sigma
orbital, because as we look down

00:42:07.573 --> 00:42:11.665
the z-axis, it looks just round.
But it certainly has a lot of p

00:42:11.665 --> 00:42:15.498
orbital character because as we
go from outside the molecule

00:42:15.498 --> 00:42:18.357
through the nucleus,
we get a change in sign.

00:42:18.357 --> 00:42:21.930
And then there is overlap in
here, but the amount of the

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.438
overlap in here is small
compared to the amount of this

00:42:25.438 --> 00:42:29.141
lobe out here that is just
nonbonding in character because

00:42:29.141 --> 00:42:33.861
it is pointing out into space.
It is like a lone pair of

00:42:33.861 --> 00:42:37.808
electrons at the same time as it
is a bonding orbital.

00:42:37.808 --> 00:42:41.978
If this molecule actually had
enough electrons to fill up

00:42:41.978 --> 00:42:46.297
through three sigma and no
higher, than you would recognize

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:50.765
that this orbital that we are
looking at would be the highest

00:42:50.765 --> 00:42:55.085
occupied molecular orbital.
And it would be responsible for

00:42:55.085 --> 00:42:58.882
the basicity and the
nucleophilicity of the molecule

00:42:58.882 --> 00:43:02.471
--
-- because any Lewis acid that

00:43:02.471 --> 00:43:07.744
came in would want to come in on
the z-axis to interact with this

00:43:07.744 --> 00:43:10.710
lone pair electron density out
there.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.900
So, that is how our three sigma
orbital now looks when we are on

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.926
the left side of that red dotted
line to the lighter elements.

00:43:20.926 --> 00:43:25.704
I will leave that up there for
a moment while we consider a

00:43:25.704 --> 00:43:30.761
couple of interesting points.
One of the things that you will

00:43:30.761 --> 00:43:34.000
often be asked to do is to write
down the configuration.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.849
And I want to finish these two
questions here of O two,

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:49.205
why does it have unpaired
electrons?

00:43:49.205 --> 00:43:54.575
In the case of O two,
we are over on this diagram,

00:43:54.575 --> 00:43:58.698
we have 12 valance electrons.
We can go two,

00:43:58.698 --> 00:44:02.630
four, six, eight,
ten, and then 11 and 12,

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:08.000
two electrons up here in the pi
star manifold.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.292
We are completely filled up
through pi.

00:44:11.292 --> 00:44:16.144
And then, we have a half-filled
pi star with 12 electrons

00:44:16.144 --> 00:44:19.176
populating the O two diagram.

00:44:19.176 --> 00:44:24.375
Let's represent that this way.
We have our one sigma with two

00:44:24.375 --> 00:44:27.667
electrons in.
We have our second sigma,

00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:32.000
which is antibonding with two
electrons.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.074
Then we have our third sigma
with two electrons.

00:44:36.074 --> 00:44:40.928
And then, as we go up in
energy, the next is our first pi

00:44:40.928 --> 00:44:44.222
orbital bonding.
That accommodates four

00:44:44.222 --> 00:44:47.256
electrons.
And then we have next our

00:44:47.256 --> 00:44:51.764
second pi type orbital.
It is antibonding and has two

00:44:51.764 --> 00:44:55.839
electrons in it.
And then all the other orbitals

00:44:55.839 --> 00:45:00.000
are empty, so I won't indicate
them.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.121
This is the configuration for
the O two molecule.

00:45:04.121 --> 00:45:08.617
That means, we come back over
here, by Hund's rule of maximum

00:45:08.617 --> 00:45:11.764
multiplicity,
we have two spin-up electrons

00:45:11.764 --> 00:45:16.036
in the O two molecule
with all these other orbitals

00:45:16.036 --> 00:45:20.082
down here being filled.
That configuration that I wrote

00:45:20.082 --> 00:45:24.878
down for the O two molecule over
there is a very shorthand way of

00:45:24.878 --> 00:45:29.000
representing the MO energy level
diagram --

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.584
-- because I started here at
the lowest energy,

00:45:32.584 --> 00:45:35.155
and I went up in energy like
this.

00:45:35.155 --> 00:45:38.896
And what you can see is sigma
star cancels sigma,

00:45:38.896 --> 00:45:42.558
so no bonding there.
We have here three electron

00:45:42.558 --> 00:45:45.675
pairs in bonding orbitals,
sigma and 2pi,

00:45:45.675 --> 00:45:49.805
but we have two electrons that
are unpaired electrons,

00:45:49.805 --> 00:45:53.311
responsible for the
paramagnetism of the O two

00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:56.974
molecule,
that cancel some of the bonding

00:45:56.974 --> 00:46:01.070
down here.
When we want to write that down

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.877
in terms of our bond order
convention, we have six bonding

00:46:04.877 --> 00:46:08.216
electrons minus two antibonding
electrons over two,

00:46:08.216 --> 00:46:11.489
which is going to be equal to a
bond order of two.

00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:14.093
That is our bond order for O
two.

00:46:14.093 --> 00:46:18.034
While the bond order is what we
expect to find based on that

00:46:18.034 --> 00:46:21.507
valance bond representation of O
two up there,

00:46:21.507 --> 00:46:25.514
what we find out is that the
representation of O two up there

00:46:25.514 --> 00:46:29.321
in the valance bond terminology
would not tell us that the

00:46:29.321 --> 00:46:32.994
molecule should actually have
two electrons that are not

00:46:32.994 --> 00:46:36.000
paired in the molecule,
--

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.217
-- that it should have
paramagnetism due to the lack of

00:46:39.217 --> 00:46:42.852
pairing up of all the electrons,
spin pairing in the molecule.

00:46:42.852 --> 00:46:46.367
And it has to do with this high
symmetry of the O two molecule.

00:46:46.367 --> 00:46:48.751
And it cannot distort from high

00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:51.015
symmetry because it has just two
atoms.

00:46:51.015 --> 00:46:53.041
It has very few degrees of
freedom.

00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:56.676
It cannot bend or something to
get those electrons to pair up,

00:46:56.676 --> 00:47:01.125
and so they are unpaired.
And that is why dioxegen has

00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:04.921
unpaired electrons.
And then, if we go to nitrogen,

00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:09.096
the order that we write these
things down in is a little

00:47:09.096 --> 00:47:13.196
different because the energy
level diagram is different

00:47:13.196 --> 00:47:16.157
because now s and p are closer
together.

00:47:16.157 --> 00:47:19.801
And what we have is one sigma
with two electrons,

00:47:19.801 --> 00:47:22.534
or two sigma star with two
electrons.

00:47:22.534 --> 00:47:25.722
And then, next,
we have our one pi with its

00:47:25.722 --> 00:47:29.019
four electrons.
And then next,

00:47:29.019 --> 00:47:32.368
we have our three sigma with
its two electrons.

00:47:32.368 --> 00:47:35.571
And that is it.
We have two less electrons in

00:47:35.571 --> 00:47:38.265
the system than we do in 
O two.

00:47:38.265 --> 00:47:41.614
That is N two.
And our bond order now is

00:47:41.614 --> 00:47:43.944
three.
That is in accord with our

00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:48.021
Lewis structure of N two,
but it is a triple bond.

00:47:48.021 --> 00:47:52.025
And it is a triple bond in a
molecule that is completely

00:47:52.025 --> 00:47:54.937
non-polar.
And it is one of the strongest

00:47:54.937 --> 00:47:58.723
chemical bonds known.
That triple bond is worth about

00:47:58.723 --> 00:48:03.808
226 kilocalories per mole.
And it makes N two a

00:48:03.808 --> 00:48:06.555
very fascinating molecule.
And, of course,

00:48:06.555 --> 00:48:09.570
it is the major constituent of
our atmosphere.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:13.054
And it is very inert,
due to the stability associated

00:48:13.054 --> 00:48:16.538
with having this diagram
populated up all through the

00:48:16.538 --> 00:48:19.553
bonding orbitals,
and then no more antibonding

00:48:19.553 --> 00:48:23.774
electrons present in the system.
So, that is pretty interesting.

00:48:23.774 --> 00:48:27.057
And given the time,
I think I will leave you after

00:48:27.057 --> 00:48:31.293
the following.
I just want to show you one

00:48:31.293 --> 00:48:36.134
more picture as a prelude to
where I will start next time.

00:48:36.134 --> 00:48:41.145
And that has to do with what
happens when the two atoms that

00:48:41.145 --> 00:48:45.816
are bonding are different.
Let's look at the three sigma

00:48:45.816 --> 00:48:49.213
orbital for the carbon monoxide
molecule.

00:48:49.213 --> 00:48:52.865
It would look like it does for
N two.

00:48:52.865 --> 00:48:55.753
It is the same number of
electrons.

00:48:55.753 --> 00:49:00.000
But look here.
It is very asymmetric.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.097
And that has to do with the
fact that carbon and oxygen have

00:49:04.097 --> 00:49:06.319
very different
electronegativity.

00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:10.277
And so, this highest occupied
molecular orbital for carbon

00:49:10.277 --> 00:49:13.125
monoxide, again,
an eight orbital problem,

00:49:13.125 --> 00:49:16.944
and again, a ten electron
system, is one where we have a

00:49:16.944 --> 00:49:21.250
larger coefficient on the lone
pair piece that is on the carbon

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.791
atom of the molecule.
And I will start off with this

00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:30.000
next time, but that is one of
two reasons why CO is a poison.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.333
Have a nice weekend.
