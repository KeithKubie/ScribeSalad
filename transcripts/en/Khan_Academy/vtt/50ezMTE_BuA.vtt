00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.616
- [Instructor] Vera rents
bicycles to tourists.

00:00:02.616 --> 00:00:05.919
She recorded the height, in
centimeters, of each customer

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.074
and the frame size, in centimeters,

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.103
of the bicycle that customer rented.

00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:13.147
After plotting her results,

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:15.494
Vera noticed that the relationship

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:18.898
between the two variables
was fairly linear,

00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:20.906
so she used the data to calculate

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:24.746
the following least
squares regression equation

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.187
for predicting bicycle frame size

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:28.344
from the height of the customer.

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:29.641
And this is the equation.

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.435
So before I even look at this question,

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:33.417
let's just think about what she did.

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:35.468
So she had a bunch of customers,

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.598
and she recorded, given
the height of the customer,

00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:41.912
what size frame that person rented.

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:45.421
And so she might've had
something like this,

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:49.041
where in the horizontal
axis you have height

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:51.171
measured in centimeters,

00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.423
and in the vertical
axis you have frame size

00:00:53.423 --> 00:00:55.496
that's also measured in centimeters.

00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:57.972
And so there might've been someone who

00:00:57.972 --> 00:00:59.966
measures 100 centimeters in height

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.268
who gets a 25 centimeter frame.

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:03.731
I don't know if that's reasonable or not,

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:06.443
for you bicycle experts,
but let's just go with it.

00:01:06.443 --> 00:01:08.096
And so she would've plotted it there.

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:11.135
Maybe there was another person
of 100 centimeters in height

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:14.169
who got a frame that was slightly larger,

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:15.890
and she plotted it there.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.538
And then, she did a
least squares regression.

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.392
And a least squares regression

00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:24.237
is trying to fit a line to this data.

00:01:24.237 --> 00:01:27.416
Oftentimes, you would use a
spreadsheet or use a computer.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.976
And that line is trying
to minimize the square

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:33.059
of the distance between these points.

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:37.106
And so the least squares regression,

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:39.267
maybe it would look something like this,

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:41.698
and this is just a rough estimate of it.

00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:44.196
It might look something,

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:46.062
let me get my ruler tool,

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:49.208
it might look something like,

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.763
it might look something

00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:52.691
like this.

00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:54.390
So let me plot it.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.223
So this,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.095
that would be the line.

00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:00.163
So our regression line, y-hat,

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:04.750
is equal to 1/3 plus 1/3 x.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.467
And so this, you could view
this as a way of predicting,

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:09.662
or either modeling the relationship

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.377
or predicting that, hey,
if I get a new person,

00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:14.241
I could take their height and put as x

00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.839
and figure out what frame
size they're likely to rent.

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:22.466
But they ask us, what is
the residual of a customer

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.696
with a height of 155 centimeters

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:27.282
who rents a bike

00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:30.249
with a 51 centimeter frame?

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.194
So how do we think about this?

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:34.741
Well, the residual is
going to be the difference

00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:38.254
between what they actually
produce and what the line,

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:41.792
what our regression line
would have predicted.

00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:45.357
So we could say residual,
let me write it this way,

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:46.190
residual

00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:49.618
is going to be actual,

00:02:50.857 --> 00:02:52.685
actual minus

00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:53.874
predicted.

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:55.997
So if predicted is larger than actual,

00:02:55.997 --> 00:02:57.735
this is actually going
to be a negative number.

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:00.099
If predicted as smaller than actual,

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.880
this is gonna be a positive number.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.747
Well, we know the actual.

00:03:03.747 --> 00:03:05.016
They tell us that.

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:07.355
They tell us that they rent,

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:08.222
it's a,

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.962
the 155 centimeter person rents a bike

00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:12.548
with a 51 centimeter frame,

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:14.336
so this is 51 centimeters.

00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:16.057
But what is the predicted?

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.581
Well, that's where we can
use our regression equation

00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.245
that Vera came up with.

00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:22.828
The predicted, I'll do that in orange,

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:27.404
the predicted is going to be equal to 1/3

00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:30.511
plus 1/3 times the person's height.

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:32.758
Their height is 155.

00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:33.791
That's the predicted.

00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.412
Y-hat is what our linear
regression predicts

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:38.377
or our line predicts.

00:03:38.377 --> 00:03:39.410
So what is this going to be?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.282
This is going to be equal
to 1/3 plus 155 over three,

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:47.326
which is equal to 156 over three,

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.743
which comes out nicely to 52.

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:54.366
So the predicted on our line is 52.

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.366
And so here,

00:03:56.365 --> 00:03:57.763
so this person is 155,

00:03:57.763 --> 00:04:00.931
we can plot 'em right over here, 155.

00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:04.372
They're coming in slightly below the line.

00:04:04.372 --> 00:04:06.748
So they're coming in slightly
below the line right there,

00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:09.022
and that distance, which is,

00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:11.038
and we can see that
they are below the line,

00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:12.774
so the distance is going to be,

00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:15.385
or in this case, the residual
is going to be negative.

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:17.267
So this is going to be negative one.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:20.240
And so if we were to
zoom in right over here,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.894
you can't see it that well,

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.228
but let me draw it.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:26.431
So if we zoom in, let's say
we were to zoom in the line,

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:27.961
and it looks like this.

00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:30.358
And our data point is right,

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:33.369
our data point is right over here.

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:34.733
We know we're below the line,

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.336
and it's just gonna be
a negative residual.

00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:37.972
And the magnitude of that residual is

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:40.001
how far we are below the line.

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:42.750
And in this case, it is negative one.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.347
And so that is our residual.

00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:47.672
This is what actual, the actual data minus

00:04:47.672 --> 00:04:50.872
what was predicted by our regression line.
