00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.920
They say 5G is going to completely change
our lives – from as simple to gaming, to

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.680
driving,to as complex as medical care.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.419
This shift will be a once in a decade upgrade
for our wireless systems.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.839
Now, that all sounds great but what is it
and when can I get it?

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.929
Well, there’s a brand new, second generation,
cellular module from the current leading chip

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.960
company,
Qualcomm that boasts the almighty power of

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.950
5G speeds for your phone.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.720
Except, we all don’t exactly have 5G phones
yet, nor a 5G mobile network.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.239
However, this might be the year all that changes.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.300
If you’re just being brought up to speed,
5G, is known as the fifth generation of wireless

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.980
network communication.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.390
Every time the technical rules that define
the inner workings of cellular networks changes,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.120
we get a new “generation,” or “G”
of technology, meaning to reap the benefits

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.199
people have to buy whole new phones, and carriers
will need to install new transmission equipment

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.379
to deliver the speeds they promised.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.289
When we got 1G it was for voice calls only,
but then 2G gave us text messages, 3G added

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.100
that multimedia support that we can’t imagine
being without, like vidchats and faster speeds,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.360
and now we have 4G – which has all the features
of 3G BUT an added bump of speeds from 14

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.130
Mbps to 100Mbps which changed the game.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.220
Now we have video chats in HD, HD mobile TV,
and live streamed apps But this next one is

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.430
gonna be big.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.590
5G is anticipated to give users the fastest
connectivity they’ve ever experienced.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.940
Its thought to be so fast it'd compete with
our current fibre optic cables we have in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.300
our homes, and about ten to a hundred times
faster than the phone you currently have in

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.300
your hand.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.340
But other than the major benefits of downloading
“8K” videos in seconds, and using VR and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.630
AR seamlessly (goodbye buffering)why does
the world want data coming in so fast?

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.979
Well, 5G connectivity promises reduced latency,
or lag time, to practically zero.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.170
Meaning devices can communicate with each
other in nearly real-time.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.259
We’re talking about major improvements in
the responsiveness in devices that use sensors

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.360
to make important decisions; like self-driving
cars that need to suddenly brake, or industrial

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.890
robots that can be sent to hazardous areas
and be controlled remotely from anywhere in

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.300
the world or better yet, anything in the healthcare
field.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.580
From telemedicine, precision surgical robots,
to remote surgery, or even virtual physical

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.120
therapy sessions.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.760
All this without any data slow down.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.320
But wait, how does any of this work?

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.340
Well, 5G systems will run on smaller what
they call, cell sites, that divide their territory

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.670
into different sections.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.480
Then, exchanges between cell sites and devices
are made with encoded data,through radio waves,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.470
called OFDM, .
This encoding isn’t much different from

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.090
what 4G LTE uses, but the frequencies they
use within the spectrum are.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.510
Right now the low-band spectrum that 4G LTE
travels on is overly crowded and therefore

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.420
we can only expect speeds up to 2Gs.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.090
Which, by the way, doesn’t seem too bad
running on Verizon visible for only $40/month,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.680
but we can get that more later on.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.120
5G can currently travel on a couple of kind
of airwaves.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.720
One low-band frequency and one high-frequency.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.580
The plans are for low-band frequency 5G to
operate through 4G cell sites that companies

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.120
already have in place.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.810
But the encoding will be more flexible and
use a bigger channel size to get up to 50

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.990
percent better speeds than LTE.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.420
This isn’t too bad.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.580
But since we want the multi-gigabit, ultra-fast,
speeds, we’re going to use higher frequencies

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.660
on the millimeter wave spectrum.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.230
Now it slightly varies, but millimeter waves
are signals estimated to be above 24GHz or

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.110
30GHz range where there’s enough spectrum
available to create big channels for very

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.360
high speeds.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.070
But what researchers have been struggling
with is the fact that these wavelengths are

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.610
easily blocked and can only go very short
distances.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.550
So a new infrastructure is needed.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.200
That’s why we have to get the small cell
sites.Hundreds, if not thousands of lower-power

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.520
base stations (outputting only 2-10 watts
each)will have to be built in and around city

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.860
homes to keep the connectivity in place.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.940
There are select places around the U.S. that
actually already have some of them, BUT we

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.350
still need our devices to upgrade to get the
speeds we want.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.260
This is where the Qualcomm chip comes in.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.300
Qualcomm is a wireless chip maker and they’ve
been the forefront of advancements in chip

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.639
technology since the 3G era.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.430
Their new one, creatively called Snapdragon
X55 5G , is a millimeter wave modem that would

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.850
run along their new millimeter wave antenna
the QTM525..

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.030
The idea is that these modules will help smartphones
connect to the new and improved network of

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.680
5G AS WELL AS stay connected to the previous
“g’s” 2 through 4.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.721
They anticipate that phone makers will embed
three or four modules in their devices, so

00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:51.350
the device always gets a signal from one module
even if the others are blocked by something

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.850
like your hand.And Qualcomm is not the only
one, there are other brands that are in the

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.380
works to make 5G happen for the consumer market.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.080
So, for us to really reap the benefits of
this all-powerful 5G speed.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.140
The whole infrastructure needs to change.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.521
You can’t have the 5G phone without the
5G network, and you can’t have the 5G network

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:14.250
until you get the mini cell towers, but companies
are making massive strides.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.870
Most of the phones and networks are planning
to launch at the end of 2019.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.910
So keep your eyes peeled, And your phones
ready to throw out
