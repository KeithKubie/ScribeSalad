00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.010
- [Katie] These are the
horses that don't fit in

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.060
in any other place.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.060
All of these abandoned animals
were getting sent to slaughter.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.080
They would have been killed.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.750
I think what they're
doing here is incredible.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.640
I'm born and raised in New York City.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.070
I still live here and base here

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.530
even though most of my work
is pretty far away and abroad.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.110
You get into the city life,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.260
and it's really important
to get away from all of that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.050
and to go somewhere
that's closer to nature,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.420
but also have the
opportunity to slow down.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.560
I'm on assignment for National Geographic.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.220
I'm going up to Rosemary Farm Sanctuary,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.840
which is a horse rescue
in upstate New York.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.540
It's this really interesting place

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.940
where horses are living a life

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.250
that you're not accustomed to seeing.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.330
They're letting animals
live in a really different

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.860
and unique way, and the
animals are relating to people

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.240
in a really unique way.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.120
I hope that I can capture
that with the images

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.550
and people can read this story,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.810
and maybe it's just a
break from the normal news

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.300
that they're looking at.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.430
Every story that you tell
doesn't have to be so dark

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.390
and difficult and gritty.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.890
- Nemo is an unusual donkey.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.010
This is not normal donkey behavior.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.810
When he was at the hospital
and we had his leg amputated

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.780
and they started teaching him
how to wear his prosthetic,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.460
they spent a lot of time with him.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.030
And one person would sit
at his head and cuddle

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.230
and the other person would put the leg on.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.640
And so he developed this routine.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.540
- [Katie] Something I
really wanted to capture was

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.550
putting on Nemo's prosthetic leg,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.250
and I know it's just a really big part
of their daily routine there

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.370
for the people, but then also for Nemo.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.110
- [Man] Come on, Nemo, you wanna come out?

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.250
- [Katie] He was injured
when he was really little,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.700
and it's not normal for
equine animals to live

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.990
if they lose a leg.
- Come on, Nemo.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.580
- [Katie] It's pretty cool
to watch the journey of this

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.500
really resilient and
inspiring little creature.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.550
He's ready, let's go Nemo.

00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:39.884
Hey, beauty.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.420
I never know where I'm
gonna find inspiration.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.350
It oftentimes comes from stories

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.850
and sometimes it comes from chance.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.060
There's this energy here,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.700
so that's something I
really wanted to take.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.405
I really wanted to sort of capture a moment

00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:09.890
where you could feel the energy
of all the horses as one,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.300
the feeling of them as a herd
and the strength of that.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.950
But it's also dangerous. These
are really powerful creatures

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.620
and there's also, a lot of them,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.090
they were put up to slaughter
because they won't obey

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.037
and they won't act like what
people consider a normal horse

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:28.680
to act like, and that's okay,
they get to be free there,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.420
but then I'm on their turf.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.920
With everything that's
going on in the world,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.160
especially what's happening
to the environment,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.130
it's almost like
photographing a way of life

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.730
where there's this really
deep connection with nature

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.140
and this interconnectedness
between people and animals,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.640
it's almost like you're capturing history.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.340
This is just as important
as any huge news story.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.090
It's just a little harder to grasp.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.650
When I've shot something
special, I know immediately.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.330
Everything comes together
and it just says something

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.830
much more than what you're
seeing in front of you.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:19.130
