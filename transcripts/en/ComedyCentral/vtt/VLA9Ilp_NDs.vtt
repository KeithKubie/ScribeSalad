- Hello, I'm Patti Harrison.

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:03.669 line:0%
- (sighs) And I'm
Joel Kim Booster.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.171 line:0%
- You're a ******* bitch.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.674
And your watching Unsend
where we celebrate the best

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.808
and the worst of the web,

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.309
but mostly the worst.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.680
(energetic techno music)

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.253
(crowd cheering)

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:22.488
(paper crunching)

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:23.656 align:start size:81% position:19%
- This issue needs
to be addressed

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.491 align:start size:84% position:16%
as quickly as it
needs to be stopped.

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.428 align:start size:97% position:3%
Hot girls on Instagram
taking way too many pictures

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.998
of themselves eating junk food.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.533
(chanting music)

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
Are these biddies
Papa John influencers

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.770
or am I missing something?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.038
Why so much pizza?

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.706
- I'm sure you've all
picked up on the fact

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:44.677
that I myself am a hot,
hot little slut girl.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.212
- Hmmm.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.148
- But when I eat pizza, I
just suck it all in, okay?

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.350
I don't invite a glam squad over

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.620
and take a bunch of
pics of us squattin',

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.223 align:start size:94% position:6%
popping in squats, eating
and licking on pizza.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And there's the
time Sarah Hashcroft

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.193 align:start size:97% position:3%
made a shocking announcement
in her photo depicting

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:04.564
her eating Fruit Loops
whilst wearing a bikini.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.733
"Buy me a box of Froot
Loops and I'm all yours."

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:12.739 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Girl, a box of Froot Loops
is 2.50 before coupons.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.174 align:start size:81% position:19%
What are you doing
with your life?

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.909
You're supposed
to be influencing

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.878
and this is your self-worth?

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.346
Two dollars?

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.814
Two dollars!?

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.316
- Our society is crumbling.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.085
First gay marriage and now
model is eating Froot Loops.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.888 align:start size:97% position:3%
Also, how come her body looks
wet, but her hair is dry?

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.222
I need answers.

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.557
- Hot girls of Insta,

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:33.559
stop pretending like
you're doing us a favor

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:36.529
and trying to come across
as relatable or people.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.565
Olivia Holt doesn't even put
cream cheese on her bagels.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:42.568 align:start size:94% position:6%
She's going to be an
active shooter very soon.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.670 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Her Instagram page
looks like it's showcasing

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.040
Christian Bale's diet for his
role as Dick Cheney in Vice.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.242
Olivia, stay in your lane, girl.

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:51.077
(paper crunching)

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.444
(swipe)

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.746 align:start size:94% position:6%
- We've all sent
something, said something,

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.249
tweeted something that
we wish we could Unsend.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.518 align:start position:0% line:0%
- Today, Esther Povitsky is
gonna share her shameful Unsend

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.754 line:0%
because the only way
to Unsend an Unsend

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.455
is to talk about it.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:04.891
- Thanks for being here, Esther.

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:07.459 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Thank you for providing
me with a platform

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.262 align:start size:97% position:3%
to tell this story that
I'm going to regret telling

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.065
for the rest of my life.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.101 align:start size:94% position:6%
A long time ago, I had
started dating someone new

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
who was a little bit
out of my league.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.438
I'll say it.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.405
- In what way?

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.608
- He was tall and handsome.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.942 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Tall doesn't necessarily
mean handsome though.

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:25.411
Do you just mean he was tall?

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.581 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And any man who meets
my eye level here,

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.816
I'm, like, fine.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.085
And any man who meets
my, when I talk to you

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.820
if my eyes do, like, this.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.954
I will kill for you.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.122
(laughter)

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.390 align:start size:81% position:19%
You're my god,
I'll kill for you.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.557 align:start size:81% position:19%
But if you're here
I'm, like, hey.

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.960
- So as this strong, smart,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.995
empowered business
woman that I am,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.297
I was, like, he's
out of my league.

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:47.233 align:start size:84% position:16%
I need to figure
out how to keep him.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.472 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm just gonna see if
squirting is real, right?

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.573 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't know, it might be.
- [Patti] Yeah.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:57.810 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Look, was I super thin
and had a great bod?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.312
Not really.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.981 align:start size:97% position:3%
Was I a tall, classically
attractive, beautiful woman?

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.449
No, I wasn't.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.451
I was just me.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.953
- On a mission to squirt.

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:09.355
- Yeah.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.155 align:start size:94% position:6%
- That's really romantic.
- That's beautiful.

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:11.257
- It is romantic.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.658
- I'm gonna ******* cry.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:17.330 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, I de-pants, I
de-pantie and I go in.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.866
I'm poking, I'm prodding,
I'm pointing, I'm laughing,

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.435
I'm smiling, I'm crying.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.503 align:start size:94% position:6%
Hopefully, I'm squirting,
but I'm not sure.

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:26.506 align:start size:88% position:13%
- There's different
wets that can come out.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.707 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, I don't
haver that knowledge.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.208
I don't have that
experience, I'm.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.110
- There's a lot more room
in there than I thought.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.511
- So (laughs).

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.380
- Wait, how much room do
you think is in there?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.515
- I don't know, I thought
it was mostly like a butt,

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:37.684
but in the front.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.690
- And then I remembered that I
had a pretty close friendship

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.325
with a woman who was in porn.

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:47.326
Who better to ask?

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.328
I have a direct line of contact

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:50.629
with someone who
actually knows this

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.464
as opposed to doing all
this Google searching.

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:55.401
So I text her and
it's a long text.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.737 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do you know, we're
talking a true paragraph.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.872
I told her that
there's a liquid.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:03.209
I can't quite tell
is it maybe piss.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.978
Maybe, so I include
that in the text.

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:08.881
I hit send, she responds.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:12.651
I open the text and it
says, "Who is this?"

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.386
(sighs)

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.222
And I just never responded.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.723
(sighs)

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:21.594 align:start size:97% position:3%
And, look, I can tell you
who I am any day of the week.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.096
(whispering)

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.263
- Esther, that's so, so sad.
- [Esther] That's strange.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.498 align:start size:88% position:13%
- But if you just
receive a text about me

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:29.235
possibly pissing myself
in my twin sized bed,

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.670
I cannot tell you
my name after that.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.572
And I think that's fair.

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:35.041 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm not using this
as a pejorative,

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.042
I just think you
are mentally ill.

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.777
- I think that I
was in my early 20s

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:40.346
and those were the same thing.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:41.414
(drum cymbals crashing)

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.248
- Joel, baby.

00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:44.449
- What, no.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.751
I don't, what's going on here.

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.553 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't trust
whatever is happening.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:48.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
The last time you
were this nice to me

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.089
you stole my identity.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.791
- That instinct isn't wrong.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.192
I'm about to destroy you.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.426
Here's the thing.

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:56.428
Here at Unsend we
poke a lot of fun

00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:58.230
and we enjoy taking the piss,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.566 align:start size:97% position:3%
so to counteract that
snark, I dug around the web

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:03.636 align:start position:0%
to find something that will
grab you by the lower intestine,

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:06.772
push up through your throat
and spill out your eyeballs.

00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:08.641
(emotional music)

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.743
(crying)

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.126
(cat meowing)

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.427
(crying)

00:05:28.427 --> 00:05:29.962
- Are you identifying
with the cat in this?

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.096
Is that why you're sad?

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:33.466
- Yes, the cat, it was sad.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.135 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It was sad because
three people died

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:39.472
in that apartment fire and
they glossed right over that

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.307
to focus on one cat.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:44.910 align:start size:84% position:16%
You let them die
because they were gay.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.146 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's a homophobic
firefighter who loves cats.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.315
Do you feel good about
your tears now, Patti?

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.983
- Wait, how did you
know they were gay?

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:55.187
- Because I could
sense them dying.

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:57.256 align:start size:97% position:3%
Something that a lot of people
don't know about gay people

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.993
is that when another gay
person dies we feel it.

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.962
- That's the same
for trans people,

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.298
but it's, like, anytime you
see someone else get, like.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.033
- Okay, let's not make
this a political show.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.601 align:start size:88% position:13%
Everybody at home,
this is Patti Harrison.

00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:11.336
- I've been silenced again.

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:13.138
- And his is Joel Kim Booster.

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:14.507
And we're Unsend.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.808
- We're Unsend.

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:19.545
- We can do better.

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:21.981
We can do better than that.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.550
(quirky jazz music)

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.819
(paper crunching)
