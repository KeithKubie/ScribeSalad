00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.450
Is Pet Food Safe for Humans to Eat?

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.900
Nearly 80 million American households have
a pet, with a majority being a cat or dog.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.189
Additionally, 42% of homes have more than
one pet.

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.269
A lot of food is needed to feed all of these
animals, so it should come as no surprise

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.109
that pet food is a 21 billion dollar industry.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.060
While this food is specially made for our
four-legged pals, the question many have (including

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.559
this researcher) is- in a post-apocalyptic
world where human food was scarce, could I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.559
eat my cat’s wet food?

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.050
Would I get sick from eating my dog’s milk
bones?

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.250
For the short answer, while it certainly doesn’t
look appetizing, nor (probably) taste any

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.490
good, the answer is, for the most part, yes-
humans can safely eat their pets’ food…

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.600
but there are some important caveats which
we’ll get into.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.010
For the long answer, let’s look at a brief
history of pets and their food and what manufacturers

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.910
put in it today and why.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.230
It is theorized that dogs first became man’s
best friend sometime during the Ice Age, between

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.470
19,000 and 32,000 years ago.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.750
It’s thought that the first dogs were simply
tame wolves.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.280
Their domestication likely was associated
with the wolves realizing they could get a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.030
quick and easy meal if they hung out near
human gathering sites, feasting on the leftover

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.610
meat of the humans’ hunt.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.931
The domestication of cats came much later,
perhaps about 3000-10,000 years ago, with

00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:30.740
the first potentially domesticated cat discovered
in a 9,500 year old grave.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.470
That said, the mass domestication of cats
probably occurred at least a few thousand

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.810
years after that and was directly related
to the proliferation of agriculture.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.590
The theory goes that as humans started storing
grain and wheat, mice came along to eat it.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.219
As we all know, the natural (and cartoon)
enemy of mice are cats.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.650
(Aside: as we also all “know,” mice love
cheese… except they don’t actually, and

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.460
will even sometimes be actively averse to
it.)

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.159
Over thousands of years, both animals have
evolved or been bred to have certain traits

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.789
become more pronounced or disappear entirely.

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.980
In terms of physical characteristics, domesticated
dogs today have smaller skulls, paws and brains

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.680
than their wolf ancestors.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.250
Dogs have also adjusted their behavior, becoming
active during the day as opposed to nocturnal

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.410
like they once were.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.260
Today’s house cats, which haven’t been
so deliberately bred, aren’t that much different

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.320
than the wild cats of yesteryear, at least
physically.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.540
Domestic cats may be slightly smaller than
their ancestors, but it is really their genetic

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.390
and personality traits that separate them
from their forebears.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.420
For instance, present-day cats are thought
to be more docile and have better memories

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.640
than their ancestors.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.610
Essentially, cats over time evolved such that
they’re more likely to purr than hiss, with

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.950
the latter cats less likely to get food from
humans, providing them a decided disadvantage

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.150
over cats more comfortable around us.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.430
Because of these changes (and a more sedentary
lifestyle due to be domesticated), both animals

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.260
have developed to require fewer calories and
slightly different dietary requirements than

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.760
their ancestors, who primarily lived off of
raw meat.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.239
This brings us to what these animals should
be eating today, and what is generally included

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.490
in their commercial pet foods.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.159
Dietary needs for a dog differ from other
animals, including humans.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.379
Canines need more fat than humans, which is
their primary energy source.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.330
While dogs also need protein (which helps
build muscle mass) and some amount of carbohydrates

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.860
(which helps with digestion), human diets
require more.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.569
In addition, dogs produce their own vitamin
C and don’t need it included in their food.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.050
Despite the differing dietary requirements,
in the end, today’s dogs eat much like their

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.950
ancestors – consuming the leftovers of humans,
whether you feed them from the table or not.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.160
You see, commercial dog food products are
often simply made from “the byproducts of

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.700
human food production,” as in what’s left
over after humans have taken what we want

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.700
of the meat.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.650
And this is perfectly fine, according to the
Association of American Feed Control Officials,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.019
provided the recipe is formulated specifically
for a dog’s dietary needs.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.290
It also means that dogs have adapted to be
able to eat a large variety of foods.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.010
On the other hand, cats do not eat like dogs,
nor should they be eating dog food or a typical

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.360
human diet.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.880
For one, cats need to eat more meat due to
the presence of an amino acid called taurine,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.500
which is only found in animal-based proteins.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.200
Unlike humans and other animals, cats are
unable to manufacture their own taurine and,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.610
therefore, need to get it from their food
sources.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.100
If they don’t, they relatively quickly,
and permanently, go blind, among other health

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.100
issues.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.030
Additionally, since cats are “obligate”
carnivores – as in, they must eat meat in

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.400
order to get the nutrients they require – animal-based
proteins are essential for felines.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.910
Despite this fact, many dry cat foods use
primarily plant based protein.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.140
Dry cat foods are also not typically optimal
for our feline friends owing to the fact that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.200
they do not have a strong sense of when they’re
dehydrated.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.140
You see, cats at one point were desert animals
and their bodies are still optimized for desert-like

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.770
conditions- able to withstand temperatures
as high as 126° F to 133° F (52° C to 56°

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.210
C) before showing signs of being overheated
and their feces is typically very dry and

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.720
their urine highly concentrated, allowing
them to potentially stay hydrated off nothing

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.910
but the water they get from eating animals.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.420
While cats that eat a dry food diet do drink
more water than their wet food diet compatriots

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.500
to make up for the discrepancy, studies have
shown that, in the general case, their total

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.560
daily water intake is generally less than
optimal, likely due to their weak thirst “sense”.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.320
Thus, if they are not getting a significant
amount of moisture from their food, as they

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.550
would in the wild, many cats tend to live
in a perpetually mild dehydrated state.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.430
For reference, most wet cat foods are about
75% water (about what they’d get from eating

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.340
animals in the wild) vs. most dry cat food
at about 5%-10% water.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.600
The combination of many dry cat foods primarily
being based on plant-based protein and lacking

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.371
much in the way of moisture is generally thought
to be why many house cats ultimately develop

00:06:03.371 --> 00:06:07.750
diabetes and kidney problems, among other
related issues, later in life.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.800
That’s not to say all dry cat foods are
inherently bad (some are made of very high

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.720
quality meat-based proteins and the like,
and simply suffer from a lack of moisture)

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.990
nor all wet cat foods are inherently good
for your cat (some are packed with unhealthy

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.810
amounts of fats and the like).

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.680
In either case, the order of the ingredients
is key here, with the first item on the list

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.680
being the primary ingredient and on down.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.150
Cats also need more thiamine, Vitamin A and
Vitamin C than dogs and humans.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.270
Without food that specifically has these elements,
cats will be undernourished.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.880
This brings us back to humans.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.960
In theory, given the human body’s ability
to adapt to a wide variety of food sources,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.060
humans are able to eat both dog and cat food,
whether wet or dry, high quality or not…

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.130
in a limited quantity.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:58.410
For instance, regular high intake of animal
based Vitamin A (which, as mentioned, pet

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.570
foods tend to have a relatively high amount
of) in humans can cause a myriad of serious,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.020
even fatal, complications.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.850
For this reason, good quality vitamin supplements
(which are harder to find than you might think)

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.910
generally use plant based Vitamin A via carotenoids,
like beta-carotene.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.300
In this case, if your body needs more Vitamin
A, it will convert the beta-carotene to Vitamin

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.720
A; if it doesn’t need it, it won’t.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.810
In contrast, a meat-based Vitamin A source
is already in the form your body needs, meaning

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.540
you can potentially get too much of it in
your system.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.630
This is particularly a concern for pregnant
women.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.400
So, in the end, while it is possible for a
human to subsist for a time on dog and cat

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.120
food, there is the general caveat that these
animal foods are specifically formulated for

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.230
the particular animal and not meant to meet
the dietary requirements of humans, though

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.880
irregular consumption of these foods shouldn’t
hurt you.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.550
In other words, cat food shouldn’t be your
breakfast every day.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.300
Of course, this hasn’t stopped other writers
and publications from attempting this very

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.380
thing as a stunt.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.440
Nor did it stop a pet store owner from eating
dog treats for thirty days as a way to promote

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.470
her store.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.500
She was later featured on the Today Show.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:55.860
There’s also the TLC show “My Strange
Addiction” with one episode focusing on

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:24.900
one person’s cat food fascination.
