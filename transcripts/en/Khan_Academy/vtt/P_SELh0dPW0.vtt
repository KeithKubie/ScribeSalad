00:00:01.026 --> 00:00:02.048
- [Voiceover] Now that
we have our collection

00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:04.846
of components, our favorite
batteries and resistors,

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:07.563
we can start to assemble
these into some circuits.

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:09.501
And here's a circuit shown here.

00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:12.844
It has a battery and
it has three resistors,

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:14.117
and a configuration that's called

00:00:14.117 --> 00:00:17.240
a series resistor configuration.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.980
Series resistors is a familiar pattern,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.488
and what you're looking for is resistors

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:25.483
that are connected head
to tail, to head to tail.

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.782
So these three resistors are in series

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:31.242
because their succession of nodes

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.970
are all connected, one after the other.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.965
So that's the pattern that tells you

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:41.667
this is a series resistor connection.

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.583
So we're gonna label
these our resistors here.

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:48.583
We'll call this R1, R2, and R3.

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:51.989
And we'll label this as v.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.688
And the unknown in this
is what is the current

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.579
that's flowing here, that's
what we want to know.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.261
We know v, we want to know i.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.917
Now one thing we know about i

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:06.714
is i flows down into resistor R1,

00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:10.104
all of the current goes out of
the other end of resistor R1

00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:13.343
because it has to, it
can't pile up inside there.

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:15.561
All that goes into here,

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.277
and all that comes out of R3.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:23.277
And i returns to the place it came from,

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.255
which is the battery.

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:29.481
So that's a characteristic
of series resistors,

00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:34.481
is in a series configuration
is they are head to tail,

00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:44.017
and that means that all the components,

00:01:44.017 --> 00:01:49.017
all the resistors share the same current.

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:55.534
Current.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:57.299
That's the key thing.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.425
The thing that we don't know

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:00.735
that's different between each resistors,

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:05.681
is the voltage here, and the voltage here,

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:10.681
let's call that v1,
this is v2, plus, minus,

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:18.402
and this is v3, plus, minus.

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:22.457
So in general, if these
resistors are different values

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:24.419
because they have the same
current going through them,

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.483
Ohm's Law tells us these
voltages will all be different.

00:02:28.483 --> 00:02:30.898
So the question I want to
answer with series resistors

00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:34.137
is could I replace all three of these

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:38.502
with a single resistor that
cause the same current to flow?

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:41.498
That's the question we have
on the table right now.

00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:42.984
So we make some observations,

00:02:42.984 --> 00:02:47.984
we have Ohm's Law, our friend, Ohm's Law.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:55.205
And we know that means v equals i times R,

00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:56.718
for any resistor.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:03:00.643
That sets the ratio of voltage to current.

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:02.686
And this is another
thing we know about this,

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:07.686
which is that v3, plus v2, plus v1,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.777
those are the voltages
across each resistor,

00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:15.004
those three voltages have
to add up to this voltage

00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:17.721
because of the way the
wires are connected.

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:21.204
So the main voltage from the battery

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:26.204
equals v1, plus v2, plus v3.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.326
We know that's for sure,
and now what we're gonna do

00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:34.184
is we're gonna write Ohm's Law

00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:38.234
for each of these individual resistors.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:43.234
v1 equals i, and i is
the same for everybody,

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:46.568
times R1.

00:03:46.568 --> 00:03:51.568
v2, this voltage here, equals i times R2.

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:59.265
And v3 equals i times R3.

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:04.169
Now you can see, if I had four,
or five, or six resistors,

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.025
I would have four, or five, or
six equations just like this

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:10.763
for each resistor that was in series.

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:14.165
So now what I'm gonna do is
substitute these voltages

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:17.230
into here, and then we'll
make an observation.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.109
So let's do that substitution.

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.109
I can say v equals i, R1,

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.099
plus i, R2, plus i, R3.

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.476
And because it's the
same i on every resistor,

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:44.476
I can write v equals i,
I'm gonna factor out the i.

00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:50.397
R1, plus R2, plus R3.

00:04:52.978 --> 00:04:54.955
Now what I want to do
is take a moment here

00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:59.955
and compare this expression
to this one here,

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.888
the original Ohm's Law.

00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:04.761
Alright, there's Ohm's Law.

00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:08.895
So we have v equals i, some current,

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:12.174
times some resistor.

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:15.137
I can come up with a resistor value,

00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:20.036
a single resistor that would
give me the same Ohm's Law.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:25.036
And that is gonna be called,
let's draw it over here.

00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:30.976
Here's our battery.

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:35.976
And I'm gonna say there's a
resistor that I can draw here,

00:05:37.588 --> 00:05:42.588
R series, that's equivalent
to the three resistors here.

00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:48.118
And it's equivalent in the sense that

00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:52.379
it makes i flow here, that's
what we mean by equivalent.

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.756
So in our case, to get the
same current to flow there

00:05:56.756 --> 00:06:01.756
I would say v equals i times R series,

00:06:03.757 --> 00:06:07.762
in which case, what I've done
is I've said that R series

00:06:07.762 --> 00:06:10.804
is what, is the sum of these three things,

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:15.804
R1 plus R2, plus R3.

00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:23.621
This is how we think
about series resistors.

00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:27.139
We can replace a set of series resistors

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.297
with a single resistor
that's equivalent to it

00:06:30.297 --> 00:06:34.163
if we add the resistors up.

00:06:34.163 --> 00:06:36.799
Let's just do a really fast
example to see how this works.

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:41.799
I'm gonna move this screen.

00:06:43.493 --> 00:06:45.653
Here's an example with three resistors.

00:06:45.653 --> 00:06:50.030
I have labeled them 100
ohms, 50 ohms, and 150 ohms.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.375
And what I want to know
is the current here.

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:53.397
And we'll put in a voltage,

00:06:53.397 --> 00:06:56.961
let's say it's 1.5 volts,

00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:59.461
just a single small battery.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:04.163
So what is the equivalent resistance here?

00:07:04.163 --> 00:07:06.125
One way to figure this out
and to simplify the circuit

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:09.829
is to replace all three of those resistors

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:13.700
with a series resistor, RS,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.544
and that is, as we said here, is the sum,

00:07:15.544 --> 00:07:20.544
so it's 100, plus 50, plus 150.

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:31.886
And that adds up to 300 ohms.

00:07:32.692 --> 00:07:34.700
So that's the value of the equivalent

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.314
series resistor right here.

00:07:36.314 --> 00:07:41.314
And if I want to calculate the current, i,

00:07:43.954 --> 00:07:48.954
i equals v over R, and
this case, it's R series,

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:56.454
and that equals 1.5 divided by 300.

00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:03.133
And if I do my calculations right,

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:08.133
that comes out to .005 amperes.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:15.656
Or an easier way to say it is
five milliamps, milliamperes.

00:08:20.026 --> 00:08:22.719
So that's i.

00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:27.719
And now that I know i, I can
go ahead and I can calculate

00:08:29.256 --> 00:08:32.657
the voltage at each point
across each resistor

00:08:32.657 --> 00:08:35.061
because I know i, I know R,

00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:36.941
I can calculate v.

00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:41.941
So v1, v1, which is the
voltage across that resistor,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.640
v1 equals i, R1, as we said before.

00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:56.616
So it's five milliamps
times 100 ohms, 0.5 volts.

00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:08.923
Let's do it for the other one, v2,

00:09:12.201 --> 00:09:17.201
equals i, same i, this time times R2,

00:09:18.118 --> 00:09:23.118
five milliamps times 50 ohms,

00:09:23.853 --> 00:09:28.853
and that equals 0.25 volts.

00:09:31.295 --> 00:09:36.295
And finally, we do v3.

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:42.722
This is plus, minus v3.

00:09:42.722 --> 00:09:47.722
And that equals the same
current again times 150 ohms,

00:09:54.248 --> 00:09:59.248
which is equal to 0.75 volts.

00:10:01.052 --> 00:10:03.873
So we've solved the
voltage and the current

00:10:03.873 --> 00:10:06.764
on every resistor, so this
circuit is completely solved.

00:10:06.764 --> 00:10:08.052
And let's do one final check.

00:10:08.052 --> 00:10:12.069
Let's add this up.

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:15.703
Five, five (mumbles) is zero.

00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:20.452
Carry the one, six, seven eight.

00:10:20.452 --> 00:10:25.452
15, 1.5 volts, and that's very handy

00:10:26.744 --> 00:10:29.287
because that is the same as that.

00:10:29.287 --> 00:10:32.573
So indeed, the voltages across
the resistors did add up

00:10:32.573 --> 00:10:37.054
to the full battery that was applied.

00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:38.587
There's one more thing
I want to point out.

00:10:38.587 --> 00:10:43.587
Here's an example of
some series resistors.

00:10:46.005 --> 00:10:47.805
And that's a familiar pattern.

00:10:47.805 --> 00:10:49.605
And you'll say, "Oh, those
are series resistors."

00:10:49.605 --> 00:10:53.529
Now, be careful because if
there's a wire here going off

00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:56.884
and there's, doing this,
or there's a wire here,

00:10:56.884 --> 00:10:58.985
connected to this node here,

00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:00.390
this still looks like they're in series,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.654
but there might be current flowing

00:11:02.654 --> 00:11:04.686
in these branches here.

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:06.729
If there's current flowing out

00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:09.249
anywhere along a series branch,

00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:12.174
anywhere along what looks
like a series branch,

00:11:12.174 --> 00:11:17.174
then this i may or may
not be the same as this i.

00:11:17.503 --> 00:11:20.731
And it might not be the same as this.

00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:21.764
So you gotta be careful here.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:25.050
If you see branches going
off your series resistors,

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:30.050
these are not in series
unless these are zero current.

00:11:31.853 --> 00:11:35.348
If that's zero current, and
if that is zero current,

00:11:35.348 --> 00:11:37.925
then you can consider these in series.

00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:39.864
So that's just something to be careful of

00:11:39.864 --> 00:11:41.907
when you are looking at a circuit

00:11:41.907 --> 00:11:44.914
and you see things that
look like they're in series,

00:11:44.914 --> 00:11:46.691
but they have little branches coming off.

00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:49.953
So a little warning there.

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:51.671
So that's our series resistors.

00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:53.448
If you have resistors and series,

00:11:53.448 --> 00:11:56.542
you add them up to get
an equivalent resistance.
