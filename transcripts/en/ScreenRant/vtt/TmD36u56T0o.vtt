00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.400
Reality is messy and unpredictable.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.120
So it’s only fitting that shows marketing
themselves as reality television have more

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.530
than a few surprises.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.140
And with the boom in reality programming,
some shows have gone over-and-above in the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.960
hopes of being noticed by audiences.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.949
But even though there is no shortage of entertainment,
some situations are just so outstanding that

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.480
we thought they deserved a shoutout.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.539
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Most Shocking
Reality TV Moments Of All Time.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.899
Jersey Shore, S01E04 “Fade to Black”
We all know someone who gets a little silly

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.899
when they drink.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.899
But for six seasons, that’s what the cast
of Jersey Shore did for a living.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.110
The gang would dress up, get wasted, and usually
engage in some degree of buffoonery.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.800
The cast’s most ridiculous member is also
its tiniest.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.710
At just over 4 and a half feet, Nicole “Snooki”
Polizzi had an incredible ability to stir

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.520
up trouble wherever she went.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.830
And in the series’ fourth episode, it backfired.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.040
Thinking that someone was stealing drinks,
Snooki ruffled some Jersey feathers, and got

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.200
punched in the face for it.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.810
The result is one reality TV moment that will
go down in infamy.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.290
The Bachelor, S13E10 “After the Final Rose”
At this point The Bachelor is a reality television

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.290
institution.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.439
Since 2002 audiences have followed the stories
of eligible men searching for The One.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.939
And thanks to it’s success, there is an
entire universe of dating shows to choose

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:19.939
from.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.950
What starts as a group of about twenty five
potential mates eventually gets narrowed down

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.770
to one, and marriage is the end goal.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.890
As you can probably imagine, the competition
is through the roof.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.929
So when it comes down to only two women, the
choice should be pretty obvious at that point,

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:32.929
right?

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:33.929
Wrong.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.119
After the Romeo from Season 13 proposed to
one lady, he turned around and changed his

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.930
mind… on national television.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.600
Saying the breakup was “public” feels
like an understatement, since over 17 million

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.299
people watched it happen.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.630
America’s Next Top Model, S04E07 “The
Girl Who Sends Tyra Over The Edge”

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.819
Being on Americas Next Top Model is an honor.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.729
And anyone who acts otherwise is setting themselves
up for a lecture from Tyra Banks.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.179
One of the model hopefuls in the shows fourth
cycle learned that the hard way.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.100
After displaying what Banks felt was a bad
attitude, model Tiffany Richardson came under

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740
fire at the elimination ceremony.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.880
An argument between the two women escalated
quickly, which culminated in Banks full-on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.099
yelling at Richardson.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.400
Obviously, Richardson was the one eliminated
that week.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.210
But we’re willing to bet that even though
she didn’t win, she’s one of the most

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.090
memorable contestants in the show’s 22 season
history.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.660
Keeping Up With The Kardashians, S10E16 “Vanity
Unfair”

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.740
Shining a light on anyones family dynamics
is a bold move, and the Kardashian clan have

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.760
been doing it since 2007.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.690
When news of Caitlyn Jenner’s transition
hit the media, many were stunned.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.520
And while the reactions were mixed, the news
prompted a lot of discussion about gender

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520
transition.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.820
Considering his who her family is, it should
come as no surprise that the intensely personal

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.380
subject was at the center of some of the most
popular episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.910
But the moment that made the biggest splash
was Jenner’s interview with Vanity Fair

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.910
magazine.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.041
In fact, so many people were interested that
a spinoff I Am Cait was created to focus just

00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:52.041
on her.

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.880
The Hills, S06E12 “All Good Things…”

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.550
For just under a decade, reality television
was run by a bunch of kids from California.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.560
After the end of MTV’s Laguna Beach, some
of the characters moved on to the follow-up

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.590
show called The Hills.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.570
A show loaded with teenage angst.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.500
Lauren Conrad moved from her childhood neighborhood
to the big city, and audiences were beside

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.510
her every step of the way as she fumbled her
way to adulthood.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.840
That is, until fellow Laguna-alum Kristin
Cavallari took over.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.270
Fans took sides in every argument and were
supposedly seeing real-life drama.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.330
Until the last shot of the series, anyway,
in which the camera zooms out to show that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.180
the scene was being shot on a soundstage.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.130
And just like that, it ruined it’s own legacy.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.681
Survivor, S07E11 “The Great Lie”
Ask any fan and they’ll tell you: Survivor

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:33.600
is all about the challenges.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.070
Seeing our everyday conveniences suddenly
transformed into luxuries is one of it’s

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.400
most interesting aspects.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.150
One thing the survivors find the hardest is
being away from their loved ones, and perhaps

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.570
the most coveted reward comes in the form
of a visit with a family member.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.470
During the show’s seventh season, the winner
of that visit was a contestant known as Jonny

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.470
Fairplay.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.670
After a friend revealed that Jonny’s grandmother
died, the tribe voted to let Jonny have the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.250
time with his friend given the unfortunate
news.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.260
But shortly after, it was discovered that
Jonny engineered the entire situation, and

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.330
his grandma was just fine.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.210
Miss Universe 2015
Of all the people in a pageant, the host has

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.440
it the easiest.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.340
They don’t have to answer hard-hitting political
questions or parade around in a swimsuit.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.940
And although they may have the most camera
time, they’re usually pretty forgettable.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.669
Unless you’re Steve Harvey.

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.310
When Harvey hosted the 2015 Miss Universe
pageant, he almost made it out unscathed.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.669
But then he announced the wrong winner.

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.669
That’s right.

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.090
Even though he was physically holding a card
with the winner’s name on it, the crown

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.680
went to the wrong contestant.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.630
After realizing his mistake, Harvey was genuinely
mortified.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.180
And, like the classy ladies they are, Miss
Colombia and Miss Philippines handled the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.820
mixup with grace.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.060
The Bachelorette, S11E01 “Week 1, Part 1:
Limo Arrivals”

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.491
Given the aforementioned universe of dating
shows, it can be hard for show runners to

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.889
keep their content fresh.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.510
But because there are so few limitations on
reality television, people behind the scenes

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.140
are always scheming about the next possible
twist.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.410
This has led to some pretty interesting variations
on old classics.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.710
And the premiere episode of the eleventh season
of The Bachelorette is no exception.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.560
Audiences expected to be greeted by one eligible
bachelorette and twentysomething potential

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.560
mates.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.660
So when two bachelorettes emerged and the
mates were asked to vote on which one should

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.430
stay, the show’s whole foundation was rocked.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.020
American Idol, 12E03 “Charlotte Auditions”
American Idol has gone through a few different

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.330
judging combinations over it’s 15 season
run.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.990
For the most part they’ve all been pretty
well-respected in the industry, but when Mariah

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.410
Carey showed up, critics took notice.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.630
Given the songstress’ diva reputation, audiences
ate up every snide remark she made.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.040
And when she butted heads with fellow judge
Nicki Minaj over a contestant named Summer,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.020
the exchange made an impression.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.081
To this day it’s hard to understand what
their argument was actually about, but it

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:44.710
was a big deal nonetheless.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.980
And for a show that many pundits argued was
on it’s last legs, the tiff provided a much-needed

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.490
popularity boost.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.050
Australia’s Next Top Model, S06E11 “Live
Finale”

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.910
A few years before Steve Harvey announced
the wrong winners name on a global scale,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.419
Sarah Murdoch had the same experience on a
slightly smaller level.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.150
As the host of Australia’s Next Top Model,
Murdoch had the responsibility of declaring

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.090
the competition’s winner on live T.V. Given
it’s unpredictable nature, even the most

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.699
seasoned veterans stumble from time to time.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.800
And yet again, the wrong person was named
the victor.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.760
When Murdoch realized the mistake, she apologized
profusely and admitted that the incorrect

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.840
name had been announced into her earpiece.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.370
Both models took a second to understand what
had happened, and were good sports about it.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.370
Whoopsie!

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.420
What do you think of our list?

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.280
