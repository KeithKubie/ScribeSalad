ANDREA BUEHLER: My
name is Andrea Buehler.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.470
JEREMY BLAIR: My
name's Jeremy Blair.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.580
MICHAEL THOMAS:
I'm Michael Thomas,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.840
and we're Team PH2OG Water.


00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.550 position:97%
 


00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.720
JEREMY BLAIR: PH2OG Water
is a premium bottled water

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.140
brand that's
looking to challenge

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.620
every perception of
what bottled water is.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.530
It's 3 things-- a new source,
environmentally sustainable

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.880
packaging, and a social mission.


00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.580
-We're looking to get our water
from cloud harvesting, which

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.330
is a non-groundwater
source, and addresses

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.220
the issues of groundwater
depletion and groundwater

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.520
pollution that are affecting
a lot of the developed

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.710
and developing world.


00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.960
All that has to happen is
for suspended water droplets

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.910
in the air to come in contact
with our cloud harvesting nets,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.930
coalesce into larger
droplets, and then run

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.350
into a collection trough.


00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.000
From there, the water is
piped to a treatment facility,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.650
filtered, sterilized, and
then put into bottles.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.440
It's a non-invasive,
passive technique

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.150
with less of a risk
for contamination

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.400
than spring or well water.


00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.590
-This project developed in a
social entrepreneurship class

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.610
that was taught at
Princeton University, where

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.030
Michael and I developed a
business plan to target people

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.390
in water-scarce regions,
with the cloud harvesting

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.050
technology.


00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.210
But what we realized is that
another way to the issue

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.910
would be to make a premium
product that puts a profit

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.250
pledge on every bottle
sold, to partner

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.000
with humanitarian
organizations that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.620
already have feet on the ground.


00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.750
MICHAEL THOMAS: I
was actually born

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.750
on the island of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.050
but my family moved to New
York when I was very young.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.360
After going to Princeton,
and growing up in New York,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.610
I always knew that I wanted
to give back to that place

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.460
that I came from.


00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.540
-So while we were developing
our business plan,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.300
I realized that St.
Vincent had some

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.490
of the perfect conditions
for cloud harvest there.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580
So we took a trip
down there this summer

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.640
to set up a pilot site.


00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.350
Whenever we told
somebody about our idea,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.040
they were incredibly
excited about it,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.690
and they were really
proud that we'd

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.330
be able to be going
forward with this.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.330
-The biggest
challenge on the trip

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.470
was definitely hiking up
the volcano, La Soufriere.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.930
So when we told
people that we were

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.490
gonna do this in the first
place, they were like,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.570
what are you talking about?


00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.900
You're gonna hike up there
-- all the way up to the top?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.860
We're like, yes, that's
what we're gonna do.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.450
And then we told
them that we were

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.050
gonna do it twice in 1 week,
and they just laughed at us.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.970
-But again, it was really
rewarding coming out

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.640
of the Palm Break, which is what
they call one of the climates,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.680
and seeing all the clouds
around us-- seeing the fog

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.020
--and just how perfect it
was for cloud harvesting.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.830
It was just a really
exciting moment.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.750
And then being able to
finally put up our net,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.820
and see it standing there,
already collecting water

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.530
pretty much as soon
as we put it up--

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.830
that was an amazing experience.


00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.820
-Then coming back to Soufriere
the second time-- First of all,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.410
we didn't know if
our cloud harvesting

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.460
net was gonna be standing
when we got up there.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.540
We weren't really sure
that that was gonna happen.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.040
So we came up, we
saw it standing

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.360
in the first place,
which was like, yeah,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.760
mission accomplished,
number one.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.180
-But then we really
wanted to know

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.910
how much water it
can actually get.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.000
So Jeremy runs over to
the cloud harvesting net,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.930
he sees the tank there,and
he goes, it's overflowing!

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.150
That was indescribable
happiness at that point.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.590
Just to see that not only
was it a really great site,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.430
but it far surpassed
expectations

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.480
in terms of how much
water we can actually get.
