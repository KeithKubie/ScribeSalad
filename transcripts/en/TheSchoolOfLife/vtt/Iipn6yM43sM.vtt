00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.169
The first question you tend to get asked when
you meet someone at a party is

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:05.460
 “So what do you do?”

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.040
And according to how impressive your answer
is, people are either keen to get to know

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.400
you better, or swiftly leave you behind by
the nuts.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.180
We’re anxious because we live in a world
of snobs, people who take a tiny part of us

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.880
- our professional identities - and use these
to come to a complete verdict about how valuable

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.749
we are as humans.

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.189
The opposite of a snob is your mother. She
doesn’t care about your status, she cares

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.010
about your soul. Yet most people aren’t
our mothers - and that’s why we worry so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.399
much about judgement and humiliation.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.129
It’s said we live in materialistic times.
But it’s more poignant than that. We live

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.280
in times where emotional rewards have been
pegged to the acquisition of material things.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.679
What people want when they go after money,
big jobs or fancy cars is rarely these things

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.539
in themselves, so much as the attention and
respect - if you like “the love” - that

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.079
are given to those who have them.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.499
Next time you see a guy driving by in a Ferrari,
don’t think it’s someone unusually greedy;

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.890
think it’s someone with a particularly intense
vulnerability and need for love.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.310
We’re also anxious because we’re constantly
told we could become anything. We hear it

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.560
from our earliest days.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.030
It should be great that there’s so much
opportunity. But what if we fail in such a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.380
world - what if you don’t manage to get
to the top when there was said to be every

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.540
chance?

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.039
The self-help shelves of bookstores are filled
with two kinds of books that capture the modern

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.859
anxious condition.
The first have titles like

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.560
 ‘How to make it big in 15 minutes’ and ‘Be
an overnight millionaire.’

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.250
The second have titles like: ‘How to cope
with low self-esteem.’

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.090
The two genres are related. A society that
tells people they could have everything, but

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.219
where in fact only a tiny minority can, will
end up with a lot of dissatisfaction and grief.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:58.289
There’s a related problem: our societies
are - to a large extent - deemed to be “fair”.

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.359
Back in the olden days, you knew the system
was rigged. It wasn’t your fault if you

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.679
were a peasant and not to your credit if you
were the lord. But now we’re told our societies

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.480
are meritocracies, places where rewards go
to those who merit them; the hardworking clever

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.030
among us.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.860
[word MERITOCRACY appears typed up]

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.240
It sounds lovely - but there’s a nasty sting
in the tail.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.420
If you really believe in a society where those
at the top deserve to get there, that has

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.670
to mean those at the bottom deserve to be
there too.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.040
Meritocracies make poverty seem not just unpleasant,
but also somehow deserved.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.220
In Medieval England, people used to call the
poor ‘unfortunates’.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.080
Literally, people who had not been blessed by the Goddess of fortune.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.020
 Nowadays, especially in the US (where meritocracy is big), they
call them - rather tellingly - ‘losers’.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.940
We scarcely believe in “luck” nowadays
as something that explains where we end up.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.340
No one will believe you if you say you were
fired because of “bad luck”. Your professional

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.200
position has become the central verdict on
your character. No wonder suicide rates rise

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.930
exponentially the moment a society joins the
so-called ‘modern world’.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.860
How can we cope?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.290
First off, by refusing to believe that any
society really can be meritocratic: luck or

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.810
accident continue to determine a critical
share of where people end up in the hierarchy.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.790
Treat no one - not least yourself - as though
they entirely deserve to be where they are.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.540
Secondly, make up your own definition of success
instead of uncritically leaning on society’s.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.910
There are so many ways to succeed, and many
of them have nothing to do with status as

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.260
its currently defined within the value system
of industrial capitalism. Those who succeed

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.140
at making money rarely succeed at empathy
or family life.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.810
Thirdly, and most importantly, we should refuse
to let our outer achievements define our sense

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.910
of self entirely. There remain so many vital
sides of us that will never appear on our

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.890
business cards, that do not stand a chance
of being captured by that maddeningly blunt

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.410
and unimaginative question, ‘So what do
you do?’
