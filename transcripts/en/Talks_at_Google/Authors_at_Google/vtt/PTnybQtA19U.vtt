[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:08.211
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.570
ANNA KENDRICK: Hi.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.796
I'll bet you guys
were really surprised.

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:13.420
I came all the way
through the audience

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.090
and then hung out over
there in the dark, like you

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.131
didn't know I was coming.

00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:16.934
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.684
MOLLY DECKER: Everyone
was like, hi, Anna.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.930
[INAUDIBLE] But we're here
to talk about Anna's book,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.950
"Scrappy Little Nobody."

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.910
If you haven't read it--

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.390
ANNA KENDRICK:
(WHISPERS) It's Anna.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.730
MOLLY DECKER: --it
is hilariously funny.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.814
It made my miserable New
Jersey commute enjoyable.

00:00:28.814 --> 00:00:29.563
ANNA KENDRICK: Oh.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.272
Oh, that's great.

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:31.354
MOLLY DECKER: Yes, it did.

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:32.400
ANNA KENDRICK: Thank you.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.440
MOLLY DECKER: Well, it took
one day-- one day to read it,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.530
so one day of commuting.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.720
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah, it
took me a day to write it.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.428
It's no big deal.

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:38.621
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.540
It's a year of my life.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.499
MOLLY DECKER: But
to get started, if--

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.790
ANNA KENDRICK: Sorry, I
insisted that we use hand mics.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.778
So I'm a jerk, but it's
just because I need a prop.

00:00:50.778 --> 00:00:53.559
MOLLY DECKER: But in the book,
you talk about the paparazzi.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.350
But other than that
and just talking to you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.660
backstage, you seem
completely unfazed by fame.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.730
And obviously,
you're really famous.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.230
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah, it's just
where I'm really comfortable.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.370
MOLLY DECKER: So my questions
are A, is that true?

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.504
And B, what's the creepiest
thing a fan has ever done?

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:11.670
ANNA KENDRICK: I don't want
to put anybody on blast.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.919
They might be in the audience.

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:13.878
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.070
Well, I don't know.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.570
People have shown
up at my house,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.719
and I'm always like, bro,
you can't be my house.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.010
It's like a nine-year-old girl.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.590
And I'm like, dude, come on.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.210
Come on.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.790
But that's always
like, I don't know

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.150
what I'm supposed to do about
that, other than be like,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.780
I'm in my bathrobe cleaning.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.160
So I guess this picture
was worth it for you.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.930
But I did once have a-- this
wasn't really even about me.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.460
But I was shooting one of
the later "Twilight" movies

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.280
in Vancouver.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.940
And I was in an American Eagle,
and I was looking at underwear,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.620
as a lady is wont to do.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.080
And a girl came up to
me, and she was like, hi,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.260
are you going to see
Taylor Lautner soon?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.830
And I was like, yeah,
because we were filming.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.330
And she was like, I
have something for him.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.052
And I was like, I really
need to say no to this girl,

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:19.760
because I was really
worried it was going

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.330
to be a thumb or something.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.870
Why does she have it with her?

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.230
I was just in a store,
and she ran into me.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.060
And why did she have a thing?

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.770
She carried a thing
at all moments

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.080
for Taylor Lautner in
case she ran into him

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.700
or somebody that knows him.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.200
And I thought,
this can't be good.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.190
This is going to be a
lock of hair or anthrax.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.070
I don't know.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.570
I can't be a part of this.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.900
MOLLY DECKER: What was it?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.900
ANNA KENDRICK: I don't
know, because I was like,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.810
ma'am I really can't.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.890
I called her ma'am.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.640
She very young.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.877
But I was trying to
keep my distance.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.210
MOLLY DECKER: That is hilarious.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.160
ANNA KENDRICK: Because I didn't
want to see a severed hand.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.955
MOLLY DECKER: I'm sure
you've seen it all.

00:02:53.955 --> 00:02:54.830
So you're an actress.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.510
You're a singer.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.530
So everyone knows she sings.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.290
And I recently saw your lip
sync battle with John Krasinski.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.790
And it's like,
oh, she can dance.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.944
I was like, great.

00:03:02.944 --> 00:03:03.860
She can do everything.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.000
Now she's an author.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.900
ANNA KENDRICK: That was
just me like sticking out

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.066
my butt pretending to dance.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.390
It was supposed to be funny.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.264
MOLLY DECKER: It was.

00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:10.001
It was awesome.

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.750
But I was like, oh,
and now she can write.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.500
She wrote a book.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.854
She's an author too.

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:15.020
ANNA KENDRICK: I am amazing.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.230
Is that your question?

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.438
MOLLY DECKER: You really are.

00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:18.152
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:19.874
MOLLY DECKER: Well, she is.

00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:21.290
How long did it
take, and what was

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.550
the impetus for you writing?

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.008
What made you want
to write a book?

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:25.580
ANNA KENDRICK: Well,
I wrote a piece

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.230
for "Vogue," that looking back
on it, I had to turn it in.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.950
It was supposed to be a diary
of an Oscars weekend one

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.510
of the times I was presenting.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.377
And I had to turn it in Monday
morning after the Oscars.

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:40.960
And you're out pretty
late that night.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.500
So I wrote it really quickly
and on very little sleep,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.540
so looking back on
it, I'm like mmm eh.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.810
But that's when I started
getting approached

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.170
about writing a book.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.530
And I think I
thought at some point

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.970
somebody was going to stop me.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.120
I was like, yeah I'll do that.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.642
And I was expecting
somebody to be like--

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:05.600
I was expecting to turn
in a couple of chapters

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.080
and mutually go, this
probably wasn't a good idea.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.290
Let's not do this.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.190
And that didn't happen.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.270
So I wrote--

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.760
I think I wrote the bulk
of it in this 45 day

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.220
where I knew that
I was never going

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.740
to become that person that
could write on my lunch break

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.420
and find time and find balance--

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.970
not really my thing, balance.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.940
So I was between movies, and
I had this 45-day period.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.660
So I wrote 2,000 words a
day every day for 45 days.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.730
And it didn't have
to be good, but I had

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.201
to write something 2,000 words.

00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:48.950
And I had to be really
strict with myself,

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.810
because if I give myself
an inch, I'll take a mile.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.310
I'm a really bad person.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.154
So that was where I
wrote a lot of it.

00:04:57.154 --> 00:04:59.570
And a lot of that stuff wasn't
good and isn't in the book.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.530
But that was kind
of where I started.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.865
And then the year after that
was about expanding on things

00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:10.490
that were interesting
and losing things

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.650
that weren't interesting.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.070
And in a lot of cases,
that meant entire sections.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.780
The section about
being nice didn't

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.415
come until right
toward the very end,

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:24.290
because I was in a bad
mood and was like, oh,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.791
here's this stupid
thing I wrote.

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.290
You're probably not
going to use it.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.760
And my editor
liked it a lot, so.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.718
MOLLY DECKER: Liked it?

00:05:29.718 --> 00:05:31.920
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.746
ANNA KENDRICK: [GASPS]
Whose phone just went off?

00:05:34.746 --> 00:05:36.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.225
Shame.

00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:40.600
MOLLY DECKER: For those of
you who haven't seen "Camp,"--

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.410
so you talk about "Camp" in your
book your, first movie 2003.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.190
It's amazing.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.355
And I love the show
must go on scene.

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.230
I must of watched on
YouTube a million times.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.890
Loved it.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.310
ANNA KENDRICK: Oh, thanks.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.910
MOLLY DECKER: I love it.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.830
I just watched it this
morning with somebody,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.697
because I was like,
I love it that much.

00:05:56.697 --> 00:05:59.030
But you talk a lot about how
that experience shaped you.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.930
You worked with a lot of younger
actors and actresses on set,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.540
like a camp, like a
real kind of camp.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.866
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah.

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.240
MOLLY DECKER: And
so the question

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.400
is, what about that
experience do you still

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.426
hold on to in that character
specifically, Fritzi,

00:06:12.426 --> 00:06:14.050
what do you still
hold on to from that?

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.107
ANNA KENDRICK: Well,
the character was so--

00:06:16.107 --> 00:06:18.190
was such an interesting
experience for me, because

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.700
at the time, I was 16 or 17.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.900
And I just like wanted to have
my makeup done and be like--

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.110
and be able to be like,
guys, like I'm in a movie.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.450
And I'm playing someone normal.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.120
And that wasn't the
case, because Fritzi

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.000
is the smelly girl.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.400
And now, I would love to
play a character like that.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.310
It was just about getting--

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.070
realizing that vanity just has
no place in performance or art

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.000
or--

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.894
it's just going to
hold you back, so.

00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:53.560
MOLLY DECKER: You
know the scene where--

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.091
is it the director-- was like,
you're a creepy little girl.

00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:57.840
I was like, this is a
hilarious character.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.305
ANNA KENDRICK: I know.

00:06:58.305 --> 00:06:58.770
I know.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.350
MOLLY DECKER: I loved it.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.560
ANNA KENDRICK: I know.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.768
But there were definitely
times when the director had

00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:03.960
to convince me, because
I was like, everybody

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.180
is going to hate me.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.030
Everybody's gonna
hate this character.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.430
It was definitely a lesson.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.407
But when you're 16, you don't
want to play the smelly girl.

00:07:12.407 --> 00:07:13.240
MOLLY DECKER: Right.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.050
But it is great.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.294
You've got to watch it
for anyone who hasn't.

00:07:16.294 --> 00:07:18.460
In the book, one of my
favorite quotes from the book

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.447
was when you said
your dad only cries

00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:22.530
when describing the storyline
of the movie "Rudy."

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.520
ANNA KENDRICK: That
is a true fact.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.060
MOLLY DECKER: I was just like--

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.650
I literally laughed out loud.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.190
I thought that was hilarious.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.100
ANNA KENDRICK: Then,
they come in, and they--

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.183
they put their shirt down.

00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:32.920
And they say, this for Rudy.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.010
This is for Rudy.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.340
I was like, what the fuck
is happening right now?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.759
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:38.800
We were in an Applebee's.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.170
MOLLY DECKER: That's so funny.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.710
ANNA KENDRICK: True fact.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.444
MOLLY DECKER: But similarly,
the title of the book "Scrappy

00:07:47.444 --> 00:07:49.360
Little Nobody," and you
talk about sticking up

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.650
to the bully in the school.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.495
You love that whole underdog,
David versus Goliath

00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:55.870
sort of thing, which is kind
of what "Rudy" is all about.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.530
So it seems like
similar to your dad.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.390
ANNA KENDRICK: Whoa.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.390
MOLLY DECKER: Did you
not make that connection?

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.070
ANNA KENDRICK: No.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.490
MOLLY DECKER: Oh.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.480
ANNA KENDRICK: I'm not
a very smart person.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.842
I don't know why they
let me write a book.

00:08:04.842 --> 00:08:06.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.540
MOLLY DECKER: So as I was
reading it, I was like, wow,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.290
she loves the underdog.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.250
Her dad loves the underdog.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.640
What is it about being the
underdog, and what are you--

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.570
why do you miss being like
this scrappy little nobody?

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.819
ANNA KENDRICK: Well, I think
everybody feels that way.

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:17.530
No matter where you
come from in life,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.640
you feel the insecurities
that you have.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.660
You carry those with
you your whole life.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.830
And the best thing
you can do with them

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.380
is turn them into
something productive.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.390
So that's why I sing so loud.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.480
And because I have no technique.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.480
MOLLY DECKER: You once--

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.920
[LAUGHS] This cracks me up too.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.419
There's so much in
this book that is

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.159
just-- you will laugh out loud.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.110
You said once on
Twitter that your dream

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.570
is to live in the Thanksgiving
episode of a '90s sitcom.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.670
ANNA KENDRICK: So true.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.503
MOLLY DECKER: Which I
can totally relate to,

00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:50.406
I totally get.

00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:52.219
And I was equally as
excited in the book

00:08:52.219 --> 00:08:54.010
when you started
describing all the holiday

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.990
parties that you will no--

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.850
you'll never throw.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.330
But you have a vision of them.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.730
ANNA KENDRICK: Yes, that
was really fun to write.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.313
MOLLY DECKER: And I
just want to know,

00:09:01.313 --> 00:09:04.480
what's up with that
whole holiday section?

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.780
ANNA KENDRICK: I don't know.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.550
And I think there
was only one of those

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.080
that I had to come up with.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.400
Because it wanted it to have
a nice kind of pacing to it.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.860
The rest of them, I genuinely
have planned parties

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.770
in my head with great
detail and talked about them

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.220
with one of my best friends.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.380
And the Christmas party
especially, every single detail

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.464
I had laid out in my head.

00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:28.879
MOLLY DECKER: Every
room has to be

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.360
decorated with Christmas decor.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.901
ANNA KENDRICK: I
think it's because I

00:09:31.901 --> 00:09:33.610
don't have much
of a social life,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.800
because I have turned
myself into a workaholic.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.860
So I'd fantasize about having
parties and having friends

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.360
over.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.000
MOLLY DECKER: But
you never throw them.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.570
ANNA KENDRICK: So yeah, I
don't know what that's about,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.409
other than like--

00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:47.950
I don't know.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.324
Does anybody else do that?

00:09:49.324 --> 00:09:51.240
MOLLY DECKER: I can
relate, but I don't plan--

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.823
ANNA KENDRICK: Plans
their dream-- no?

00:09:52.823 --> 00:09:55.190
MOLLY DECKER: I don't
plan them out that way.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.387
But I can relate.

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:57.220
I love the holidays.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:57.910
I love "Home Alone."

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.701
You talked about "Home
Alone," in the book.

00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:01.030
That There's a holiday theme.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.390
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.850
I think it's--

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.180
I don't love Christmas.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.570
It makes me really stressed.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.360
Any forced fun, like birthdays
and New Year's and stuff,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.400
like have the best
time of your life right

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.950
now is-- it seems
counterintuitive to having

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.710
a good time.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.770
But the season around
it, I really do love.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.640
I know I'm supposed to
hate Christmas music.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.098
Fuck you, you hate
Christmas music.

00:10:24.098 --> 00:10:25.340
Christmas music's great.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:31.330
So I love just
decorating everything

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.567
with tacky tinsiley garbage.

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:34.650
MOLLY DECKER: Who doesn't?

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.250
It's great.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.630
So you describe a lot of hustle.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.530
So as a young girl,
you would take the bus

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.904
from Maine, where you lived
with your brothers, sometimes

00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:44.160
your dad, into New York City.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.410
You were on theater,
performed a lot, worked

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.217
a lot as a young kid, really.

00:10:49.217 --> 00:10:50.050
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.490
MOLLY DECKER: How old were you?

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.390
ANNA KENDRICK: I started
coming to New York

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.430
to audition when
I was 10, I think.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.360
And I got--

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.300
I did the-- my first
Broadway show at 12.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:11.020
And yeah, I don't know.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.530
I didn't think a lot about it.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.290
It just felt like it
was my only option.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.470
It's just what I wanted to do.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.370
I remember particularly
when I moved--

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.590
I think at 12, it
seemed more like--

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.765
people just assumed that
it was my parents being--

00:11:28.765 --> 00:11:29.290
MOLLY DECKER:
Pushing you to do it.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.730
ANNA KENDRICK: --creepy.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.590
But particularly when I
moved to LA when I was 17,

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.340
there was a lot of like,
whoa, I could never do that.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.930
And it was like, I had to.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.170
I didn't have a choice.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.330
It was the only thing
I could think to do.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.372
It just was necessary.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.830
MOLLY DECKER: What
advice would you

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.080
give-- there's
people old, young,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.920
all types here in the audience.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.590
But what advice would you
give younger, up-and-coming,

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.770
working on your career
in New York City?

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.611
What would you give the
younger 12-year-old you advice?

00:11:59.611 --> 00:12:01.360
ANNA KENDRICK: The
shitty thing about this

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.782
is I only have a piece
of truly terrible advice.

00:12:04.782 --> 00:12:05.740
I say this in the book.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.280
And I do feel that
it's terrible advice.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.410
But I was told very, very young,
like when I was 11 years old,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.640
don't have a backup plan.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.190
That's terrible advice.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:22.780
But I think if I had
one, I would have caved.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.590
I absolutely-- there was not--

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.010
even though I felt
like I have to do this,

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.840
this is completely necessary,
and this was my only choice,

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.147
I never felt like so that
means it's going to work out.

00:12:38.147 --> 00:12:38.980
MOLLY DECKER: Right.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.260
ANNA KENDRICK: So
there were definitely

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.550
times where I felt like I wish
I hadn't listened to that advice

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.410
and I did have my backup plan.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.432
Because I wanted to opt out.

00:12:50.432 --> 00:12:52.140
MOLLY DECKER: Yeah,
and you moved to LA--

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.990
still young.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.210
You didn't go to
college, moved to LA.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.090
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah,
did not go to college.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.756
MOLLY DECKER: Bought
your Ikea furniture

00:12:56.756 --> 00:12:58.940
and just worked and
went on auditions.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.774
It's like actually--

00:12:59.774 --> 00:13:01.148
ANNA KENDRICK:
Yeah, so my advice

00:13:01.148 --> 00:13:02.440
is don't have a backup plan.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.440
MOLLY DECKER: It's OK,
don't have a backup plan.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:08.570
ANNA KENDRICK: And
do drugs, I guess.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.855
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:10.855
MOLLY DECKER: Hilarious.

00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:11.850
All right.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.660
We'll take our first
audience question.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:13.960
ANNA KENDRICK: Hi.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.720
So first of all, thank you
so much for taking the time

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.125
to be here.

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:17.470
You're hilarious.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.520
ANNA KENDRICK: It's my pleasure.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.260
AUDIENCE: I want to
know a fun question.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.059
What has been your
favorite set to work on,

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:24.100
your favorite movie set,
and your least favorite?

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.940
And why?

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.230
ANNA KENDRICK: Ugh.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.502
That is a really hard question.

00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:29.210
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:34.180
ANNA KENDRICK: I like that.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.280
I did like "Up In The
Air" a lot, because it

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.609
felt like we were making
a really small movie,

00:13:43.609 --> 00:13:45.650
especially because I mostly
interact with George.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.149
And I interact with Vera Farmiga
a little bit in that movie.

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:52.100
It felt like it was just the
three of us making that movie.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.560
And it was kind of a big
production and a big budget.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.670
But at the same time, doing
something like "Into the Woods"

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.870
was so dream come true.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.090
I remember standing with Tracey
Ullman, who's like a goddess,

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.680
and being on that set in
Pinewood Studios in London,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.160
where a lot of the-- some
of the scenes in the woods

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.590
we did outside in the woods.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.290
But some of it was on a stage,
and the stage was so enormous

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.880
that you couldn't-- we
couldn't tell where it ended.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.900
And Chris Pine was
riding in on a horse,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.950
and Tracey and I were
just like, can you

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.450
fucking believe that we're here?

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.830
And I was like, I
can't fucking believe

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.829
I'm having this conversation
with Tracey Ullman.

00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:42.102
And it's how you think
every film set will be,

00:14:42.102 --> 00:14:43.560
that it'll be this
production where

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.560
you get to wear this corset
and this period costumes.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.280
And that's really
the only experience

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.900
that I've had like that.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.360
And to make it interesting,
I'll say that was also

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.650
my least favorite set.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.530
Because it was
cold all the time,

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.840
because they built a
real forest in a studio.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.690
And it was so huge that
we couldn't keep it warm,

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.550
and there were dirt everywhere.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:11.970
And they had to pump so
much smoke into the studio

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.120
to get the atmosphere right
that I would-- this is gross,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.116
but I'll just share.

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:18.282
I would go home and blow
my nose, and it'd be black.

00:15:18.282 --> 00:15:18.919
AUDIENCE: Ew.

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:19.710
ANNA KENDRICK: Eww.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.720
Ugh.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.850
So it was one of
those things where

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.290
I was so happy to be there.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.849
And then, my ribs and feet
hurt at the end of the night,

00:15:27.849 --> 00:15:29.640
because the costumes
were very unforgiving.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.620
So it was one of
those sets where

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.970
I had to be like so grateful
to be here and remind yourself,

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.360
this is a dream job.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.367
So happy.

00:15:37.367 --> 00:15:38.200
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.241
ANNA KENDRICK: Thank you.

00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:41.232
MOLLY DECKER: That's awesome.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.690
In the book, you
talk about wanting

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.190
to be a doctor when
you were little.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.870
That's the story
that your mom loves.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.030
ANNA KENDRICK: That's when
I thought I was smart.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.863
MOLLY DECKER: You were
going to be a doctor,

00:15:48.863 --> 00:15:50.070
but you're an actor/singer.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.320
You didn't have a backup plan.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.850
But if you weren't doing this,
because you clearly love it,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.400
what do you think
you'd be doing?

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.050
ANNA KENDRICK: I'm
hoping I'd have

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.030
one of those bullshit
racket jobs, where

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.660
I was a life coach or a
personal organizer or something,

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.130
one of those made up.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.250
I mean, I'm sure there are
people who do it well and are

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.210
effective, but I'd just
be really bad at it

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.090
but convince people.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.604
I'd have a nice aesthetic
on my Instagram,

00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:19.020
so people would
be like, she seems

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.530
like she's onto something.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.530
MOLLY DECKER: Are you
good at advice in general,

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.720
outside of the career advice?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.950
ANNA KENDRICK: No.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:24.780
Very bad.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.400
MOLLY DECKER: So that's just
what you would like to do?

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:26.840
ANNA KENDRICK: Mm-hmm.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.250
MOLLY DECKER: That's hilarious.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.900
ANNA KENDRICK: Just ruin
people's lives willfully.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.960
MOLLY DECKER: Oh my God.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.940
OK, question over here.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.823
ANNA KENDRICK: Hi.

00:16:33.823 --> 00:16:36.190
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming, by the way.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.220
ANNA KENDRICK: Thanks.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.560
Thank you for speaking
into the microphone,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.893
even though it's clearly not on.

00:16:39.893 --> 00:16:41.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.560
I like that about you.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.750
You're a rule follower.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.346
I like it.

00:16:45.346 --> 00:16:46.342
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:46.342 --> 00:16:48.409
ANNA KENDRICK: OK.

00:16:48.409 --> 00:16:49.876
AUDIENCE: Often,
I think at Google,

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:52.321
we get asked what our
five-year plan is,

00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:54.544
and you're very successful.

00:16:54.544 --> 00:16:55.460
ANNA KENDRICK: I know.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.846
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:56.846 --> 00:16:58.262
AUDIENCE: Where
do you [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:58.262 --> 00:16:59.663
in the next five years?

00:16:59.663 --> 00:17:00.600
What are your goals?

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.724
ANNA KENDRICK: Do you know?

00:17:01.724 --> 00:17:03.470
I don't fucking know.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.430
Do you guys know?

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.349
Do you have answers when
people ask you that?

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.474
Can I have a show of hands?

00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:09.740
Do you have a teed up answer?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.560
Nobody?

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.490
You're Google.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.843
What the fuck is going on?

00:17:13.843 --> 00:17:14.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.778
No, I think that's one of
those insane questions.

00:17:17.778 --> 00:17:19.819
I feel like a sociopath
would have a great answer

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:20.960
for that question.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.800
But I don't have a plan.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.510
Honestly, sometimes
I feel like my plan

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.174
is to work as hard
as I can until I

00:17:28.174 --> 00:17:29.840
have a nervous breakdown
and have to say

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.320
that I have lupus or something.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.850
I don't know.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.810
I'm excited all the time
and terrified all the time.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.577
How do you feel?

00:17:39.577 --> 00:17:40.910
AUDIENCE: I feel-- that's great.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.900
ANNA KENDRICK: How do
you feel about my life?

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.000
AUDIENCE: I feel like you've
got it all figured out.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.450
ANNA KENDRICK: OK, great.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.068
I need a lot of validation.

00:17:46.068 --> 00:17:48.160
I appreciate that.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.810
MOLLY DECKER: OK,
we'll go over here.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:50.380
ANNA KENDRICK: Hi.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:50.963
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:17:50.963 --> 00:17:54.837
So I was in acapella group in
college and recently went--

00:17:54.837 --> 00:17:56.670
I'm not going to sing
with you, don't worry.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.120
ANNA KENDRICK: No, I wasn't
gonna do that either.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.994
AUDIENCE: Recently went
to ICCA Championships

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:03.360
in New York, which were
definitely not as fun

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.215
as the movie, "Pitch Perfect."

00:18:05.215 --> 00:18:06.590
And I'm just
wondering if you can

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.620
talk about how just making
that movie in general,

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.105
how fun it was, the musical
rehearsal that went into it?

00:18:13.105 --> 00:18:14.480
ANNA KENDRICK:
Well first of all,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.600
I can tell you the reason that
real acapella competitions,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.667
while very impressive, are
not as fun as the movie,

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:22.250
"Pitch Perfect,"
because they actually

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.470
have to sing live and dance.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.260
So the dance moves
are more like walking.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.770
And we are trying to
get down to the best

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:36.290
of our non-dancer abilities.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:42.800
So we fall on the floor
after the dance numbers.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.550
So obviously, we can't
actually sing during them.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.580
If you could do an ICCA--

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.580
this is a real competition.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.280
If the ICCAs could
prerecord their vocals

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.190
and then dance to them, they'd
really be on to something.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.110
But then, they'd just be
like pop stars in the '90s.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.610
Ooh.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.620
Burn on pop stars in the '90s.

00:19:06.464 --> 00:19:07.701
Is that-- I don't know.

00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:08.950
Did that answer your question?

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:09.640
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.139
But I--

00:19:10.139 --> 00:19:12.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.850
ANNA KENDRICK: OK.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:16.350
Sorry.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.960
What else did you need to know?

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.760
AUDIENCE: Just
curious if you could

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.250
talk about just
how much fun it was

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.540
to make the movie in general?

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.915
ANNA KENDRICK: It
was really fun.

00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:29.061
AUDIENCE: OK, good talk.

00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:30.060
MOLLY DECKER: All right.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.250
All right.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.166
We're going over here.

00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:32.952
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:32.952 --> 00:19:35.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Hi, Anna.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.320
I was just wondering, since
you mentioned earlier that you

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.800
wanted to play more roles like
that 16-year-old smelly girl--

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.276
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah.

00:19:43.276 --> 00:19:45.085
Oh my god, you think
I could pass for 16?

00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:45.584
Thank you.

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:46.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:50.380
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm 19.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:51.575 --> 00:19:52.950
ANNA KENDRICK: I
don't understand

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.545
what's happening, but great.

00:19:55.545 --> 00:19:56.920
AUDIENCE: It just
kind of made me

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.460
think about what kind of advice
you would give to someone who

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.940
isn't really comfortable in the
position they're in, like how

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.490
you would find an
environment where

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.020
you are safe to be yourself.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.146
ANNA KENDRICK: My
friend, Ben Platt--

00:20:16.146 --> 00:20:18.330
AUDIENCE: Whoo.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.340
ANNA KENDRICK: Oh, that was the
biggest name drop of the night.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.736
I think he said it best
in his Tony speech.

00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:27.110
He said, what
makes you different

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.370
is what makes you powerful.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.500
And I was like that
thing, yes, what he said.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.430
So yeah, it's--

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.366
I think finding your tribe is
important, whatever that means.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.680
And I always hate that--

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.440
I hate that thing
of like when adults

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.560
are like, oh, none of this
will matter in the real world.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:59.710
Because if you're in it,
it sucks for you now.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.802
If somebody asked me to suffer
through four years of feeling

00:21:03.802 --> 00:21:05.510
targeted and ostracized,
I would be like,

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.801
I really don't want to do that.

00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:09.610
And you telling me that it
will be over in four years

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.170
doesn't make it better.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.140
So I think just trying
to like find strength

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.220
in yourself if you
feel misunderstood

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:23.740
and knowing that
you are powerful,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.610
and the things that make
you odd and the things

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:32.040
that people don't understand
are the things that give you

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.782
value in the world, I think.

00:21:34.782 --> 00:21:36.240
I'm just paraphrasing
what he said.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.990
He said it better.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.936
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:37.936 --> 00:21:39.060
MOLLY DECKER: That's great.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.143
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:21:40.143 --> 00:21:41.410
ANNA KENDRICK: Thanks.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:41.910
Hey.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:42.630
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.410
You seem like a pretty
grounded person.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.140
So I'm wondering,
what do you focus on

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.189
outside that industry
that makes you grounded

00:21:50.189 --> 00:21:50.980
or makes you happy?

00:21:54.614 --> 00:21:55.780
ANNA KENDRICK: I don't know.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.071
I should probably have a more
profound answer for this,

00:21:58.071 --> 00:22:03.160
but I grew up in like a black
Irish humor kind of family.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:10.630
And finding humor was
always the thing that--

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.700
how we got through everything.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.830
And I'm a big fan
of gallows humor

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.370
and just undercutting
everything.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.540
So I idolize comedians.

00:22:25.349 --> 00:22:26.890
I just did a movie
with Chris Morris.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.230
I don't know if you guys know
the British comedian, Chris

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.730
Morris.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.730
He's just the darkest
motherfucker around.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:40.360
So that kind of thing
just reminds me.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.480
It's basically like I can't
hang out with my older brother

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.330
all the time anymore, because
we live across the country.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.064
But he would be the guy
to be like, you're being

00:22:49.064 --> 00:22:50.230
a pretentious piece of shit.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.880
Like, chill.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.040
And since I can't
have that, it's

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.320
like I just try to
look at Morgan Murphy's

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.345
Twitter accounts
and stuff like that.

00:23:01.345 --> 00:23:01.970
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:02.560
Thanks.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.030
MOLLY DECKER: I have a
related question, sort of

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.113
like outside the industry.

00:23:05.113 --> 00:23:09.610
If you were on "Jeopardy" and
could preselect the category,

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.450
what would it be?

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.000
ANNA KENDRICK: Oh, my.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.750
What do I know a lot about?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.430
The script of "Clueless"?

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.956
Yeah.

00:23:22.956 --> 00:23:24.080
Oh, that's a good question.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.935
And it really makes you realize
the things you know really well

00:23:26.935 --> 00:23:27.935
are mostly embarrassing.

00:23:27.935 --> 00:23:30.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.340
I guess like 30
screwball films, I guess.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.132
I like those a lot.

00:23:36.132 --> 00:23:38.215
MOLLY DECKER: You know
those-- the lines by heart,

00:23:38.215 --> 00:23:40.080
know all the characters'
names and scenes?

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.913
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah.

00:23:40.913 --> 00:23:42.530
MOLLY DECKER: That's awesome.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.140
OK, we're going to take
you over here, Richard.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.050
So I became familiar
with you from

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.311
your early theatrical career.

00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:51.810
I saw "High Society" when I was
trying out in San Francisco.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:52.730
ANNA KENDRICK: What the--?

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.438
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:23:53.438 --> 00:23:54.720
I went to Latin Club.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.860
I was very popular.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.150
But then I saw "Camp"
when it was in theaters.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.400
And I was curious,
what motivated

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.680
you to go from theater to
film and if you would ever

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.760
consider a return?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.760
ANNA KENDRICK: Well, when I
did "High Society" in New York

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.130
Randy Graff was in it, and she--

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.640
I became very close to her.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.960
And I loved her very much.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.970
And her cousin, Todd Graff,
directed the movie, "Camp."

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.396
So she told me that I should
audition for this movie.

00:24:23.396 --> 00:24:24.770
And especially
because that movie

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.620
was about musical
theater kids, that

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.780
seemed like the
right thing to do.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.960
And then, I had such
an amazing experience

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.380
with Todd and with those
kids and kind of realized

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:42.170
that while there are--

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.100
you're more likely
to run into assholes,

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.600
I guess, in terms
of movie actors.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.400
But I think actors
are out of their minds

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.600
but wonderful
presences to be around.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.990
And I had such a great
experience on that,

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.750
that I wanted to
keep doing that.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.659
And I also started to
actually understand

00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:01.950
the mechanics of making a
movie, and that was exciting.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.600
Because the first
movie was mostly

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.060
me being totally terrified
and going like, wait,

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.851
I have to look over
here, even though she's

00:25:09.851 --> 00:25:12.500
standing over there
and not understanding

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.610
what was happening.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.630
Learning about the
filmmaking process

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.990
was really exciting to me.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.215
I don't know if that
was interesting.

00:25:25.215 --> 00:25:27.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] And are
you considering going back

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.920
to theater at some point?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.380
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah
I would love to.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.480
I look at Bette Midler
in "Hello, Dolly!",

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.790
and she can do that
because she's Bette Midler.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.120
So I think I would want to
do a new piece so that it

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.700
wasn't-- just selfishly, to
take the pressure off myself.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.404
Just I wouldn't
want to follow up

00:25:44.404 --> 00:25:46.320
on anybody else's
performance to do a revival,

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.765
but I would love
to do a new piece.

00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:50.640
MOLLY DECKER: When were
you the most nervous?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.530
Because you did an opening
number for the Oscars, right?

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.510
That must been a
little nerve-wracking.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.030
ANNA KENDRICK:
Yeah, I think the--

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.655
I can tell you that the times in
my life I've-- the three times

00:25:59.655 --> 00:26:04.450
I've been most nervous was doing
[INAUDIBLE] stage at Carnegie

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:04.950
Hall.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.110
I did this weird performance
when I was like 13 years old,

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.440
and Julie Andrews was there.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.230
So that was terrifying.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.330
And then the first time
I did David Letterman,

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.940
like fully thought I
was going to pass out.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.524
And then the performing
at the Oscars.

00:26:16.524 --> 00:26:17.814
MOLLY DECKER: The Oscars, yeah.

00:26:17.814 --> 00:26:19.230
The Oscars is a big one.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.370
All right, let's take
a question over here.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:20.911
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:20.911 --> 00:26:22.365
ANNA KENDRICK: Hi.

00:26:22.365 --> 00:26:24.080
AUDIENCE: So before
you mentioned

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.880
that vanity will hold you back.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.700
And I was wondering-- obviously
there was a point in your life

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.490
when you transitioned
between auditioning for roles

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:37.110
and not having a name and
having the celebrity status

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.510
and people knowing you.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.110
What did that
transition look like,

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:45.535
and how did it impact you
as a person or your career?

00:26:45.535 --> 00:26:48.434
I'm assuming you don't
audition anymore?

00:26:48.434 --> 00:26:50.850
ANNA KENDRICK: I don't know
if this is exactly what you're

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:51.433
talking about.

00:26:51.433 --> 00:26:56.010
But the point where
I suddenly started

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.980
going on red carpets and
stuff and promoting the movie

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.390
and getting dressed, and people
were doing my hair and makeup

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.290
stuff, I've never
felt more hideous.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.780
Because people,
like teams of people

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.500
are putting hours of
effort into how you look.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.150
And that's never
happened before.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.650
And then, you go
on a red carpet,

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.330
and Joan Rivers
is like, C-minus.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.260
And you're like, what the fuck?

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.134
This is the best I've
ever looked in my life.

00:27:18.134 --> 00:27:19.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.552
So that is a rude awakening.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.310
I had also never
been in a position

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.880
to be compared to
Natalie Portman.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.790
That shouldn't happen
to any woman ever.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:40.530
So I always thought
like, I do OK.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:41.030
I get mine.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.795
And then I was
like, no, no, no no.

00:27:45.795 --> 00:27:48.170
I'm not supposed to be compared
to Blake Lively, which is

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.419
the movie I'm doing right now.

00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:51.770
So that's good for
my self-esteem.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:57.570
But yeah, it just took
me kind of saying like,

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.100
the best thing I can do with
what is happening in my brain

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.080
right now is know that I have
never had to lie awake at night

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.330
and go, do I offer anything?

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:16.790
Am I only getting the work that
I'm getting because I'm so hot?

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.890
And that I have
to just go, well,

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.500
that's a blessing, because
at least I know I have value.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.771
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:25.132 --> 00:28:27.590
So really, let's say a prayer
for the really, really pretty

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.100
girls.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.558
They're the ones
who have it rough.

00:28:29.558 --> 00:28:30.730
Am I right?

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.670
Those poor things.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.335
AUDIENCE: Real quick follow-up.

00:28:33.335 --> 00:28:33.960
Oh, never mind.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.520
ANNA KENDRICK: I have no idea
if that was the question.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.060
I honestly was thinking
about how weirdly soft

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.110
this microphone is.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.820
MOLLY DECKER: Over here.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.680
AUDIENCE: Hello really big fan.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.050
So I guess I was wondering--

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.100
you've written this book.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.516
You're working on
a lot of movies.

00:28:50.516 --> 00:28:52.430
How do you manage your time?

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.110
How do you manage
doing all these things

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:58.130
that you want to do that
you do for your career?

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.180
ANNA KENDRICK: That is
such a great question,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.250
and I will tell you
when I figure it out.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:09.050
Honestly, I've tried to
do a couple of things

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:13.355
recently to correct the fact
that I felt like I was--

00:29:13.355 --> 00:29:15.560
I'm going to get really real--

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.810
I was letting everybody
in my life down.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.370
Because I just didn't--

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.280
I had spread myself too thin
and said yes to too many things.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.410
And therefore, I
was constantly--

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.900
I felt like everybody
was mad at me.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.990
I wasn't maintaining friendships
and family relationships

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:36.030
and have recently tried to make
sure that that is happening.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:42.830
So I guess just having
to say to people,

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.780
no, I absolutely can't do that.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.530
I think I forget
that when somebody

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:52.490
wants you to do something,
you can't really

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.830
gauge how important
it is, because it's

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.020
just what they want.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.561
So actually saying, this
is how much I really

00:30:00.561 --> 00:30:02.060
don't want to do
this, so let's talk

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.060
about how important these things
are and make some decisions.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.810
And that's a really
uncomfortable place to be.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:12.679
Because normally, I feel
more like I'm going,

00:30:12.679 --> 00:30:13.970
is there any way that we could?

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:18.560
And the second that I get
that, ooh, we kind of planned,

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.270
and this has been worked on.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.470
And it's been decided.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:22.720
I was like, oh, then, totally.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.430
Then, totally.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:28.400
And having to
assert that no, I'm

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.940
going to have to like
compartmentalize here and make

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.147
some time for my momma.

00:30:35.147 --> 00:30:35.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.450
ANNA KENDRICK: She
gets really mad at me.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.850
MOLLY DECKER: Back to
the book for one second.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:43.212
Just in writing it, what's
your hope or one thing

00:30:43.212 --> 00:30:44.420
you want people to take away?

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:48.860
Is it more laughter
or story of you?

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.135
ANNA KENDRICK: That was
what I wanted people

00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:52.010
to take away from it.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:53.926
I was like, I just want
it to be really funny.

00:30:53.926 --> 00:30:55.970
That was my goal.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.390
And since I'm not
a writer by trade

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.106
or a comedian or something,
that was like the best thing

00:31:02.106 --> 00:31:03.980
that I could hope is
that people would laugh.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.724
And my editor was
like, maybe put

00:31:05.724 --> 00:31:06.890
some serious stuff in there.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.110
And I was like, ugh, ew.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.330
But actually, I think the thing
that I get comments on the most

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:18.650
is the section about being nice
and how it's just not something

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.360
that I'm prioritizing anymore.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.360
So fuck all of you.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.130
And that was something
that I thought

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:29.107
for sure I would send it to my
editor, and she would be like,

00:31:29.107 --> 00:31:31.190
you're coming off a little
bitter in this section.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.092
But she was like,
no, this is right on.

00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:34.300
MOLLY DECKER: It's authentic.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.335
And to the question
you just had--

00:31:37.335 --> 00:31:38.050
it's you.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.277
It's you.

00:31:39.277 --> 00:31:40.110
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.300
MOLLY DECKER: That's great.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.180
Question over here.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:42.920
AUDIENCE: Howdy.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.560
ANNA KENDRICK: Hi.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.643
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that going into "Camp,"

00:31:45.643 --> 00:31:47.260
it felt pretty
natural since it was

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.510
more musical theater oriented.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.270
And I was curious
how it felt to go

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.600
into the role in
"Rocket Science," where

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.135
it was heavily debate-based.

00:31:54.135 --> 00:31:55.760
And it's a weird
culture to begin with.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.650
So I was just wondering
your opinion on that.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.080
ANNA KENDRICK: Well
it was really fun.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.020
And the writer and director
came from policy debate,

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.540
and he did have an
intense stutter.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:14.750
And he didn't join because of
a manipulative psychotic girl,

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.470
so I was made up.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:20.120
But I had a great time with
that because I knew that he was

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.620
getting all the details right.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.920
They had this really specific
thing about what boxes we--

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.070
yeah, look at your face--

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.570
we used.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.040
And knowing that like
certain subcultures

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.180
can be explored in each--

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.150
in different movies was
exciting and knowing that you

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.940
would get that recognition of--

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:45.060
and when I watch movies about
theater or making movies,

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.817
I love it when they
get everything right.

00:32:46.817 --> 00:32:48.650
And it's really frustrating
when they don't.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.590
So I think it's always fun to
be able to honor that and know

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.400
that somebody is going to
go, those fucking boxes.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.025
Yeah.

00:32:55.025 --> 00:32:55.840
AUDIENCE: Well, thanks.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.756
ANNA KENDRICK: Thanks.

00:32:56.756 --> 00:32:58.472
MOLLY DECKER:
Question [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:58.472 --> 00:32:59.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:00.650
And I love you.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.590
Don't worry, I won't show
up at your house, though.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.260
But my question is, why did
you want to include Google

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.670
as part of your book tour?

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.290
We need affirmations too.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.802
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.802 --> 00:33:12.260
ANNA KENDRICK: You
guys seem smart.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.840
I don't know.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.770
Like I always think it's crazy
that you guys would want--

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.410
professional people
would want to talk to me.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.350
And I always feel like I
get something out of it too.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.320
And you guys have asked
really great questions,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.980
and you're all young
and attractive, so just

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.070
looking to get laid, really.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.016
How's that for-- is
that a good affirmation?

00:33:35.016 --> 00:33:36.140
AUDIENCE: That was perfect.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.306
ANNA KENDRICK: Very attractive
group here at Google.

00:33:38.306 --> 00:33:39.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.280
MOLLY DECKER: Over here.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.970
AUDIENCE: Hi I know
we talked a little--

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.544
or mentioned your
Twitter account.

00:33:45.544 --> 00:33:47.210
And I just wanted to
ask you about that.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.467
I actually don't have Twitter.

00:33:48.467 --> 00:33:49.550
I don't really do Twitter.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.657
But when I see funny tweets
being posted elsewhere,

00:33:52.657 --> 00:33:54.740
they're often yours, and
they're often very funny.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.615
ANNA KENDRICK: [GASP]

00:33:56.115 --> 00:33:57.680
AUDIENCE: So I was
just wondering,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.388
how does that-- that's
always a question.

00:33:59.388 --> 00:34:01.779
How do you-- do just wake
up and think of funny things

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:02.570
and then post them?

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.450
Or how do you go about
creating your Twitter?

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.400
ANNA KENDRICK: It's just when
I think of something funny.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.330
I follow Andy
Richter from Conan.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.969
And when I go on Conan, he was
like, you should tweet more.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:17.510
You're funny.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:18.426
You should tweet more.

00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:20.690
And I was like, I
am not holding back.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.429
It's not a quality
control thing.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:25.760
It's a supply and demand
brilliant thing on my part.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.010
It's just like when
I think of things.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.010
And sometimes as an exercise,
I'll try to think of a joke,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.820
and it'll always go down OK.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.831
I'll sit in an airport
and try to come up

00:34:37.831 --> 00:34:39.830
with a joke and tweet
something, and it's always

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.570
like that was all right.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:49.590
So it's more just like weird
things will pop into my head.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.257
And recently, I texted
some of the girls

00:34:51.257 --> 00:34:52.965
from "Pitch Perfect,"
because I was like,

00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:54.870
I need a female opinion
on whether I can post

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.890
about that thing where
you put in a new tampon

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:02.820
and then you're like, did
I take out my old tampon?

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.140
Like five minutes later.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.181
MOLLY DECKER: I saw that.

00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:06.180
I saw that meme.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.420
ANNA KENDRICK: And
they said, yes.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.440
So I was like, OK.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.030
So I'm not the only one.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.490
I've never done it,
but I always think it.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.820
MOLLY DECKER: OK, over here.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.830
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks
for being with us.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.810
I thought you were great
in the "Trolls" movie,

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.090
and I wanted to know if
you could give something

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:28.652
to Justin Timberlake for me.

00:35:28.652 --> 00:35:29.860
ANNA KENDRICK: Is it a thumb?

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.840
AUDIENCE: No, but seriously.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.600
Voice acting versus live acting,
is there anything about it

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.340
that you like more or less?

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.130
ANNA KENDRICK: The
big joke is like you

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.660
get to go to work
in your pajamas,

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.550
and I would do that anyway.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.090
So yeah, voice acting is
preferable in the sense

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.640
that you get to be comfortable.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.000
But it's like the best acting
class I've ever been in,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.700
because you get--

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.860
on the films that you get a
direction, and you're like, OK.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.260
And I have that
kind of physical--

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.510
emotional response to, I
see what you're saying.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.020
And I want to execute
on that right now.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.130
And then like 10 minutes
later, you get to do it,

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.840
and you're filtering it through.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.022
But I have to hit
this mark, and I have

00:36:15.022 --> 00:36:16.230
to have the cup in this hand.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.900
So I switch it there
and make sure I'm

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.980
in my light or whatever.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.950
And it's being able
to just follow through

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.780
on those intentions
like the second

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.780
that you have them
is so fantastic.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.270
And it's the most
freeing experience,

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.770
because you don't
have to like fight

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.069
through these layers of the
filmmaking process, which

00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.610
is important.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.230
And I honestly
can't stand it when

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.710
I'm working with somebody
who's like all over the map

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.687
and is like completely--

00:36:42.687 --> 00:36:43.770
the camera can follow you.

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.540
But there's equipment
in the background.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.170
So the shot's unusable.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.890
So congratulations on the great
performance you just gave.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.720
It's not going in the movie.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.590
So I really want to
like respect the process

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.160
and make sure that I'm doing my
job to the best of my ability

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.280
while not making anybody
else's job harder.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.220
But to not have any
of those obstacles

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.097
is so freeing and so amazing,
I would do it forever.

00:37:08.097 --> 00:37:09.930
It's so much fun,
especially that character.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.622
She's out of her mind.

00:37:11.622 --> 00:37:12.330
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.310
ANNA KENDRICK: In the pink way.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.820
MOLLY DECKER: Well,
today, the question

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.194
I wanted to make
sure to ask you.

00:37:16.194 --> 00:37:18.060
You were in "Twilight
The Eclipse,"

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.420
or "Twilight Eclipse," which is
literally the only link today's

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.750
eclipse that I could find.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.545
Actually, someone sent it to me.

00:37:26.545 --> 00:37:28.920
But we were talking a little
earlier, and a lot of people

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.080
are saying that today's
eclipse is going

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.875
to cause life transformation.

00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:33.750
So I wanted to know--

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.710
ANNA KENDRICK: Are people
really saying that?

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.174
MOLLY DECKER: They really are.

00:37:36.174 --> 00:37:37.590
So what are your
thoughts on that?

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:43.629 --> 00:37:45.420
ANNA KENDRICK: For real
true fact, people--

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.170
MOLLY DECKER: For true fact.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:47.850
I read about it.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:51.307 --> 00:37:52.140
ANNA KENDRICK: Wait.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.890
I have so many
follow-up questions.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:59.280
What is going to be life
transforming about it?

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.340
Is this-- genuinely
they think it

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.480
will have an effect like on wow,
we're all under the same sun

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.650
and we're all one?

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.422
Or like in the way,
your horoscope will--

00:38:10.422 --> 00:38:11.880
MOLLY DECKER: They
say whatever was

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.570
starting to shift in
March 2016 is going

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.424
to come to fruition today.

00:38:17.424 --> 00:38:18.090
So I don't know.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.520
You'd have to think
back to March 2016.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.414
There's also some bad spirits.

00:38:22.414 --> 00:38:23.330
ANNA KENDRICK: Oh, OK.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:24.400
So it's nonsense.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.340
MOLLY DECKER: That was
supposed to come out--

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:25.810
ANNA KENDRICK: OK.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.280
No, no, no, no.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.110
I just wanted to make
sure it's nonsense.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:32.760
It's not like somebody had
some kind of a fact-based--

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.660
we're at Google.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.090
Come on.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:36.830
They don't have
time for nonsense.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.830
MOLLY DECKER: All right.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.989
Question over here.

00:38:39.989 --> 00:38:40.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.320
So how do you go about
picking a project?

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.670
And somewhat related,
is there anything--

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:49.050
because you've had a nice kind
of run of different genres--

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.240
is there any project
or film you have not

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.090
done that you're really
excited about possibly

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.014
pursuing in the future?

00:38:56.014 --> 00:38:57.180
ANNA KENDRICK: Well, I did--

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.860
like silly bucket
list, I had always

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.151
wanted to do a Christmas movie.

00:39:00.151 --> 00:39:04.509
And I'm doing one later
in the year, so uh.

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:07.050
As far as picking projects, this
is one of those answers like

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.591
the five-year plan where I feel
like I should have an answer,

00:39:09.591 --> 00:39:12.420
and I don't.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.907
Honestly, you read a
lot of bad scripts.

00:39:15.907 --> 00:39:17.740
There are a lot of bad
scripts in the world.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.948
There are a lot of bad ideas.

00:39:18.948 --> 00:39:23.190
And when there are good
ones, people fight over them.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:27.150
And sometimes it lines up
that there is a great script,

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.760
and I fight harder.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.240
And that's great.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.980
So it always seems
pretty obvious to me

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.070
like what I'm going to choose.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.800
And every now and then, there'll
be something that's good,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.670
but I'm like, I've played this
character three times in a row.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:48.000
And you don't want to then have
that thing of like, ooh, you're

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.470
kind of a one-trick pony.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:54.289
And I'm sure that applies
to a lot of areas of life.

00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:55.830
Maybe it doesn't,
and I'm just trying

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.840
to make you some seem
relevant for you guys.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.610
But I think it's
not like there's

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.500
some kind of like a master
stroke to any of it.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.990
And knowing that, nobody's
had a perfect career ever.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.450
That's another question that
people ask you a lot is like,

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.900
whose career do you
want to emulate?

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.820
And nobody's perfect career.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.900
Everybody's made crappy movies.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.730
And knowing that's kind
of freeing, knowing

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.909
that you're going to
screw up and make mistakes

00:40:19.909 --> 00:40:20.700
is kind of freeing.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.920
Because it just means that
I should choose things

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.340
based on what I think is going
to be personally satisfying.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.430
And then a number of them will
work, and a number of them

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:30.780
will be really terrible.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.142
And that's OK.

00:40:32.142 --> 00:40:34.350
MOLLY DECKER: But do you
ever feel a strong intuition

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.292
that this is going to
be a great movie or this

00:40:36.292 --> 00:40:38.250
is going to be a great
experience going into it

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.360
before you take it?

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.530
ANNA KENDRICK: Yes.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:45.600
And the last movie that I had
that with did not work at all.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.580
Nobody liked it.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.210
So you just don't know.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:52.020
And nobody goes into
any movie, any project,

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.710
any work-related thing
trying to make it bad.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.860
And sometimes, it happens.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.120
And I don't know why.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.950
But again, I think
that's weirdly

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.270
freeing, knowing you
can't control it,

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.550
and you can make all
the right decisions.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:14.211
You just have to try to
experience joy however you can.

00:41:14.211 --> 00:41:15.960
Often for me is watching
the "Sorry" music

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.446
video, because those
dancers are great.

00:41:18.446 --> 00:41:19.820
MOLLY DECKER:
Question over here.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.695
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:41:20.695 --> 00:41:23.460
I loved hearing it earlier about
your affinity for '90s sitcoms

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.710
and wanting to be in one
of the holiday scenes.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.030
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.529
AUDIENCE: And as
Molly will attest,

00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:29.070
I'm kind of a '90s
sitcom aficionado.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.354
So I'm curious, what
is your favorite one,

00:41:31.354 --> 00:41:34.020
or what character would you wish
you have played in one of them?

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.311
ANNA KENDRICK: My favorite
one is the one with Chandler

00:41:36.311 --> 00:41:39.827
in a box, where he's
in the-- and he's--

00:41:39.827 --> 00:41:41.160
you know what I'm talking about.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.243
AUDIENCE: "Friends," yeah.

00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:44.070
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah, where he--

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.920
Chandler kisses
Joey's girlfriend,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.090
and Joey makes him spend
Thanksgiving in a box.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.550
But they're all like
dressed really cute,

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.154
and they have banter.

00:41:56.154 --> 00:41:57.820
And we're all pretending
it's not insane

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.750
that you put your
friend in a box.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.100
So that's my dream.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.610
And also, Thanksgiving
episodes of like--

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.610
these aren't '90s, but
"Community" and "Brooklyn

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.901
Nine-Nine," I love that we're
just suspending disbelief

00:42:10.901 --> 00:42:14.100
that you spend your
Thanksgiving with your work

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:18.444
colleagues and your community
college and a group of friends,

00:42:18.444 --> 00:42:20.610
and none of you are going
home to see your families.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:22.170
We're all just fine with that.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.220
AUDIENCE: The magic of
the movies, of course.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.382
ANNA KENDRICK: Exactly.

00:42:24.382 --> 00:42:25.410
Exactly.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.124
I'm trying to get
friends like that.

00:42:27.124 --> 00:42:29.640
You guys wanna have
Thanksgiving together?

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.140
Hi.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:30.681
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:32.949
I was a big fan of
"The Last Five Years."

00:42:32.949 --> 00:42:33.990
ANNA KENDRICK: Thank you.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.520
AUDIENCE: And I was wondering
if you could talk a little bit

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.890
about making that movie
and your inspiration

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.240
for the role of Cathy.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.220
ANNA KENDRICK: That was a close
runner-up for my favorite film

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.310
set.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.980
I was going to maybe say
it earlier, but I thought,

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.750
there'll be like one person--

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.940
and two.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.430
And I loved-- that
was so much fun.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:57.290
We had no time and no
money, and we sang a lot--

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.710
we sang as much
live as we could.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:05.195
Yeah, that was such a dream,
because my favorite musical

00:43:05.195 --> 00:43:07.460
is "Parade," by
Jason Robert Brown.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.010
And I had somehow--

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:16.000
like cosmically, I had never
heard "The Last Five Years"

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.250
So they sent me this script,
and I read the script

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.607
without knowing the music.

00:43:20.607 --> 00:43:22.190
And they had the
lyrics, and they just

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:23.870
had like stage direction
and the lyrics.

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:25.760
And I was weeping reading it.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.890
And then the next
morning, I woke up

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.630
and listened to the
soundtrack as I read along,

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.300
and I was just beside myself.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.630
So I think it was meant
to happen that way.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.345
Otherwise, A, I'm one
of those people where

00:43:37.345 --> 00:43:39.470
I would have-- it would
have been impossible for me

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.570
to not sing it in
the exact intonation

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.340
as the original cast
album, like "Rent."

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.105
Is like-- nobody?

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:53.860
I am grateful that I didn't
have to overcome getting

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.830
that voice out of my head.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:00.190
And I don't know.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.400
I think I had some
personal experience

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.770
that I was drawing
on for that role

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:11.800
and just being able to
work with Jason Robert

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.900
Brown and his amazing wife,
who was our music director, who

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.480
likes to make the joke that the
only person in the world who

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.646
thinks that "The Last Five
Years" has a happy ending

00:44:21.646 --> 00:44:24.890
is his new wife.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.920
OK, wrong crowd.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.180
That's fine.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.250
I thought it was funny.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.160
And yeah, I just couldn't
have had a better experience

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.200
than that.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.357
And I think if we'd
had a little more time,

00:44:38.357 --> 00:44:40.190
we could have gotten a
little more coverage.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.280
Some of those
angles I'm like, why

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.446
are we holding this so long?

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:45.460
Oh, right, it's because we
didn't shoot anything else.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.172
But sometimes, movies
are held together

00:44:48.172 --> 00:44:49.630
with love and duct
tape, and that's

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.250
what makes them really special.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.420
So I'm glad you liked it.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.230
Thank you so much.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.893
ANNA KENDRICK: That means a lot.

00:44:54.893 --> 00:44:57.671
MOLLY DECKER: I think we
have time for one more.

00:44:57.671 --> 00:44:59.420
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
going to apologize,

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.044
because if I had known I was the
last person asking a question,

00:45:02.044 --> 00:45:04.300
I would have come up with
something more serious.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.344
ANNA KENDRICK: This is exciting.

00:45:06.344 --> 00:45:08.260
AUDIENCE: So a number
of years ago on Twitter,

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.426
you had a back and forth
between yourself and Dwayne

00:45:10.426 --> 00:45:13.815
"The Rock" Johnson about
making a movie called

00:45:13.815 --> 00:45:14.620
"Rock And Pebble."

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.250
ANNA KENDRICK: Yeah, "The
Rock and the Pebble."

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.900
I'm the pebble.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.890
Get it?

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:18.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.419
Because I'm small.

00:45:20.419 --> 00:45:22.460
AUDIENCE: So now, if you
were to make this movie,

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.376
what would the movie--

00:45:23.376 --> 00:45:26.290
what would be the movie's theme
and what would it be about?

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.340
ANNA KENDRICK: You
guys are smart people,

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.720
so we could come up with this.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.730
We could storyboard this right
now and pitch it to The Rock.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.570
I don't know.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:39.550
I feel like he really excels
in like a buddy cop comedy

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.180
kind of thing.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:47.710
So I think just a kind
of classic buddy comedy,

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.060
like on a mission.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.815
And I'm kind of useless
the entire time,

00:45:52.815 --> 00:45:53.940
and he has to save the day.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.315
But then like
right at the end, I

00:45:55.315 --> 00:45:58.480
do something
[INTENTIONALLY MUMBLES]..

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.040
Something like, oh, no,
this tiny crawl space.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.400
And I'm like, this is my moment.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.820
So I think, yeah, it'd
be the first buddy cop

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.944
comedy to end with a high-stakes
crawl space sequence.

00:46:14.944 --> 00:46:16.360
AUDIENCE: So when's
it coming out?

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.582
I'd like to get tickets now.

00:46:18.582 --> 00:46:20.290
ANNA KENDRICK: Whenever
"Game of Thrones"

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.260
is finished, so
like 2020, I guess.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.407
Because we're not trying
to compete with that.

00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:26.240
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:26.960
ANNA KENDRICK: Thank you.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.320
MOLLY DECKER: It's amazing.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:27.670
All right, guys.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.330
Let's thank Anna for
coming to Google today.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:30.163
ANNA KENDRICK: Anna.

00:46:30.163 --> 00:46:32.680
