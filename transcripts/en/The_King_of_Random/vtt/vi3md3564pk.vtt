00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.280
Hey guys, I'm Nate.
Welcome back to the workshop where today

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.280
We're gonna be trying once again to make our copper radioactive gear

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.560
This is something that has been tried a couple of times before on the channel to mixed results

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.400
so today we're gonna try adding a couple of new techniques to see if we can finally get a nice clean pour of our gear

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.119
We've got our styro-slicer' some pink rigid insulation foam and our gear shaped template

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.108
So let's see if we can cut out a new gear and try and get that to cast

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109
first Let's cut one of our gears out of our template

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.340
The paper doesn't get cut by the wire the wire isn't hot enough to burn its way through

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.559
Which lets the paper act as a guide as I go around the foam it won't cut through the paper

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.889
So I can just push it right up against there and get a nice clean

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.320
Cut that's also why most of the time if I'm ever using the foam core board

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.360
I don't use the hot wire cutter

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.100
It won't get through the foam core because foam core has paper, sandwiching the foam in between it

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.540
We've got our gear all cut out of the foam

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.980
Let's peel off our paper, and then we can do a little bit of cleanup work this foam actually sands pretty

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.250
Well if you use a light grit sandpaper got here some 600 grit sandpaper

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.779
Which should do an okay job of smoothing it out without really taking too much of it down

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.550
Our foam gear has been cut and clean and so we would be ready to start putting it into the sand and casting it but

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.360
We've had some problems with that in the past

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.300
The molten copper is so dense that it has a tendency to break the sand apart

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.729
And that's what led to

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.848
the holes in this gear being full

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.030
The little sand that was sticking up through those holes broke off and the molten copper flowed in and it really didn't get a very

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.220
Nice clean cast as you can see

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.659
So we want to try and keep that from happening this time with our gear and so what we're going to do is

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.709
Put a rigid shell around

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:12.149
The gear that will then be surrounded by the sand and for that shell we're going to be using this wall texture

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.840
It's a plaster like substance that is normally painted onto walls to make it so they aren't just flat and smooth and boring I guess

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.819
but what we're gonna try and do is thin this down to a sort of runny paste and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.060
Coat over this gear in a couple of layers. We'll do a layer

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.869
We'll let it dry for 12 to 24 hours, and then we'll do a second layer

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.819
And that should give us a pretty nice rigid shell that probably wouldn't be strong enough by itself

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.979
But when we surround that shell with the sand, I'm hoping we'll have a nice smooth

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.149
Shell that will hold itself in shape even as we pour in the molten copper

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.030
Now unlike plaster of Paris this stuff just has water mixed into it and isn't chemically

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.269
Activated by the water it dries out rather than curing

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.860
As a result it may not be quite as strong as plaster of Paris

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.479
But it dries out much faster plaster of Paris tends to hold the water in the plaster

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.310
Sometimes for days and sometimes the only way to get rid of all of the water is to heat it up a lot

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.759
This should just dry in room-temperature air as you can see this is now fairly runny about the consistency of paint

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.020
It's gonna shake it back and forth a little bit to try and get some of the bubbles out of it

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.560
And I'm not putting it in the vacuum chamber

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.610
one, because this bowl doesn't fit in the vacuum chamber and two, when stuff with this consistency starts to bubble it tends to splash a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.499
Lot it would really get the inside of the vacuum chamber messy, so I'm just gonna bounce it back and forth

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.969
Hopefully, that's removed a bunch of the bubbles now

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.600
Here's the plan we're gonna take the gear and we do still want it to be open on one side

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.089
We're going to cast this just by pouring copper out of our crucible directly into the mold

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.089
Which means one side of it shouldn't have any shell on it.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.679
But we do want to make sure that the shell gets all the way up to the edges on all the other sides

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.089
So what we'll try doing is dip the gear down in not covering one side of it, and then we'll flip it upside down

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.690
Onto a piece of foil over this block of foam

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.699
It's pretty good. Just to make sure I've got all the little gaps

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.739
I'm gonna get a little bamboo skewer and use that to touch up some spots like where my fingers were

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.309
Our gear now has a nice coating all over it and I think I've really managed to get it onto

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.410
every square inch of that surface

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.009
Let's give this a little while to dry come back and add another layer.

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.069
Our gear has now had a chance to dry for about 24 hours

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.919
And the shell that we put on to it is nice and rigid

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.400
Feeling so it's time to go back and add a second layer this time

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.310
We're gonna be using the same stuff, but we're not gonna thin it out with water

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.450
We'll take a paintbrush dip it in and paint it all over every exposed surface directly. I'm actually kind of surprised at how little

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.769
Cracking there was there's tiny little spots where it started to break apart

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.680
But I actually suspected that we would get more than that.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.789
All right our gear is all covered in a new layer of plaster

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.669
you can see all the brush marks everywhere, but those shouldn't matter because

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.869
Everything that you can see right now is just gonna be in contact with the sand itself the gear remember is the foam?

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.899
Inside of this plaster like material, and that's just gonna get melted away when we pour the molten copper onto it.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.610
Let's let this dry for another 24 hours

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.479
And then we should be ready to encase it in the sand and pour our copper

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.419
The coating all around our gear has had plenty of time to dry and we do have a little bit of cracking forming on it

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.198
But I don't think that's gonna be a problem because remember this isn't supposed to be a perfect mold

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.419
It's basically just supposed to keep the sand

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.449
Away from the foam and away from the copper as we pour that in so it doesn't break off and float on the molten copper

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.859
So I'm still hoping this will work the plan now is we'll try and peel the foil off

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.720
Put it at the bottom of our little box

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.810
And then we'll fill

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.289
Compacted sand or round it at that point,

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.939
We should be able to flip it over and have the exposed foam on the top and we can pour our molten copper

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.039
directly into that.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.080
With the mold nice and squished in with the compacted sand inside this box it's time to fire up the foundry and start melting our copper.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.409
Ooooh that looks nice, I like that

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.390
Ooooh that looks good.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.490
Oh, bubbling strangely now.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.500
The surface is getting all...

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.400
warped, hopefully that doesn't mean too much as bad is happening at the bottom.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.600
That's cool how you can see the sand, drying out around it.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.800
The temperature at which copper is

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:37.079
Molten, will actually make it fuse onto this steel pan almost every time so we can't use the muffin tin to cast the copper

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.080
That's why we poured it into the sand.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.709
Our pour looks like it worked really well,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.030
It poured in flowed into all of the gaps nicely destroying all of the foam

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.600
And it doesn't look like any of the sand broke off, and floated up

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.489
So I think that means that the shell we had around it did a good job of holding the sand where it was supposed to be.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.340
Now we need to take this out of the sand and see how it's looking. I hope that shell comes off nicely

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.320
I think what I'll do is try and lift the whole thing out shell and metal all together and just

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.410
Put it in some water

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.839
And it might make the shell sort of break apart because the shell should still be super hot

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.209
Because the copper is still super hot this looks like the only spot where it spilled over a little bit

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:31.020
Just kind of weird it went in all flat, and then these bubbles happened afterwards so that might be part of the copper cooling process

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:39.299
I'll see if I can dig this out. The shell is breaking apart, that's all right my shells breaking apart a lot. That's still all right

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.600
Infact, my shell is barely...

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.740
It's only there in the middle, but let's just see what happens if we throw this into the water. Hopefully nothing terrible

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.260
Doesn't look like anything terrible happened, there we go

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.880
Yeah

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.420
That shell after being hit with all that steam, I think it just kind of falls to pieces

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:16.339
An interesting sort of iridescent effect going on on the surface of the copper here

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:19.698
I don't know if that is just from the copper itself if that's from some contaminants

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:24.678
That was in our crucible if that's from the shell that was made, but it looks pretty cool

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:27.918
This worked out pretty well that drywall

00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:32.869
texturing paste did a very good job of creating a barrier between the copper and the sand and

00:09:32.969 --> 00:09:38.100
we just had one little spill over point, that was on top, that had nothing to do with the sand, getting into the mold,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.300
it just... I added just a tiniest bit too much copper,

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:45.199
But overall this works really well, very happy with how it turned out

00:09:45.469 --> 00:09:50.100
Tune in for our next video where we'll clean up this copper gear, and hopefully make and just a nice, shiny

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.998
almost mirrored surface in places that should look awesome.
