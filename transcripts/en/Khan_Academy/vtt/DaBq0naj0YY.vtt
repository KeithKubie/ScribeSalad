00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:03.299
- [Instructor] So let's say
that I am a drug company

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.687
and I have come up with
a medicine that I think

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:09.047
will help folks with
diabetes, and in particular,

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:13.802
I think it will help reduce
their hemoglobin A1c levels,

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:16.178
and for those of you who aren't familiar

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:18.635
with what hemoglobin
A1c is, I encourage you,

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:20.745
we have a video on that on Khan Academy,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.240
but the general idea is if
you have high blood sugar

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.392
over roughly a three-month period of time,

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:30.559
high blood sugar, and I can
say high average blood sugar,

00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:35.630
you're going to have a high
A1c, a high hemoglobin A1c level

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:40.588
and if you have a low average blood sugar

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:42.478
over roughly a three-month
time, you're going

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:45.061
to have a lower hemoglobin A1c.

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:49.652
So if taking the pill
seems to lower folks'

00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:53.207
A1c levels more than is likely to happen

00:00:53.207 --> 00:00:56.034
due to randomly or due to other variables,

00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:57.742
well then that means that your new pill

00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:02.645
might be effective at
controlling folks' diabetes.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:06.522
So in this situation, when
we're constructing an experiment

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:09.970
to test this, we would
say that whether or not

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.483
you are taking the pill, this
is the explanatory variable.

00:01:14.483 --> 00:01:18.650
Explanatory variable, and the
thing that it is affecting,

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.663
the thing that you're
hoping has some response,

00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:25.806
in this case the A1c
levels are your indicator

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:28.228
of whether it is help
controlling the blood sugar,

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:31.145
we call that the response variable.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.042
That right over there is
the response variable.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:43.847
So how are we actually going
to conduct this experiment?

00:01:43.847 --> 00:01:47.313
Well let's say that we
have a group of folks,

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:51.419
let's say that we have been
given a group of 100 folks

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.333
who need to control their diabetes.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:58.500
So 100 people here who need
to control their diabetes,

00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:03.471
and we say, "Alright, well
let's take half of this group

00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.862
"and put them into, I guess
you could say a treatment group

00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:10.609
"and another half and put
them into a control group

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.802
"and see if the treatment
group, the one that actually

00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:16.969
"gets my pill is going to
improve their A1c levels in a way

00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:21.854
"that seems like it would
not be just random chance."

00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:26.129
So let's do that, so we're
going to have a control group,

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.962
so this is my control
group, control, and this

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:36.432
is the treatment group,
this is the treatment group.

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:43.263
And you might say, "Okay,
we'll just give these folks,

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.773
"the treatment group the
pill and then we won't give

00:02:45.773 --> 00:02:49.600
"the pill that I created
to the control group."

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.005
But that might introduce
a psychological aspect

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:56.705
that maybe the benefit of the
pill is just people feeling,

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.210
"Hey I'm taking something
that'll control my diabetes,"

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.760
maybe that psychologically
affects their blood sugar

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.484
in some way and this is actually possible,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.279
maybe it makes them act
healthier in certain ways,

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:09.342
maybe that makes them act
unhealthier in certain ways

00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:11.478
'cause they're like, "Oh
I have a pill to control

00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:14.087
"my diabetes, my blood sugar, I can go eat

00:03:14.087 --> 00:03:16.337
"more sweets now and it'll control it."

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:19.756
And so to avoid that, in
order for just the very fact

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:22.264
that someone says, "Hey I
think I'm taking a medicine,

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:24.436
"I might behave in a
different way or it might even

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:28.080
"psychologically affect
my body in a certain way,"

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.270
what we wanna do is
give both groups a pill,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.800
and we wanna do it in a
way that neither group

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.553
knows which pill they're getting.

00:03:36.553 --> 00:03:39.683
So what we would do here
is we would give this group

00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:42.683
a placebo, a placebo, and this group

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:49.150
would actually get the
medicine, the medicine,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.427
but those pills should look
the same, and people should

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:56.026
not know which group they
are in and that is a,

00:03:56.026 --> 00:04:00.193
when we do that, that is a
blind experiment, experiment.

00:04:02.301 --> 00:04:05.879
Now you might have heard about
double-blind experiments.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.390
Well that would be the case
where not only do people

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.317
not know which group
they're in, but even their

00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:15.470
physician or the person who's
administering the experiment,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.841
they don't know which one they're giving,

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.739
they don't know if
they're giving the placebo

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.144
or the actual medicine to the group.

00:04:23.144 --> 00:04:24.720
So let's say we wanna do that.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.071
So we could do double,
double-blind experiment,

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:30.699
so even the person giving the pill

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.471
doesn't know which pill they're giving.

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.307
And you might say, "Well
why is that important?"

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:38.988
Well if the physician knows,
or the person administering

00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:42.230
or interfacing with the
patient, they might give a tell

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.372
somehow, they might not
put as much emphasis

00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:47.779
on the importance of taking
the pill if it's a placebo,

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.820
they might by accident give
away some type of information.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.319
So to avoid that type of thing happening,

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.288
you could do a double-blind,
and there's even,

00:04:57.288 --> 00:04:59.468
some people talk about a
triple-blind experiment

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:01.076
where even the people analyzing the data

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:03.511
don't know which group
was the control group

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.178
and which group was the treatment group,

00:05:05.178 --> 00:05:09.281
and once again, that's
another way to avoid bias.

00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:11.177
So now that we've kinda
figured out, we have a control

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:14.303
group, we have a treatment
group, we're using A1c

00:05:14.303 --> 00:05:17.433
as our response variable, so
we would wanna measure folks'

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:22.188
A1c levels, their hemoglobin
A1c levels before they get

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.479
either the placebo or the medicine

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.770
and then maybe after three months,

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.520
we would measure their A1c after,

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.873
but the next question is, how
do you divvy these 100 people

00:05:32.873 --> 00:05:36.379
up into these two groups,
and you might say,

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.035
"Well I would wanna do it
randomly," and you would be right

00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:40.486
'cause if you didn't do
it randomly, if you put

00:05:40.486 --> 00:05:42.137
all the men here and all the women here,

00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:46.242
well that might, first of
all, sex might explain it

00:05:46.242 --> 00:05:49.992
or behavior of men versus
women might explain

00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:54.893
the differences or the
non-differences you see

00:05:54.893 --> 00:05:58.197
in A1c level, if you get
a lot of people of one age

00:05:58.197 --> 00:06:00.862
or one part of the country
or one type of dietary habit,

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:04.152
you don't want that, so in order to avoid

00:06:04.152 --> 00:06:08.020
having an imbalance of some
of those lurking variables,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.978
you would want to randomly
sample and we've done multiple

00:06:10.978 --> 00:06:14.478
videos already on ways to randomly sample,

00:06:15.897 --> 00:06:17.851
so you're going to randomly sample

00:06:17.851 --> 00:06:20.069
and put people into either groups.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.748
And a very simple way of
doing that, you could give

00:06:23.748 --> 00:06:25.893
everyone here a number from one to 100,

00:06:25.893 --> 00:06:29.611
use a random number generator to do that

00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:33.303
and then, or you could use
a random number generator,

00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:35.738
pick 50 names to put in the control group

00:06:35.738 --> 00:06:37.509
or 50 names to put in the treatment group

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.180
and then everyone else gets
put in the other group.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.940
Now, to avoid a situation,
just randomly by doing

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.482
a random sample, you might
have a situation where

00:06:47.482 --> 00:06:50.125
there's some probability
that you disproportionately

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:53.483
have more men in one group or
more women in another group

00:06:53.483 --> 00:06:55.793
and to avoid that, you
could do really a version

00:06:55.793 --> 00:06:57.627
of stratified sampling
that we've talked about

00:06:57.627 --> 00:07:00.891
in other videos, which is
you could do what's called

00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:03.211
a block design for your random assignment

00:07:03.211 --> 00:07:07.011
where you actually split
everyone into men and women

00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:08.835
and it might be 50-50 or it might even be

00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:13.002
just randomly here you got
60 women, 60 women and 40 men

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:19.994
and what you do here is you
say, "Okay let's randomly

00:07:19.994 --> 00:07:22.798
"take 30 of these women and
put 'em in the control group

00:07:22.798 --> 00:07:25.122
"and 30 of the women and put
'em in the treatment group

00:07:25.122 --> 00:07:28.091
"and let's put randomly 20 of
the men in the control group

00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:29.990
"and 20 of the men in the treatment group"

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.599
and that way someone's sex is less likely

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:37.766
to introduce bias into
what actually happens here,

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:43.680
so once again, doing this
is called a block design,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.283
really a version of stratified sampling.

00:07:46.283 --> 00:07:49.350
Block design, and there might
be other lurking variables

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.635
that you wanna make sure
doesn't just show up here

00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:53.889
randomly and so you might want,

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:57.306
there's other ways of randomly assigning.

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:02.616
Now once you do this, you
see what was a change in A1c.

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:06.383
If you see that, hey, the change in A1c,

00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:09.309
one if you see there's no
difference in A1c levels

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:10.586
between these two groups, and you're like,

00:08:10.586 --> 00:08:13.524
"Hey, there's a good probability
that my pill does nothing"

00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:15.919
and once again it's all
about probabilities,

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:17.982
there's some chance
that you're just unlucky

00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:19.562
and it might be a very
small chance and that's why

00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:21.227
you wanna do this with
a good number of people

00:08:21.227 --> 00:08:23.839
and as we forward our
statistics understandings,

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:26.913
we will better understand
at what threshold levels

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:28.845
do we think the probability
is high or low enough

00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:32.124
for us to really feel
good about our findings.

00:08:32.124 --> 00:08:35.874
But let's say that you
do see an improvement,

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.695
you need to think about,
is that improvement,

00:08:40.695 --> 00:08:43.104
could that have happened
due to random chance

00:08:43.104 --> 00:08:45.100
or is it very unlikely that that happened

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.945
due purely to random chance,
and if it was very unlikely

00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:50.802
that it happened due
purely to random chance,

00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:52.383
then you would feel pretty good,

00:08:52.383 --> 00:08:53.777
and other people when
you publish the results,

00:08:53.777 --> 00:08:56.495
would feel pretty good
about your medicine.

00:08:56.495 --> 00:09:00.196
Now, even then, science is not done.

00:09:00.196 --> 00:09:02.086
No one will say that they are 100% sure

00:09:02.086 --> 00:09:04.825
that your medicine is good,
there still might have been

00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:06.554
some lurking variables that we
did not, that our experiment

00:09:06.554 --> 00:09:10.387
did not properly adjust
for, that just when we

00:09:12.847 --> 00:09:14.833
even did this block design, we might

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:17.921
have disproportionately
gotten randomly older people

00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:19.701
in one of the groups
or the other or people

00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:22.220
from one part of the country
in one group or another

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.165
so there's always things to think about

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:25.638
and the most important
thing to think about,

00:09:25.638 --> 00:09:28.701
even if you did this as good as you could,

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.943
you still, some random
chance might have given you

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:36.412
a false positive, you got
good results even though

00:09:36.412 --> 00:09:39.088
it was random, or a false
negative, you got bad results

00:09:39.088 --> 00:09:42.005
even though it was actually random.

00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:46.703
And so a very important
idea in experiments

00:09:46.703 --> 00:09:50.458
and this is in science in
general is that this experiment,

00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:54.208
you should document it
well and it should be,

00:09:57.963 --> 00:10:00.370
the process of replication,
other people should

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.006
be able to replicate this experiment

00:10:03.006 --> 00:10:05.807
and hopefully get consistent results

00:10:05.807 --> 00:10:07.125
so it's not just about the results,

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:10.167
it's your experiment
design, other people should,

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:13.426
it should be an experiment
that other people could

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:16.978
and should replicate to reinforce the idea

00:10:16.978 --> 00:10:19.935
that your results are actually true

00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:21.731
and not just random or just due to some

00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:25.398
bad administration of
the actual experiment.
