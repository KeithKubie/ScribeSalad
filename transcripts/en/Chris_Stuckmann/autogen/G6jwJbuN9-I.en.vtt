really good on paper and then they just

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
really good on paper and then they just
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.940
really good on paper and then they just

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
threw it at a wall and see where it
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.740
threw it at a wall and see where it
splattered and that's kind of how they

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
splattered and that's kind of how they
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.360
