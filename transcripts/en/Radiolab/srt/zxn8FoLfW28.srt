1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,510
I don't really know where Tim is,

2
00:00:01,511 --> 00:00:05,370
so we're just going to try am
Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,790
Radiolab and today we're talking
about truth and facts. Yup.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,120
Facts of the matter. So recently
our producer, Pat Walters and I,

5
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:16,920
we were trying to get in touch with
a guy, Tim criter. Hello Tim? Nope,

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,240
not there. I think if we just shout
very loud, very low up the window.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,020
We wanted to talk to Tim because Tim is
not only is he a wonderful writer and

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,150
before that a cartoonist,
he has this essay, uh,

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,130
which kind of gets to the heart of a
very different kind of truth and we've

10
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,600
tackled so far and that is,

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,550
can you truly know somebody even after
everything you thought you knew turns out

12
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:43,070
to be wrong. Hello, Tim? Yes. Oh,

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,180
there you are. You sound great too. Oh,

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,240
we should say this is
a story not about Tim,

15
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:52,260
but about his friend who he named Skelly,
just to protect his identity. Right?

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,940
So let's, let's try,
if it's okay with you,

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,340
if we could maybe just talk about Skelly
as if we were just kind of hanging out

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,190
at a bar, even though you're
in a tiny booth on the other

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,980
beer in this tiny room, that
would be easier. Tell us uh,

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,690
how you met this guy. Um, he was

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,410
part of a group of friends I made when
I was working at post-collegiate job,

22
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:20,250
going door to door for
the environment, um,

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,970
to knock on doors with clipboards
and get people to donate.

24
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,220
Like vacuum salesman knock
knock kind of thing. Yeah,

25
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:31,221
you're dropped off by a van in a suburban
neighborhood and I can still faintly

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,430
feel the dread of, of having to
knock on your first door the night,

27
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:39,150
which was always the worst. But you
know like, like being in the army,

28
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,100
it was a bonding experience,

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,670
especially because they're knocking on
the doorstep. It's just really, you know,

30
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,850
a few hours a day. Then there is
going out to the bars afterwards,

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,430
which became as much a part of the
job for us as, as anything else.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
And one of those nights
out drinking with friends.

33
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:59,730
He got to talking with Skelly. What'd he
look like, by the way? You know, I, I,

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,130
he forbade me ever to draw him.

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,610
I used to put my friends in my
cartoons all the time and um,

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,000
I did that once to him and he
interdicted me from doing that again.

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,930
So you don't want to draw him on the
radio though. You know, he's about to, uh,

38
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,270
he had this great mop of
curly hair glasses that were
literally held together by

39
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:22,830
duct tape. The overall effect
was warmth and intelligence.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,490
But from the beginning he says
basic facts about this guy.

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
What a little hard to pin down.

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,540
It wasn't really clear at first whether
he belonged to our camp on the hippie

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,260
young people or whether he
was someone slightly older.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,470
His first life hadn't worked
out. Um, as it turned out,

45
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:48,471
he was the ladder and he had been a
practicing lawyer and he had quit being a

46
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,480
lawyer for reasons that
remain unknown to me.

47
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,100
I mean, I'm not sure it was
entirely voluntary quitting.

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,680
But Tim says at the time he liked
the guy. Yeah. For one thing,

49
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,380
women seem to like him. They
were charmed by him right away.

50
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,320
All my girlfriends always liked
him. And beyond that, you know,

51
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,730
he and I were two of the
readers in the group. Uh,

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,720
we each always had a book with us.

53
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,260
So they began to swap books and
as they got to be good friends,

54
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,320
Skelly even showed him his writing. I
still have it somewhere in Longhand,

55
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,690
even beautiful long hand.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,560
He was clearly a sort of kindred spirit.

57
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,870
But then some questions popped up one day,

58
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,580
Skelly told him that he had written a
novel and that it had been accepted for

59
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,730
publication. Tim was like,
wow, I was excited for him.

60
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,690
You probably thought you got published.
That's amazing. I want to do that. Yeah.

61
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,300
So, you know, I kept bugging
him about, well, when's,

62
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:46,690
when's your book coming out? Skelly would
say, well, you know, in a few months,

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,000
and then a few months would
pass. And Scotty would say, well,

64
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,360
they just pushed it back.
It's coming. And you know,

65
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,360
we had a close little group of
friends and like all people on Earth,

66
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,250
we talked about each other
behind each other's backs.

67
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:01,180
And it may be that someone else sort of
clued me in like, Tim, there's no block

68
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:03,330
[inaudible].

69
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,180
I mean, maybe he wrote a book,
but it's not being published.

70
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,820
Initially Tim thought, well, there's
probably some truth to it, you know,

71
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,750
even if the truth was only the kind
of truth that's contained in dreams.

72
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,390
But then there were other stories.

73
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,260
One of his stories was about having been
married briefly in France and having a

74
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,440
daughter over there and there was a time,

75
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,360
at least one time when he was on vacation
from the environmental canvas and he

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,550
supposedly,

77
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,430
it was going to be in France visiting
his daughter who lived with her, uh,

78
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,930
maternal grandparents there.

79
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,940
And our boss saw him walking on Charles
Street in Baltimore during that time.

80
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:46,820
Obviously he was not in France
and they were never like, ah,

81
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,800
dude, someone saw you in Baltimore
where you really in France? No,

82
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,580
we didn't say that. And
you know, I, I've met,

83
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,320
I mean I've spent,

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,880
I've logged a lot of time hanging out in
bars and you do meet pathological liars

85
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,990
in that line of work.
Um, and, and you know,

86
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:10,010
I'm always duly impressed by their
stories when I first hear them until they

87
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,490
pile up and they've, they're always
able to one up your story, you know,

88
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:15,220
they've always met someone
more famous than you,

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,150
something more tragic has
always happened to them.

90
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,390
And then they start to
seem creepy and repellent.

91
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,520
And all I can say is he
didn't feel that way.

92
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,410
He just seemed like a really good guy
who happened to lie more than most

93
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,060
[inaudible].

94
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,240
In any case, after they
left the canvasing job,

95
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,360
they both stayed in Baltimore
and the state close.

96
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,420
We frequently ended up crashing
on the same floors together,

97
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,130
closed down the bars together every
night they'd take road trips together,

98
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:54,040
blasting classic rock.
He loved LED's up on.

99
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,730
And after a while those stories,

100
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,400
like I've published a novel or
I have a daughter in France,

101
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:03,800
we didn't hear that stuff anymore.

102
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,810
Our theory is that he did not expect that
we would end up being friends for the

103
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,760
next 20 years and he would
have to maintain these stories.

104
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,230
And you know,

105
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:19,910
we liked the guy so much that would have
been unthinkably mean spirited to bring

106
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,060
this stuff up. So we just sort
of pretended we'd never heard it.

107
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,900
And he says they kept themselves from
asking too many questions like, yeah,

108
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,690
they knew he had a job at the
opera house, you know, fundraising.

109
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,010
But he was always broke, always
hitting them up for money. And he was,

110
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,030
he was,

111
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,760
they wonder why was he
always house-sitting and
spending the night at the

112
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:41,390
library. You just never
knew. You did have to.

113
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,980
You did have to triangulate from, from
the few facts available and you know,

114
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:48,770
in a way it was fun.

115
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,240
It was fun to speculate about and fun to
tease him about. Only behind his back.

116
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,740
Of course, for example,

117
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:58,220
Tim told us about one time he and his
friend nick were up at their cabin near

118
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,160
the Chesapeake Bay, which is
about an hour outside Baltimore.

119
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,680
And we had had a lovely
afternoon eating oysters,

120
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,360
drinking beers overlooking the bay.

121
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,070
And we're supposed to drive to a
train station about 20 minutes,

122
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,530
half an hour away to pick Skelly up. Uh,

123
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,560
he's gonna take the train up there
and join us and so break away from our

124
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,770
pleasant setup on the water and we'd
drive down to the train station to pick

125
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,390
them up. The train comes and
goes, he's not on it. Uh,

126
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,020
and we're both a little peeved at having
been torn away from our afternoon to

127
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:34,090
come get him only to be stood
up at the train station. So my,

128
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,250
my friend checks his cell phone
to see if maybe there's a message.

129
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:41,930
And indeed there is and the
message goes like this, hey guys,

130
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:45,320
this is Skelly. Um, I missed
the train. First of all,

131
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,940
there's the background noises of what
is clearly a bar glasses clinking the TV

132
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:54,540
on unmistakably the mount
royal tavern, a alone oil.

133
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,750
We just knew. And he says, so I'm,

134
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,550
I'm really sorry about this,

135
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,670
but I was in a meeting that ran a
little longer than I expected and

136
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,970
I tried to catch it, but I was
like three minutes too late,

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,130
but I checked and there's
another train seven 20,

138
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,860
it gets in seven 45 we'll
definitely be on that one.

139
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,060
So hopefully you all get this message
and be there to meet me. Uh, okay. Again,

140
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,860
sorry about that. Hope I'll see you soon.

141
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,780
And then there's 30 or 45 seconds of him
fumbling to figure out how to hang up

142
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:29,060
this borrowed cell phone throughout,

143
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:32,150
which we can hear the sounds of
the bar clearly in the background.

144
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,570
And I listened to this message and I just
smiled and shook my head and handed it

145
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,250
speechless. Lee to my friend. Nick,
do you give any sense of what's,

146
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,050
when you're not being told something,

147
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:48,320
do you have any feeling for what you're
not being told or you just think it's

148
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:52,920
just silly details? No,
you know, I don't, it was,

149
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,760
he was just a very guy

150
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,883
[inaudible].

151
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,200
Um, and we got the sense that, I
mean he told me once, you know,

152
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,180
the less people know about
you, the better off you are.

153
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,013
[inaudible]

154
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:08,411
I mean,

155
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:11,290
we weren't supposed to know for a long
time that he lived at home with his

156
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:15,550
mother. Um, you know,
which is not unheard of,

157
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:17,590
but an embarrassing thing
when you're a grown man.

158
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,100
And it became really obvious that he did,

159
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:24,010
cause if you called his house
sometime you got his mother. Um,

160
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,340
and he had a complex
cover story about how, oh,

161
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:29,650
well if the phone rang
enough times at his house,

162
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:33,160
it was forwarded to his mother's
to pick up, which, you know,

163
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,480
I had never heard of that.

164
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,180
I didn't know the phone company
and offered that service. So,

165
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,590
you know, we knew the deal,

166
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,440
but we weren't going to challenge him
on it because it's so clearly with

167
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,770
something he was embarrassed
about and eager to conceal.

168
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:49,750
[inaudible]

169
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,220
I think he probably saw himself and was
worried that others would see him as,

170
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:58,390
as you know, marginal or
pathetic or loser. And you know,

171
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:02,580
we didn't see him that
way. We love the guy.

172
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,820
It was just one of us, you know,

173
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,740
there are conditions that
come with every friendship.

174
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:14,880
People are weird and most of the people
who are really worth being friends with

175
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,630
are weird.

176
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,520
And you learn to accept that there are
unspoken rules in certain friendships.

177
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,410
[inaudible]

178
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,170
until the day comes when the
rules don't apply anymore.

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,310
[inaudible]

180
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,890
fast forward a few years,
Tim has moved to New York.

181
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,140
Skelly still is in Baltimore with his,

182
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,870
well his mother had died but he
was living in the same house.

183
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,330
I still saw him pretty often.

184
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:40,270
He'd take the train up and we get
some beers and some chicken wings.

185
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,780
And one day I got a phone call from a
friend of mine and he sounded very badly

186
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,070
shaken.

187
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,220
Tim's friends said that he'd been worried
about Skelly cause he hadn't heard

188
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,210
from him for a while.

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,030
And then he called work and it turned
out he hadn't been there and he knew

190
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:59,080
something was wrong. So he
went to his house. And um,

191
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,290
you know, I think he was able to get
the door open enough to see inside.

192
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,870
And uh, he called in him
and he heard nothing.

193
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:12,370
And he forced his way in and
found him lying on the floor dead.

194
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,160
The coroner ruled that that
death was drug related.

195
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,170
So I went back to
Baltimore right away, um,

196
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,450
because I assumed there would be
a, a memorial service and so on.

197
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,060
And for a couple of days,

198
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,710
nothing happened at all because
he had kept his life so thoroughly

199
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:41,270
compartmentalized that no one knew
how to get in touch with his family.

200
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,720
Although at the last minute,
who, the day before his funeral,

201
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:47,590
we got in touch with his extended family
and they were able to send some people

202
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,110
up just before they arrived.
It occurred to Tim, well,

203
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,640
maybe we should go through his house,
you know, and just clean up and you know,

204
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:56,830
find out if there's anything
there that we should, you know,

205
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,110
disappear before his family shows up.

206
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,150
And we were talking to the guy who
first found him and he said, yeah,

207
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,010
well here's the thing. He told them, you
guys, you can go back into that house,

208
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,880
but I'm, I'm not going back
in there. He had warned us,

209
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,690
but as soon as we stepped
in, it was still shocking.

210
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,700
Terrible.

211
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,480
What'd you see when you walked in?

212
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,973
Um,

213
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,730
there are aspects about that that I
will never tell you or anyone else.

214
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,630
But suffice to say that
as soon as you walked in,

215
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:37,740
you could tell that someone had
ceased living like a human being.

216
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,000
I mean, there were heaps of things heaps

217
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,880
and he'd stop throwing things
out. There wasn't electricity,

218
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,230
there wasn't working
plumbing, no plumbing at all.

219
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,170
No, no, I don't think so.

220
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,360
[inaudible]

221
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,100
and words are gonna fail
me here. I mean, the,

222
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:04,410
the simplest way to say it would be
to say it was clearly a place where an

223
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:08,910
insane person that lived for
someone who is mentally ill,

224
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,770
ed left. Um,

225
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,650
I dunno if that's what to call it because
most people who are mentally ill don't

226
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:19,950
know to conceal their mental illness.

227
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,250
He was just a, a very gentle,
decent, kindhearted guy.

228
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,470
But something horrible had happened. Um,

229
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,610
but on some level he had,

230
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,380
he'd understood that. I mean,

231
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:39,381
it was a secret that he was keeping
[inaudible] and he kept it locked inside

232
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:40,524
that house.

233
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,800
Hmm.

234
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,800
And I think we were all appalled to
realize that something had been so

235
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,720
drastically wrong with him all this time.

236
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,670
And the single most upsetting
aspect of it was imagining how

237
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,900
utterly alone he must've
felt himself to be.

238
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,730
[inaudible].

239
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,970
Did you ever have moments of
feeling guilt like I should have,

240
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,360
I should have gotten into that place.

241
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,730
I shouldn't have no.

242
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,990
That I don't think there is anything
that anyone could have done for him.

243
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,580
I mean, he, uh,

244
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,130
he had so clearly determined not to
let people in to that chamber of his,

245
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,080
his life. And,

246
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,760
and the other thing is that he was
so convincing in his dissembling.

247
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,530
I mean, we really didn't think
there was anything seriously wrong.

248
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,400
Yeah.

249
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,400
He was his best and most decent and
sanest self when he was in our company.

250
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,490
But you didn't know so much about him.
[inaudible] and I guess I just in,

251
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:49,950
in light of that, I
wonder what it means to,

252
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,460
to know someone or what it, who
exactly it was that you think you knew.

253
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,820
Yeah. Well. Um, you know,

254
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:03,410
the only people I knew of whoever
got mad at him for telling,

255
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,830
uh, what they would've
called lies were women.

256
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,600
I mean he was a guy so he was not above
trying to impress girls and you know,

257
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:11,791
the,

258
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:16,791
the things he was trying to impress
them with where his novel is storied

259
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,840
history.

260
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,790
And often when they found out that those
things were not strictly speaking true,

261
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,360
they felt lied to and betrayed and

262
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,250
none of his friends ever felt
that way. And I always felt that

263
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,500
perhaps is patronizing or nasty of me,

264
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:37,880
but I always felt that what those girls
were really mad about was that they

265
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:40,250
believed him, they'd fallen for it.

266
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,550
But in a sense you and your
friends fell for something too?

267
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,370
Well, I dunno.

268
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,520
I mean what I would say we fell for was
the thousands of hours we spent in that

269
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,413
guy's company,

270
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,710
which seems to me like a more direct and
reliable form of knowing than hearing

271
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,530
facts either made up or real.

272
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,680
I mean there was a [inaudible]

273
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,060
day one, um,

274
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,660
Skelly and I drove up to my cabin to
check on the place cause there had been a

275
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:14,100
blizzard, uh,

276
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,190
and there is a grove of bamboo trees
there and the weight of all the snow had

277
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:25,170
bent them over the driveway so that
they formed a kind of continuous arch.

278
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,340
And we parked and we walked down through
that arcade and we would tug on every

279
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:38,211
bamboo tree and it would shake the snow
off and it would suddenly spooling up

280
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:43,830
into the air and fling it's load
of snow 50 feet into the sky.

281
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,280
We did that with every tree walking all
the way down the driveway and it was

282
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:54,470
[inaudible]

283
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,470
so beautiful and so much fun
that we cracked up like boys.

284
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,270
And I'm the only one
who remembers that. Now

285
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,890
I don't really know where Tim is. So
we're just going to try am Jab. I'm Rod.

286
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,140
Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and
today we're talking about truth and facts.

287
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,890
Yup. Facts of the matter. So recently
our producer, Pat Walters and I,

288
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:21,680
we were trying to get in touch with
a guy, Tim Kreider. Hello Tim? Nope.

289
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,010
Right there. I think if we just shout
very loudly, like out the window,

290
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,610
we wanted to talk to Tim because Tim
is not only is he a wonderful writer,

291
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,580
and before that a
cartoonist has this essay,

292
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,900
which kind of gets to the heart of a
very different kind of truth and we've

293
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,340
tackled so far, and that is,

294
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,290
can you truly know somebody even after
everything you thought you knew turns out

295
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,124
to be wrong.

296
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,180
Hello, Tim? Yes.

297
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,420
Oh, there you are. You sound
great too. Oh, we should say,

298
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:55,470
this is a story not about Tim, but
about his friend who he named Skelly,

299
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,490
just to protect his identity. Right? So
let's, let's try, if it's okay with you,

300
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,110
if we could maybe just talk about Skelly
as if we were just kind of hanging out

301
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,010
at a bar, even though you're in it.
