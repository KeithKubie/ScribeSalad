00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.570
good afternoon today we're going to

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580
good afternoon today we're going to
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.090
good afternoon today we're going to
continue looking at the interaction of

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100
continue looking at the interaction of
 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.619
continue looking at the interaction of
viruses with hosts we're going to talk

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
viruses with hosts we're going to talk
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.410
viruses with hosts we're going to talk
about these kinds of the different kinds

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
about these kinds of the different kinds
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.570
about these kinds of the different kinds
of interactions that can occur we're

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
of interactions that can occur we're
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.310
of interactions that can occur we're
gonna start talking about virulence

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
gonna start talking about virulence
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.670
gonna start talking about virulence
viral virulence this means the capacity

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
viral virulence this means the capacity
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.550
viral virulence this means the capacity
of a virus to cause disease in the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
of a virus to cause disease in the
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.570
of a virus to cause disease in the
infected host viral virulence so we say

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
infected host viral virulence so we say
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.150
infected host viral virulence so we say
a virulent virus causes significant

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
a virulent virus causes significant
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.419
a virulent virus causes significant
disease while one it is a virulent or

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
disease while one it is a virulent or
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.630
disease while one it is a virulent or
attenuated causes reduced or no disease

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
attenuated causes reduced or no disease
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760
attenuated causes reduced or no disease
so as you can see by the definition that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
so as you can see by the definition that
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.380
so as you can see by the definition that
it's going to be a relative term

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
it's going to be a relative term
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.680
it's going to be a relative term
we can measure virulence there are a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
we can measure virulence there are a
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.200
we can measure virulence there are a
variety of ways to measure it this is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
variety of ways to measure it this is
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.940
variety of ways to measure it this is
just some of them you could measure the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
just some of them you could measure the
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100
just some of them you could measure the
mean time to death if you're infecting

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
mean time to death if you're infecting
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.220
mean time to death if you're infecting
an experimental animal with a virus you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
an experimental animal with a virus you
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.700
an experimental animal with a virus you
can measure the mean time to symptoms a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
can measure the mean time to symptoms a
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.880
can measure the mean time to symptoms a
specific symptom caused by the virus you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
specific symptom caused by the virus you
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680
specific symptom caused by the virus you
can measure fever the induction of fever

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
can measure fever the induction of fever
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.529
can measure fever the induction of fever
weight loss is very typical or the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
weight loss is very typical or the
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479
weight loss is very typical or the
measurement of lesions caused by the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
measurement of lesions caused by the
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.329
measurement of lesions caused by the
virus so poliovirus if you inject it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
virus so poliovirus if you inject it
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.780
virus so poliovirus if you inject it
into a an animal will cause destruction

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
into a an animal will cause destruction
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.750
into a an animal will cause destruction
of motor neurons and you can see these

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
of motor neurons and you can see these
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670
of motor neurons and you can see these
lesions in the brain and spinal cord so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
lesions in the brain and spinal cord so
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890
lesions in the brain and spinal cord so
a very well trained pathologist can

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
a very well trained pathologist can
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.600
a very well trained pathologist can
quantify those HIV infection causes a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
quantify those HIV infection causes a
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.060
quantify those HIV infection causes a
reduction in the cd4 positive

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
reduction in the cd4 positive
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.010
reduction in the cd4 positive
lymphocytes in the blood you can measure

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
lymphocytes in the blood you can measure
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.510
lymphocytes in the blood you can measure
that you can draw blood and count the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
that you can draw blood and count the
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.630
that you can draw blood and count the
cd4 positive lymphocytes yeah

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.300
well you can't give people viruses right

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310
well you can't give people viruses right
 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.120
well you can't give people viruses right
you can only observe what a virus does

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130
you can only observe what a virus does
 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.560
you can only observe what a virus does
you can't manipulate it the key to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570
you can't manipulate it the key to
 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.510
you can't manipulate it the key to
studying virulence is to change the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520
studying virulence is to change the
 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.730
studying virulence is to change the
virus and see what happens you can't do

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740
virus and see what happens you can't do
 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.959
virus and see what happens you can't do
that in people so you always have to

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969
that in people so you always have to
 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.319
that in people so you always have to
make correlations you can see one season

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329
make correlations you can see one season
 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.330
make correlations you can see one season
influenza virus kills more people than

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340
influenza virus kills more people than
 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.350
influenza virus kills more people than
another and but you're always yeah

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360
another and but you're always yeah
 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.880
another and but you're always yeah
that's a natural but there you cannot

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890
that's a natural but there you cannot
 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.459
that's a natural but there you cannot
often make conclusions from that so it's

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469
often make conclusions from that so it's
 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.169
often make conclusions from that so it's
very difficult to do what you can do is

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179
very difficult to do what you can do is
 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.179
very difficult to do what you can do is
observe what happens so we know that HIV

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189
observe what happens so we know that HIV
 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.120
observe what happens so we know that HIV
is is virulent because it does this to

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130
is is virulent because it does this to
 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.220
is is virulent because it does this to
cd4 positive lymphocytes but you always

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230
cd4 positive lymphocytes but you always
 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.890
cd4 positive lymphocytes but you always
have to make correlations with an animal

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
have to make correlations with an animal
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.009
have to make correlations with an animal
model which is never perfect because

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019
model which is never perfect because
 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.080
model which is never perfect because
that's why it's a model so it's very

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
that's why it's a model so it's very
 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.550
that's why it's a model so it's very
difficult but though in the long term

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560
difficult but though in the long term
 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.050
difficult but though in the long term
you can draw some conclusions obviously

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
you can draw some conclusions obviously
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.750
you can draw some conclusions obviously
so here is a two examples of measuring

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
so here is a two examples of measuring
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.229
so here is a two examples of measuring
virulence of viruses on the left is a

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239
virulence of viruses on the left is a
 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.220
virulence of viruses on the left is a
graph of the number of survivors after

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230
graph of the number of survivors after
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.930
graph of the number of survivors after
infecting mice with two different

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940
infecting mice with two different
 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.490
infecting mice with two different
strains of poliovirus

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500
strains of poliovirus
 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.680
strains of poliovirus
so you can see type 1 strain the mice

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
so you can see type 1 strain the mice
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.460
so you can see type 1 strain the mice
are all living up to 15 days type 2

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
are all living up to 15 days type 2
 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.920
are all living up to 15 days type 2
strain the mice are all dead by 15 days

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930
strain the mice are all dead by 15 days
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.390
strain the mice are all dead by 15 days
so that's a very crude measure of

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
so that's a very crude measure of
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.800
so that's a very crude measure of
virulence so you could say that this

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
virulence so you could say that this
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.289
virulence so you could say that this
virus is more virulent than the blue one

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299
virus is more virulent than the blue one
 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.940
virus is more virulent than the blue one
on the right the multiplication of

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950
on the right the multiplication of
 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.849
on the right the multiplication of
different viruses in the central nervous

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859
different viruses in the central nervous
 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.960
different viruses in the central nervous
system of of an experimental animal and

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
system of of an experimental animal and
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.729
system of of an experimental animal and
here we're measuring the lesions in this

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739
here we're measuring the lesions in this
 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.250
here we're measuring the lesions in this
in the central nervous system so someone

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
in the central nervous system so someone
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.140
in the central nervous system so someone
is looking at sections in a microscope

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150
is looking at sections in a microscope
 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.509
is looking at sections in a microscope
and putting a number on the lesions and

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519
and putting a number on the lesions and
 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.640
and putting a number on the lesions and
you can see in 3 different parts of the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
you can see in 3 different parts of the
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.930
you can see in 3 different parts of the
CNS the cerebrum brain stem and spinal

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940
CNS the cerebrum brain stem and spinal
 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.110
CNS the cerebrum brain stem and spinal
cord for five different viruses you have

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120
cord for five different viruses you have
 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.390
cord for five different viruses you have
different numbers of lesions very few

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400
different numbers of lesions very few
 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.089
different numbers of lesions very few
lesions with dengue a lot of lesions

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099
lesions with dengue a lot of lesions
 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.640
lesions with dengue a lot of lesions
with Japanese encephalitis virus and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650
with Japanese encephalitis virus and
 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.229
with Japanese encephalitis virus and
some of them fall in between so just a

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239
some of them fall in between so just a
 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.059
some of them fall in between so just a
measure of the wait another way to

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069
measure of the wait another way to
 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.819
measure of the wait another way to
measure virulence it's very important to

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829
measure virulence it's very important to
 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.589
measure virulence it's very important to
remember that virulence is a relative

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599
remember that virulence is a relative
 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.170
remember that virulence is a relative
property it's very difficult to compare

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180
property it's very difficult to compare
 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.300
property it's very difficult to compare
the virulence of HIV and polio because

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310
the virulence of HIV and polio because
 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.759
the virulence of HIV and polio because
they use different experimental animals

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769
they use different experimental animals
 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.319
they use different experimental animals
in different measurements for the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329
in different measurements for the
 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.440
in different measurements for the
virulence

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450
virulence
 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.110
virulence
so you can't really do that variance is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120
so you can't really do that variance is
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.980
so you can't really do that variance is
influenced by dose route of infection

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990
influenced by dose route of infection
 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.280
influenced by dose route of infection
species of the animal age gender

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
species of the animal age gender
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.090
species of the animal age gender
susceptibility and many many other

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100
susceptibility and many many other
 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.370
susceptibility and many many other
things as well so unless you're

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380
things as well so unless you're
 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.050
things as well so unless you're
measuring the virulence of two viruses

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060
measuring the virulence of two viruses
 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.820
measuring the virulence of two viruses
exactly the same way

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830
exactly the same way
 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.980
exactly the same way
you really cannot compare the virulence

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990
you really cannot compare the virulence
 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.270
you really cannot compare the virulence
of those two so for similar viruses we

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280
of those two so for similar viruses we
 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.860
of those two so for similar viruses we
could take two different polio viruses

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870
could take two different polio viruses
 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.230
could take two different polio viruses
like we did in that experiment and put

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240
like we did in that experiment and put
 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.110
like we did in that experiment and put
them in animals the same way and you can

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120
them in animals the same way and you can
 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.150
them in animals the same way and you can
compare the virulence but you can't do

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160
compare the virulence but you can't do
 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.430
compare the virulence but you can't do
it if you have any aspect of the assay

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440
it if you have any aspect of the assay
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.700
it if you have any aspect of the assay
that is different here's an example of

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710
that is different here's an example of
 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.090
that is different here's an example of
how just the root of inoculation in an

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
how just the root of inoculation in an
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.860
how just the root of inoculation in an
animal will change the virulence of the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870
animal will change the virulence of the
 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.130
animal will change the virulence of the
virus so on the Left we have a curve of

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140
virus so on the Left we have a curve of
 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.590
virus so on the Left we have a curve of
a virus multiplication pfu per

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600
a virus multiplication pfu per
 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.700
a virus multiplication pfu per
milliliter and with days after infection

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710
milliliter and with days after infection
 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.930
milliliter and with days after infection
so these are suckling mice given virus

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940
so these are suckling mice given virus
 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.750
so these are suckling mice given virus
subcutaneously right under the skin to

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.670
subcutaneously right under the skin to
different viruses lacrosse and Tonya and

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680
different viruses lacrosse and Tonya and
 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.560
different viruses lacrosse and Tonya and
these are and then we're measuring the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570
these are and then we're measuring the
 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.750
these are and then we're measuring the
amount of virus in the brain here in the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760
amount of virus in the brain here in the
 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.980
amount of virus in the brain here in the
solid circles and the viremia in the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990
solid circles and the viremia in the
 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.170
solid circles and the viremia in the
blue in the lighter blue line

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180
blue in the lighter blue line
 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.290
blue in the lighter blue line
so that's lacrosse brain viremic if I

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300
so that's lacrosse brain viremic if I
 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.450
so that's lacrosse brain viremic if I
read me of course virus in the blood and

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460
read me of course virus in the blood and
 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.270
read me of course virus in the blood and
then titania viremia and brain by this

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280
then titania viremia and brain by this
 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.490
then titania viremia and brain by this
root apparently doesn't multiply in the

root apparently doesn't multiply in the
 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.430
root apparently doesn't multiply in the
brain and doesn't cause a very Mia but

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440
brain and doesn't cause a very Mia but
 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.980

cerebrally put a needle right in the
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.930
cerebrally put a needle right in the
brain can do that mice are pretty

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940
brain can do that mice are pretty
 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.410
brain can do that mice are pretty
resilient you see the amount of virus in

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420
resilient you see the amount of virus in
 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.930

the brain of lacrosse here and Tonya

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940
the brain of lacrosse here and Tonya
 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.700
the brain of lacrosse here and Tonya
does very well when you put it right in

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710
does very well when you put it right in
 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.210
does very well when you put it right in
the brain and you would also say from

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220
the brain and you would also say from
 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.130
the brain and you would also say from
this of course that Tonya is not very

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140
this of course that Tonya is not very
 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.800
this of course that Tonya is not very
neuro invasive right because we're

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810
neuro invasive right because we're
 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.690
neuro invasive right because we're
putting it at a peripheral site and it

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700
putting it at a peripheral site and it
 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.010
putting it at a peripheral site and it
doesn't seem to be getting into the

doesn't seem to be getting into the
 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.860
doesn't seem to be getting into the
brain so the root of inoculation can

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870
brain so the root of inoculation can
 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.090
brain so the root of inoculation can
make a big difference so you certainly

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100
make a big difference so you certainly
 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.610
make a big difference so you certainly
have to have the same root to compare

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620
have to have the same root to compare
 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.980
have to have the same root to compare

what we try and do in virology one of

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480
what we try and do in virology one of
 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.790
what we try and do in virology one of
the things we try and do is to identify

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800
the things we try and do is to identify
 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.480
the things we try and do is to identify
what makes viruses virulent we want to

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490
what makes viruses virulent we want to
 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.130
what makes viruses virulent we want to
know the viral genes that are involved

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.140
know the viral genes that are involved
 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.820
know the viral genes that are involved
and the host genes and we usually do

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830
and the host genes and we usually do
 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.550
and the host genes and we usually do
this by mutation below there are other

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560
this by mutation below there are other
 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.400
this by mutation below there are other
ways nowadays and originally it was only

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410
ways nowadays and originally it was only
 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.620
ways nowadays and originally it was only
possible to do so by mutation you delete

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630
possible to do so by mutation you delete
 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.840
possible to do so by mutation you delete
a gene or you disrupt the gene that you

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850
a gene or you disrupt the gene that you
 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.060
a gene or you disrupt the gene that you
think is involved in virulence and you

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070
think is involved in virulence and you
 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.190
think is involved in virulence and you
see the effect in an animal if you have

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200
see the effect in an animal if you have
 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.680
see the effect in an animal if you have
reduced virulence you say this gene is

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690
reduced virulence you say this gene is
 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.060
reduced virulence you say this gene is
involved in virulence and then you have

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070
involved in virulence and then you have
 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.220
involved in virulence and then you have
to figure out how you have to look at

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230
to figure out how you have to look at
 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.250
to figure out how you have to look at
the mechanism of that so here's an

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.260
the mechanism of that so here's an
 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.350
the mechanism of that so here's an
experiment where we're trying to

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360
experiment where we're trying to
 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.600
experiment where we're trying to
identify some virulence genes with which

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610
identify some virulence genes with which
 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.910
identify some virulence genes with which

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:37.920
illustrates what I'm talking about we
 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.150
illustrates what I'm talking about we
have a virus a wild type virus that

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160
have a virus a wild type virus that
 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.480
have a virus a wild type virus that
grows very well in cell culture and when

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:44.490
grows very well in cell culture and when
 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.100
grows very well in cell culture and when
you inoculate this into the brain of

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110
you inoculate this into the brain of
 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.650
you inoculate this into the brain of
mice the virus multiplies in the brain

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660
mice the virus multiplies in the brain
 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.020
mice the virus multiplies in the brain
and it's neuro virulent it causes some

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.030
and it's neuro virulent it causes some
 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.700
and it's neuro virulent it causes some
neurological disease so we say this

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.710
neurological disease so we say this
 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.670
neurological disease so we say this
virus is neuro virulent we now introduce

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680
virus is neuro virulent we now introduce
 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.520
virus is neuro virulent we now introduce
a mutation into this virus and that

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:58.530
a mutation into this virus and that
 

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.000
a mutation into this virus and that
mutation impairs the replication of the

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.010
mutation impairs the replication of the
 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.860
mutation impairs the replication of the
virus and cells is shown here by fewer

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:03.870
virus and cells is shown here by fewer
 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.380
virus and cells is shown here by fewer
plaques so in cell culture doesn't grow

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:06.390
plaques so in cell culture doesn't grow
 

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.360
plaques so in cell culture doesn't grow
well you put it in the brain of the

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.370
well you put it in the brain of the
 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.130
well you put it in the brain of the
mouse it also doesn't grow well in the

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.140
mouse it also doesn't grow well in the
 

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.680
mouse it also doesn't grow well in the
brain and it's attenuated which means it

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:12.690
brain and it's attenuated which means it
 

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.230
brain and it's attenuated which means it
has reduced virulence

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240
has reduced virulence
 

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.580
has reduced virulence
now this is not a particularly

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:16.590
now this is not a particularly
 

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.830
now this is not a particularly
interesting mutation because all you've

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840
interesting mutation because all you've
 

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.190
interesting mutation because all you've
done is make the virus less fit

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.200
done is make the virus less fit
 

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.710
done is make the virus less fit
basically and so if there's nothing

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720
basically and so if there's nothing
 

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.900
basically and so if there's nothing
specific about that mutation but look at

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:26.910
specific about that mutation but look at
 

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.490
specific about that mutation but look at
the next one we make a mutation in

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500
the next one we make a mutation in
 

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.350
the next one we make a mutation in
another gene and this mutation does not

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360
another gene and this mutation does not
 

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.270
another gene and this mutation does not
markedly affect replication and cell

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:35.280
markedly affect replication and cell
 

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.370
markedly affect replication and cell
culture but when you put it in the

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.380
culture but when you put it in the
 

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.830
culture but when you put it in the
animal it is still it is attenuated it

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:39.840
animal it is still it is attenuated it
 

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.330
animal it is still it is attenuated it
doesn't replicate well in the animal

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:41.340
doesn't replicate well in the animal
 

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.029
doesn't replicate well in the animal
it's attenuated has less virulence so

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039
it's attenuated has less virulence so
 

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.650
it's attenuated has less virulence so
this is an interesting gene this is

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660
this is an interesting gene this is
 

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.510
this is an interesting gene this is
something that you specifically need to

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:47.520
something that you specifically need to
 

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.460
something that you specifically need to
cause disease or to be very limited in

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:49.470
cause disease or to be very limited in
 

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.500
cause disease or to be very limited in
animal as opposed to a gene that you

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:51.510
animal as opposed to a gene that you
 

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.050
animal as opposed to a gene that you
need for replication in general and so

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060
need for replication in general and so
 

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.240
need for replication in general and so
those are the kinds of genes that are of

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.250
those are the kinds of genes that are of
 

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.890
those are the kinds of genes that are of
interest to people studying viral

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:57.900
interest to people studying viral
 

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.080
interest to people studying viral
virilis so that's how you would identify

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.090
virilis so that's how you would identify
 

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.000
virilis so that's how you would identify
such a gene and then you figure out what

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.010
such a gene and then you figure out what
 

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.120
such a gene and then you figure out what
it's doing so this has been done for

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.130
it's doing so this has been done for
 

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.300
it's doing so this has been done for
many viruses over the years mutation

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.310
many viruses over the years mutation
 

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.850
many viruses over the years mutation
infect animals and the consequence is

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860
infect animals and the consequence is
 

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.250
infect animals and the consequence is
you could put all the viral genes that

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.260
you could put all the viral genes that
 

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.990
you could put all the viral genes that
affect virulence into four different

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000
affect virulence into four different
 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.390
affect virulence into four different
classes all right there are those that

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:17.400
classes all right there are those that
 

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.210
classes all right there are those that
affect the ability of virus to replicate

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:19.220
affect the ability of virus to replicate
 

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.410
affect the ability of virus to replicate
which we've talked about which I don't

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420
which we've talked about which I don't
 

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.750
which we've talked about which I don't
find particularly interesting there are

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760
find particularly interesting there are
 

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.730
find particularly interesting there are
those that modify the host defense

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740
those that modify the host defense
 

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.800
those that modify the host defense
mechanisms that's that's very

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:27.810
mechanisms that's that's very
 

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.690
mechanisms that's that's very
interesting so it's a gene product the

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700
interesting so it's a gene product the
 

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.210
interesting so it's a gene product the
virus that the virus uses to somehow

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220
virus that the virus uses to somehow
 

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.370
virus that the virus uses to somehow
modify the immune response of course in

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380
modify the immune response of course in
 

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.680
modify the immune response of course in
cell culture there is no immune response

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:36.690
cell culture there is no immune response
 

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.900
cell culture there is no immune response
there's an innate immune response but

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:38.910
there's an innate immune response but
 

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.110
there's an innate immune response but
not an adaptive one so this is not going

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120
not an adaptive one so this is not going
 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.730
not an adaptive one so this is not going
to tell you much in cell culture but in

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:43.740
to tell you much in cell culture but in
 

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.490
to tell you much in cell culture but in
an animal it will and then there are

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500
an animal it will and then there are
 

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.430
an animal it will and then there are
genes that allow spread of the virus and

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440
genes that allow spread of the virus and
 

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.350
genes that allow spread of the virus and
the host so those are very interesting

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360
the host so those are very interesting
 

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.610
the host so those are very interesting
and again in in cell culture you

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620
and again in in cell culture you
 

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.380
and again in in cell culture you
wouldn't necessarily pick these up and

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:54.390
wouldn't necessarily pick these up and
 

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.690
wouldn't necessarily pick these up and
then there are some that have cell

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700
then there are some that have cell
 

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.440
then there are some that have cell
killing effects these could be of these

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:00.450
killing effects these could be of these
 

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.390
killing effects these could be of these
could have an effect in cells in in the

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:02.400
could have an effect in cells in in the
 

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.940
could have an effect in cells in in the
animal but not likely to affect the

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:04.950
animal but not likely to affect the
 

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.590
animal but not likely to affect the
amount of virus produced in cell culture

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600
amount of virus produced in cell culture
 

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.420
amount of virus produced in cell culture
so these could also be interesting as

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:08.430
so these could also be interesting as
 

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.650
so these could also be interesting as
well that's my particular bias on the

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660
well that's my particular bias on the
 

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.360
well that's my particular bias on the
interest of these mutations if you talk

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.370
interest of these mutations if you talk
 

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.610
interest of these mutations if you talk
to ten other virologists you might get

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620
to ten other virologists you might get
 

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.430
to ten other virologists you might get
ten other views as well but since I'm

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440
ten other views as well but since I'm
 

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.050
ten other views as well but since I'm
teaching this course you can listen to

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060
teaching this course you can listen to
 

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.850
teaching this course you can listen to
my view

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860
my view
 

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.730
my view
okay here's an example of even

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:26.740
okay here's an example of even
 

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.220
okay here's an example of even
non-coding sequences can have an effect

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.230
non-coding sequences can have an effect
 

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.870
non-coding sequences can have an effect
on virulence so so far I'm talking about

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880
on virulence so so far I'm talking about
 

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.490
on virulence so so far I'm talking about
mutating a gene coding for something and

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:34.500
mutating a gene coding for something and
 

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.680
mutating a gene coding for something and
a protein and having an effect on

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:37.690
a protein and having an effect on
 

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.740
a protein and having an effect on
virilis but even non-coding regions can

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:40.750
virilis but even non-coding regions can
 

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.870
virilis but even non-coding regions can
have an effect this is an example of a

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880
have an effect this is an example of a
 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.120
have an effect this is an example of a
mutation in a vaccine strain of

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.130
mutation in a vaccine strain of
 

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.980
mutation in a vaccine strain of
poliovirus so we have two different

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:46.990
poliovirus so we have two different
 

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.280
poliovirus so we have two different
kinds of polio vaccine strains there is

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.290
kinds of polio vaccine strains there is
 

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.900
kinds of polio vaccine strains there is
one that is inactivated it's a

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:51.910
one that is inactivated it's a
 

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.350
one that is inactivated it's a
non-infectious vaccine and then there's

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360
non-infectious vaccine and then there's
 

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.440
non-infectious vaccine and then there's
a second which is an attenuated a live

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.450
a second which is an attenuated a live
 

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.350
a second which is an attenuated a live
attenuated vaccine and these have

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360
attenuated vaccine and these have
 

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.150
attenuated vaccine and these have
mutations in their five prime non-coding

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160
mutations in their five prime non-coding
 

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.260
mutations in their five prime non-coding
regions that make them attenuated

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.270
regions that make them attenuated
 

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.030
regions that make them attenuated
another example is also within the five

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040
another example is also within the five
 

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.500
another example is also within the five
prime non-coding region of another

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.510
prime non-coding region of another
 

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.380
prime non-coding region of another
picornavirus called mango virus there's

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.390
picornavirus called mango virus there's
 

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.870
picornavirus called mango virus there's
a poly c track there that if you delete

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880
a poly c track there that if you delete
 

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.870
a poly c track there that if you delete
it they that reduces virulence in mice

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880
it they that reduces virulence in mice
 

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.630
it they that reduces virulence in mice
so you don't have to make a protein to

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:21.640
so you don't have to make a protein to
 

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.640
so you don't have to make a protein to
influence virulence a non-coding region

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:23.650
influence virulence a non-coding region
 

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.040
influence virulence a non-coding region
of a virus can also have effects on

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.050
of a virus can also have effects on
 

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.120
of a virus can also have effects on
virulence this is to illustrate the

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.130
virulence this is to illustrate the
 

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.160
virulence this is to illustrate the
non-coding mutations in the Sabin

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.170
non-coding mutations in the Sabin
 

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.230
non-coding mutations in the Sabin
vaccine strains and we'll come back to

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240
vaccine strains and we'll come back to
 

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.550
vaccine strains and we'll come back to
these later this is a very interesting

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560
these later this is a very interesting
 

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.530
these later this is a very interesting
story if you remember the five prime

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:37.540
story if you remember the five prime
 

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.230
story if you remember the five prime
non-coding region of corner viruses has

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240
non-coding region of corner viruses has
 

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.970
non-coding region of corner viruses has
this highly structured region it's

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:41.980
this highly structured region it's
 

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.760
this highly structured region it's
called an iris and that's involved in

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:44.770
called an iris and that's involved in
 

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.470
called an iris and that's involved in
translation you see there all these

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480
translation you see there all these
 

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.230
translation you see there all these
stem-loop structures in the iris and

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240
stem-loop structures in the iris and
 

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.230
stem-loop structures in the iris and
this one here stem-loop six it's blown

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240
this one here stem-loop six it's blown
 

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.260
this one here stem-loop six it's blown
up here on the right you can see these

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:55.270
up here on the right you can see these
 

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.110
up here on the right you can see these
numbers in red these are the mute there

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120
numbers in red these are the mute there
 

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.420
numbers in red these are the mute there
are three serotypes of polio and the

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:00.430
are three serotypes of polio and the
 

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.030
are three serotypes of polio and the
vaccine has three serotypes in it and

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040
vaccine has three serotypes in it and
 

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.370
vaccine has three serotypes in it and
each has a slightly different mutation

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:05.380
each has a slightly different mutation
 

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.740
each has a slightly different mutation
in the 5-prime non-coding region that

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:07.750
in the 5-prime non-coding region that
 

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.480
in the 5-prime non-coding region that
makes it a good vaccine makes it not

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:09.490
makes it a good vaccine makes it not
 

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.370
makes it a good vaccine makes it not
give you polio most of the time anyway

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:11.380
give you polio most of the time anyway
 

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:20.600
give you polio most of the time anyway
so this type one it has a change here I

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:20.610
 

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.920
don't know why this is G to G this

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:22.930
don't know why this is G to G this
 

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.280
don't know why this is G to G this
should be GTA this is secede so that's

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:26.290
should be GTA this is secede so that's
 

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.160
should be GTA this is secede so that's
the type one strain of G to a and I've

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.170
the type one strain of G to a and I've
 

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.900
the type one strain of G to a and I've
shown this for 15 years and I've never

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:30.910
shown this for 15 years and I've never
 

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.700
shown this for 15 years and I've never
noticed this was think before and

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:32.710
noticed this was think before and
 

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.420
noticed this was think before and
there's a change at this position

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:36.430
there's a change at this position
 

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.300
there's a change at this position
from a G to an A and a type 2 strain and

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.310
from a G to an A and a type 2 strain and
 

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.430
from a G to an A and a type 2 strain and
then in the type 3 strain there's a

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440
then in the type 3 strain there's a
 

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.770
then in the type 3 strain there's a
change from a C to a you so single base

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:43.780
change from a C to a you so single base
 

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.540
change from a C to a you so single base
changes in each of the strains make them

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:45.550
changes in each of the strains make them
 

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.060
changes in each of the strains make them
not able to cause paralysis we'll talk

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.070
not able to cause paralysis we'll talk
 

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.120
not able to cause paralysis we'll talk
about how that works another time now

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.130
about how that works another time now
 

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.370
about how that works another time now
you can show this effect in mice this is

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:53.380
you can show this effect in mice this is
 

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.180
you can show this effect in mice this is

and the vaccine has a u so he made two

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880
and the vaccine has a u so he made two
 

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.430
and the vaccine has a u so he made two
viruses that were exactly the same

put 10,000,000 pfu is which is as much
 

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.610
put 10,000,000 pfu is which is as much
as we can put in so a single base change

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:02.620
as we can put in so a single base change
 

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.530
as we can put in so a single base change
in a non-coding region can have this

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:04.540
in a non-coding region can have this
 

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.090
in a non-coding region can have this
effect so examples of genes that modify

host defense mechanisms you'll hear more
 

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.940
host defense mechanisms you'll hear more
from Professor silverstein about these

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:13.950
from Professor silverstein about these
 

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.000
from Professor silverstein about these
some of them are called viral kinds

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.010
some of them are called viral kinds
 

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.360
some of them are called viral kinds
these are viral homologues of cytokines

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.370
these are viral homologues of cytokines
 

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.280
these are viral homologues of cytokines
they are secreted proteins that mimics

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:23.290
they are secreted proteins that mimics
 

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.990
they are secreted proteins that mimics
cytokines member cytokines are produced

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000
cytokines member cytokines are produced
 

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.720
cytokines member cytokines are produced
during the early immune responses to

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:27.730
during the early immune responses to
 

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.360
during the early immune responses to
virus infection and these are viral

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:30.370
virus infection and these are viral
 

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.370
virus infection and these are viral
encoded proteins that mimic those

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:32.380
encoded proteins that mimic those
 

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.880
encoded proteins that mimic those
cytokines and there's also another class

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:35.890
cytokines and there's also another class
 

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.070
cytokines and there's also another class
called of i receptors and these are

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:38.080
called of i receptors and these are
 

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.720
called of i receptors and these are
virus encoded proteins that mimic the

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:39.730
virus encoded proteins that mimic the
 

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.420
virus encoded proteins that mimic the
receptors for cytokines and other immune

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.430
receptors for cytokines and other immune
 

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.640
receptors for cytokines and other immune
molecules so you see they're antagonists

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:44.650
molecules so you see they're antagonists
 

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.370
molecules so you see they're antagonists
the viral kinds will bind to the normal

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:47.380
the viral kinds will bind to the normal
 

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.020
the viral kinds will bind to the normal
receptor for the cytokine on the host

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.030
receptor for the cytokine on the host
 

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.259
receptor for the cytokine on the host
cell and block its active

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:50.269
cell and block its active
 

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:52.600
cell and block its active
so these impaired the immune response

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:52.610
so these impaired the immune response
 

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.290
so these impaired the immune response
they mimic normal cellular molecules and

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:56.300
they mimic normal cellular molecules and
 

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.199
they mimic normal cellular molecules and
they basically sabotage the innate and

00:14:59.199 --> 00:14:59.209
they basically sabotage the innate and
 

00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:01.600
they basically sabotage the innate and
adaptive defenses but they're not needed

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:01.610
adaptive defenses but they're not needed
 

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.759
adaptive defenses but they're not needed
for growth and cell culture so this is

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:03.769
for growth and cell culture so this is
 

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:05.470
for growth and cell culture so this is
an example of that class of genes that

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480
an example of that class of genes that
 

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.230
an example of that class of genes that
you pick up in the animal has no effect

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240
you pick up in the animal has no effect
 

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.699
you pick up in the animal has no effect
on growth and cell culture but has a

00:15:09.699 --> 00:15:09.709
on growth and cell culture but has a
 

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:12.249
on growth and cell culture but has a
market effect on virulence so this is

00:15:12.249 --> 00:15:12.259
market effect on virulence so this is
 

00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:14.319
market effect on virulence so this is
these if you take away these viral kinds

00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:14.329
these if you take away these viral kinds
 

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:16.030
these if you take away these viral kinds
of virus receptors from the viruses

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040
of virus receptors from the viruses
 

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.259
of virus receptors from the viruses
they're much less virulent than an

00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:17.269
they're much less virulent than an
 

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:19.150
they're much less virulent than an
animal because they can't overcome the

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160
animal because they can't overcome the
 

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.549
animal because they can't overcome the
host defense most of these have been

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.050
functions the soluble cytokine receptors
 

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.019
functions the soluble cytokine receptors
they bind cytokines and then they're

00:15:32.019 --> 00:15:32.029
they bind cytokines and then they're
 

00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:34.980
they bind cytokines and then they're
also proteins that bind key

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:34.990
also proteins that bind key
 

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.730

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.769
intermediates in the complement cascade
you remember the complement cascade is a

00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:38.779
you remember the complement cascade is a
 

00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:41.319
you remember the complement cascade is a
series of proteins which undergo

00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:41.329
series of proteins which undergo
 

00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:43.540
series of proteins which undergo
activation when an antibody binds a

type virus say so let's look at

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080
type virus say so let's look at
 

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.649
type virus say so let's look at
macrophages so you get a certain number

00:17:50.649 --> 00:17:50.659
macrophages so you get a certain number
 

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:52.659
macrophages so you get a certain number
of macrophages coming in but if you take

00:17:52.659 --> 00:17:52.669
of macrophages coming in but if you take
 

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:54.610
of macrophages coming in but if you take
away the m3 gene you get more

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:54.620
away the m3 gene you get more
 

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.799
away the m3 gene you get more
macrophages coming in it's telling you

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:56.809
macrophages coming in it's telling you
 

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:58.630
macrophages coming in it's telling you
that the chemokine that m3 is

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640
that the chemokine that m3 is
 

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.990
that the chemokine that m3 is
antagonizing is now taken away so the

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.100
block that two examples of genes that
enable virus spread unfortunately we

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:21.110
enable virus spread unfortunately we
 

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.100
enable virus spread unfortunately we
don't know the mechanisms by which these

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.110
don't know the mechanisms by which these
 

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.990
don't know the mechanisms by which these
are involved in spread remember I told

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000
are involved in spread remember I told
 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.500
are involved in spread remember I told
you

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:26.510
you
 

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.899
you
uou start by identifying genes that are

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:28.909
uou start by identifying genes that are
 

00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:30.340
uou start by identifying genes that are
involved in virulence but really you

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:30.350
involved in virulence but really you
 

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.690
involved in virulence but really you
need to know how they work

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:31.700
need to know how they work
 

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.759
need to know how they work
so for these two cases we don't know how

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:33.769
so for these two cases we don't know how
 

00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:38.169
so for these two cases we don't know how
they're working very few viruses encode

00:19:38.169 --> 00:19:38.179
they're working very few viruses encode
 

00:19:38.179 --> 00:19:40.690
they're working very few viruses encode

there is one example the road of viruses
 

00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:56.379
there is one example the road of viruses
those are double-stranded RNA viruses

00:19:56.379 --> 00:19:56.389
those are double-stranded RNA viruses
 

00:19:56.389 --> 00:19:59.830
those are double-stranded RNA viruses
that cause gastroenteritis they encode a

00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840
that cause gastroenteritis they encode a
 

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.350
that cause gastroenteritis they encode a

triangles here and this is really a

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760
triangles here and this is really a
 

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.629

toxin it's an enterotoxin it is produced

00:20:07.629 --> 00:20:07.639
toxin it's an enterotoxin it is produced
 

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:11.110
toxin it's an enterotoxin it is produced
in infected cells and secreted above and

in infected cells and secreted above and
 

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.980
in infected cells and secreted above and
below the mono layer so this is a

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:13.990
below the mono layer so this is a
 

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.350
below the mono layer so this is a
epithelial layer in the intestine which

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360
epithelial layer in the intestine which
 

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.350

very nice lined up epithelial cells here

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:22.970
very nice lined up epithelial cells here
 

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.610
very nice lined up epithelial cells here
they're being infected by rotaviruses

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:24.620
they're being infected by rotaviruses
 

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.850
they're being infected by rotaviruses
and they're producing NS p4 and this has

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:27.860
and they're producing NS p4 and this has
 

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.889
and they're producing NS p4 and this has
a variety of effects that the outcome of

00:20:29.889 --> 00:20:29.899
a variety of effects that the outcome of
 

00:20:29.899 --> 00:20:31.029
a variety of effects that the outcome of
course of this infection is

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039
course of this infection is
 

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:33.700
course of this infection is
gastroenteritis diarrhea so diarrhea is

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.710
gastroenteritis diarrhea so diarrhea is
 

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.710
gastroenteritis diarrhea so diarrhea is
fluid in balance in the intestine and

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720
fluid in balance in the intestine and
 

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.779
fluid in balance in the intestine and
this protein alone if you make this

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:37.789
this protein alone if you make this
 

00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:39.850
this protein alone if you make this
protein and feed it to animals they get

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:39.860
protein and feed it to animals they get

diarrhea in the absence of virus

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:41.510
diarrhea in the absence of virus
 

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.960
diarrhea in the absence of virus
infection so this protein has effects on

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:43.970
infection so this protein has effects on
 

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.200
infection so this protein has effects on
its own to cause fluid imbalance and

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:47.210
its own to cause fluid imbalance and
 

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.419
its own to cause fluid imbalance and
some of the mechanisms are shown here we

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:49.429
some of the mechanisms are shown here we
 

00:20:49.429 --> 00:20:52.750
some of the mechanisms are shown here we
think that one of the things n sp4 does

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760
think that one of the things n sp4 does
 

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.460
think that one of the things n sp4 does
is to disrupt the tight junctions

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:54.470
is to disrupt the tight junctions
 

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.860
is to disrupt the tight junctions
between these cells and that allows

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:56.870
between these cells and that allows
 

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.259
between these cells and that allows
water to come out into the intestine

00:20:59.259 --> 00:20:59.269
water to come out into the intestine
 

00:20:59.269 --> 00:21:00.850
water to come out into the intestine
that's a component of the diarrhea of

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:00.860
that's a component of the diarrhea of
 

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.879
that's a component of the diarrhea of
course we also think that this protein

00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:03.889
course we also think that this protein
 

00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:06.669
course we also think that this protein
binds to a receptor on the cell surface

00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679
binds to a receptor on the cell surface
 

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:09.580
binds to a receptor on the cell surface
of the epithelial cells and starts a

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:09.590
of the epithelial cells and starts a
 

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.759
of the epithelial cells and starts a
signaling cascade that results in

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:11.769
signaling cascade that results in
 

00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:15.190
signaling cascade that results in
increased intracellular calcium and that

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200
increased intracellular calcium and that
 

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.460
increased intracellular calcium and that
in turn forces chloride out of the cells

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:18.470
in turn forces chloride out of the cells
 

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.960
in turn forces chloride out of the cells
and then once you do that you get a

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:19.970
and then once you do that you get a
 

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.460
and then once you do that you get a
chloride imbalance and I don't that

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:21.470
chloride imbalance and I don't that
 

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.310
chloride imbalance and I don't that
further worsens the diarrhea so that's

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320
further worsens the diarrhea so that's
 

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.230
further worsens the diarrhea so that's
the second mechanism and then finally we

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240
the second mechanism and then finally we
 

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.130
the second mechanism and then finally we
think n sp4 goes

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140
think n sp4 goes
 

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.160
think n sp4 goes
below the basement membrane and

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.170
below the basement membrane and
 

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.480
below the basement membrane and
interacts with the enteric nervous

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:32.490
interacts with the enteric nervous
 

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.539
interacts with the enteric nervous
system there's a whole network of nerves

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:34.549
system there's a whole network of nerves
 

00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:37.669
system there's a whole network of nerves
innervating your gut and we think that

00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679
innervating your gut and we think that
 

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:40.130
innervating your gut and we think that
if this protein interacts with that

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140
if this protein interacts with that
 

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.740
if this protein interacts with that
system in a certain way it can influence

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:42.750
system in a certain way it can influence
 

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.620
system in a certain way it can influence
the fluid imbalance in the intestine so

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:45.630
the fluid imbalance in the intestine so
 

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.810
the fluid imbalance in the intestine so
that's an example of a toxic viral

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820
that's an example of a toxic viral
 

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:53.120
that's an example of a toxic viral

this is a cellular gene that's involved

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:55.710
this is a cellular gene that's involved
 

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.260
this is a cellular gene that's involved
in virulence so far we've been talking

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:57.270
in virulence so far we've been talking
 

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.470
in virulence so far we've been talking
about viral genes this is a cell protein

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480
about viral genes this is a cell protein
 

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.460
about viral genes this is a cell protein
called trim5 alpha now this is a very

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:04.470
called trim5 alpha now this is a very
 

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.930
called trim5 alpha now this is a very
interesting story it began with the

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940
interesting story it began with the
 

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.510
interesting story it began with the
observation that old-world monkeys are

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520
observation that old-world monkeys are
 

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.299
observation that old-world monkeys are
resistant to infection with HIV one and

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:14.309
resistant to infection with HIV one and
 

00:22:14.309 --> 00:22:17.570
resistant to infection with HIV one and
it turns out that the block to infection

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580
it turns out that the block to infection
 

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.380
it turns out that the block to infection
is after entry but before reverse

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:21.390
is after entry but before reverse
 

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.750
is after entry but before reverse
transcription remember retroviruses from

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760
transcription remember retroviruses from
 

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.570
transcription remember retroviruses from
which HIV is one enter cells and then

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580
which HIV is one enter cells and then
 

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.520
which HIV is one enter cells and then
they reverse transcribe their RNA into a

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:28.530
they reverse transcribe their RNA into a
 

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.070
they reverse transcribe their RNA into a
DNA copy there's a block in monkeys old

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080
DNA copy there's a block in monkeys old
 

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.230
DNA copy there's a block in monkeys old
world monkey cells before reverse

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240
world monkey cells before reverse
 

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.770
world monkey cells before reverse
transcription this block is mediated by

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780
transcription this block is mediated by
 

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.650
transcription this block is mediated by
trim5 alpha cellular protein that

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:39.660
trim5 alpha cellular protein that
 

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.600
trim5 alpha cellular protein that
somehow acts on the viral capsid it

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:41.610
somehow acts on the viral capsid it
 

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.630
somehow acts on the viral capsid it
recognizes the viral capsid of HIV 1 and

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640
recognizes the viral capsid of HIV 1 and
 

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.240
recognizes the viral capsid of HIV 1 and
somehow targets it to be degraded so it

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:47.250
somehow targets it to be degraded so it
 

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.000
somehow targets it to be degraded so it
never can replicate so if you take away

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.010
never can replicate so if you take away
 

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.490
never can replicate so if you take away
trim5 alpha in old-world monkeys or

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500
trim5 alpha in old-world monkeys or
 

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.480
trim5 alpha in old-world monkeys or
monkey cells HIV 1 will replicate so

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:56.490
monkey cells HIV 1 will replicate so
 

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.020
monkey cells HIV 1 will replicate so
that's an example of a cellular protein

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.030
that's an example of a cellular protein
 

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.930
that's an example of a cellular protein
that can influence virulence so you may

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940
that can influence virulence so you may
 

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.320
that can influence virulence so you may
be asking do we have trim5 alpha or

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:06.330
be asking do we have trim5 alpha or
 

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.230
be asking do we have trim5 alpha or
maybe you're not interested is that a

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240
maybe you're not interested is that a
 

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.600
maybe you're not interested is that a
good question yeah we do but it doesn't

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:11.610
good question yeah we do but it doesn't
 

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.850
good question yeah we do but it doesn't
work to prevent HIV infection obviously

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860
work to prevent HIV infection obviously
 

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.760
work to prevent HIV infection obviously
yeah so we're not sure why but obviously

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:16.770
yeah so we're not sure why but obviously
 

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.260
yeah so we're not sure why but obviously
there was some other other evolutionary

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:18.270
there was some other other evolutionary

are virulent so virulence results from
 

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:09.080
are virulent so virulence results from
damage in the host and we're going to

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.090

fusion of neighboring infected cells so
 

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.870

talked about that before so this is

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:14.260
talked about that before so this is
 

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.530
talked about that before so this is
another mechanism of causing cell damage

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:16.540
another mechanism of causing cell damage
 

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.200

and virus infection also induces

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.210
and virus infection also induces
 

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:23.280
and virus infection also induces
programmed cell death apoptosis so these

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:23.290
programmed cell death apoptosis so these
 

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.700
programmed cell death apoptosis so these
are just some ways that we think viruses

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:25.710
are just some ways that we think viruses
 

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.980

in culture the cells look just great and
 

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.660
in culture the cells look just great and
they produce lots of virus for long

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:39.670
they produce lots of virus for long
 

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.880
they produce lots of virus for long
periods of time without being destroyed

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.950
be the various immune mediated
mechanisms by which these viruses cause

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960
mechanisms by which these viruses cause
 

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.500
mechanisms by which these viruses cause
disease in a host why these viruses are

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:37.510
disease in a host why these viruses are
 

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.140
disease in a host why these viruses are
virulent and you can see some of them

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:40.150
virulent and you can see some of them
 

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.380
virulent and you can see some of them
have cd8 positive T cell mediated

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:43.390
have cd8 positive T cell mediated
 

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:48.450
have cd8 positive T cell mediated
mechanisms cd4 positive T cells both th1

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:48.460
mechanisms cd4 positive T cells both th1
 

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.740

and th2 and antibody so basically almost

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:52.750
and th2 and antibody so basically almost
 

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.930
and th2 and antibody so basically almost
every arm of the adaptive response has

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:54.940
every arm of the adaptive response has
 

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.780
every arm of the adaptive response has
been implicated in immunopathology so

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:57.790
been implicated in immunopathology so
 

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.400
been implicated in immunopathology so
again what we're saying here is that

00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.410
again what we're saying here is that
 

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.620
again what we're saying here is that
these viruses cause damn

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:01.630
these viruses cause damn
 

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.020
these viruses cause damn
to the host via these specific mechanism

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:04.030
to the host via these specific mechanism
 

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.430
to the host via these specific mechanism
so we're gonna look at some of these in

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440
so we're gonna look at some of these in
 

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.480
so we're gonna look at some of these in
detail now so here's an experiment that

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:09.490
detail now so here's an experiment that
 

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:14.190
detail now so here's an experiment that
you can do to show that cd8 positive T

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200
you can do to show that cd8 positive T
 

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.830
you can do to show that cd8 positive T

they license ected cells that they cause

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:21.460
they license ected cells that they cause
 

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.820
they license ected cells that they cause
lethality in some cases so here you've

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:23.830
lethality in some cases so here you've
 

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.790
lethality in some cases so here you've
infected a mouse with an arena virus

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:26.800
infected a mouse with an arena virus
 

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.370

the virus of rodents usually doesn't
 

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.380
the virus of rodents usually doesn't
infect people unless you have a rodent

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:34.390
infect people unless you have a rodent
 

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.390
infect people unless you have a rodent
and you get it from your rodent and if

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:36.400
and you get it from your rodent and if
 

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.980
and you get it from your rodent and if
you happen to be immunosuppressed and

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:37.990
you happen to be immunosuppressed and
 

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.750
you happen to be immunosuppressed and
you're you can be in big trouble also

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760
you're you can be in big trouble also
 

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.080
you're you can be in big trouble also
but usually benign to people you infect

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:43.090
but usually benign to people you infect
 

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.260
but usually benign to people you infect
rodents though and within a week or so

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:45.270
rodents though and within a week or so
 

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.710
rodents though and within a week or so
they're dead

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720
they're dead
 

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.130
they're dead
lethal Koryo meningitis okay now you

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:50.140
lethal Koryo meningitis okay now you
 

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.090
lethal Koryo meningitis okay now you
immune suppress the mice after infection

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100
immune suppress the mice after infection
 

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.770
immune suppress the mice after infection
mice are fine they get a persistent

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:55.780
mice are fine they get a persistent
 

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.600
mice are fine they get a persistent
infection that is they have virus for

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:57.610
infection that is they have virus for
 

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.730
infection that is they have virus for
the rest of their life but they're okay

00:28:59.730 --> 00:28:59.740
the rest of their life but they're okay
 

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.620
the rest of their life but they're okay
so just by suppressing the immune

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:01.630
so just by suppressing the immune
 

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:03.780
so just by suppressing the immune
response with with chemical inhibitors

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:03.790
response with with chemical inhibitors
 

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.750
response with with chemical inhibitors
you can keep them healthy you don't stop

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760
you can keep them healthy you don't stop
 

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.480
you can keep them healthy you don't stop
virus replication but they're fine so

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.490
virus replication but they're fine so
 

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.370
virus replication but they're fine so
this tells you that the immune responses

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:11.380
this tells you that the immune responses
 

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.260
this tells you that the immune responses
seems to be part of the lethality now if

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:13.270
seems to be part of the lethality now if
 

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.140
seems to be part of the lethality now if
you give them what we call adoptive

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:16.150
you give them what we call adoptive
 

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.140
you give them what we call adoptive
immunization you give them t-cells from

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:19.150
immunization you give them t-cells from
 

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.180
immunization you give them t-cells from
an infected Mouse so you can infect

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:21.190
an infected Mouse so you can infect
 

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.400
an infected Mouse so you can infect
another Mouse and take out the t-cells

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:23.410
another Mouse and take out the t-cells
 

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.740
another Mouse and take out the t-cells
after a certain period of time transfer

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:25.750
after a certain period of time transfer
 

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.520
after a certain period of time transfer
them to this Mouse he dies so the

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:29.530
them to this Mouse he dies so the
 

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.620
them to this Mouse he dies so the
t-cells in fact specifically the cd8

t-cells in fact specifically the cd8
 

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.960
t-cells in fact specifically the cd8
positive T cells are what's responsible

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:33.970
positive T cells are what's responsible
 

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.410
positive T cells are what's responsible
you can purify various subsets of T

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:37.420
you can purify various subsets of T
 

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.180
you can purify various subsets of T
cells and put each one in and show which

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:39.190
cells and put each one in and show which
 

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.280
cells and put each one in and show which
one is causing the lethality so that's

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:41.290
one is causing the lethality so that's
 

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:47.010
one is causing the lethality so that's
an example of immunopathology let's go

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:47.020
an example of immunopathology let's go
 

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.750
an example of immunopathology let's go
on and talk about more of these cd8

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.730
coxsackievirus B it's a very important
infection and in fact a lot of people

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:02.740
infection and in fact a lot of people
 

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.890

infection by this virus it's very hard
 

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.940
infection by this virus it's very hard
to detect early on so but

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:14.950
to detect early on so but
 

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.950
to detect early on so but
time you do it's for the symptoms and

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960
time you do it's for the symptoms and
 

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.600
time you do it's for the symptoms and
it's too late to do anything

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:18.610
it's too late to do anything

it's too late to do anything
this virus doesn't kill myocytes

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360
this virus doesn't kill myocytes
 

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.060
this virus doesn't kill myocytes
cardiomyocytes it's non-sinusoidal so we

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.070
cardiomyocytes it's non-sinusoidal so we
 

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.600
cardiomyocytes it's non-sinusoidal so we
believe that the pathology is occurring

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:27.610
believe that the pathology is occurring
 

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.220
believe that the pathology is occurring
only in immunocompetent animals

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:29.230
only in immunocompetent animals

T cells are hurting the cardiomyocytes
they're trying to clear virus infection

00:30:40.049 --> 00:30:40.059
they're trying to clear virus infection
 

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:41.460
they're trying to clear virus infection
but in doing so they're destroying the

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:41.470
but in doing so they're destroying the
 

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.620
but in doing so they're destroying the
heart cells and that leads to heart

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:43.630
heart cells and that leads to heart
 

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.799
heart cells and that leads to heart
failure and in support of that if you

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:46.809
failure and in support of that if you
 

00:30:46.809 --> 00:30:48.779

are important for CTL mediated cell
 

00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:58.409
are important for CTL mediated cell
killing if you make mice that lack

00:30:58.409 --> 00:30:58.419
killing if you make mice that lack
 

00:30:58.419 --> 00:31:00.470
killing if you make mice that lack
perforin and then you infect them with

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480
perforin and then you infect them with
 

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.639
perforin and then you infect them with
coxsackievirus b they get less severe

00:31:02.639 --> 00:31:02.649
coxsackievirus b they get less severe
 

00:31:02.649 --> 00:31:05.909

disease shows you that the perforin

00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919
disease shows you that the perforin
 

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:07.820
disease shows you that the perforin
which is a component of cd8 positive

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:07.830
which is a component of cd8 positive

CTLs are important for development of
 

00:31:10.539 --> 00:31:12.990
CTLs are important for development of
disease we also think that these cells

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000
disease we also think that these cells
 

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000

probably we also release site cytokines

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.010
probably we also release site cytokines
 

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.549
probably we also release site cytokines
that recruit inflammatory proteins which

00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559
that recruit inflammatory proteins which
 

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:22.769
that recruit inflammatory proteins which
in turn make more cytokines and that

00:31:22.769 --> 00:31:22.779
in turn make more cytokines and that
 

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:24.810
in turn make more cytokines and that
probably contributes to the damage as

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:24.820
probably contributes to the damage as
 

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.180
probably contributes to the damage as
well so it's not just perforin but

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:27.190
well so it's not just perforin but
 

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.009
well so it's not just perforin but
probably perforin plus other things

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:29.019
probably perforin plus other things
 

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:32.070
probably perforin plus other things

made by these cells nipple and alpha you

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:36.789
made by these cells nipple and alpha you
 

00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:39.389
made by these cells nipple and alpha you
can also take the gene out of mice that

00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399
can also take the gene out of mice that
 

00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:41.129
can also take the gene out of mice that
encodes that protein and also these mice

00:31:41.129 --> 00:31:41.139
encodes that protein and also these mice
 

00:31:41.139 --> 00:31:45.419
encodes that protein and also these mice
also do not develop myocarditis so this

00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:45.429
also do not develop myocarditis so this
 

00:31:45.429 --> 00:31:47.159
also do not develop myocarditis so this
is interesting because it suggests that

00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:47.169
is interesting because it suggests that
 

00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:49.860
is interesting because it suggests that
if we could detect infection in people

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:49.870
if we could detect infection in people
 

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.680
if we could detect infection in people
very early you could perhaps inhibit

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:52.690
very early you could perhaps inhibit
 

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.799
very early you could perhaps inhibit
this CTL mediated lysis and prevent

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:55.809
this CTL mediated lysis and prevent
 

00:31:55.809 --> 00:31:58.049
this CTL mediated lysis and prevent
heart failure problem is we don't we

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:58.059
heart failure problem is we don't we
 

00:31:58.059 --> 00:32:00.330
heart failure problem is we don't we
don't know how to detect early and that

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:00.340
don't know how to detect early and that
 

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.980
don't know how to detect early and that
would involve screening everyone which

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:01.990
would involve screening everyone which
 

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.720
would involve screening everyone which
at this point is probably not

it's the calcification caused by damage

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:24.740
it's the calcification caused by damage
 

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.710
it's the calcification caused by damage
to the myocytes so this is a / 4 +

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720
to the myocytes so this is a / 4 +
 

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.240

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.120
knockout where there's very little
damage you can see so these mice don't

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:31.130
damage you can see so these mice don't
 

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:36.340
damage you can see so these mice don't
develop myocarditis okay another example

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:36.350
develop myocarditis okay another example
 

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:39.280
develop myocarditis okay another example
is liver damage caused by hepatitis B

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:39.290
is liver damage caused by hepatitis B
 

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.250
is liver damage caused by hepatitis B
virus remember that funny virus with the

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:52.820
glycoprotein the envelope glycoprotein
 

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.400
glycoprotein the envelope glycoprotein
of this virus in mice you make a

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:54.410
of this virus in mice you make a
 

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.440
of this virus in mice you make a
transgenic Mouse encoding this gene

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:56.450
transgenic Mouse encoding this gene
 

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.810
transgenic Mouse encoding this gene
there's no problem the mice are fine but

00:33:58.810 --> 00:33:58.820
there's no problem the mice are fine but
 

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.340
there's no problem the mice are fine but
if you give these mice virus specific

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:02.350
if you give these mice virus specific
 

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.710
if you give these mice virus specific
CTLs which you get from another infected

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720
CTLs which you get from another infected
 

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.400
CTLs which you get from another infected
animal

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:06.410
animal
 

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.680
animal
so you'd adoptive lis transfer those

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:08.690
so you'd adoptive lis transfer those
 

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.590
so you'd adoptive lis transfer those
CTLs into these mice now you get liver

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:11.600
CTLs into these mice now you get liver
 

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.370
CTLs into these mice now you get liver
lesions so those CTLs are killing liver

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:15.380
lesions so those CTLs are killing liver
 

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.500
lesions so those CTLs are killing liver
cells because they're expressing the

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:17.510
cells because they're expressing the
 

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.230
cells because they're expressing the
viral envelope glycoprotein of course

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240
viral envelope glycoprotein of course
 

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.550
viral envelope glycoprotein of course
so normally transgenic mice notice this

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560
so normally transgenic mice notice this
 

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.230
so normally transgenic mice notice this
protein from birth so they're tolerant

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240
protein from birth so they're tolerant
 

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.600
protein from birth so they're tolerant
to it but if you put in CTL s that

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:28.610
to it but if you put in CTL s that
 

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.310
to it but if you put in CTL s that
recognize it from another Mouse it will

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320
recognize it from another Mouse it will
 

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.110
recognize it from another Mouse it will
cause liver damage so it shows you that

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.120
cause liver damage so it shows you that
 

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.480
cause liver damage so it shows you that
in principle liver damage can be caused

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:34.490
in principle liver damage can be caused
 

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:37.150
in principle liver damage can be caused
by CTLs just like hope myocarditis can

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:37.160
by CTLs just like hope myocarditis can
 

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.200
by CTLs just like hope myocarditis can
be caused by coxsackievirus infection

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:40.210
be caused by coxsackievirus infection
 

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.180
be caused by coxsackievirus infection
so the way this works is that the CTLs

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:43.190
so the way this works is that the CTLs
 

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.830
so the way this works is that the CTLs
that you inject they attach to

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:44.840
that you inject they attach to
 

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.660
that you inject they attach to
hepatocytes and they induce apoptosis

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:46.670
hepatocytes and they induce apoptosis
 

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.300
hepatocytes and they induce apoptosis
remember I told you CTLs can not only

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:49.310
remember I told you CTLs can not only
 

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.250
remember I told you CTLs can not only
lyse target cells but they can induce

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:51.260
lyse target cells but they can induce
 

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.830
lyse target cells but they can induce
apoptosis so that's what's going on here

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:53.840
apoptosis so that's what's going on here
 

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.590
apoptosis so that's what's going on here
in addition the the CTL is reduce

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:56.600
in addition the the CTL is reduce
 

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.770
in addition the the CTL is reduce
release cytokines these recruit other

00:34:59.770 --> 00:34:59.780
release cytokines these recruit other
 

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.980
release cytokines these recruit other
cells into the area and those enhance

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:02.990
cells into the area and those enhance
 

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.690
cells into the area and those enhance
the cell death if you will better pata

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:04.700
the cell death if you will better pata
 

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.060
the cell death if you will better pata
site this so if you give these animals

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:07.070
site this so if you give these animals
 

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:12.100
site this so if you give these animals
anti interferon gamma antibody it

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.110
anti interferon gamma antibody it
 

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.290
anti interferon gamma antibody it
prevents cell killing so that tells you

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:14.300
prevents cell killing so that tells you
 

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.150
prevents cell killing so that tells you
that this is a major player it's

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160
that this is a major player it's
 

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.460
that this is a major player it's
probably being released by the CTL x'

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:18.470
probably being released by the CTL x'
 

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.070
probably being released by the CTL x'
and recruiting a lot of cells into the

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:25.420
hypersensitivity reaction anybody have
ever had a tuberculous skin test yeah so

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:25.430
ever had a tuberculous skin test yeah so
 

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.510
ever had a tuberculous skin test yeah so
you know you get a little stick with it

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520
you know you get a little stick with it
 

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.890
you know you get a little stick with it
some to tuberculosis antigen here and if

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:32.900
some to tuberculosis antigen here and if
 

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.329
some to tuberculosis antigen here and if
you have already been infected with

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:34.339
you have already been infected with
 

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:37.210
you have already been infected with
tuberculosis then you have a very rapid

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:37.220
tuberculosis then you have a very rapid
 

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.950
tuberculosis then you have a very rapid
immune response which involves

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960
immune response which involves
 

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.380
immune response which involves
recruitment of t-cells and the little

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:41.390
recruitment of t-cells and the little
 

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.540
recruitment of t-cells and the little
bump and redness that you get is a

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:43.550
bump and redness that you get is a
 

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.579
bump and redness that you get is a
delayed type hypersensitivity reaction

00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:45.589
delayed type hypersensitivity reaction
 

00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:49.180
delayed type hypersensitivity reaction
t-cells coming in okay so once my

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:49.190
t-cells coming in okay so once my
 

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:52.060
t-cells coming in okay so once my
daughter had an allergy test where they

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.070
daughter had an allergy test where they
 

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.099
daughter had an allergy test where they
put 12 pricks into your skin with

00:39:54.099 --> 00:39:54.109
put 12 pricks into your skin with
 

00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:56.109
put 12 pricks into your skin with
different allergens and you can just

00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119
different allergens and you can just
 

00:39:56.119 --> 00:39:58.060
different allergens and you can just
watch the redness growing and I said to

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:58.070
watch the redness growing and I said to
 

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.859
watch the redness growing and I said to
my daughter those are t-cells coming in

00:39:59.859 --> 00:39:59.869
my daughter those are t-cells coming in
 

00:39:59.869 --> 00:40:04.390
my daughter those are t-cells coming in
there all right this is corneal

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400
there all right this is corneal
 

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.300
there all right this is corneal
inflammation caused by a herpes virus

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:06.310
inflammation caused by a herpes virus
 

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.480
inflammation caused by a herpes virus
it's called herpes stromal keratitis one

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:10.490
it's called herpes stromal keratitis one
 

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:11.980
it's called herpes stromal keratitis one
of the most common causes of blindness

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:11.990
of the most common causes of blindness
 

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.829
of the most common causes of blindness
in developed countries and it is

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839
in developed countries and it is
 

00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:17.589
in developed countries and it is
probably entirely immuno pathological

00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599
probably entirely immuno pathological
 

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:20.680
probably entirely immuno pathological
caused by cd4 positive th1 cells so

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:20.690
caused by cd4 positive th1 cells so
 

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.290
caused by cd4 positive th1 cells so
here's an example of herpes stromal

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:23.300
here's an example of herpes stromal
 

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.130
here's an example of herpes stromal
keratitis you see this clouding of the

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:27.140
keratitis you see this clouding of the
 

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.079
keratitis you see this clouding of the
cornea so you can't see any longer

00:40:29.079 --> 00:40:29.089
cornea so you can't see any longer
 

00:40:29.089 --> 00:40:31.569
cornea so you can't see any longer
repeated infections cause opacity and

00:40:31.569 --> 00:40:31.579
repeated infections cause opacity and
 

00:40:31.579 --> 00:40:34.089
repeated infections cause opacity and
reduced vision so what happens here

00:40:34.089 --> 00:40:34.099
reduced vision so what happens here
 

00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:37.540
reduced vision so what happens here
here's a cross section of cornea so it's

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:37.550
here's a cross section of cornea so it's
 

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:41.079
here's a cross section of cornea so it's
a relatively thin tissue of course now

00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:41.089
a relatively thin tissue of course now
 

00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:42.900
a relatively thin tissue of course now
you have an epithelial layer at the top

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:42.910
you have an epithelial layer at the top
 

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.339
you have an epithelial layer at the top
which is the darker staining layer you

00:40:45.339 --> 00:40:45.349
which is the darker staining layer you
 

00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:46.480
which is the darker staining layer you
can see it better in this higher

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:46.490
can see it better in this higher
 

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.300
can see it better in this higher
magnification and then the stromal cells

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:49.310
magnification and then the stromal cells
 

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.940
magnification and then the stromal cells
below it constitute the bulk of the

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:51.950
below it constitute the bulk of the
 

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.000
below it constitute the bulk of the
cornea so what happens is the virus you

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.010
cornea so what happens is the virus you
 

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.680
cornea so what happens is the virus you
get infected with herpes or if you have

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:56.690
get infected with herpes or if you have
 

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.950
get infected with herpes or if you have
a reactivation it infects the corneal

00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960
a reactivation it infects the corneal
 

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.780
a reactivation it infects the corneal
epithelium these cells up here does not

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:01.790
epithelium these cells up here does not
 

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:06.400
epithelium these cells up here does not
infect the stromal layers below but what

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:06.410
infect the stromal layers below but what
 

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.349
infect the stromal layers below but what
you get is inflammation of C

00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359
you get is inflammation of C
 

00:41:08.359 --> 00:41:10.630
you get is inflammation of C
for positive th1 cells largely to the

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640
for positive th1 cells largely to the
 

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.789
for positive th1 cells largely to the
stroma so you can see all these darker

00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:12.799
stroma so you can see all these darker
 

00:41:12.799 --> 00:41:15.190
stroma so you can see all these darker
staining cells here these are cd4

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200
staining cells here these are cd4
 

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.160
staining cells here these are cd4
positive T lymphocytes that are coming

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:18.170
positive T lymphocytes that are coming
 

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.259
positive T lymphocytes that are coming
in but these cells are not infected so

00:41:20.259 --> 00:41:20.269
in but these cells are not infected so
 

00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:21.999
in but these cells are not infected so
presumably they are recruited there by

00:41:21.999 --> 00:41:22.009
presumably they are recruited there by
 

00:41:22.009 --> 00:41:26.190
presumably they are recruited there by
cytokines produced by the infected cells

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:26.200
cytokines produced by the infected cells
 

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.789
cytokines produced by the infected cells
by the time these cd4 positive cells are

00:41:30.789 --> 00:41:30.799
by the time these cd4 positive cells are
 

00:41:30.799 --> 00:41:32.259
by the time these cd4 positive cells are
attacking the virus infection has

00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:32.269
attacking the virus infection has
 

00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:34.479
attacking the virus infection has
actually stopped so you can see this is

00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:34.489
actually stopped so you can see this is
 

00:41:34.489 --> 00:41:36.519
actually stopped so you can see this is
sort of a late problem of the immune

00:41:36.519 --> 00:41:36.529
sort of a late problem of the immune
 

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:39.539
sort of a late problem of the immune
response and these get damaged

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:39.549
response and these get damaged
 

00:41:39.549 --> 00:41:42.460
response and these get damaged
eventually these stromal cells by the

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:42.470
eventually these stromal cells by the
 

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.049
eventually these stromal cells by the
cytokines that are produced in that

00:41:44.049 --> 00:41:44.059
cytokines that are produced in that
 

00:41:44.059 --> 00:41:47.380
cytokines that are produced in that
recruit in the cd4 positive T h1 cells

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:47.390
recruit in the cd4 positive T h1 cells
 

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.569
recruit in the cd4 positive T h1 cells
which also produce more cytokines so you

00:41:49.569 --> 00:41:49.579
which also produce more cytokines so you
 

00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:51.700
which also produce more cytokines so you
get a lot of cell damage within this

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:51.710
get a lot of cell damage within this
 

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.319
get a lot of cell damage within this
stromal layer and that causes the

00:41:53.319 --> 00:41:53.329
stromal layer and that causes the
 

00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:56.140
stromal layer and that causes the
opacity and the blindness so this is a

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:56.150
opacity and the blindness so this is a
 

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:59.289
opacity and the blindness so this is a
immunopathology cool reaction the virus

00:41:59.289 --> 00:41:59.299
immunopathology cool reaction the virus
 

00:41:59.299 --> 00:42:02.380
immunopathology cool reaction the virus
isn't even replicating here but the

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:02.390
isn't even replicating here but the
 

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.120
isn't even replicating here but the
cells that come in to try and clear the

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:04.130
cells that come in to try and clear the
 

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.549
cells that come in to try and clear the
infection up here damage the cornea

00:42:06.549 --> 00:42:06.559
infection up here damage the cornea
 

00:42:06.559 --> 00:42:37.550
infection up here damage the cornea
yeah dr. Silverstein

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560
 

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.020
so this comes this can come from another

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:40.030
so this comes this can come from another
 

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:43.470
so this comes this can come from another
person what about if you have a lesion

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480
person what about if you have a lesion
 

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.810
person what about if you have a lesion
you could you could infect your eye by

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:45.820
you could you could infect your eye by
 

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:51.690
you could you could infect your eye by
yeah yeah okay so next time you have a

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:51.700
yeah yeah okay so next time you have a
 

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.880
yeah yeah okay so next time you have a
fever sore don't be putting your finger

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:53.890
fever sore don't be putting your finger
 

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.290
fever sore don't be putting your finger
in your eye that's that that's the

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:55.300
in your eye that's that that's the
 

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.030
in your eye that's that that's the
lesson because this is a problem in

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040
lesson because this is a problem in
 

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.650
lesson because this is a problem in
developed countries that's us right okay

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:01.660
developed countries that's us right okay
 

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:06.030
developed countries that's us right okay

help B cells mature respiratory

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200
help B cells mature respiratory
 

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.830
help B cells mature respiratory
syncytial virus a really important virus

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:13.840
syncytial virus a really important virus
 

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.460
syncytial virus a really important virus
of newborn children the first few months

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:17.470
of newborn children the first few months
 

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.700
of newborn children the first few months
of age this targets them this have

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:20.710
of age this targets them this have
 

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:22.320
of age this targets them this have
caused a severe lower tract disease

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.330
caused a severe lower tract disease
 

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.200
caused a severe lower tract disease
there's not a cytolytic virus so the

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:25.210
there's not a cytolytic virus so the
 

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.800
there's not a cytolytic virus so the
disease is largely immuno pathological

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:27.810
disease is largely immuno pathological
 

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.910
disease is largely immuno pathological
now if you do an experiment you

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920
now if you do an experiment you
 

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.580
now if you do an experiment you
immunosuppressed mice you get lower

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:32.590
immunosuppressed mice you get lower
 

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.010
immunosuppressed mice you get lower
severity lesions caused by the virus

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:35.020
severity lesions caused by the virus
 

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:35.580
severity lesions caused by the virus
again

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:35.590
again
 

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.470
again
the immune responses of our but if you

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480
the immune responses of our but if you
 

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.990
the immune responses of our but if you
involve but if you transfer virus

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000
involve but if you transfer virus
 

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.600
involve but if you transfer virus
specific cd4 positive th2 cells into

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:42.610
specific cd4 positive th2 cells into
 

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.270
specific cd4 positive th2 cells into
those mice you get worse disease so

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280
those mice you get worse disease so
 

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.700
those mice you get worse disease so
these are the cells that are involved

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:46.710
these are the cells that are involved
 

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:49.470
these are the cells that are involved
now the in these mice when you transfer

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480
now the in these mice when you transfer
 

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.350
now the in these mice when you transfer
these T cells these th two cells you get

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:52.360
these T cells these th two cells you get
 

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.140
these T cells these th two cells you get
lesions with eosinophils it's thought

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:55.150
lesions with eosinophils it's thought
 

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.030
lesions with eosinophils it's thought
that these are recruited by cytokines

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040
that these are recruited by cytokines
 

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.370
that these are recruited by cytokines
that are produced by these th two cells

00:43:59.370 --> 00:43:59.380
that are produced by these th two cells
 

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.080
that are produced by these th two cells
and the eosinophils themselves are

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.090
and the eosinophils themselves are
 

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:05.840
and the eosinophils themselves are
actually causing the cell damage now

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:05.850
actually causing the cell damage now
 

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.010
actually causing the cell damage now
while we're talking about the two

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:08.020
while we're talking about the two
 

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.540
while we're talking about the two
subsets of cd4 cells CH 1 and 2 it's

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:12.550
subsets of cd4 cells CH 1 and 2 it's
 

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.180
subsets of cd4 cells CH 1 and 2 it's
useful to point out that the balance of

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:15.190
useful to point out that the balance of
 

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:17.490
useful to point out that the balance of
the two is really important for

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:17.500
the two is really important for
 

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.260
the two is really important for
determining the outcome and of infection

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:19.270
determining the outcome and of infection
 

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.860
determining the outcome and of infection
so an example is a vaccine that was

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:22.870
so an example is a vaccine that was
 

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.250
so an example is a vaccine that was
produced for RS virus so this is a

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:26.260
produced for RS virus so this is a
 

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.350
produced for RS virus so this is a
really important infection and we need

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:28.360
really important infection and we need
 

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.200
really important infection and we need
to be able to prevent it and so far our

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.210
to be able to prevent it and so far our
 

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.820
to be able to prevent it and so far our
old vaccines have failed there was one

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:32.830
old vaccines have failed there was one
 

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:33.480
old vaccines have failed there was one
made many

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:33.490
made many
 

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.870
made many
years ago now so the basis for this is

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880
years ago now so the basis for this is
 

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.480
years ago now so the basis for this is
that if you get infected and survived

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:39.490
that if you get infected and survived
 

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.400
that if you get infected and survived
then you're protected against subsequent

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:41.410
then you're protected against subsequent
 

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.930
then you're protected against subsequent
lethal disease so that means the vaccine

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:42.940
lethal disease so that means the vaccine
 

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.300
lethal disease so that means the vaccine
might work a formalin inactivated

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:45.310
might work a formalin inactivated
 

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:47.430
might work a formalin inactivated
vaccine was developed a number of years

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440
vaccine was developed a number of years
 

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.060
vaccine was developed a number of years
ago it didn't it didn't elicit a th1

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:51.070
ago it didn't it didn't elicit a th1
 

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:53.130
ago it didn't it didn't elicit a th1
response which is what virus infect

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:53.140
response which is what virus infect
 

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.550
response which is what virus infect
infection elicits it elicited a th2

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560
infection elicits it elicited a th2
 

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.210
infection elicits it elicited a th2
response so remember the cd4 cells can

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:00.220
response so remember the cd4 cells can
 

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.040
response so remember the cd4 cells can
go either way depending on what the

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:02.050
go either way depending on what the
 

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.170
go either way depending on what the
dendritic cells are telling them in the

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:04.180
dendritic cells are telling them in the
 

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.390
dendritic cells are telling them in the
livers in the lymph node but the vaccine

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400
livers in the lymph node but the vaccine
 

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.980
livers in the lymph node but the vaccine
is apparently not telling them the same

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:07.990
is apparently not telling them the same
 

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.080
is apparently not telling them the same
thing that the virus live virus

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.090
thing that the virus live virus
 

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:13.440
thing that the virus live virus
infection is now these children could

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:13.450
infection is now these children could
 

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.359
infection is now these children could
still be infected so they did a vaccine

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:15.369
still be infected so they did a vaccine
 

00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:17.310
still be infected so they did a vaccine
trial with these children they got

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:17.320
trial with these children they got
 

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.750
trial with these children they got
infected and many of them got more

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760
infected and many of them got more
 

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.359
infected and many of them got more
severe disease with a lot of eosinophils

00:45:21.359 --> 00:45:21.369
severe disease with a lot of eosinophils
 

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:23.160
severe disease with a lot of eosinophils
in the lung remember in the mouse

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:23.170
in the lung remember in the mouse
 

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:24.990
in the lung remember in the mouse
experiment the eosinophils seemed to be

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000
experiment the eosinophils seemed to be
 

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.750
experiment the eosinophils seemed to be
causing pathology so they had an

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760
causing pathology so they had an
 

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.390
causing pathology so they had an
imbalanced cd4 response by the vaccine

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400
imbalanced cd4 response by the vaccine
 

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.940
imbalanced cd4 response by the vaccine
and just last year was determined that

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:32.950
and just last year was determined that
 

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.460
and just last year was determined that
by formalin and activating the vaccine

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:35.470
by formalin and activating the vaccine
 

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:36.930
by formalin and activating the vaccine
you treat the virus with formalin at

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:36.940
you treat the virus with formalin at
 

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.640
you treat the virus with formalin at
cross-links the proteins makes the virus

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:38.650
cross-links the proteins makes the virus
 

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:39.690
cross-links the proteins makes the virus
not infectious

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:39.700
not infectious
 

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.930
not infectious
this made it a bad stimulator of a

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:42.940
this made it a bad stimulator of a
 

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.180
this made it a bad stimulator of a
toll-like receptor so one of the TLRs

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:45.190
toll-like receptor so one of the TLRs
 

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.630
toll-like receptor so one of the TLRs
recognizes the virus proteins initially

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640
recognizes the virus proteins initially
 

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.570
recognizes the virus proteins initially
and you get a very good innate response

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:51.580
and you get a very good innate response
 

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.280
and you get a very good innate response
which then helps get high affinity

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:53.290
which then helps get high affinity
 

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:55.440
which then helps get high affinity
antibodies remember the innate and

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:55.450
antibodies remember the innate and
 

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:58.290
antibodies remember the innate and
adaptive responses for length the innate

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:58.300
adaptive responses for length the innate
 

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.120
adaptive responses for length the innate
response makes cytokines that helps

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:00.130
response makes cytokines that helps
 

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.980
response makes cytokines that helps
mature a very good immune response

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:01.990
mature a very good immune response
 

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.970
mature a very good immune response
antibody response

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:02.980
antibody response
 

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.210
antibody response
well this formalin treatment wrecked the

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:06.220
well this formalin treatment wrecked the
 

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.570
well this formalin treatment wrecked the
ability of the virus to make a good TLR

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:08.580
ability of the virus to make a good TLR
 

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.430
ability of the virus to make a good TLR
response so the results are low affinity

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440
response so the results are low affinity
 

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.920
response so the results are low affinity
antibodies produced and these could not

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:13.930
antibodies produced and these could not
 

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:17.099
antibodies produced and these could not
neutralize infection in these kids so it

00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:17.109
neutralize infection in these kids so it
 

00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:18.750
neutralize infection in these kids so it
shows you that the innate response is

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760
shows you that the innate response is
 

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.460
shows you that the innate response is
really important for getting good

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:20.470
really important for getting good
 

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:23.040
really important for getting good
antibody production yes did you have a

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.050
antibody production yes did you have a
 

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:27.680
antibody production yes did you have a
question

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:27.690
 

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:39.390
right right so that's what people are

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400
right right so that's what people are
 

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.890
right right so that's what people are
doing trying to figure out how to

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:40.900
doing trying to figure out how to
 

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.080
doing trying to figure out how to
formulate the vaccine so that you get a

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:43.090
formulate the vaccine so that you get a
 

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:45.540
formulate the vaccine so that you get a
proper th1 response so we didn't

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:45.550
proper th1 response so we didn't
 

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.910
proper th1 response so we didn't
actually know this now we know the

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920
actually know this now we know the
 

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.890
actually know this now we know the
reason for that is that we have a poor

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:49.900
reason for that is that we have a poor
 

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.140
reason for that is that we have a poor
TLR stimulation so we can try and make

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:52.150
TLR stimulation so we can try and make
 

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:57.890
TLR stimulation so we can try and make
an antigen that does that properly yeah

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900
 

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.810
another example of an imbalanced

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:00.820
another example of an imbalanced
 

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.060
another example of an imbalanced
immunopathology cool response is

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.070
immunopathology cool response is
 

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:06.830
immunopathology cool response is
systemic inflammatory response syndrome

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:06.840
systemic inflammatory response syndrome
 

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.540
systemic inflammatory response syndrome
so if you're infected by a virus and

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:09.550
so if you're infected by a virus and
 

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.510
so if you're infected by a virus and
your immune system isn't controlling it

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520
your immune system isn't controlling it
 

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.710
your immune system isn't controlling it
you start to get a lot of virus

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.720
you start to get a lot of virus
 

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.240
you start to get a lot of virus
replication early on if you're an 8

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:15.250
replication early on if you're an 8
 

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.680
replication early on if you're an 8
system can't control it

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:16.690
system can't control it
 

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.109
system can't control it
remember your adaptive defenses become

00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119
remember your adaptive defenses become
 

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:21.300
remember your adaptive defenses become
mobilized you get a global response so

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:21.310
mobilized you get a global response so
 

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:23.880
mobilized you get a global response so
it because from local response to a

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:23.890
it because from local response to a
 

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.380
it because from local response to a
global response you have lots of

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:25.390
global response you have lots of
 

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.720
global response you have lots of
antibodies and cell mediated immunity

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:27.730
antibodies and cell mediated immunity
 

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.720
antibodies and cell mediated immunity
many cytokines produced if this happens

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:30.730
many cytokines produced if this happens
 

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.060
many cytokines produced if this happens
really quickly and it can happen very

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:33.070
really quickly and it can happen very
 

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:34.800
really quickly and it can happen very
quickly or if the response is not

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:34.810
quickly or if the response is not
 

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.870
quickly or if the response is not
proportional you can get a large-scale

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880
proportional you can get a large-scale
 

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.270
proportional you can get a large-scale
release of cytokines and stress

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280
release of cytokines and stress
 

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.920
release of cytokines and stress
mediators the connect these can actually

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:40.930
mediators the connect these can actually
 

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:41.550
mediators the connect these can actually
kill you

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:41.560
kill you
 

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.960
kill you
so it's look it's sort of an

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:42.970
so it's look it's sort of an
 

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.359
so it's look it's sort of an
overreaction to the infection something

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:45.369
overreaction to the infection something
 

00:47:45.369 --> 00:47:47.760
overreaction to the infection something
is imbalanced normally we have checks to

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:47.770
is imbalanced normally we have checks to
 

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.700
is imbalanced normally we have checks to
our immune responses that balance the

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:49.710
our immune responses that balance the
 

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:51.570
our immune responses that balance the
responses there are cytokines that

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:51.580
responses there are cytokines that
 

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.000
responses there are cytokines that
antagonize the positive action of other

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.010
antagonize the positive action of other
 

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.220
antagonize the positive action of other
cytokines but that can go awry sometimes

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:56.230
cytokines but that can go awry sometimes
 

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.859
cytokines but that can go awry sometimes
and then you get this a systemic

00:47:58.859 --> 00:47:58.869
and then you get this a systemic
 

00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:02.670
and then you get this a systemic
inflammatory response this happens often

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680
inflammatory response this happens often
 

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.300
inflammatory response this happens often
when it's the first infection of a host

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:06.310
when it's the first infection of a host
 

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.390
when it's the first infection of a host
with the virus or say it's a zoonotic

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400
with the virus or say it's a zoonotic
 

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.690
with the virus or say it's a zoonotic
infection where you get a infection from

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:12.700
infection where you get a infection from
 

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.920
infection where you get a infection from
an animal Ebola and Marburg viruses are

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:16.930
an animal Ebola and Marburg viruses are
 

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.840
an animal Ebola and Marburg viruses are
examples they go from animals into

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:18.850
examples they go from animals into
 

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:21.660
examples they go from animals into
people they don't typically spread from

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:21.670
people they don't typically spread from
 

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.930
people they don't typically spread from
person to person except in hospitals but

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940
person to person except in hospitals but
 

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.040
person to person except in hospitals but
normally when there's an outbreak it's a

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:26.050
normally when there's an outbreak it's a
 

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:28.290
normally when there's an outbreak it's a
fresh outbreak from an animal and so

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:28.300
fresh outbreak from an animal and so
 

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.050
fresh outbreak from an animal and so
that's that's sort of an example of an

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:31.060
that's that's sort of an example of an
 

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.220
that's that's sort of an example of an
infection where the virus is not

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:32.230
infection where the virus is not
 

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:35.970
infection where the virus is not
co-evolved with the host so we also call

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:35.980
co-evolved with the host so we also call
 

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.940
co-evolved with the host so we also call
this a cytokine storm you get a lot of

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:38.950
this a cytokine storm you get a lot of
 

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:40.140
this a cytokine storm you get a lot of
cytokines produced in this

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:40.150
cytokines produced in this
 

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.510
cytokines produced in this
to be lethal to the host and some people

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520
to be lethal to the host and some people
 

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.370
to be lethal to the host and some people
believe it might have been responsible

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:44.380
believe it might have been responsible
 

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.250
believe it might have been responsible
for the extreme lethality of the 1918

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:47.260
for the extreme lethality of the 1918

millions of people died but it's very
 

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:56.190
millions of people died but it's very
difficult to prove at this point other

pathogens can do the same thing you may

00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:58.930
pathogens can do the same thing you may
 

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.349
pathogens can do the same thing you may
have heard of toxic shock syndrome or

00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359
have heard of toxic shock syndrome or
 

00:49:01.359 --> 00:49:03.539
have heard of toxic shock syndrome or
toxic sepsis these are bacteria

00:49:03.539 --> 00:49:03.549
toxic sepsis these are bacteria
 

00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:05.700
toxic sepsis these are bacteria
bacterial infections can have the same

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:05.710
bacterial infections can have the same
 

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:07.470
bacterial infections can have the same
effect they can overwhelm your system

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480
effect they can overwhelm your system
 

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.180
effect they can overwhelm your system
you have an enormous response of

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:09.190
you have an enormous response of
 

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.279
you have an enormous response of
cytokine production a cytokine storm and

00:49:11.279 --> 00:49:11.289
cytokine production a cytokine storm and
 

00:49:11.289 --> 00:49:14.460
cytokine production a cytokine storm and
it can be lethal so that's systemic

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:14.470
it can be lethal so that's systemic
 

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:17.910
it can be lethal so that's systemic
inflammatory response syndrome here's

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920
inflammatory response syndrome here's
 

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.460
inflammatory response syndrome here's
another example of how the immune

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:20.470
another example of how the immune
 

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:23.130
another example of how the immune
response can be pathological this is

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:23.140
response can be pathological this is
 

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.980
response can be pathological this is
West Nile virus encephalitis so this is

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:25.990
West Nile virus encephalitis so this is
 

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:29.130
West Nile virus encephalitis so this is
a virus borne by mosquitoes recently

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:29.140
a virus borne by mosquitoes recently
 

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.769
a virus borne by mosquitoes recently

that's called encephalitis tlr3 seems to

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640
that's called encephalitis tlr3 seems to
 

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.059
that's called encephalitis tlr3 seems to
be playing a role in the ability of the

00:49:45.059 --> 00:49:45.069
be playing a role in the ability of the
 

00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:48.269
be playing a role in the ability of the
virus to get into the brain so if you

00:49:48.269 --> 00:49:48.279
virus to get into the brain so if you
 

00:49:48.279 --> 00:49:50.730
virus to get into the brain so if you
take away the gene for tlr3 toll-like

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:50.740
take away the gene for tlr3 toll-like
 

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.579
take away the gene for tlr3 toll-like
receptor 3 which recognizes the viral

00:49:53.579 --> 00:49:53.589
receptor 3 which recognizes the viral
 

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:56.430
receptor 3 which recognizes the viral
RNA as foreign you take away the tlr3

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440
RNA as foreign you take away the tlr3
 

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.920
RNA as foreign you take away the tlr3
gene and mice they are more resistant to

00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:58.930
gene and mice they are more resistant to
 

00:49:58.930 --> 00:49:59.609
gene and mice they are more resistant to
infection

00:49:59.609 --> 00:49:59.619
infection
 

00:49:59.619 --> 00:50:02.190

they make fewer cytokines because tlr3

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200
they make fewer cytokines because tlr3
 

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.410
they make fewer cytokines because tlr3
of course is the sensor that says AHA

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:04.420
of course is the sensor that says AHA
 

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.539
of course is the sensor that says AHA
here's a virus RNA let's make cytokines

00:50:06.539 --> 00:50:06.549
here's a virus RNA let's make cytokines
 

00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:09.150
here's a virus RNA let's make cytokines
and get this immune response going one

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:09.160
and get this immune response going one
 

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.620
and get this immune response going one
of the cytokines that would be produced

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:10.630
of the cytokines that would be produced
 

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:14.970
of the cytokines that would be produced
is TNF alpha TNF alpha is known to

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:14.980
is TNF alpha TNF alpha is known to
 

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.200
is TNF alpha TNF alpha is known to
compromise the blood-brain barrier

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:16.210
compromise the blood-brain barrier
 

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.170
compromise the blood-brain barrier
remember there is a barrier between the

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180
remember there is a barrier between the
 

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.809
remember there is a barrier between the
CNS circulation and the tissue proper

00:50:21.809 --> 00:50:21.819
CNS circulation and the tissue proper
 

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:24.359
CNS circulation and the tissue proper
and that barrier can be compromised by

00:50:24.359 --> 00:50:24.369
and that barrier can be compromised by
 

00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:27.539
and that barrier can be compromised by
cytokines like TNF alpha so if you take

00:50:27.539 --> 00:50:27.549
cytokines like TNF alpha so if you take
 

00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:30.660
cytokines like TNF alpha so if you take
away TNF by taking away tlr3 the mice

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:30.670
away TNF by taking away tlr3 the mice
 

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:33.599
away TNF by taking away tlr3 the mice
get less lethal infection so here are

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:33.609
get less lethal infection so here are
 

00:50:33.609 --> 00:50:36.240
get less lethal infection so here are
some pictures of mouse brains that shows

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:36.250
some pictures of mouse brains that shows
 

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:40.490
some pictures of mouse brains that shows
this and what what is done in these

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500
this and what what is done in these
 

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:44.609
this and what what is done in these
experiments is actually to inject the

00:50:44.609 --> 00:50:44.619
experiments is actually to inject the
 

00:50:44.619 --> 00:50:49.140
experiments is actually to inject the
mice with a dye and this dye can get

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:49.150
mice with a dye and this dye can get
 

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:52.260
mice with a dye and this dye can get
into the brain of wild-type mice so you

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:52.270
into the brain of wild-type mice so you
 

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:54.030
into the brain of wild-type mice so you
infect mice with West

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040
infect mice with West
 

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.150
infect mice with West
virus and then you inject also a dye and

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160
virus and then you inject also a dye and
 

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.860
virus and then you inject also a dye and
the dye by day three gets into the brain

00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:58.870
the dye by day three gets into the brain
 

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:00.630
the dye by day three gets into the brain
you can see the coloring the blue color

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640
you can see the coloring the blue color
 

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.180
you can see the coloring the blue color
of the brain but look if you do the same

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:03.190
of the brain but look if you do the same
 

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:06.600
of the brain but look if you do the same
experiment in a tlr3 knockout Mouse you

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:06.610
experiment in a tlr3 knockout Mouse you
 

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.340
experiment in a tlr3 knockout Mouse you
infect you infect them with virus and

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:08.350
infect you infect them with virus and
 

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:08.850
infect you infect them with virus and
die

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:08.860
die
 

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.610

the the dye takes much longer to get in

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:11.620
the the dye takes much longer to get in
 

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:14.250
the the dye takes much longer to get in
the brain and it's much less so these

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:14.260
the brain and it's much less so these
 

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.950
the brain and it's much less so these
are mice now that are surviving have

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960
are mice now that are surviving have
 

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.930
are mice now that are surviving have
have less severe encephalitis and it

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:18.940
have less severe encephalitis and it
 

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.080
have less severe encephalitis and it
looks like tlr3 is affecting the

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:22.090
looks like tlr3 is affecting the
 

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:25.560
looks like tlr3 is affecting the
permeability of the CNS via TNF alpha

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:25.570
permeability of the CNS via TNF alpha
 

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:28.020
permeability of the CNS via TNF alpha

can't recognize the double-stranded RNA
 

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.320
can't recognize the double-stranded RNA
because they have no tlr3 so there's no

because of what happens after you get
one infection so the primary infection

00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000
one infection so the primary infection
 

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.990
one infection so the primary infection
is usually asymptomatic but you may get

hemorrhagic fever which is
life-threatening and this is when you

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:29.170
life-threatening and this is when you
 

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.470
life-threatening and this is when you
are hemorrhaging your capillaries are

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480
are hemorrhaging your capillaries are
 

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.350
are hemorrhaging your capillaries are
leaking fluids and blood and it can kill

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:34.360
leaking fluids and blood and it can kill
 

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.020
leaking fluids and blood and it can kill
you you saw so much internal bleeding

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.030
you you saw so much internal bleeding
 

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.460
you you saw so much internal bleeding
that patients develop shock syndrome

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:38.470
that patients develop shock syndrome
 

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:40.950
that patients develop shock syndrome
which is frequently fatal now if you

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960
which is frequently fatal now if you
 

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.410
which is frequently fatal now if you
survive the first infection most of the

survive the first infection most of the
 

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.170
survive the first infection most of the
time you do you make antibodies to the

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:46.180
time you do you make antibodies to the
 

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.760

virus you have a memory response of

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:47.770
virus you have a memory response of
 

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:49.380
virus you have a memory response of
course but there are four different

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:49.390
course but there are four different
 

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:51.240
course but there are four different
serotypes of the virus and if you're

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:51.250
serotypes of the virus and if you're
 

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.040
serotypes of the virus and if you're
infected with one you're not protected

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.050
infected with one you're not protected
 

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:54.930
infected with one you're not protected
against the other three serotypes and

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:54.940
against the other three serotypes and
 

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.600
against the other three serotypes and
that's where the problem lies

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:56.610
that's where the problem lies
 

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:59.550
that's where the problem lies
so these non protective antibodies can

00:54:59.550 --> 00:54:59.560
so these non protective antibodies can
 

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:04.100
so these non protective antibodies can
enhance the infection of monocytes with

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:04.110
enhance the infection of monocytes with
 

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.110
enhance the infection of monocytes with
another sera type of virus so let's say

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:07.120
another sera type of virus so let's say
 

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.420
another sera type of virus so let's say
you are infected with sera type one you

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:09.430
you are infected with sera type one you
 

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:11.340
you are infected with sera type one you
recover and then a few months later

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:11.350
recover and then a few months later
 

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:14.130
recover and then a few months later
you're infected with dengue two or three

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:14.140
you're infected with dengue two or three
 

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.560
you're infected with dengue two or three
you make a memory response to dengue

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:16.570
you make a memory response to dengue
 

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.410
you make a memory response to dengue
type one those antibodies will bind

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420
type one those antibodies will bind
 

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.000
type one those antibodies will bind
dengue type - but they won't block it's

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:21.010
dengue type - but they won't block it's
 

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:21.400
dengue type - but they won't block it's
in

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:21.410
in
 

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:23.410
in
affection of cells and antibodies you

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:23.420
affection of cells and antibodies you
 

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.390
affection of cells and antibodies you
know have an FC portion and that can

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400
know have an FC portion and that can
 

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.670
know have an FC portion and that can
attach to monocytes and macrophages they

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680
attach to monocytes and macrophages they
 

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.980
attach to monocytes and macrophages they
have receptors and that lets the virus

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:29.990
have receptors and that lets the virus
 

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:31.980
have receptors and that lets the virus
get into these cells very efficiently

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:31.990
get into these cells very efficiently
 

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.030
get into these cells very efficiently
replicating them kill them and then they

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:34.040
replicating them kill them and then they
 

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.240
replicating them kill them and then they
all release cytokines and you get this

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:36.250
all release cytokines and you get this
 

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:39.130
all release cytokines and you get this
hemorrhagic fever syndrome so the

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:39.140
hemorrhagic fever syndrome so the
 

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.900
hemorrhagic fever syndrome so the
affected macrophages release cytokines

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:40.910
affected macrophages release cytokines
 

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:43.570
affected macrophages release cytokines
and those caused the severe symptoms so

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:43.580
and those caused the severe symptoms so
 

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:47.080
and those caused the severe symptoms so
the incidence of hemorrhagic fever and

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:47.090
the incidence of hemorrhagic fever and
 

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:48.790
the incidence of hemorrhagic fever and
shock syndrome is one in ninety and one

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:48.800
shock syndrome is one in ninety and one
 

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.890
shock syndrome is one in ninety and one
in fifty after your second infection so

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:50.900
in fifty after your second infection so
 

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.410
in fifty after your second infection so
this is a big problem because this is

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:53.420
this is a big problem because this is
 

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.600
this is a big problem because this is
often fatal so that's why dengue is a

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:55.610
often fatal so that's why dengue is a
 

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.010
often fatal so that's why dengue is a
big issue because we have so many

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:57.020
big issue because we have so many
 

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.370
big issue because we have so many
primary infections right now

00:55:59.370 --> 00:55:59.380
primary infections right now
 

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.890
primary infections right now
so here's a schematic of what is going

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:02.900
so here's a schematic of what is going
 

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.160
so here's a schematic of what is going
on here here's a macrophage here in

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:06.170
on here here's a macrophage here in
 

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:09.100
on here here's a macrophage here in
yellow and it is

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:09.110
yellow and it is
 

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:10.930
yellow and it is
here's dengue virus or the little black

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:10.940
here's dengue virus or the little black
 

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.740
here's dengue virus or the little black
particles here and they can be coated by

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:14.750
particles here and they can be coated by
 

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:16.930
particles here and they can be coated by
antibodies that won't block their

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:16.940
antibodies that won't block their
 

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.850
antibodies that won't block their
infectivity if these antibodies were

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:18.860
infectivity if these antibodies were
 

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.130
infectivity if these antibodies were
against the same sera type those viruses

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:21.140
against the same sera type those viruses
 

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.620
against the same sera type those viruses
would not be able to infect cells but if

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:23.630
would not be able to infect cells but if
 

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:25.540
would not be able to infect cells but if
they're the wrong sera type they will

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:25.550
they're the wrong sera type they will
 

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:27.970
they're the wrong sera type they will
let the virus get into macrophages by FC

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:27.980
let the virus get into macrophages by FC
 

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.980
let the virus get into macrophages by FC
receptors those are these blue molecules

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:29.990
receptors those are these blue molecules
 

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:32.680
receptors those are these blue molecules
here macrophages get infected then they

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:32.690
here macrophages get infected then they
 

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:34.960
here macrophages get infected then they
start releasing cytokines like TNF alpha

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:34.970
start releasing cytokines like TNF alpha
 

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:38.080
start releasing cytokines like TNF alpha
which makes your your capillaries

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:38.090
which makes your your capillaries
 

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:40.510
which makes your your capillaries
permeable it activates complement so you

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520
permeable it activates complement so you
 

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.640
permeable it activates complement so you
get plasma leakage and then you have of

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:42.650
get plasma leakage and then you have of
 

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.260
get plasma leakage and then you have of
course the macrophage is being attacked

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:44.270
course the macrophage is being attacked
 

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.410
course the macrophage is being attacked
by CTLs and that releasing even more

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:47.420
by CTLs and that releasing even more
 

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.720
by CTLs and that releasing even more
cytokines so you have this is a theory

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:49.730
cytokines so you have this is a theory
 

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.700
cytokines so you have this is a theory
and there's some evidence for this in

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:51.710
and there's some evidence for this in
 

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:54.220
and there's some evidence for this in
mice but it seems to make some sense so

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:54.230
mice but it seems to make some sense so
 

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:56.440
mice but it seems to make some sense so
there's a lot of effort to make a dengue

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:56.450
there's a lot of effort to make a dengue
 

00:56:56.450 --> 00:57:01.500
there's a lot of effort to make a dengue
vaccine at the moment as a consequence

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:01.510
 

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:04.930
another form of immunopathology is the

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:04.940
another form of immunopathology is the
 

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.860
another form of immunopathology is the
deposition of immune complexes so when

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:08.870
deposition of immune complexes so when
 

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:11.770
deposition of immune complexes so when
you get a lot of virus multiplication

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:11.780
you get a lot of virus multiplication
 

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.200
you get a lot of virus multiplication
you know you have a good antibody

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:14.210
you know you have a good antibody
 

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:18.280
you know you have a good antibody
response within a few weeks you in in

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:18.290
response within a few weeks you in in
 

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:20.950
response within a few weeks you in in
certain areas you can get formation of

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960
certain areas you can get formation of
 

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.010
certain areas you can get formation of
virus antibody complexes and these are

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:24.020
virus antibody complexes and these are
 

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.110
virus antibody complexes and these are
not cleared by your reticuloendothelial

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:26.120
not cleared by your reticuloendothelial
 

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.710
not cleared by your reticuloendothelial
system they circulate in the blood and

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720
system they circulate in the blood and
 

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.540
system they circulate in the blood and
so basically you have circulating virus

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:31.550
so basically you have circulating virus
 

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:33.370
so basically you have circulating virus
receptor antibodies if they're not

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:33.380
receptor antibodies if they're not
 

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.310
receptor antibodies if they're not
cleared they can clog

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:35.320
cleared they can clog
 

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.650
cleared they can clog
shoes that have very fine capillaries

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:37.660
shoes that have very fine capillaries
 

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.350
shoes that have very fine capillaries
one of those is the kidney so here's a

00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:40.360
one of those is the kidney so here's a
 

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.050
one of those is the kidney so here's a
diagram of the capillary in a glimmer

deposits are shown here in red they can
 

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:52.550
deposits are shown here in red they can
clog these interstitial spaces and

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:52.560
clog these interstitial spaces and
 

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.620
clog these interstitial spaces and
eventually the fluid cannot leave the

so autoimmune disease is when you make
 

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.660
so autoimmune disease is when you make
an immune response against your host

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:24.670
an immune response against your host

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:37.420
trigger autoimmune responses you infect
 

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.450
trigger autoimmune responses you infect
an animal the animal makes antibodies to

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:39.460
an animal the animal makes antibodies to
 

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.580
an animal the animal makes antibodies to
the virus and some of those react with

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:41.590
the virus and some of those react with
 

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:44.460
the virus and some of those react with
the animals tissues whether this is true

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:44.470
the animals tissues whether this is true
 

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.560
the animals tissues whether this is true
in humans or not it's still up in the

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:46.570
in humans or not it's still up in the
 

00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:48.160
in humans or not it's still up in the
air as far as I can tell

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:48.170
air as far as I can tell
 

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:50.540
air as far as I can tell
how does this work so there are a couple

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:50.550
how does this work so there are a couple
 

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.370
how does this work so there are a couple
of mechanisms that we'll talk about one

00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:52.380
of mechanisms that we'll talk about one
 

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.910
of mechanisms that we'll talk about one
is the virus might replicate in a site

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920
is the virus might replicate in a site
 

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.450
is the virus might replicate in a site
that is normally sequestered so the it's

00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.460
that is normally sequestered so the it's
 

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.860
that is normally sequestered so the it's
not recognized by the immune response

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:00.870
not recognized by the immune response
 

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:02.810
not recognized by the immune response
but the consequence of virus

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:02.820
but the consequence of virus
 

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.520
but the consequence of virus
multiplication there is that antigens

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:04.530
multiplication there is that antigens
 

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.050
multiplication there is that antigens
are released which are not normally

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:06.060
are released which are not normally
 

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:09.290
are released which are not normally
recognized as self those are now exposed

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:09.300
recognized as self those are now exposed
 

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.750
recognized as self those are now exposed
and you get an autoimmune response so

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760
and you get an autoimmune response so
 

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.110
and you get an autoimmune response so
that's one mechanism shown in animals

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:14.120
that's one mechanism shown in animals
 

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.060
that's one mechanism shown in animals
virus replication as you know leads to

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:17.070
virus replication as you know leads to
 

01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:19.160
virus replication as you know leads to
the production of cytokines or

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:19.170
the production of cytokines or
 

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:22.400
the production of cytokines or
complement and these activate proteases

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:22.410
complement and these activate proteases
 

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:26.300
complement and these activate proteases
that can unmask normally hidden self

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:26.310
that can unmask normally hidden self
 

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:29.450
that can unmask normally hidden self
antigens and that ends up making an

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460
antigens and that ends up making an
 

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.580
antigens and that ends up making an
antibody response against the self

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:31.590
antibody response against the self
 

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:35.060
antibody response against the self
antigen then the third mechanism is what

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:35.070
antigen then the third mechanism is what
 

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.130
antigen then the third mechanism is what
is called molecular mimicry so those

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140
is called molecular mimicry so those
 

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.590
is called molecular mimicry so those
first two involve exposure by virus

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:39.600
first two involve exposure by virus
 

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.380
first two involve exposure by virus
infection of self antigens the third one

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:42.390
infection of self antigens the third one
 

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:44.930
infection of self antigens the third one
is something in common between the virus

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940
is something in common between the virus
 

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.260
is something in common between the virus
and and our host proteins so here we

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:48.270
and and our host proteins so here we
 

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:49.940
and and our host proteins so here we
have a situation where viral and host

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:49.950
have a situation where viral and host
 

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.880
have a situation where viral and host
proteins share antigenic determinants so

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:52.890
proteins share antigenic determinants so
 

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:54.830
proteins share antigenic determinants so
you get infection you get an immune

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:54.840
you get infection you get an immune
 

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.450
you get infection you get an immune
response against the virus and some of

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460
response against the virus and some of
 

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.750
response against the virus and some of
those antibodies react against you as

01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760
those antibodies react against you as
 

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.690
those antibodies react against you as
well now if you take all the proteins

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700
well now if you take all the proteins
 

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.150
well now if you take all the proteins
encoded by us and you compare them to

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160
encoded by us and you compare them to
 

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.010
encoded by us and you compare them to
all the viral proteins you're bound to

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020
all the viral proteins you're bound to
 

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.080
all the viral proteins you're bound to
get something similar especially if you

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:09.090
get something similar especially if you
 

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.940
get something similar especially if you
look at an epitope which is short about

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:10.950
look at an epitope which is short about
 

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:13.130
look at an epitope which is short about
10 amino acids or so so there are a lot

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140
10 amino acids or so so there are a lot
 

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:16.940
10 amino acids or so so there are a lot
of common sequences and it's not clear

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:16.950
of common sequences and it's not clear
 

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:19.790
of common sequences and it's not clear
whether this is actually a problem in

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:19.800
whether this is actually a problem in
 

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.500
whether this is actually a problem in
people you can show this experimentally

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:21.510
people you can show this experimentally
 

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:23.540
people you can show this experimentally
in a variety of ways but again there's

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:23.550
in a variety of ways but again there's
 

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:26.120
in a variety of ways but again there's
no clear evidence in people so here's

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:26.130
no clear evidence in people so here's
 

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.970
no clear evidence in people so here's
some example of epitopes the short amino

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980
some example of epitopes the short amino
 

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.830
some example of epitopes the short amino
acid sequence is shared between virus

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:30.840
acid sequence is shared between virus
 

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.620
acid sequence is shared between virus
proteins and host proteins here's capsid

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:33.630
proteins and host proteins here's capsid
 

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.800

protein of polio and a sequence from the

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:36.810
protein of polio and a sequence from the
 

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:39.320
protein of polio and a sequence from the
acetylcholine receptor now you can make

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:39.330
acetylcholine receptor now you can make
 

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:41.450
acetylcholine receptor now you can make
these peptides you can make antibodies

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460
these peptides you can make antibodies
 

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.890
these peptides you can make antibodies
against them and show that the

01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900
against them and show that the
 

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.050
against them and show that the
antibodies will cross react that's what

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:45.060
antibodies will cross react that's what
 

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.720
antibodies will cross react that's what
this means here but it's never been

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:47.730
this means here but it's never been
 

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:49.880
this means here but it's never been
shown that in people you're making

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:49.890
shown that in people you're making
 

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:52.130
shown that in people you're making
antibodies against your acetylcholine

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140
antibodies against your acetylcholine
 

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.020

receptor if you're infected with polio
 

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:56.210
receptor if you're infected with polio
and again you have examples here

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220
and again you have examples here
 

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.430
and again you have examples here
papilloma virus and insulin receptor

01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440
papilloma virus and insulin receptor
 

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.760
papilloma virus and insulin receptor
rabies and insulin receptor HIV and

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:01.770
rabies and insulin receptor HIV and
 

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:05.150

immunoglobulin sequence and measles and

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160
immunoglobulin sequence and measles and
 

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.370
immunoglobulin sequence and measles and
cortical troph and so you know some

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380
cortical troph and so you know some
 

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.930
cortical troph and so you know some
cases these are pretty good homologies

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940
cases these are pretty good homologies
 

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.450
cases these are pretty good homologies
but whether this is actually an issues

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.460
but whether this is actually an issues
 

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.630
but whether this is actually an issues
is not really clear

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640
is not really clear
 

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.810
is not really clear
another effective virus infection is

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:16.820
another effective virus infection is
 

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:20.120
another effective virus infection is
immunosuppression and that means that

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:20.130
immunosuppression and that means that
 

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.980
immunosuppression and that means that
some virus infection have a global

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:21.990
some virus infection have a global
 

01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:25.030
some virus infection have a global
effect on reducing immune responses

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:25.040
effect on reducing immune responses
 

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.070
effect on reducing immune responses
mechanisms involve the virus replicating

01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:28.080
mechanisms involve the virus replicating
 

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.990
mechanisms involve the virus replicating
in some immune cell that will do immuno

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000
in some immune cell that will do immuno
 

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.570
in some immune cell that will do immuno
suppression if you get infected as a

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:32.580
suppression if you get infected as a
 

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.330
suppression if you get infected as a
fetus you typically get tolerant to the

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:35.340
fetus you typically get tolerant to the
 

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.370
fetus you typically get tolerant to the
virus and then that can immunosuppressed

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380
virus and then that can immunosuppressed
 

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.090
virus and then that can immunosuppressed
as you age the virus infection can can

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:41.100
as you age the virus infection can can
 

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.550
as you age the virus infection can can
mess with cytokines or signaling that

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:43.560
mess with cytokines or signaling that
 

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.260
mess with cytokines or signaling that
are that's involved in cytokine

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:45.270
are that's involved in cytokine
 

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.760
are that's involved in cytokine
production that can cause immuno

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:46.770
production that can cause immuno
 

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.070
production that can cause immuno
suppression and even these virus

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:49.080
suppression and even these virus
 

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.560
suppression and even these virus

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:51.570
scepters and viral kinds the evasion
 

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:54.190
scepters and viral kinds the evasion
that's done by them is a form of

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200
that's done by them is a form of
 

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.470
that's done by them is a form of
immunosuppression here's an experiment

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480
immunosuppression here's an experiment
 

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.180
immunosuppression here's an experiment
that illustrates what we're talking

01:02:59.180 --> 01:02:59.190
that illustrates what we're talking
 

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:03.680
that illustrates what we're talking
about so here what was done was to take

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:03.690
about so here what was done was to take
 

01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:06.710
about so here what was done was to take
an animal and actually I think this is a

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720
an animal and actually I think this is a
 

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.280
an animal and actually I think this is a
human with measles so they give a tine

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:10.290
human with measles so they give a tine
 

01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:12.890
human with measles so they give a tine
test a tuberculin tine test to these

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900
test a tuberculin tine test to these
 

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.770
test a tuberculin tine test to these
individuals and if they're uninfected

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780
individuals and if they're uninfected
 

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.540
individuals and if they're uninfected
you get a certain amount of in duration

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:17.550
you get a certain amount of in duration
 

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:20.810
you get a certain amount of in duration
the raising of the of the swelling the

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:20.820
the raising of the of the swelling the
 

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.560
the raising of the of the swelling the
delayed type hypersensitivity and then a

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:24.570
delayed type hypersensitivity and then a
 

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:26.840
delayed type hypersensitivity and then a
child who has measles if you give them a

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:26.850
child who has measles if you give them a
 

01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:29.060
child who has measles if you give them a
timed test initially they have no they

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.070
timed test initially they have no they
 

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:33.830
timed test initially they have no they

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:33.840
have no in duration from the TB test so
 

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.900
have no in duration from the TB test so
this is weeks after the rash of measles

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:35.910
this is weeks after the rash of measles
 

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:40.090
this is weeks after the rash of measles
appears so you can see very early on the

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:40.100
appears so you can see very early on the
 

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.310
appears so you can see very early on the
delayed type hypersensitivity to the

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:43.320
delayed type hypersensitivity to the
 

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.950
delayed type hypersensitivity to the
tuberculin antigen is suppressed by

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960
tuberculin antigen is suppressed by
 

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.110
tuberculin antigen is suppressed by
measles and then eventually as the

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:48.120
measles and then eventually as the
 

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.300
measles and then eventually as the
measles infection wanes then you get a a

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:50.310
measles infection wanes then you get a a
 

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.520
measles infection wanes then you get a a
reaction so an example of

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:52.530
reaction so an example of
 

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.250

immunosuppression by measles virus so

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260
immunosuppression by measles virus so
 

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:57.200

get a
just and rubella infection so you can't

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:17.310
just and rubella infection so you can't
 

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:20.720
just and rubella infection so you can't
clear it and of course HIV probably the

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:20.730

opportunistic infections and cancer and

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:35.340
opportunistic infections and cancer and
 

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.290

that's what ends up killing you measles

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:39.300
that's what ends up killing you measles
 

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.120

cells and monocytes actually get
 

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:50.650
cells and monocytes actually get
infected so when that happens

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:50.660
 

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.670
remember the dendritic cells are

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:36.559
in people now we can sequence genomes
and look at mutations associated with

01:07:36.559 --> 01:07:36.569
and look at mutations associated with
 

01:07:36.569 --> 01:07:38.120
and look at mutations associated with
susceptibility and this is one of the

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:38.130
susceptibility and this is one of the
 

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:44.120
susceptibility and this is one of the
more recent one that has come out herpes

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:44.130
more recent one that has come out herpes
 

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:48.200
more recent one that has come out herpes
encephalitis herpes encephalitis yes

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:48.210
encephalitis herpes encephalitis yes
 

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:56.180
encephalitis herpes encephalitis yes
herpes simplex encephalitis yeah viral

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:56.190
herpes simplex encephalitis yeah viral
 

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:58.640
herpes simplex encephalitis yeah viral
encephalitis is infection of the pia the

01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:58.650
encephalitis is infection of the pia the
 

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:01.640
encephalitis is infection of the pia the
brain matter with a virus and meningitis

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:01.650
brain matter with a virus and meningitis
 

01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:05.890
brain matter with a virus and meningitis
is is an infection of the meninges right

01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:05.900
is is an infection of the meninges right
 

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:09.740
is is an infection of the meninges right
so it can as far as viruses go there are

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:09.750
so it can as far as viruses go there are
 

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:11.000
so it can as far as viruses go there are
other things that can cause encephalitis

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:11.010
other things that can cause encephalitis
 

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.440
other things that can cause encephalitis
but when we talk about viral

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:12.450
but when we talk about viral
 

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:13.730
but when we talk about viral
encephalitis were talking about

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740
encephalitis were talking about
 

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.829
encephalitis were talking about
replication in the cells that comprise

01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839
replication in the cells that comprise
 

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:21.320

01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:36.860
present antigens to lymphocytes and it's
been shown that certain MHCs are simply

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:36.870
been shown that certain MHCs are simply
 

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:38.900

Nile virus infection and you can see
 

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:04.630
Nile virus infection and you can see
this is age specific ld50 titer so this

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640
this is age specific ld50 titer so this
 

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.580
this is age specific ld50 titer so this
is increasing age and this is the amount

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:06.590
is increasing age and this is the amount
 

01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:08.890

of virus you need to kill 50 percent of
 

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.919
of virus you need to kill 50 percent of
the animals so at a very young age you

01:10:11.919 --> 01:10:11.929
the animals so at a very young age you
 

01:10:11.929 --> 01:10:14.560
the animals so at a very young age you
need a lot of virus to kill half the

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:14.570
need a lot of virus to kill half the
 

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:16.419
need a lot of virus to kill half the
animals and you need less as you get

01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:16.429
animals and you need less as you get
 

01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:19.169

young adults 18 to 30 years old and we
 

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:04.660
young adults 18 to 30 years old and we
don't know why that is many other

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:04.670
don't know why that is many other
 

01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:06.880
don't know why that is many other
infections are milder at young ages

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:06.890
infections are milder at young ages
 

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:09.640
infections are milder at young ages
rather than old ones polio for example

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:09.650
rather than old ones polio for example
 

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:11.740

is very mild at a young age

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:11.750
is very mild at a young age
 

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:13.840
is very mild at a young age
we don't really understand that it could

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:13.850
we don't really understand that it could
 

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:15.669
we don't really understand that it could
be that there's a balance of protective

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679
be that there's a balance of protective
 

01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.680
be that there's a balance of protective
and pathogenic responses so maybe when

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:17.690
and pathogenic responses so maybe when
 

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:20.439
and pathogenic responses so maybe when
you're young you don't make as many

01:12:20.439 --> 01:12:20.449
you're young you don't make as many
 

01:12:20.449 --> 01:12:22.510
you're young you don't make as many
immuno pathological responses to

01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:22.520
immuno pathological responses to
 

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.800
immuno pathological responses to
infection and so some of these

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:23.810
infection and so some of these
 

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:26.560
infection and so some of these
infections are less severe this is a

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:26.570
infections are less severe this is a
 

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:30.970
infections are less severe this is a

susceptible this is death rate according
 

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:42.760
susceptible this is death rate according
to age and in 1918 there was this

unusual spike in the middle in addition

01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199
unusual spike in the middle in addition
 

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:46.450

to the young and old we still don't
 

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:50.500
to the young and old we still don't
understand why that is and here's an

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:50.510

not simply the case that the very young
 

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:14.529
not simply the case that the very young
and the very old are always more

males are slightly more susceptible

01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920
males are slightly more susceptible
 

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.370

susceptible to infection with a number

01:13:23.109 --> 01:13:23.119
susceptible to infection with a number
 

01:13:23.119 --> 01:13:25.290
susceptible to infection with a number
of viruses and you may remember that

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:25.300
of viruses and you may remember that
 

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.839

when pandemic influenza merged in 2009

01:13:28.839 --> 01:13:28.849
when pandemic influenza merged in 2009
 

01:13:28.849 --> 01:13:31.479

faster rate than others malnutrition

01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800
faster rate than others malnutrition
 

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.399
faster rate than others malnutrition
also increases susceptibility because of

01:13:36.399 --> 01:13:36.409
also increases susceptibility because of
 

01:13:36.409 --> 01:13:38.680
also increases susceptibility because of
its effects on the immune response and

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:38.690
its effects on the immune response and
 

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:41.290
its effects on the immune response and
this is why measles is 300 times more

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:41.300
this is why measles is 300 times more
 

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.810
this is why measles is 300 times more
lethal in developing countries because

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:43.820
lethal in developing countries because
 

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.870
lethal in developing countries because
of malnutrition can be a death sentence

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880
of malnutrition can be a death sentence
 

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.200
of malnutrition can be a death sentence
in those countries
