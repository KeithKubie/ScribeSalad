ZEINA OWEIS: Hi.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.220
My name is Zeina, and
I'm a product manager

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.120
on the Google Play team.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.064
As a developer for a
great Google Play app,

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.480
you're probably
thinking about how

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.020
to cover the cost
of your business.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.380
And who doesn't
like to make money?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.240
One way to monetize
your apps and games

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.400
is using one-time purchases.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.230
But you may be able
to better monetize

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.200
your apps through
subscription-based payments.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.760
Subscriptions are
great because they

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.405
allow you to form this ongoing
relationship with your buyers.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.430
Subscriptions are a win-win.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.810
Users sign up for these
auto-recurring payments

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.960
because they get the same great
value at a discounted price.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.880
And in turn, you will get more
revenue and more happy buyers.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.660
And subscriptions
currently work for apps

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.140
across a variety of categories,
news apps like "The New York

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.810
Times," sports apps like MLB
At Bat, and educational games

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.930
like those developed
by SmartEducation.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.710
And subscriptions on Google
Play have been growing,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.750
and they continue to grow
quarter over quarter.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.810
Google Play Subscriptions is
included in our in-app billing

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.300
service, so you will get
the same great benefits

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.330
you're used to with
one-time time purchases,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.510
including global
payments and automated

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.330
financial reporting
and deposits.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.910
So your app never has
to directly process

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.800
any financial transactions.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.317
On top of that,
in-app billing takes

00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:20.150
care of the headaches
of recurring payments,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.290
so you can focus on
building a great service

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.450
and a successful business model.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.270
The developer console gives you
full control over the pricing

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.662
and the billing periods of
each subscription product.

00:01:30.662 --> 00:01:33.120
Choose the billing period that
works best for your service.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.780
We currently support monthly
and annual subscriptions,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.220
and soon we'll support weekly
and seasonal recurrence

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.584
periods as well.

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:41.750
You can offer users multiple
options to choose from.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.320
For example, you can
create a basic plan

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.210
that costs $5 a month and a pro
plan that costs $10 a month.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.110
And free trials are a great way
to encourage users to try out

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.567
the service before committing
to the recurring payments.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.650
Consult with your favorite
marketing professional.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.520
They'll probably tell you that
free trials is the way to go.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.020
When you add a
subscription product,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.510
one of the options
that you can set

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.810
is how long that trial
period should last.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.150
Of course, if you do choose
to offer a trial period,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.080
the user who signs
up won't be charged

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.919
until after the trial
period has ended.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.720
And like other
in-app items, you can

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.790
use Version 3 of the
in-app billing API

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.920
to validate the status
of a subscription

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190
when users sign
into your service.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.570
GetPurchases will return any
active subscription, including

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.660
ones in the trial
period and also ones

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.260
that have been canceled up until
the end of that billing period.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.860
You can also fire up a purchase
intent by calling GetBuyIntent.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.360
It's used almost the same way
as it's used for in-app items.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.030
Just pass Item_Type_Subs
with the skew ID

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.670
of your subscription product.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.890
The purchase token can
be used for synchronizing

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.830
the subscription state
between your back end

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.320
servers and Google Play.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.110
So what about maintaining
those subscribers?

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.490
Sometimes, they may not
be completely satisfied

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.320
with the service that
you provide them.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.980
If that ever happens,
you will soon

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.400
be able to offer them a free
week or two as a goodwill

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.270
gesture.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.820
If you do that,
they will be happy

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.474
and may continue
the subscription.

00:02:59.474 --> 00:03:01.640
Even better, when they know
that you are practically

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.434
compensating them for any
unforeseen bad service,

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.850
they will spread
the word, and you

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.130
will get more
people to subscribe.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.040
Sadly, they will
sometimes still want

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.600
to cancel their subscription.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.530
Again, you can do
that via the API.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.550
You can cancel the
subscription at the end

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.200
of their current billing period.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.910
And soon, you will also be
able to revoke it immediately

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.390
with a full refund.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.020
What if you come up with a
new great subscription plan,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.110
or you want your satisfied users
to move from, say, the monthly

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.330
to the annual plan?

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.400
Well, soon you'll be
able to easily trigger

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.810
a purchase intent for
the new subscription plan

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.430
and allow users to switch
from one tier to the other.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.730
So what's next?

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.800
Well, if your app
can offer great value

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.320
to your users via
subscriptions, in-app billing

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.680
is as easy to use for
subscription-based payments

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.540
as it is for one-time payments.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.450
And as I said, when
it comes to payments,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.850
there's nothing for you to do.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.520
We process all
recurring payments

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.150
and deposit them into your
designated bank account.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.260
So you get to focus on
what you do best, which

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.002
is creating beautiful,
engaging apps and games.

00:03:58.002 --> 00:03:59.710
If you're ready to
get started, check out

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.087
the documentation on the
Developer Help Center.

00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:03.920
With the power of Google
Play subscriptions,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.900
it's never been easier to create
meaningful and long-lasting

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.280
relationship with your users.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.040
So go out and build
something great,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.120
and thank you for watching.
