00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:16.500
The book, which was Lee’s first and only
published novel until recently, was heralded

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.409
as an “instant classic” when it was published
in 1960, and it is a staple in high school

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:22.769
classrooms today.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.890
But it might not exist at all if it hadn’t
been for a kind benefactor who helped to support

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.810
Harper Lee while she wrote the story.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.870
Lee knew that she wanted to be a writer after
developing an interest in English literature

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.090
in high school.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.410
After graduation, she attended Huntingdon
College in Montgomery, Alabama, where she

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.460
focused on writing.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.010
However, a transfer to the University of Alabama
saw a switch to a law degree—no doubt in

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.320
an attempt to do something that was potentially
more lucrative—before turning her sights

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.100
back on writing again.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.160
She wrote for the school paper before she
dropped out of college entirely, opting instead

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.670
to move to New York to pursue a career in
writing.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.430
The problem is, you can’t produce a best-selling
novel overnight, and you have to eat somehow.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.260
Lee ended up taking a job as an airline ticket
agent, where she worked for several years.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
She was struggling with something all budding
authors find difficult to balance: having

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.780
the time and energy to write and the money
to support herself while doing so.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.690
Luckily for Lee, she had befriended Michael
and Joy Brown.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.170
Michael was a popular composer and lyricist
who worked on Broadway, and was quite well

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.190
off financially.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.280
For Christmas in 1956, the couple gave Lee
a generous present: a year’s worth of wages.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.800
With the money came a note saying, “You
have one year off from your job to write whatever

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.800
you please.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.400
Merry Christmas.”

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.590
Who could say no to that?

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.650
Lee quit her day job with the airline shortly
thereafter, and was free to write what she

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.120
wanted, producing the story that would become
To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.280
But that wasn’t the end of the Browns’
generosity.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.750
They were also able to put her in touch with
a literary agent, Maurice Crain, who would

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.860
later help Lee get her bestselling novel published.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.970
Reportedly, the first draft read like several
short stories stitched together rather than

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.580
a seamlessly written novel.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.270
Lee worked with editor Tay Hohoff to rework
the initial manuscript, and two and a half

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.800
years of rewrites followed.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.360
She was warned that the book probably wouldn’t
sell more than few thousand copies.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.340
However, Lee’s hard work had paid off more
than anyone could have expected.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.209
Perhaps published at just the right time—dealing
with racial issues just as the civil rights

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.740
movement was kicking off in earnest—the
book’s popularity skyrocketed shortly after

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.840
publication in 1960.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.240
It was picked up by the Book-of-the-Month
Club and the Literary Guild, featured in Reader’s

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.599
Digest, and won a variety of literary awards,
including the prestigious Pulitzer Prize.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.870
By 1962, it had been made into an award-winning
movie.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.640
Needless to say, Lee was doing quite well.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.220
Over 30 million copies of the book have now
been sold, and it has been translated into

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.630
40 different languages.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.960
In 2009, it was reported that Lee was still
earning $9,249 every day in royalties from

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960
To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960
At the moment, it’s estimated that Lee’s
estate is worth over $45 million, and it’s

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
estimated she’ll be earning $3-$4 million
every year until she dies—and likely as

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
long as the copyright lasts after her death,
too.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.490
No word on if she paid back the Browns who
gave her the year’s wages that enabled her

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.250
to see such success.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.790
As to why she wasn’t interested in continuing
to write and publish books after such a stunning

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.770
debut, she had this to say,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.020
Two reasons: one, I wouldn’t go through
the pressure and publicity I went through

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.590
with To Kill a Mockingbird for any amount
of money.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:44.140
Second, I have said what I wanted to say 
and I will not say it again.
