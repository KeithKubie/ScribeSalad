00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.370
I want you to meet Henrietta Lacks, who's

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.810
had a hand in changing medical biology and

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.370
genetics for the better, even today. I want to

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.280
share with you a short version of the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.560
story of Henrietta Lacks. But the longer version

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.870
is documented in detail in Rebecca Skloot's 2010

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.240
book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. In

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.810
1951, Henrietta was unknowingly suffering from cervical cancer.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.430
After admission and treatment at the only hospital in the proximity that would

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.420
admit black patients, Johns Hopkins Hospital. Two

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.500
samples of Henrietta's cervix tissue were removed.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.490
Including a cancerous portion without her permission.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.100
Although Henrietta died on October 4th, 1951,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.320
due to her metastasized cancer, the cells from the tissue biopsy from her cervix

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.960
continued to be grown in the lab to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.190
this day. Known as HeLa cells, He for Henrietta

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.000
and La for Lacks. They were the first human

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.430
cells that scientists could keep growing in the lab

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.130
long enough to start actually doing real research.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.370
Most human cells would grow for a few days

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.870
and then die, but HeLa cells kept growing and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.370
growing. As a result, the cells were commercialized and

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.950
distributed all over the world. HeLa cells were

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980
used in the development of the Salk vaccine

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.910
for Polio. HeLa cells have also been used

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.460
for cancer research, AIDS research, gene mapping and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.876
countless other amazing medical advances. And in the

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:36.188
spring of 2013, finally, the genome sequence of

00:01:36.188 --> 00:01:38.852
HeLa cells was published for the whole world

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:43.090
to see. In return for the outrageous contributions

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.570
of HeLa cells, despite the fact that they were taken

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.900
and used without the consent of Henrietta herself. What compensation do

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.500
you think's been provided to her family over the years

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.370
since her death? Do you think that there's a multimillion dollar

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.140
trust fund, that's been sent from labs and pharmaceutical companies

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.740
all over the world that used HeLa cells for discoveries? Or

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.290
do you think that 0.1% of all profits from biotech

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.590
companies that use HeLa cells go to the family every year?

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.890
Or is there $1 million that was paid in a lump sum just

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.180
once to the family from the NIH? Or is it that $50,000 was paid

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.030
to each family member, from the Johns

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.670
Hopkins Hospital, where the cells were originally

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.980
isolated? Or do you think that there's

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.380
been no real financial compensation at all?
