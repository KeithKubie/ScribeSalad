00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.220
Until about 12,000 years ago, the largest group of people
ever assembled, the most humans ever gathered in one
place, was probably a crowd of about 100, tops.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.720
And there were somewhere between one and ten
million people on the entire planet back then.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.990
Today, we have football stadiums that can
fit a hundred people a thousand times over.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.269
The city of Shanghai has a population of over
24 million.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.029
And there are almost 7.5 billion people on
Earth!

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.339
How the heck did we get from there to here?

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.300
That might sound like a history question,
and it is, partly.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.260
But it's also a sociology question.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.500
Because, if we want to understand
how we got from small groups huddled
around a fire to cities of millions,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.760
we need to understand what society is and
how societies change as their populations grow.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.820
And we need to understand how different kinds
of societies shape the people who live in them.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.720
Pretty much any question you can ask about
society, you can answer with the help of sociology.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:01.460
[Theme Music]

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.360
As long as there have been humans, there have
been societies.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.460
We're social animals, and even when there
were mere handfuls of us, we grouped together,
forming the first societies.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.880
Now, society can mean lots of different things:
A few families who spend all their time hunting
deer and picking mushrooms can be a society.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.780
But so were the 70 million people of the Roman
Empire.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.689
And so are the 1.2 billion people living in
India today.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.540
So we need a definition that's going to include
all of these things.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.600
And conveniently enough, we have one: a society
is simply a group of people who share a culture
and a territory.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.100
That's a good definition, but it doesn't really
tell us much about the different kinds of societies,
or how we get from one kind to another.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.500
For that, we turn to the work of American
sociologist Gerhard Lenski.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.580
Lenski focused on technology as the main source
of societal change, through a process he called
sociocultural evolution:

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.480
the changes that occur as a society gains new technology.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.040
Lenski then broke up human history into
five different types of societies,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.240
defined by the technology they used and
the social organizations that the technology
helped create and sustain.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.049
If you look back to early human history, say about
30-40 thousand years ago, you find a lot of what
Lenski called hunting and gathering societies.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.590
In these societies, people made use of
extremely basic tools to help them hunt animals
and gather wild plants for food.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.460
Now, if you think about how much you eat in a day,
and imagine trying to gather up that much food every
day, it should be pretty clear that this is no easy task.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.080
So food was the major concern in these societies,
and they still exist today.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.980
People in hunting and gathering societies
spend almost all their time trying to make
sure they have enough food.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.660
And they’re nomadic, following migrating
animals and wild harvests, so they don’t
build permanent settlements.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.610
So, by their very nature, these societies tend to
be small; hunting and gathering can't support a group
of more than 25 to 40 people effectively.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.920
And in order for hunting and gathering to
support even that, everyone has to work to
find food,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.020
and everyone has to share their
resources in order to ensure the survival
of the group.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.800
This means that these societies have very
low inequality.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.540
For the vast majority of human history, every single
person lived in hunting and gathering societies,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.320
up until about 12,000 years ago, when the
domestication of plants and animals led to new kinds
of society: horticultural and pastoral societies.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.620
Pastoral societies are based around the
domestication of animals and are also nomadic, moving
from place to place to keep their herds fed.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.040
Horticultural societies, on the other hand
are based on cultivating plants.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.620
So, with horticultural societies we see the first
human settlements, as groups began to stay put,
to remain close to reliable sources of food.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.360
And we also see, for the first time, the
accumulation of material surplus – that is, more
resources than are needed to feed the population.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.320
This is incredibly important because, having
a surplus allows a society to grow.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.400
And it also means that not everyone needs
to work on getting food and simply surviving.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.300
This, in turn, leads to the first real instances
of specialization in society, with separate political,
religious, and military roles coming about.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.879
We also get real social inequality for the
first time.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.320
And this same dynamic accelerates as we move
into agrarian society, as permanent settlements
emerge based around agricultural production.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.900
Starting about 5,000 years ago – with better
farming techniques like the animal-drawn plow

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.749
– we get more food production and an even
bigger material surplus.

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:04.060
From this came larger populations and larger
settlements, with even more specialization
and even more inequality.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.480
Remember serfs and nobles?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.300
Feudalism was an agrarian society.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.790
And you know what else happens when societies
reach this point?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.760
The family starts to become less important.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.140
In other kinds of societies, things like education
are handled almost entirely by the family.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.760
But as societies grow and become more complex,
those functions start to be taken up by larger
social institutions, like the church or schools.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.020
And now we finally start approaching present
day America, with industrial societies.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.000
These societies get their start with the industrial
revolution around 1750, as production began to shift
from human and animal power to machine power.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.740
This had a massive impact on food production,
with new technologies like the tractor and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.860
the combine producing huge surpluses that
could support even larger populations with
even more specialization.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.940
But the industrial revolution also marked
a fundamental change in the organization of
society itself.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.400
Societies far larger than anything seen before
meant a greater need to assert centralized
control over everything –

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.000
from the production of goods, to transportation,
to agricultural production – in order to keep
things running smoothly.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.220
For the first time, human society moved away
from a subsistence-based economy.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.720
As mass production became possible, a capital-based
economy emerged.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.840
As the surplus grew and specialization increased,
so did inequality, with factory workers spending
12 hour days on one end,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.320
and incredibly wealthy “captains of industry”
making enormous profits on the other.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.940
It’s no coincidence that, soon after the
industrial revolution, Marxism and conflict
theory emerged.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.160
And the decreasing importance of the family
continued as well, as more institutions stepped
into traditional family roles.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.780
Industrial societies were the first to have
universal public education, for instance.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.280
And, for the first time, the majority of health
care and caregiving were institutionalized,
done outside the home in hospitals.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.139
The need to keep production organized also
meant an increasingly urbanized population.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.300
Because, it’s easier to control the resources
you need if they’re centralized.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.970
So people moved from the countryside to urban
centers, where the industrial jobs were.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.880
And all of this keeps going in Lenski’s
scheme of things, with specialization and
technological innovation continuing,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.700
until the development of the computer, a technology
that gave rise to the postindustrial society.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.940
In postindustrial societies, we still see
specialization, increased urbanization, and
technological advances.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.320
But the defining change is that postindustrial
societies shift away from an economy based on
raw materials and manufacturing,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.620
to an economy based based on information,
services, and technology.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.220
This is how we got here.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:21.160
If you look at the most dynamic sectors of the US economy, you see massive wealth being created in tech, finance, and service industries, but a steady decline in manufacturing.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.020
That said, it's not as though Americans don't
buy stuff.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.360
Apps can do a lot of things, but they can't
(yet) conjure a car out of the ether for you.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.420
So this is a good chance to point out that
these different types of society aren't isolated
from each other.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.940
You can't have a postindustrial society without
having industrial societies elsewhere to supply
it with goods.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.060
This points again to increasing inequality –
not just within one society, but across societies.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.100
So, in Lenski's understanding, societal change
is driven by technological change.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.360
But, it’s worth pointing out that not all
of these changes are beneficial.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.080
Pollution, global warming, and large-scale
warfare are new problems that technology has
brought us.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.860
And, technology doesn’t solve fundamental
societal problems.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.450
It has the potential to reorganize society,
but technology can’t tell us how to have
peaceful or just societies.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:12.080
In fact, just looking at Lenski's classifications,
you can see that advancing technology also advances
inequality in society, making it increasingly unequal.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.760
So, we can't limit our discussion of society
to just looking at technology.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:23.860
But that’s okay, because the sociocultural changes that
Lenski talks about can also be understood using the
work of some old friends: Marx, Weber, and Durkheim.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.300
Marx, for example, might seem pretty
similar to Lenski at first:

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.820
If you think back to his theory of historical materialism,
he certainly seems to put a strong focus on technology
and the economy as the driving forces of history.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:40.680
Remember? He saw that changes in the forces of
production are important in pushing the change from
one mode of production to another.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.840
But for Marx, you only get large-scale social
change through class struggle, which culminates
in a revolution,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.020
overthrowing the old relations of production
and replacing them with an entirely new set.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:56.400
So in Marx’s view, the transition between
Lenski’s stages requires technological change,
but it also requires revolution.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.080
And we can also use Marx’s understanding
of conflict to compare Lenski’s stages with
each other.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.380
In hunting and gathering societies, for example,
conflict and inequality are leveled by the lack of
surplus and the need to share resources.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.900
But that’s not the case in postindustrial
society.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:16.180
Max Weber, for his part, seems further away
from Lenski than Marx, focusing not on technology
or revolution, but on ideas.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.900
The major transition that Weber talked about
was the shift from traditional to modern society,

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:23.289
which he argued was really a matter of rationalization.

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:26.740
Now, it's not that Weber didn't appreciate
the importance of technology.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.120
But he argued that the transition from
agrarian to industrial society, for instance,
began with a shift in ideas –

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.340
like new techniques in accounting and
ways of approaching social organization.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.110
And it was these ideas, combined with advances
in technology, that produced the overall change.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:46.160
So in this view, both ideas and technology
were crucial for the emergence of modern capitalism.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.500
And Durkheim, finally, took a different tack
from either Marx or Weber.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.600
He approached the transitions that Lenski
talked about from the perspective of a society’s
underlying social structure.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:01.500
Specifically, Durkheim saw the history of
society as a long term change in solidarity,
a change in what held societies together.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.040
He argued that hunting and gathering
societies were held together by similarity,
what he called mechanical solidarity.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.020
Durkheim argued that everyone in these
societies had the same skills and lived in
basically the same way.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.200
But that changed as society developed and
specialization increased.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.440
With more specialization, people became more
differentiated, taking on different jobs, learning
different skills, and living in different ways.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.280
But, Durkheim argued, people also became more
tightly integrated, because they became more
interdependent.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.540
Factory workers needed farmers to make food so
that they could eat, and farmers needed factory
workers to make their tools and other goods.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.300
Durkheim called this interdependence organic
solidarity.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.720
And so Lenski’s sociocultural evolution
is, for Durkheim, the story of a long transition
from mechanical to organic solidarity.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.820
Ultimately, all of these ways of looking at society
and its changes, from the point of view of technology,
or conflict and revolution,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.600
or ideas, or underlying social structure, are important
for understanding what society is and how it works.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.680
Each one of these perspectives sees things
that the others miss, and each one is important
for the discipline of sociology.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.880
Today we learned about the society, what it
is and how it changes.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.000
We talked about Gerhard Lenski's classification
of societies into five types, and the technological
changes that turn one into another.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.120
We returned to Marx and Weber, and talked
about how they understood societal change.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.290
And we also talked about Durkheim's
understanding of society and how social
solidarity can be mechanical or organic.
