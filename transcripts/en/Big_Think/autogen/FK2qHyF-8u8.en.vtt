are the tools that we're going to be
 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.420
are the tools that we're going to be
looking to use to solve problems we want

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430

to start with prices we're going to

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329
to start with prices we're going to
 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.150
to start with prices we're going to
start with competition and then we're

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
start with competition and then we're
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.379
start with competition and then we're
going to understand the role of the

going to understand the role of the
 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:10.310
going to understand the role of the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320
 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.320
prices do everything prices tell oil

going out to the restaurant now

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860
going out to the restaurant now
 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.170
going out to the restaurant now
I wish the restaurant would drop the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180
I wish the restaurant would drop the
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.760

and a cookie cost a dollar why does the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430
and a cookie cost a dollar why does the

haven't said anything about their costs

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299
haven't said anything about their costs

haven't said anything about their costs
yet if it raises the price more to $500

00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059
yet if it raises the price more to $500
 

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:26.509
yet if it raises the price more to $500
well it gets a lot of people a thousand

00:20:26.509 --> 00:20:26.519
well it gets a lot of people a thousand
 

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:28.249
well it gets a lot of people a thousand
of those 2,000 people will still want to

00:20:28.249 --> 00:20:28.259
of those 2,000 people will still want to
 

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:30.560
of those 2,000 people will still want to
pay for the seat and they'll pay $500

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:30.570
pay for the seat and they'll pay $500
 

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.360
pay for the seat and they'll pay $500
but of course a thousand people will

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.370
but of course a thousand people will
 

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.970
but of course a thousand people will
then not fly so I've constructed the

then not fly so I've constructed the
 

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.830
then not fly so I've constructed the
example so that big air takes in the

most money when it charges $300 it's not

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:40.049
most money when it charges $300 it's not
 

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:42.200
most money when it charges $300 it's not
free for big air to fly to New York it

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.210
free for big air to fly to New York it
 

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.840
free for big air to fly to New York it
has costs and as we know these costs are

very very important in figuring out when

well I think of big air charging just

dollars to fly so many people why does

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.210
dollars to fly so many people why does
 

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.899

it cost more rather than less per seat

00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:17.909
it cost more rather than less per seat
 

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:19.310

harder to be a monopolist of most Goods
 

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:29.680
harder to be a monopolist of most Goods
because Goods can be transported from

because Goods can be transported from
other countries you don't just need a
