00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
PDF has established itself as an
interchange format now.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.290
Did people get it - straight away - as to
what it was for?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.219
Was it like PostScript was - relatively a
howling, roaring, success from day one? 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.960
I mean people couldn't wait to buy
PostScript in 1985. I'm not kidding they

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
were pressing cheques into Steve Jobs' and
John Warnock's hands and saying: "How much? How much?  I want

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.820
that NOW and I want it quicker next year!"
It wasn't like that with PDF - it wasn't at all.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.160
This was brought home to me in the most
amusing - but at the time - scary way in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.840
I think was the mid-nineties. My
guess would be it would be round about

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.820
1996. I was visiting Adobe fairly
regularly doing lots of stuff with them

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.080
on PDF and so on. And on this particular
occasion San Francisco immigration gets

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
hold of my passport and said:  "Purpose of
visit, Sir ?"

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
"Business or pleasure?"  I said:  "Well it's
business". "Oh! which company are you visiting?" 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.190
I said: "Oh! it's Adobe. They're in San Jose now".
"Ah! that's interesting, Sir, and what work are you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.869
you doing with them?" I think it's the
usual thing that we all get used to is:

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.700
"Are you an illegal immigrant; are you
actually working for Adobe?" or "Are they

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.970
paying you; are you an employee, Sir?". 
"No! no!  no! it's just that we are interested in

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.160
the same things; we're doing research and
I'm just here for a catch-up and various

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.320
meetings with people as to where we are
with our project". And he said; "But what

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
kind of work do you do with Adobe, Sir?"
and I said: "Well you may not have heard

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.729
of it but they do have a product - a
format if you like - called PDF, and you can

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.909
read it with a free thing called Acrobat
Reader". And his face froze and I thought "Oh! dear"

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.740
and he took his glasses off. He put them down and
he turned my passport over, put it to one side,
and said:

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:13.920
"Sir! that PDF!  What is it FOR?!"  And I just ... 
I'd heard similar things from other people, I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.750
just grinned. I said: "Well, do you want the
five minute story or the one hour story?"

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.310
I'll try and keep it as brief as
I can. I said to him:  "Look, you know you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.209
probably exchange documents with people
and you've been told - you've been told

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.070
you should use this route to PDF and use PDF
as your standard interchange format?" And he said:

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.160
"Yeah! Yeah! that's quite right. We can't
understand why we can't just send each

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.810
other Word files!"  And I said "Well, you'll
know some of the problems of sending each

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.400
other Word files. Everybody's

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.420
got a slightly different version and 
- oh! dear - some people are running it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.220
on Macintosh and not on PC and it doesn't 
look the same ...?"   "Oh! tell me about it!" he said

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.650
And I said:" Well ... and then there's the
refuseniks who say: 'WordPerfect is a far better

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.030
and I absolutely refuse to use anything
from Microsoft' -- or whatever?!"

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.590
"Oh yeah! We got a few of those as well". So
I said: "Well the thing to remember is - it is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.060
about document exchange. but it needs to
be, ideally, you  want a general solution

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.480
that's of high-quality that could serve
all sorts of other use cases. Just

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.109
consider newspapers they want something
which is accurate and will print out on

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.599
an enormous sheet of paper. But yet they want
to preview it at smaller sizes and they

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.629
want one document to fit a whole load of
sizes and resolutions and to move

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.939
seamlessly between them taking quality
all the time - that it doesn't start

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.769
breaking up - even if you inflate it to 
almost the size of a barn door. And I

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.049
said; "Newspapers really, really, value that
capability of it" And he said: "So, like,

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.699
they have a route to this PDF?" And I said:
"Yes, they've  got to have a route to PDF and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.959
I said "The other people -

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.889
let me give you one more example", I said,
is that many of my colleagues think it's

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.620
just magic for output from a program
called AutoCAD, you know,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.549
"computer-aided design" it could be used 
for architects drawings; it could be used for

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.409
electronics engineering circuit diagrams.
But the great thing for them is that

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:22.860
when you scale it up to a different size
it keeps the quality and by that I mean

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.840
that if it's drawn as a nice smooth
looking circle, at this kind of size, you

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.430
scale it up and the circle still looks
like a circle. It doesn't start breaking

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.750
up into dots.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.860
It's a graphics model; it's a  sophisticated,
scalable, graphics model inside the thing.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.990
And that's why engineers love it as well.
And at that stage a great grin came over his face 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.680
and he said: "Sir!"

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.330
-- puts glasses back on -- "Sir, thank you so
much for that!"

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.080
"Thank you!  thank you! ". He gives me my passport back:

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.930
"Welcome to the United States, Sir". So I went
away thinking "I'm not too surprised by

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.289
that - a lot of people really don't get it;
don't understand what it's for". And I

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.380
did think -- I don't think it was quite
on that trip, it might have been the next

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.850
year that I'd been involved with Adobe,
on and off, for many years but

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.220
particularly in early '93.  John Warnock and
his colleague Chuck Geschke chose us here at

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.690
Nottingham to be one of the first beta test
sites for PDF. And I think it was maybe

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.690
the year after my interaction with the
immigration official and I went to see

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.460
John and I said, first question was, I said:
"John.  PDF - how's it going?"

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.630
And he said: "David, it's a long, long, long,
uphill struggle!" And i said "Yeah, I can

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.070
tell it's not been kind of the overnight
success that PostScript was?" And he said:

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.180
"No, it isn't. And he said "If you want to
ask me how much I've spent already on PDF

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.310
the answer is $100 million. It dawned
on us straight away, that  if we want people to

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.550
adopt PDF you absolutely have to give
them a Reader and it must be free.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.590
The moment you start charging for it
people will just refuse and will not use

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.699
your format. So he said "We've had to live
with that" but he said "I'll say it again

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:20.320
- we are sure we are right!". So I went then
downstairs to talk to my colleague, Ken, who I

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.440
think was my liaison person at the time
and told him this story. He said: "David,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.750
those of us on the technical side of things - we
know that John and Chuck are absolutely

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.979
right". "But" he said, "I have to tell you
that within this company there's jitters,

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.880
there's nerves,  because particularly
among the sales staff you see, they say

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.030
'We don't get any bonuses out of PDF!

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.030
People don't understand what it is,  y'know,

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.560
and all that. Please put me in charge
of Photoshop! I'll make loads and loads of

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.290
money and bonuses out of Photoshop. And I
said; "Yeah! it's understandable". And having

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.650
heard from friends at Adobe about how
being in charge of Photoshop was deemed to be

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.120
the real ....

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.150
I thought; "Well, you know, the measure of
PDF success is going to be when, if ever,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:13.200
will its sales revenues overtake those
of Photoshop?" And the answer to that I

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.370
think it's in - I've got a book somewhere called 
'The Adobe Story' - I think it was April 2004

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:24.330
when finally PDF revenues
overtook those from Photoshop. And

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:31.980
in my visit, around about that time, with
great hilarity, the Photoshop mob as I

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.450
recall were on the lower floors of the
San Jose building around about four to

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.220
six, or something like that.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:44.280
The PDF/Acrobat/PostScript people were
much higher up:  floors 11 and 12. The top

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.410
management, John and Chuck and so on, were up
at the top of the tower.  And I was told

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.970
when I got there that - to great hilarity -
the moment the sales results were

00:07:53.970 --> 00:08:00.930
announced and PDF / Acrobat sales had
overtaken Photoshop, large quantities of

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:07.740
champagne were sent from floor 4 up to floor 
12, with ribbons and congratulations

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.360
cards, and the message was: "The pressure's on
you guys now -- have a nice day !"
