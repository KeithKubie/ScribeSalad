You know, back when I was a kid
in the 1900s,

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.939
LEGO was just a brand
of building block play sets

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:08.976
-that hurt like a bitch when
you stepped on 'em. -(laughter)

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.511
These days,
there's a whole LEGO...

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.979
They still hurt a lot,
by the way.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.547
-(laughter)
-That didn't change.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.883
But these days,
there's a whole LEGO empire!

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.218
They got LEGOLAND,
they got LEGO <i>Star Wars.</i>

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:19.887
-PHOEBE ROBISON: Mm-hmm.
-This man's horrifying,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.422
-skin-textured LEGO cosplay.
-(laughter)

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:25.058
ADAM NEWMAN:
Oh, just got nails.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.793
-HARDWICK: I know. He doesn't.
-Just one nail.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:30.264
-Why was I given life and no
fingers? -(laughter, groaning)

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.000
-Chernobyl, why?
-(laughter)

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.802
-Why? -Why did I put
my hands in there? I thought

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.138
-I'd get super powers!
-(applause)

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:39.940
Well, we're just weeks away
from the release

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.543
of <i>The LEGO Batman Movie, </i>
which maybe...

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.878
-(applause and cheering)
-Listen. -ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:47.014
-Yeah.
-I...

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.883
may have done a couple voices
in this movie.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.752
Maybe I did!
Maybe I'm in this movie.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.287
-ROBINSON: Cool!
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.423
Okay, I am. I did.
I'm very excited about it.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.891
Very excited about this.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.826
So, very excited
about <i>LEGO Batman.</i>

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.529
Also, shortly followed
by <i>LEGO Fences.</i>

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:05.532
-I wasn't sure if you guys
were aware. Um... -(laughter)

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.868
-I...
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.369
Yeah.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.171
-Oh.
-ROBINSON: I think I...

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.708
I... um... I did not get asked
to be in this one.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.476
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.545
Today, LEGO is expanding
in social media,

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.047
launching LEGO Life,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.283
a new LEGO-based social network
for children 13 and under

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:26.086
-and probably me,
Chris Hardwick. -(laughter)

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.355
This is an Android and iOS app,
has built-in

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:31.191
anti-bullying measures,
chiefly that any kid cool enough

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:32.860
to be a bully is probably not
gonna be

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:34.528
<i>-on</i> the LEGO social network.
-(laughter)

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.029
So, you'll be fine there.

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:38.932
Comedians, if this trend
continues, what is the next

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.201
social network targeted
at children under 13?

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:43.871
-Adam.
-(as child): This many square.

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:45.939
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Points.
Very good. Yeah. -(laughter)

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:48.308
-Very good. Phoebe.
-Tindergarten.

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.110
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Points!
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.579
Hampton.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.015
Uh, Puber. It's like Uber,
but for pubes.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.384
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yes. Wait. I'm sorry.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.853
Hang on a second.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:03.690
So... you go on it
to have pubes brought to you?

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.025
-Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, okay. Great.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.326
-I just wanted to clear it up.
-When you're low.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.761
HARDWICK: Yeah. Yeah,
that's all I wanted to know.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.496
-PuberEATS is disgusting.
-HARDWICK: It's...

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.198
(laughter)

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:11.298
HARDWICK: Well done.
Well done, Adam.
