&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Good afternoon everyone,
again, thank you very much for attending this

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.779
screening of "I AM."

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.620
I will actually cut right to the chase.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.099
Today with us we have the director of the
film, Tom Shadyac, who really is an ordinary

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.730
guy who has led a really exciting and interesting
journey in life.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.850
So, from his early days of directing films
to some life changing experiences that he

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.820
under, underwent, he now created the film
that you now see.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.100
So we're very pleased to have him join us
today and he will answer any questions that

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.110
you may have and without further ado, here's
Tom.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.570
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Thank you my brother, Cliff.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.470
Could we have a hand for Cliff?

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.370
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: I call Cliff, now, Saint Peter

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.900
because he just toured me around heaven.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.640
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Uh, it's a little overwhelming

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.120
to come here and see so many incredible things.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.670
So much creative energy, so much, it's a look
into how things can be, it's a look into how

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.939
things can be and I'd love to talk today about
why things aren't that way.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.280
Why is it that we come to Google and wow,
I can't walk thirty feet without finding a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.600
carb?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.770
There's a kitchen with carbohydrates, there's
fruit here and I have to pee, oh it's right

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.259
here.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.280
I can't move without all the necessities of
life taken care of.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.460
Oh, and there's dogs and babies, it's phenomenal,
right?

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.450
You're well fed, you're well taken care of,
you have insurance, you don't have to worry

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.280
about medical, why doesn't the world work
this way?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.299
So, I'd love to talk about that cause I sense
such an incredible spirit here.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.619
That that's what you're about is somehow opening
up this world; somehow our collective energy

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:01.859
has created you, created this amazing place
not just as an example, but as a source and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.039
a starting point for what can be.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:13.800
I don't think you're here by accident so talk
to me.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.220
What do ya got?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.990
By the way, Yahoo was filled with questions,
that's all I'm gonna say.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.990
[Laughter]

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.790
&gt;&gt;male #1: How's it going [inaudible] today?

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.530
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Thank you, brother.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.810
&gt;&gt;male #1: I guess my question is

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.490
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: What is your name?

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.770
&gt;&gt;male #1: My name's Jeff.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.790
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Hello, Jeff.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.320
&gt;&gt;male #1: Nice to meet you.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.180
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Good to meet you.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.390
What do you do here, Jeff?

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.390
What do you do?

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.060
They have people that do everything.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.850
That person makes sure the grass is parallel.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.530
Okay, good, the grass is parallel, very nice.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.530
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: What do you do?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.380
&gt;&gt;male #1: You know, I try to get user feedback
on the products.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.060
So if you have any feedback on Google products,
now's the time.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.580
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Yeah, I am such a lame and
my feedback is awesome.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.580
[Laughter]

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.390
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: So I use you every day.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.400
It's actually an amazing writing tool.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.780
As a writer we used to clear our minds by
going to picture books or, do you guys have

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.810
ever heard this word, encyclopedia?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.010
Okay, we would go to books to get other ideas
to free our minds now we just go on Google

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.250
and you just, you get filled with info that
can turn your creative thought somewhere,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.250
so.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.310
&gt;&gt;male #1: Cool, I think, I mean, we all love
working here, we love Google.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.200
But my question is, really, I think companies
like Google are great and they're rare, but

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.860
I think they come about because of this entrepreneurial
spirit.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.860
So how do you kind of, how can you get that
spirit and keep those, keep kind of the innovation

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.870
alive?

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.130
At the same time have companies focus on the
community?

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.800
It seems like there's kind of two things at
odds and I wonder how we can kind of get both.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.691
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Yeah, I find that that is a
cultural, part of the cultural malaise, if

00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:57.560
you will, Jeff, that these things are at odds.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:06.850
So how do we create the entrepreneurial spirit
and still have a focus on the community?

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.340
Anybody have a thought?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.470
Okay, so, let's ask ourselves why those things
are mutually exclusive?

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.370
What is it that you value most in your life?

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.859
Our culture teaches us that money is the motivator,
right?

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.729
If you don't have the incentive of money you
won't start anything, right?

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.069
So that calls into question some people that
were really inspirational to me.

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:34.099
Buddha, for example, walked away from his
money, created something beautiful, as Meng,

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.610
one of your spiritual counselors here knows,
created mindfulness, created awareness, created

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.610
peace.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.340
His motivation was to create, to spread love,
ideas, truth.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.030
Jesus, Gandhi , so we have all these moral
leaders who are not motivated by money and

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.900
they, we all know, are the most powerful figures
in our lives.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.310
Then we look at institutions.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.949
My family runs St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital; they help found it with Danny Thomas,

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.389
not a thought about money, not a thought,
but the entrepreneurial spirit alive.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.479
90 percent of the kids, when this hospital
started, died when they were diagnosed with

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.210
cancer, 90 percent mortality rate.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.229
Darn near 90 percent if I'm, plus or minus
one or two percent.

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.819
Now it's completely inverted.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.300
It's near 90 percent kids live and there wasn't
a thought about how much money can we make,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.160
it's how can we serve?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.529
Because those things you go to your graves
and your death beds with are going to be,

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.970
not how much money did I make, it's gonna
be how much did I serve that I give back?

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.689
How creative was I?

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.070
How was I able to spread and add a value?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.409
And yet we have this poison in our culture
that says without that money, without that

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.039
money it all goes away.

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.509
It's a lie.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.199
And we know it through our experience it's
a lie but we don't quite recognize it and

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.199
walk it.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.289
That's why we go to church every Sunday to
be reminded, hey it's all about love but Monday

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.750
we close that door, as my father said, and
we become about something else.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.949
This is the poison, it's compartmentalization,
it's separation.

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:06.789
Emerson said, "You must, integrity means to
unify your life so that any drawer I open

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.650
you'll see exactly who a person is."

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.550
So what we need to see in the future is when
we open our business drawers I just see love

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.159
and compassion and creativity.

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:18.289
That's what I see.

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.449
Just the way you spread information here,
we need to spread love.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.440
What I really think Google is about is love.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.620
That's all I get when I get around here, people
love what they do, the love of food, the love

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.939
of health, the love of community, the love
of family, the love of information freely

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.199
accessible to the world.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.620
How beautiful?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.969
And there may be another drawer we can open
where love can spread.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.039
And that's up to you.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.360
I'm gonna throw out something very radical,
insanely radical.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.780
And there may be a laser beam that kills me
for saying it.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.080
But I'm simply going to quote a poet that
challenges all of us, his name is Wendell

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.770
Berry, some of you may know him he's one of
the most well regarded poets, "Intellectual

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.599
property names the deed in which the mind
is bought and sold and the world enslaved."

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:14.389
Cliff and I were talking about that, "Intellectual
property names the deed by which the mind

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.600
is bought and sold and the world enslaved."

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.669
Hey, that's my idea.

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:21.330
Ace Ventura is my idea, give it to me.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.360
That was my idea.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.099
And yet I know there's no such thing as my
idea.

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:32.300
I rest on the backs of all the creativity
before me.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.839
I'm inspired, meaning I am in spirit, and
somehow an idea comes to you and to claim

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:40.620
ownership of these things is the poison.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.370
To say, "Wow, I am serving this idea and I
offer it to the world" is beautiful and that's

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.379
the turn, I think, the human species, I think
we're starting to make here.

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:51.860
So much you offer to the world freely.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.949
Where's the laser beam?

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:04.409
[pause]
&gt;&gt;male #2: I believe, for a couple of years,

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.210
that there is actually nothing wrong with
the world.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.949
And everything that is happening is supposed
to happen.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:13.869
We live perfectly in balance.

00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:20.869
Now I understand that had I, you know, had
I been fighting in Africa all my life, my

00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:25.499
beliefs might have been different but, you
know, not having to struggle for food every

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:28.139
day, kind of gives me a different set.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:33.260
I might be wrong, but this is what I believe
correctly.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:40.190
My question is, if we are so connected to
the animal and the insects and if we are a

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.769
part of nature then why are we so different?

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:52.750
And if we do embrace the philosophy that we
should only take what we need and not go out

00:08:52.750 --> 00:09:02.649
and invent things for the reason of money,
how are we going to acknowledge that what's

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:09.980
happening to us is not, in fact, evolution
and it's not, in fact, a, you know, for the

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:18.500
reason of the greater and the longest survival
of the human species and the life on the planet,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:27.610
for not just, you know, reasons I mean, not
defending only against things that are happening,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:34.399
like hunger and disease but bigger calamities
that could happen to this planet, how are

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:40.850
we not to say that we're not here to protect
the planet by inventing things against bigger

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.420
planetary things like meteoroids or

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.339
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Yeah, let me ask you a question
was there, by the way I'm supposed to repeat

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:51.910
this for the internet, the question was, what's
the meaning of life

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.139
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: It was a big question cause

00:09:56.139 --> 00:10:00.949
you said a lot of things that are profound
that I can and may respond to but may not

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:01.949
get to.

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:05.050
You said things like you believe that world
is just as it ought to be, right?

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.111
And you're coming from a place being well
fed; you might feel differently if you were

00:10:08.111 --> 00:10:09.111
not well fed.

00:10:09.111 --> 00:10:10.950
That's a huge thing we could talk about.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.990
But now you're saying are we not to use, potentially,
our technologies that is maybe a protector

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.270
of the planet?

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.810
And is there something in this film that told
you that we ought to not do that?

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:27.270
That we ought to not be creative, that we
ought to not expand in terms of, I love the

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.470
colors of these seats, I love the color of
the human fabric, I love that each of you

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.940
is a different experiential model that adds
another piece to the mosaic.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.269
Who wants a monochromatic world?

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:41.250
I don't think that whatever created us wants
a monochromatic world because he made so many

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.430
different creative people, right?

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.320
So, I don't think this film is about that.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.180
I think this film is about what happens when
you create?

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.149
What do you do with that creativity?

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:56.269
What is that?

00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:57.949
Do we claim ownership of it?

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.490
Do we share it freely with all that we are?

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.420
So that love, the most important thing to
all us, love, love, love can be spread and

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.160
community can be spread.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.569
And goodness and the Google campus can be
spread.

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:11.580
What do we do when we create?

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.769
I could have easily done everything, I stand
by every film I've made, as imperfect as they

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:19.259
are, they had ideas and energy I wanted to
put into the world.

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:20.579
I still stand by that.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.959
But I didn't have to stand on top and say,
"Pay me more, I'm worth more."

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:29.810
I, as an artist, can serve freely, take what
I need and serve.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.750
The greatest story I will ever tell, the most
powerful story I will ever tell is the one

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.779
I will tell of my life.

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:36.259
Not the one you'll see up there.

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:37.920
So what story am I telling with my own life?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.290
That's the question that I have.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.790
[Inaudible] did this in any way address one
of your

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:52.701
&gt;&gt;male #2: Um, yeah, I mean, while watching
the movie it did challenge a few of my beliefs

00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:55.190
like I always questioned why is war wrong?

00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:01.160
You know, why does everyone say that war should
not happen and, yet, war is happening at all

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160
times.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.470
Bacteria, we're fighting with bacteria and
viruses at all times, in fact, there are hand

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.790
sanitizers which we are using to kill bacteria
at all times.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.520
It's happening at every single level but only

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.040
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Can I just, uh, I don't mean
to jump in but I wanna, cause they can't actually

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.600
hear you so are you getting him at all?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.430
I have to repeat what you say so I kind of
have to remember.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.610
Anyway, about the wars that are going on with
bacteria, so that's actually not true.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.940
I mean, it's true, the human species, for
example, there are less wars.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.080
We are evolving into a less violent species.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.000
If you read Jeremy Rifkin's "Empathic Civilization"
there is this moral progression, Rumi talks

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
about it in his poetry.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.209
But the history of biology is not that.

00:12:43.209 --> 00:12:47.750
Yes, there are, there are, quote, wars and
aggression going on all the time but the history

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:52.410
of biology is this, read Elisabet Sahtouris,
Elisabet Sahtouris is an evolutionary biologist,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.690
she said let's look at life cause life has
had 4 billion years, 13 billion if you wanna

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.519
go back to the beginning of the universe,
4 billion years to show us its mandates and

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:01.519
dictates.

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:05.620
And what you found was this pattern, single
cell life is the first life to emerge, very,

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.580
as you said, war like, angry, aggressive,
anger that's actually a human term, but aggressive,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.580
right?

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:17.630
It realizes this isn't working through whatever
communication it has, it begins talking amongst

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.089
itself, single cells, and they start cooperating,
they get creative.

00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:24.750
They create nucleated cells, nucleated cells
are young, they do the same thing, feisty,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.329
aggressive, competitive for nutrients, etcetera.

00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:31.500
Nucleated cells begin communicating with each
other, get creative and then create multi

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.410
cell creatures which is us.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.470
We are now young, we are 175 thousand year
old species based on 4 billion years.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.490
Incredibly young we are now through places
like Google, talking to each other and realizing

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.120
hey this doesn't work.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.440
We can behave this way but does it help us
thrive?

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.440
Which way must we tend as a society?

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.699
And that's why instantly when a war happens
nobody goes, "Great!

00:13:56.699 --> 00:13:57.699
More war!"

00:13:57.699 --> 00:13:59.259
They go, "How does this end?

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:00.259
How does this end?

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:02.410
How does my child come home safe?

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.410
How does this end?

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.500
Why are we in another war?"

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:11.290
Because we are hardwired, we are hardwired
to thrive in cooperation.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:17.750
So, it's how we tend, everything you say does
exist but it is more than exception than the

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.190
rule because life would not go if it was just
one big battle.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.750
You know, the simplest example is the lion.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.420
It can eat every gazelle, it can take all
the gazelles, it can take them down.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.750
It eats one it's full and everything can live
in peace around it, it's gotten what it needed.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.980
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Alright, so we have one question
here.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.290
&gt;&gt;male #3: Better.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.871
Thanks for coming to visit us, I'm David.

00:14:38.871 --> 00:14:44.269
Much of what you had to say in your documentary
resonated with me that we should, that we're

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:48.740
social creatures, we should, we should have
community and be connected with one another

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.620
and love each other and that'll give us a
greater sense of presence and happiness.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:59.760
So that all, like I said, resonates with me,
towards the end of the movie you were talking

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:06.279
about, also the part about how the endless
treadmill of wealth accumulation can distract

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:13.019
us from enjoying what it is that we should
enjoy about life, towards the end you seem

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:22.769
to be contending that if we redistribute the
wealth that we're accumulating to the homeless

00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:25.560
that that'll solve the problem.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.279
And it's probably putting too much on you
to try and solve a problem that's never been

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:35.550
solved in thousands of years but I'm not persuaded
that the whole root of the issue with the

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:40.430
homeless is that we're not redistributing
enough resources to them.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.790
I feel like resources are available and caring
people are available and yet the problem persists.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.170
Is there more to it that I've missed?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.589
Do you have any more prescriptions for how
we can fix that problem?

00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:52.839
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Let me get to the meaning of
life before I end homelessness.

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:56.420
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: So, just to be clear, can you

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.260
give him the mic back, your name again was?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.870
&gt;&gt;male #3: David.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.490
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: David.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:07.390
David, you did not see what, you did not see
what exactly about homelessness that I was

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:12.120
not, I was too simplistic in my approach to
ending homelessness?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.520
Yeah.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.670
I think it's really simple.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:21.779
I just think it's incredibly simple.

00:16:21.779 --> 00:16:24.170
I think it's incredibly simple.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:30.180
It's not simple that there issues, the alcoholism
excreta which is from a culture that I believe

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.509
is mentally ill.

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:33.939
I wasn't kidding when I called myself mentally
ill.

00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:38.930
A mentally ill person does not operate in
reality, does not see things as they are.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.459
So I don't believe I was seeing things as
they are when I took so much, much more than

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:43.649
I needed.

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:50.839
So I find the solution to, you know, the law
of the province can be summed up in two ways.

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:54.220
One will be a sort of religious sounding thing,
love God or whatever that source is, whatever

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.660
the gift is of life and the other is love
each other.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:04.530
And, so, it's really simple but the manifestation
of that might be challenging.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:09.160
But if we made a decision today would it not
end?

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.630
If we as a society made a decision, there
is not homelessness in native culture, it

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:19.179
doesn't exist because the tribe, even the
crazy guy in the tribe, is kind of enjoyed

00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:23.390
and laughed at but he's a part of the tribe,
he's fed, he's given a hut.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.689
It didn't exist in native cultures.

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:28.179
Inflation doesn't exist in native cultures.

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:30.559
Price increases don't exist in native cultures.

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:36.140
It's a mentally that allows me to ignore there's
someone I'm related to within 2000 generations

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.150
we know that we all come from the same tribe
in Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, someone I'm

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:45.220
actually related to has somehow fallen on
hard times, didn't, the number one reason

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.720
for homelessness, I have a homeless shelter
in Charlottesville Virginia that's why I know

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.429
about these things, and the number one reason
why people are homeless is because they don't

00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:53.630
have the support system that you may have.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.090
So they don't have a parent to turn to and
go, "Jeez, I had a bad year.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:01.040
I couldn't get a job out of school or I made
a mistake or I have an addiction problem"

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.500
and they get stuck.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.250
They're out.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.970
So I see these things as intensely simple
and then the fun starts.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.799
Once we agree to take care of each other.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:14.700
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi, I'm Mark.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.309
Thank you for sharing your movie with us.

00:18:18.309 --> 00:18:24.720
I understand why you made your point is if
people understood how everything is connected

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.919
and we are connected then they would work
with one another better and care for one another.

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:38.340
I've seen, so you've shown a few examples
like the yogurt and so forth, and I think

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.629
I've seen a few in a movie called "What the
bleep do you know?"

00:18:41.629 --> 00:18:45.870
do we know, like 10 years ago, I'm sure you've
heard of it or have seen it.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.070
And at the same time I watch a lot of science
shows, I learned a lot about science and very

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.900
few such examples are given.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.760
At least I don't hear or see of many.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.960
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Examples of what given?

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:03.179
&gt;&gt;male #4: Oh, of everything being connected
and my belief, especially after seeing this

00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:08.230
is if there were more and we'd hear about
more that people would be more willing to

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:13.520
believe and act on that and realize that yes,
everything they do does impact other people.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.320
Um, do you know why there aren't more and
is it difficult

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.760
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Yes, well, there are.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.159
They're everywhere.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.720
You can't look at something and not say there's
connection.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.500
But when you're raised in a culture that says
that's not true that you separate.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.520
The basic ideology that you heard in this
film is the ideology that you've been taught

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520
in this culture.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.610
That you are separate and yet science, we
know, if you look there's no ending of me

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.220
and beginning of you.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.350
Everything is intermixed.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.470
We all agree that there's such a thing called
the butterfly effect.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.299
We all look at the movie "Back to the Future"
and go, "yeah, that's true.

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:50.320
Michael J. Fox goes back in time, he does
one thing different, he's nice to someone

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.299
or mean to someone, 20 years later everything
is different in the future."

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:57.970
We already know this, right?

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:02.200
But we don't want you to see it cause with
that comes an incredible exigency.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.909
The exigency of love is intense.

00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:09.250
Much more so than the law of separation, just
take care of yourself, after you take care

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.451
of yourself, this is the poison, take care
of yourself, get yourself set up then you

00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:16.510
can reach out to the world.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.299
There's a mystic named Irwin Kula who says
something very cool, "Everything is God in

00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:21.990
drag" right?

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.740
"Everything is God in drag."

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:33.120
Another divine, beautiful walking manifestation,
another, another, that, there's stuff going

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.650
on inside of that that is insane.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.210
That same stuff that's going on, rotating,
spinning, that same spinning goes on in the

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.490
Sufi Mystic.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:50.440
It's all connected and when we get that we'll
understand and we'll behave differently.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.040
Desmond Tutu said something to me and I'm
writing a chapter of it in the book, I've

00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:02.309
got a book deal with a group, not easy writing
a book, Desmond Tutu talked about, when you

00:21:02.309 --> 00:21:06.980
talk about something, he's a religious person
but he doesn't speak about it in a religious

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.980
way.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.980
I said, "Desmond, what's wrong?

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.980
What's wrong with the world?"

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:17.880
He said, "Tom" and he uses the word God, "God
gives us instructions on the box of human

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.200
being and we are not operating according to
the instructions on the box."

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.860
And those instructions are the same instructions
that you see in nature.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.080
Connected, that's why Emerson wrote the essay
"Compensation."

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.080
Everything is a compensation.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.909
That's why there's a full tide here, you know
the saying, that was the saying I wanted to

00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:39.909
remember, Harold.

00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:42.659
A tide rises, a tide rises all boats, no it
doesn't.

00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:45.380
What about the tide across the sea?

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.890
Those boats are receding, right?

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.830
There is always ebb and flow, everything,
we take from here something gets richer, something

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.910
gets less, we invent the car, we lose the
use of our feet.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.130
The only thing with no compensation is love.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.419
Only love multiplies, Emerson says, I agree
because love is how things work.

00:22:04.419 --> 00:22:08.270
It's the operating manual that Desmond Tutu
was talking about.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:13.391
And until we get that, now we already know
that you know it deep in your DNA cause every

00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:16.960
time you share something at Google, we were
talking about China and how you want that

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.160
to be more open and the dialogue there and
the information to be more open, that's love

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.380
and you know it.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.430
So you applaud when your leaders, Larry and
Sergey come and say, "We wanna be more open"

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.950
and you feel it cause it's so deeply in you.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.840
Your operating manual is in you.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.220
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi, I'm Johnny.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:48.690
Um, no, so, you talk about Google here and
where everything is, there's lack of scarcity

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:56.720
and we're kind of in a bubble of the world
and you, likewise, in Hollywood where it's

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:03.669
kind of in the bubble and I would even argue
that the US, the worst situation in the US

00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:11.429
is far better than a lot of other situations
outside the country.

00:23:11.429 --> 00:23:18.880
Now, with the amount, the lack of scarcity
in all the environments, right, how do you

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:27.679
differentiate between that and people that
are actually struggling to survive and basically

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:35.159
pushing the message of collaboration when
there's just not enough to go around in that

00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:36.730
society or in that group?

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.850
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Be a little bit more clear
about your question cause I'm not quite clear

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.060
on what you wanna address.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:48.570
&gt;&gt;male #4: No, I think that what I'm saying
is at Google it's very easy to say we should

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.570
all collaborate.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:57.880
There's no competition in terms of food, we
walk a hundred feet there's food.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.710
We walk, you know, ten feet and there's something
else.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:07.029
And likewise, in the US, we, you know, there's
grocery stores and there's availability of

00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:10.340
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: So we have a relative abundance
here in the US and

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.929
&gt;&gt;male #4: And how do you

00:24:11.929 --> 00:24:14.150
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: What do you mean by differentiate?

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:21.360
&gt;&gt;male #4: Well how do you push the message
of collaboration to people that don't have

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.460
the abundance of

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.010
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: The same way you push every
message which is to be the thing that you

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.720
wish to see in the world.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.720
That's the whole simple message that Gandhi
preached.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.580
It's what I hope, I, I, impart here, be it.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.659
I just heard Warren Buffet did a great thing
cause I've spoken of it as a bit of an insane

00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:41.659
thing.

00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:46.899
Warren Buffet stood on, in the press recently
and said, "I have all this extra resources,

00:24:46.899 --> 00:24:47.899
I wanna help.

00:24:47.899 --> 00:24:49.690
Why doesn't the government tax me more?"

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.090
And I thought that's insane.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.809
Why don't you just help?

00:24:52.809 --> 00:24:55.909
Why are you waiting for the government to
tell you to be good?

00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:57.130
Be good.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.480
As Aristotle said, "Follow the action of good
and happiness is the right outcome."

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480
So be good.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.480
I heard he just did that, I gotta find out
if it's true.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.809
I think I'll Google it.

00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:08.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: But I heard he just did that

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.960
which is wonderful.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.149
That's extraordinary.

00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:15.640
He felt that he had something to share, he
didn't wait for somebody to make him share

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640
it and he shared it.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.790
So he is becoming the message he wishes to
see in the world.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.440
So if you want a more collaborative world,
a more equitable world, that's why I want

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.539
to disassemble, I am a very imperfect work
in progress, I believe the principles that

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:31.299
animate me are perfect.

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:35.080
I hope that I am in touch with the principles
that have animated others.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.380
I hope that they animate me.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.799
That's my hope.

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:45.100
But, so, you can look at my life and see imperfection
but I am whittling away my resources because

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.769
I wanna be more equitable.

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:51.750
I wanna be more equitable so I must be more
equitable in my dealings.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.750
Yes?

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:58.270
I'm sorry, someone else has the mic, we'll
go to the back.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.700
&gt;&gt;male #5: Hi, I'm Joe.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:09.419
So, in my limited experience when you're trying
to change people's perspectives and aware,

00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:13.309
increase awareness there's really nothing
that can substitute direct experience.

00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:19.029
Like, if you, if they experience that tragedy
themselves and that's your story as well.

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:24.420
Do you ever look, like take a step back and
be like why did it take me to have so much

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:30.029
taken away to finally be aware of what, something
is wrong?

00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:35.799
And did you take that approach when you started
filming and kind of understand that?

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:41.670
For many of us that don't experience such
tragedies to kind of put that, put life into

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:47.200
perspective it's, you can only tell someone
so much before they actually go through it

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.270
and then they realize, like, it's true.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.809
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Let me be clear about something.

00:26:55.809 --> 00:27:03.950
The accident and facing my own death did not
in any way shift my life in terms of my view

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:09.490
on resources and the generosity I wanted or
didn't want to inhabit me.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.769
I had been on that path for years.

00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:16.270
After I did 'Liar, Liar' in 1995 or 6, I sat
down with a dear friend and said, "This doesn't

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.270
feel right."

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.130
That's when the money started coming and I
said, "There's something not good about this.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.409
It doesn't feel right.

00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:23.100
I feel like it should flow back."

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.100
"No, no, no, keep it.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.100
Keep it."

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.100
And I bought into it.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.779
But I began to shift very early.

00:27:28.779 --> 00:27:33.240
What the concussion did and facing my own
death did was give me the courage to talk

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240
about it.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.600
So for ten years, I was already in the mobile
home park which is a beautiful place, the

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.320
message is not, for me, necessarily austerity
for austerity sake but a reasonable life.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320
What's enough for you?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.320
I love to surf, I'm near the beach.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.299
I love the mountains, they're right behind
me.

00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:49.380
I want everyone to have what they love and
are passionate about.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.269
I think that's how we beam.

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:59.460
So, yes, you're right when we experience something
personally, of course, we are more compelled

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.669
and propelled into action.

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:07.860
However, we do have a connective relationship
with others and we do look to others to say,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.010
"Hey, what do you know?

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:11.389
What do you know?"

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:16.190
So others and through their energy offer their
experience and their stories and that can

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.389
shift us as well.

00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:22.580
We don't all have to have a concussion and
a near death experience.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:31.830
&gt;&gt;Presenter: We have a functioning mic now.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.519
&gt;&gt;male #6: My name is Mario.

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:36.799
Thank you for coming.

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:41.450
In [inaudible] I remember I grew up in Mexico
and I grew up in a Protestant family and never

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:48.540
really got it but one day I prayed, I say,
"God, I have hard heart, why don't you give

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.519
me a way that I can hear?" and somehow I went
to the bathroom and I thought, Oh, I think

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:57.580
that must have arrived like coming to Google
and hear you just kind of predisposed me to

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.090
really hear and make a change.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:06.490
But, so I just wanted to share that testimony
and the question is I wondered if because

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.490
of [inaudible]

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.540
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: I'm sorry you're going out
there.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.909
Because of?

00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:17.610
We need to get some tech people down here.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:27.030
&gt;&gt;male #6: Somehow I'm not happy because I'm
not loving enough and maybe it's because of

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:33.279
achievement [inaudible] that I'm not loving
enough, that I'm not doing enough so the message

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:40.059
I took from [inaudible] it only takes what
it needs, so I got that part, but when it

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:46.830
comes to give I wonder whether, what's your
view on this, should we just give until we've,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:51.650
like, I don't know how much I need to give
and under which criteria and I somehow feel

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:56.690
I need to give a lot in order to be happy
or I need to sacrifice myself, you know?

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.159
I don't know [inaudible] amount of giving.

00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.750
And I wonder [inaudible]

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:05.420
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: My comment on that is first,
thank you, brother.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:13.580
You've already given to me with your journey
and your beautiful spirit that seeks to be

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.190
of service.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:21.059
My view on giving is that you follow the beauty.

00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:23.309
And that, is this still on?

00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:27.539
Yeah, and that, I heard you, you were raise
Protestant?

00:30:27.539 --> 00:30:28.539
Is that what you said?

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:35.130
I was raised Catholic and there's a Catholic
mentality that I'm always working to rid myself,

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.769
to shed, and that is the feeling of guilt.

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:42.230
I don't think were to feel this feeling and
that I should, the nuns say don't should on

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.190
yourself, right?

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.950
So if you should on yourself you create energy,
"Oh I should have been better, I should have

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.950
been more loving.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.950
I should have been more generous."

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:54.820
That creates and energy attention of lack
that can actually prevent you from being more

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.820
loving.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.230
Just follow your heart.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.669
So, just give a little.

00:30:58.669 --> 00:31:00.149
Wow, that felt great.

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:04.420
I gave a bike to a kid once and that felt
fantastic.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:10.460
One of my crew members, and then I did a crazy
thing, I said, cause she couldn't afford a

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.809
bike and I said, "Well, I wonder if any of
my other crew members would like a bike?"

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:18.970
and by the way if I give money, it's so not
about money, if you give in a moment you give

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.570
in a moment of grace, so it's not about money.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.630
I have money to give.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.980
So I asked my other crew members, "Who else
would like a bike?"

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.590
I thought maybe 20 would pipe up.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.090
400 crew members out of 400 crew members said,
"Me!"

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.419
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: So I gave away 400 bikes and

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:40.140
the feeling was beautiful because I saw people
on the weekends enjoying nature getting out

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.850
into the beautiful countryside.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.720
We're from L.A., we were in Virginia at the
time, I saw this elevation and I felt so blessed

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.149
to be a part of it.

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:50.020
So now I give my class bikes.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.530
I teach a class at Pepperdine and I give them
a bike not to be Oprah.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.940
It's not like, "Today's a refrigerator!

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.940
We're going to Australia!"

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.940
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: "Oh my God!"

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:04.299
No, I give them a bike because I want to remind
that what you already know so well as to remain

00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:09.490
child-like even though the world is saying
get serious with your life, if you do not

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.360
remain child-like as some of the mystic have
said, "You shall not enter the kingdom of

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.210
heaven."

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:20.100
So I followed that joy and now I give bikes,
we give them to inner city kids.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.600
I once freed a slave, what?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.549
Freed a slave, there's 27 million slaves in
the world today.

00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:26.549
What?

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:32.139
We ended slavery in 1865, aha, we didn't because
we didn't end the mentality that creates slavery.

00:32:32.139 --> 00:32:36.220
Which is the commoditization of everything,
that intellectual property that I talked about,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.899
this is what creates slavery.

00:32:37.899 --> 00:32:43.350
Hey, if I can commoditize the human body which
is a little operation from the best guy should

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:48.490
cost a hundred thousand, from a not so good
guy ten thousand, commoditization, why not

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.840
commoditize the whole human body?

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:55.470
It's the same mentality gone askew but it
comes from the same mentality.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.929
Does that make sense to you?

00:32:57.929 --> 00:33:01.360
So give and then follow the beauty.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.389
So, anyway, I freed a slave and I wanted to
say that now I've freed others with Harold

00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:13.030
and our foundation we've been able to free
a village, I believe it was in, the village

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:18.390
was in Southern India and we've, I don't know,
we've freed a couple hundred people.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:22.779
There's a program that goes in and they pull
them out of slavery and trafficking and they

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:26.769
reeducate them, they reintroduce them to their
families and there are people walking free

00:33:26.769 --> 00:33:32.649
and it's because of all of us, because whatever
resources come to us we spit back, we share

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:35.460
back with the world and so we followed that
bliss.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:40.169
I've met these people; I've seen the pictures
of the kids being driven away.

00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:44.149
There's not a product in the world that I
would wanna buy more than seeing the face

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:49.909
of that child who's driving away, free, for
the first time since he was three years old

00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:52.380
and captured.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.070
So I follow that.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.490
So I encourage you to follow that.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:02.900
Whatever makes your heart open and expand
and feel, you'll feel a tear and a smile,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.269
you know, it's not just oh the joy we freed
a child, it's the tear that others may be

00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:11.819
suffering and how do I do what I can to connect?

00:34:11.819 --> 00:34:17.580
&gt;&gt;female #1: My name's Vina, it was a great
[inaudible] and thanks for coming.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:22.820
Um, I just want, I actually have a lot of
questions but [inaudible] off the question

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:29.440
that was just asked, in my day to day life
I wonder at what point do I stop giving and

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.520
I hope I'm not repeating the same question
but [inaudible] on the other side that it's

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:42.889
not as appreciated or valued or even acknowledged,
somewhere in me it burns.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.379
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: What burns, that you're not
acknowledged?

00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:54.609
&gt;&gt; female #1: It burns that I'm able to, I
want to remove the boundary of this is mine

00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:59.030
and [inaudible] and I'm able to step outside
of the boundary and [inaudible] and there's

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:05.780
not even an eye blinking at that thought,
right, like no need for thanks, no need for

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:14.560
re, re, coming back with the same action but
at least just the thought that, "Oh, she did

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:21.420
this" [inaudible] and I continue to do what
I do but I question myself like I should not

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:29.859
feel this way, I'm not gonna have the thankfulness
or the thoughtfulness and that's okay, but

00:35:29.859 --> 00:35:34.859
intrinsically do you believe it's a human
behavior that when on the other side it's

00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:39.160
not appreciated or acknowledged and is that
okay?

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.970
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Well, I think that there's
something that's actually natural because

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.620
what I really think your reaching for is you
don't necessarily want to be thanked, I don't

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.660
think it's that you wanna be, correct me if
I'm wrong, but you don't want someone to go,

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.470
"Oh, you're such a wonderful person!"

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:59.089
You wanna know that the gift, the giving reached
it source.

00:35:59.089 --> 00:36:04.589
To see the child's eyes light up, he didn't
need to thank me, the thanks was in the eyes.

00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:09.990
I think that's what you're reaching for that
there is some understanding that this moment

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:11.710
has had a connection.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.349
&gt;&gt;female #1: That's right.

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:20.170
At a child, it's different because the other
end is not able to do it on their own so you're

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:26.630
doing it but in cases where it's colleagues
or friends or roommates or spouses, you, they

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.960
are equally capable of giving back.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:34.599
But at the same time you see that they are
not even thinking about it.

00:36:34.599 --> 00:36:37.930
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Yes, well, this is a challenge
for all of us.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.770
But we are called to continue to be giving.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:45.010
You said you don't know when to stop giving,
you don't ever stop giving.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.210
Even when you're giving to yourself cause
you need rest, you need perspective, you need

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.160
a moment, you never stop giving.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.940
It's all a gift and you don't give to change
people.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.530
That's what I think your tension may be.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.380
You give and then that roommate doesn't get
it or that parent doesn't get it.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.720
No, that's giving to change.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.890
You give, you share and what gets in gets
in.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:09.210
And you never know, you guys have this amazing
thing where the world, there's beams of light

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:14.460
coming out wherever Google is being searched,
I think that's gonna be our human story that

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.140
you have no idea what beams of light you sent
out that you never were aware of.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.800
How many people may have seen this film that
I'm not aware of?

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.930
How many people may be touched by an act that
you were not necessarily thanked for but you

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.510
affected somebody, you weren't aware it got
in, and they effected somebody else?

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.400
That's that beam of light and I think they're
happening all around us.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.760
So you give in faith.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.560
You give because, as Aristotle said, "Follow
the good"

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.960
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi, my name is Lynn and I loved
the movie.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.990
I thought it was wonderful.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.859
I'm super excited, I'm gonna spread it, it's
gonna happen.

00:37:48.859 --> 00:37:49.859
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Fantastic.

00:37:49.859 --> 00:37:50.859
&gt;&gt;female #2: yeah.

00:37:50.859 --> 00:37:52.780
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: This is Google, spread the
frickin' thing!

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.780
&gt;&gt;female #2: Yeah!

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.780
[Laughter]

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.780
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Can we not spread it?

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.780
&gt;&gt;female #2: Absolutely.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.950
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: All the proceeds are going
to causes so spread.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:06.690
&gt;&gt;female #2: What I thought was most interesting
about it was it's not like the concept of

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.740
loving people and having that, that's not
new.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:13.760
That's been around, everyone's talked about
that before, what I think is new and interesting

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.930
is the way that you're talking about it and
the communication and the language, the narrative

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.119
that you're using to describe that.

00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:24.980
And I think you are in a unique position as
someone who created characters in a narrative

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.720
such as like, Ace Ventura, that maybe it's
more approachable to maybe a more of a mass

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.190
audience because they're like, "Well, he thought
Jim Carrey was funny, I think Jim Carrey is

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.190
funny."

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.190
I don't know.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.829
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;female #2: But what my question is, is more

00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:43.430
about when you use these different communication
styles I would certainly expect some people

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:47.530
to completely dismiss a lot of what you might
say sometimes when they think it's too out

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:53.740
there or almost hurt by the kind of hippy
dippy movement where they think, "Oh, he must

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:58.240
be just hallucinating something rather than
actually speaking truth."

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.210
So you use science, you use humor, you used
film to communicate this message and do you

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:09.829
ever find yourself tailoring your message
or tailoring your language to audiences in

00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:15.550
order to make more of an impact, in order
to really grab onto that, the main concept

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.550
which is love?

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.250
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Yes all the time.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.900
But I don't see that as a downside.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:27.300
Emerson said, "If you find nothing but the
commonality that the rain, it rains on both

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.770
you and your adversary, find that commonality."

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.150
So I need to find out what it is that grabs
you.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.990
I'm an entertainer, right?

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:40.180
I knew when we did "Bruce Almighty", a lot
of ideas about spirituality, prayer, the energy

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.620
we put out, love, but I knew that if it wasn't
insanely funny nobody would see it.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:50.319
So I know that humor is hardwired in us, it's
a trait that's evolved so I like to reach

00:39:50.319 --> 00:39:51.319
into that trait.

00:39:51.319 --> 00:39:53.180
It's, you know what a belly laugh is?

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.660
It literally makes you vulnerable because
you get hit in the gut.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.700
When you get hit in the gut you get vulnerable
and then you can drop a seed.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.940
So I do it all the time.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.390
We're, Harold and I, are pitching a talk show
to MTV, I've been with Oprah for a long time

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.290
but I think we may not be on the Oprah Winfrey
Network and we may actually go on MTV, they

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.040
wanna do talk now.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.580
So the conversation is now exactly what you
said.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:21.329
How do ideas like this get in to a youth culture
that's addicted to the Jersey Shore?

00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:24.270
To Teen Mom 2?

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.690
And we find the commonality and then we get
in.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:32.270
So we make them laugh, we do something that's
visually exciting to them.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.910
But we say there's a principle behind this,
guys, there's a reason that we put this on.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.160
You see that silly stunt you love in "Jackass"
that made you go, "Oooh!"

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.480
That's actually your vagus nerves firing because
you are hardwired to connect to someone.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.390
You actually felt that kick in the nuts.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:50.290
You felt it in your own and if you don't have
them, you felt it somewhere down there.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.750
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: So we can use that to connect

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:57.660
and say that there's a larger story that you're
not being taught, that you are connected,

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.690
that you're not to be separate but it's in
your biology.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.400
So we'll, you're very perceptive.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.410
Join us on our talk show, please.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.849
How we doing on the time, Harold, we good?

00:41:08.849 --> 00:41:12.750
A couple more minutes and we're done and then
you're back to, it's been, what?

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.190
45 minutes since you've eaten?

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.490
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: I mean my goodness.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.619
[Sigh]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: By the way, so smart, there's

00:41:20.619 --> 00:41:29.540
so many things so smart at this company it
just is, I encourage you to expand that wisdom.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.930
Expand it.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:34.609
It's so smart when you look at the food and
you're saying like eat different, rotate your

00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:38.780
diet and eat organic and you were saying,
Cliff, how you're actually going to places

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.990
now and asking them to use organic products
and it's fantastic.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:49.550
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hey, hi, um, my name is Clarissa,
how are you doing today?

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:50.680
Thanks so much for coming.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.770
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Thank you very much, Clarissa,
I'm doing very well, how are you?

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.460
Take care, bye, bye then.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.460
[Laughter]

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.980
&gt;&gt;female #3: Sorry about that.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:06.329
My question is what do you think the tipping
point is to effect change on a large scale

00:42:06.329 --> 00:42:12.490
level and if we look at food as an example,
you know, there's a huge organic movement

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:17.520
here in California but, you know, if I wanna
eat an organic mango it's gonna cost 5 dollars

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:22.480
or if I wanna help someone, it's gonna cost
me 5 dollars to give, to buy an organic mango

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.109
and give it to somebody.

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:33.540
And what do we do to counter other external
forces of the use of pesticides and different

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:40.160
farming practices that are not organic and
related to this also is, you know, maybe this

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.859
is a function of me being from New York, I
have a fear of if I help someone that I don't

00:42:44.859 --> 00:42:52.750
know I might get robbed or killed or raped
or what do I do to, as an individual, to counter

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:57.290
these external and internal forces, if this
makes sense?

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.640
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Wow

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Jeez Where am I?

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.490
At Google?

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:07.060
First of all let me answer you, there's a
couple questions in there and I'm tempted

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.640
to give the shortest answer that I can give.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.890
You said what is the tipping point for these
changes and I think the tipping point is you.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:23.530
You, very specifically, you, you.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.440
Do you know what I mean by that?

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:34.270
Yes, so you wanna eat more organic so you
can't go somewhere and get a reasonably priced

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:41.550
organic smoothie or apple from the store,
what does a person do when they're faced with

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.830
that?

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.960
They can blog about it, talk about it, talk
to the produce manager, look online, Google

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:54.579
where can I find something and when enough
of you do that a revolution happens.

00:43:54.579 --> 00:43:59.790
We all know the word love is buried inside
revolution but you have to turn it around.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:08.450
So when you do that and then you add, and
you and I, Egypt happens.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:10.700
You already have the recipe here.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.210
You've cooked it.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:15.320
You've helped the world in revolution.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:20.490
Look at the principle and be the principle.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.930
I don't even know what your second question
was.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:24.930
I forgot.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.280
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: I know it was something but

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.829
that, there's enough to chew on there.

00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:32.180
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So we have time for one final
question.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.619
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: We have time for one final
question.

00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:34.819
&gt;&gt;female #4: And I win that privilege.

00:44:34.819 --> 00:44:35.819
I'm Jennifer.

00:44:35.819 --> 00:44:36.819
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Hi Jennifer.

00:44:36.819 --> 00:44:39.619
&gt;&gt;female #4: I wanted to make a couple comments
about the film.

00:44:39.619 --> 00:44:44.319
First of all I thought the little pictogram
about the Indian village and the hunter was

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:45.319
so, just amazing.

00:44:45.319 --> 00:44:48.980
I mean, it was just very simple but something
that we could show to elementary school kids,

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:49.980
just amazing.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.550
And it's something people can walk away with
and really stick in your gut in terms of understanding

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:55.550
that kind of idea.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.220
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Before you go on can I ask
you about that?

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.220
&gt;&gt;female #4: Sure.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.730
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: So, does everyone remember
what she's talking about?

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.809
In the movie there's a hunter that said, "Wait
a second, I'm the best hunter."

00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:07.280
Do you see how I am also that hunter?

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.559
Do you see how many of us are also that hunter?

00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:14.970
I'm the best comedy director, like of the
'90s anyway, quote, unquote, cause of the

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.119
grosses.

00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:17.650
I deserve more.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:22.390
Okay, I wanna make sure that it's relatable
because that really wasn't a tribe about a

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.020
native culture that was a tribe about us and
me.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.020
Okay.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.869
&gt;&gt;female #4: And that's why I said elementary
school kids should watch that.

00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:35.349
My second comment about the film was how you
in there interspersed commentary about economy

00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:40.280
and how we've really kind of taken the idea
of using economy to serve the greater good

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.160
to now it becoming some, you know, money play
and people fighting to be on top which kind

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.740
of connects to that tribe example.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.670
My question to you is, so given your success
in Hollywood and how that has really kind

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:57.450
of given you this opportunity to spread this
word about love and sharing and all these

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:03.480
great things, what's your philosophy about
Hollywood and how do you balance that very

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.450
fine line because it sounds like you're still
somewhat involved in media and talking about

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:14.829
the MTV thing, how do you get that balance
right so that you're adding value and bringing

00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:21.040
good media to the world but also not getting
sucked kind of into that glitzy, money, Hollywood

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.490
vortex?

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:33.570
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Well, I happen to love my friends
in Hollywood even though they're crazy.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:39.700
I love them and I'm in dialogue with them
and I don't try to change them.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.960
Many have responded to this film.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:47.900
I don't mind naming names; Courtney Cox is
a dear friend, flipped over the movie.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.170
Brian Grazer is not producing the Academy
Awards, he's Ron Howard's partner, flipped

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.069
over the movie.

00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:55.990
And they're just like you and I.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:47:00.869
They're artists, they're creators, they were
raised in the same culture I'm raised in and

00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:03.390
something got stirred up.

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:08.140
So I just dialogue with them and live and
don't say, "Why do you live in this big house?"

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.339
Some people think I think, "Well, you shouldn't
live in that big house, that's what the movie's

00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:12.339
about!"

00:47:12.339 --> 00:47:13.339
No it's not.

00:47:13.339 --> 00:47:14.339
It's what's true for you.

00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:15.339
What does your heart tell you?

00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:18.891
There may be artistry, community, something
about the place where you're living, I was

00:47:18.891 --> 00:47:22.640
a single guy, I didn't need what I need, what
I had and I moved from it.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.770
What's true for you?

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:26.230
So I judge none of them.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:27.660
I share with all of them.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:33.510
And as far as what I wanna put out I'm only
gonna put out what I wanna put out.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:36.559
And if that means starvation, I will starve.

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:39.220
I would much rather feed my soul than my body.

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.220
My body's had enough.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.400
I'll feed the soul.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.809
So I'm simply gonna put out what I, everybody
thinks I'm nuts, I mean, I was the first one

00:47:48.809 --> 00:47:51.869
to move into a quote, unquote, trailer park,
this is an expensive trailer park, I wanna

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:55.590
be very clear because the headlines are "Moves
to trailer park" if you came to where we lived

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.050
you'd go, "Jeez, I'd live here."

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.580
It's beautiful but it was out of the paradigm,
right?

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.849
I was looking at 20 million dollar homes and
these were 1 and under 1 to 2 hundred thousand,

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:05.849
what?

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:06.849
Is he crazy?

00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:09.980
You don't even own the land and you have to
live with normal people.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.280
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Or it's retired police officers

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.809
and teachers, what?

00:48:15.809 --> 00:48:19.440
That's why we put up walls and fences to not
see them, right?

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.180
And I found such beauty there that many of
my friends in show business, there's a an

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:26.510
agent there, a huge director who I won't name,
has moved in.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.990
We have a community of 6 or 8 families that
have moved in because they see the beauty

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.940
of what this is.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:40.839
So I just continue to live what, to me, as
I said to you, feels expansive.

00:48:40.839 --> 00:48:46.670
And so I encourage all of you, I think you're
all here for a reason besides a nap.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:50.640
I saw the napping pods; you don't have to
come here to nap.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.950
I think you're here for a reason.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:58.579
So whatever this film, however it touched
you and moved you, I hope it at least has

00:48:58.579 --> 00:49:02.500
opened you up to the idea that maybe there's
more conversation to be had at Google to how

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.940
Google can actually break down whatever walls,
the bubble, we've created here or whatever

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.500
bubble exists and spread this.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:18.369
Again, not just the information but I kept
digging into Cliff, what's the philosophy?

00:49:18.369 --> 00:49:23.080
And your founders have so, they're onto something.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.440
And I think we just need to look in every
drawer and say, "Ah, is it in that drawer?

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.559
Is it in that drawer?

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:32.540
Wait a second, here's a drawer that doesn't
look like it's in.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.829
How do we get it in there?"

00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:38.600
You guys are a glimpse at our future.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:44.780
You're a glimpse at our future but while we
sit on the cushion of advantage let's not

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.840
fall asleep, right?

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:55.770
Let's always be looking to see how can we
expand this so that others can share in the

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:56.770
bounty?

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.750
Cause there's absolutely, Gandhi said it,
so many of our leaders, there's plenty for

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.990
the need, there's not enough for the greed.

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:08.310
&gt;&gt;Presenter: On that note, Tom, thank you
very much for speaking at Google and for showing

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:09.310
us what's right in the world.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.310
&gt;&gt;Tom Shadyac: Thank you, brother.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:11.310
Thank you, Cliff.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.820
Thanks for having us.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.130
[Applause]
