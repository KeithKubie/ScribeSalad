00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we've just seen how to integrate JavaScript and HTML in our interpreter

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in our web browser.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let me show you a more complicated example.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We'll see how it plays out in real life.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We often use this tag to begin a webpage.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's not strictly necessary, but it's very good practice.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're going to use this tag to begin a paragraph.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Just to remind us, it's possible to have comments in HTML.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The lexer strips them out, so we're not going to see them at the interpreter level.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here I've put in a list of word elements, This is a,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and then here's a tag element, and inside it, nested are 3 more word elements

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then the tag element ends.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is an anchor tag, making a link to Google.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's say I want to write a webpage about John Searle's famous

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Chinese Room thought experiment, in which he argues against

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or at least puts forth positions that cause one to consider artificial intelligence.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's fun stuff.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But I don't remember exactly when he made the experiment.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I will in a totally contrived example.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Super contrived. Use Javascript to compute this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So let's say I can't remember exactly when he came out with the Chinese Room

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
thought experiment, but I do know that the date was equal to 1,260 + 6 factorial.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If only there were some way I could carryout this computation on my webpage.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Whoa is me! So I've written some Javascript to do just that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I compute 6 factorial + 1,260 and write it out and then we finish out with the rest

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of our webpage text.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So this whole bit here is an embedded JavaScript fragment.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Over here, we see the final result. This is a link to Google.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
John Searle's italicized Chinese Room thought experiment from 1980--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
oh! that's when it was. How silly of me not to remember!--

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
argues against artificial intelligence.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And you may notice that since there's some space here at the end of the script,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
this comma doesn't line up exactly with the 1980.

00:01:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's not worry about that for now.
