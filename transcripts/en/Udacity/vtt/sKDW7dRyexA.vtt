00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This problem is a challenge problem and it's not a challenge problem because it's particularly

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
mathematically difficult, but rather the concept is really tricky to understand.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to be talking about escape velocity.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What is escape velocity? Well to understand this let's imagine a rocket on the surface of the earth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
First let's imagine that this rocket takes off with a very small speed. It's not going very fast.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then you can imagine that gravity pulling on the ship will cause it to slow down

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and fall back down to earth.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Even at greater speed it might take off, finally come to a stop, and then fall back towards the earth.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And this makes sense because the force of gravity is always pulling on the rocket.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In fact, no matter how far away the rocket is from the earth,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the earth will always be pulling on the rocket.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If we draw a force diagram for a rocket, we see that the only force acting on it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is the force of gravity pulling it back towards earth.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
No matter what speed the rocket is going, it's always accelerating back towards earth.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And since it's accelerating back towards earth, the rocket is always slowing down.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It makes sense that at some point it comes to rest and then falls back to earth.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Even though this rocket is always accelerating towards earth and in fact is always slowing down

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
it actually is still possible for the rocket to escape the earth forever

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and never be pulled back down.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Just keep going away from the earth forever. That seems like a strange idea.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If it's always slowing down, how can it avoid stopping completely? Well, let's find out.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The answer to this question actually lies in this formula for

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
gravitational potential energy that we just discussed.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now if you remember our discussion of potential energy in the unit,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we discussed how we can always set our potential energy to be 0

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
at any point we want as long as we stick to it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In fact this formula could have some constant added onto it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to make it so the gravitational was 0 at a specific location.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's be smart in picking a good choice for what we want the zero potential energy point to be.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm going to choose a point really, really, really far away from the earth

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to be where my gravitational potential energy is equal to 0.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And it just so happens that this choice for a potential energy of zero point

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
happens to be when K equals 0 and let's see why.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
As we get further and further away from the earth,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
R, the distance from the rocket to the earth, gets bigger and bigger and bigger

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which means this value continues to get closer to 0.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And the only time this value ever gets to be 0 is when R goes to infinity

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
at some point really far away from the earth.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
That's why we don't actually need that constant K here to get that same effect.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Okay. But that doesn't really explain why I chose the zero point to be off at infinity.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Why wouldn't I choose it at like the surface of the earth or something else like that.?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Well let's find out how choosing our zero point for gravitational potential energy at infinity

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
helps us reason about escape velocity.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now, once again, we're going to tackle this problem by using conservation of energy.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The idea that the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is the same at any point in the problem.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
For my starting point, I'm going to choose the original rocket taking off point.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
At which point, the rocket has some initial kinetic energy and some initial potential energy.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And for my final point, I'm going to choose the point when the rockets finally stops moving

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the acceleration caused by the force pulling it back towards the earth

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
finally causes its velocity to reach 0.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
At this point, there is no kinetic energy.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
All right. So now we want to consider a few cases of what happened if the sum

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of the kinetic and potential energy when the rocket lifts off has different values.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
First, I want to consider the case where the sum is less than 0.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
If the kinetic energy plus the original potential energy is less than 0

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
then we know that the final potential energy must also be less than 0.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And this is great because if we look at our general formula for gravitational potential energy

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we see that the value is always negative because of this negative sign on the front.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We should be easily able to solve for R,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the distance the rocket is away from the earth when its speed finally reaches 0.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Now, what about the case where the original kinetic energy

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
plus the original potential energy is greater than 0?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Well then in this case the final potential energy must also be greater than 0.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But this poses a problem since this formula says that gravitational potential energy

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is always negative, we're in trouble.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
How can the final potential energy be greater than 0 and less than 0 at the same time?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The solution is they can't be. So what went wrong?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Well, to get to this point, we assumed that the final kinetic energy was 0.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
If setting the final kinetic energy equal to 0 leads to a contradiction,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
then it must be the case that the final kinetic energy can't ever be 0.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And what does that mean? It means that the rocket never slows down to 0 velocity.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Even though it's always accelerating towards the earth,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it never slows all the way down and falls back to earth.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
If the rocket never reaches 0 velocity and never falls back to earth,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
we can say that the rocket has successfully escaped.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And that's what it means for the rocket to have escape velocity.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Its original kinetic energy plus the original potential energy is greater than 0.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And as you might've guessed, the threshold case where the rocket

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
has just enough velocity to escape is when the kinetic energy

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
plus the potential energy is exactly equal to 0.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Awesome. All right. Now that you know this fact, you're ready to tell me

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
what speed does the rocket need to be going in order to escape the earth

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
from the surface of the earth? What is its escape velocity?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
In order to solve this problem you're going to need these constants.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The value of big G, the value of the radius of the earth, and the mass of the earth.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Good luck finding the escape velocity.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And if you're confused about any of the topics I just discussed,

00:05:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
