MANUEL VIVO: In Android Q, we
are improving the ShareSheet.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.290
We're introducing a new sharing
shortcuts API that makes

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.750
Direct Share lightning-fast.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.610
Also, there is a
new content preview

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.270
for text, images, and files.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.100
Direct Share is a
feature that allows

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.980
apps to show app-specific
options directly

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.330
in the ShareSheet.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.730
Those options are called
Sharing Shortcuts.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.180
For example, a
messaging app using it

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.400
can enable the user to share
content to a contact directly.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.280
While the Direct Share
feature is still supported,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.880
the legacy Direct Share
API is now deprecated.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.680
Going forward, you will use
the new Sharing Shortcuts API.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.620
Unlike the deprecated
APIs, Sharing Shortcuts

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.540
are published in advance, making
the ShareSheet load instantly

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.540
when launched.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.040
This is similar to how the
ShortcutManner API works.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.710
That's why we've
expanded the ShortcutInfo

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.500
API to make the integration
of both features easier.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.990
The new Sharing
Shortcuts API is also

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.530
supported in the new
ShareTarget AndroidX library.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.650
That makes Direct Share
backwards-compatible down

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.700
to Android M.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.390
Taking into account that
sharing target's implemented

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.910
with the legacy
Direct Share API will

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.820
be deprioritized in
Android Q, meaning

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.520
that they will appear
after the ones published

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.160
with the new API.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.150
Using the ShortcutManagerCompat
class from the support library

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.510
is the preferred way to
publish Sharing Shortcuts.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.940
That will work on
older Android versions

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.090
without any extra work needed.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.300
Follow these steps to publish
Sharing Shortcuts using

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.340
the new API.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.130
First, declare share
target elements

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.200
in your shortcuts.xml file.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.450
And add the metadata
to your main activity

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.660
in the Android manifest file.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.240
Secondly, publish
dynamic shortcuts

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.730
to the already declared share
targets using this Shortcut

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.360
Manager API.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.090
Lastly, to make it
backwards-compatible,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.520
add this metadata tag
to the activity that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.460
will handle the shared intent.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.590
That's all.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.500
Without Direct Share, this is
how your app would look like.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.830
With the new changes and support
for the new content preview,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.650
this is how the
ShareSheet has changed.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.640
Now users can jump
straight into your app

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.800
when sharing content
from another app.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.840

about Direct Share,
