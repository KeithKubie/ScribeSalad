00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:01.469
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.274
is prove that if a
function is differentiable

00:00:04.274 --> 00:00:06.442
at some point, C, that it's also

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.002
going to be continuous at that point C.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.435
But, before we do the proof,
let's just remind ourselves

00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:15.008
what differentiability means
and what continuity means.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.246
So, first, differentiability.

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:21.469
Differentiability

00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:24.210
So, let's think about that, first.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.440
And it's always helpful to draw ourselves

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.242
a function.

00:00:29.374 --> 00:00:32.744
So, that's our Y-axis.

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:36.269
This is our X-axis.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.507
And let's just draw some function, here.

00:00:38.507 --> 00:00:40.746
So, let's say my function looks like this

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:44.133
and we care about the point X equals C,

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.773
which is right over here.

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:48.470
So, that's the point X equals C,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.434
and then, this value, of course,

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:53.337
is going to be F of C.

00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:54.709
F of C.

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:57.813
And one way that we
can find the derivative

00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:00.901
at X equals C, or the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:05.270
at X equals C is, we could
start with some other point.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.547
Say, some arbitrary X out here.

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:11.479
So, let's say this is
some arbitrary X out here.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.944
So, then, this point right
over there, this value,

00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:17.629
this Y value, would be F of X.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.108
Would be F of X.

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:23.267
This graph, of course, is
a graph of Y equals F of X.

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:27.513
And we can think about finding
the slope of this line,

00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:30.802
this secant line between these two points,

00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:33.609
but then, we can find the
limit as X approaches C.

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.971
And as X approaches C, this secant,

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.947
the slope of the secant
line is going to approach

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:39.303
the slope of the tangent line, or,

00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:40.972
it's going to be the derivative.

00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:43.613
And so, we could take the limit...

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:48.134
The limit as X approaches C,

00:01:48.134 --> 00:01:50.846
as X approaches C,

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:54.301
of the slope of this secant line.

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:55.206
So, what's the slope?

00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:57.641
Well, it's gonna be change
in Y over change in X.

00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:01.711
The change in Y is F of X minus F of C,

00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:03.678
that's our change in Y right over here.

00:02:03.678 --> 00:02:06.266
This is all review, this
is just one definition

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.700
of the derivative, or one way
to think about the derivative.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.506
So, it's going to be F of X minus F of C,

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:16.577
that's our change in Y,
over our change in X.

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:20.371
Over our change in X, which is X minus C.

00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:23.974
It is X minus,

00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:26.480
X minus C.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.445
So, if this limit exists,
then, we're able to find

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:32.066
the slope of the tangent
line at this point,

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:34.172
and we call that slope
of the tangent line,

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:37.510
we call that the derivative at X equals C.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.908
We say that this is going
to be equal to F prime,

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:42.877
F prime of C.

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:44.779
All of this is review.

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.370
So, if we're saying, one
way to think about it,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.240
if we're saying that the function, F,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.362
is differentiable at X equals C,

00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:53.000
we're really just saying that this limit

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.642
right over here actually exists.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:56.978
And if this limit actually exists,

00:02:56.978 --> 00:02:59.573
we just call that value F prime of C.

00:02:59.573 --> 00:03:02.079
So, that's just a review
of differentiability.

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.338
Now, let's give ourselves
a review of continuity.

00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:10.581
Continuity.

00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:13.671
So, the definition for continuity is

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:18.671
if the limit as X approaches C of F of X

00:03:19.412 --> 00:03:22.813
is equal to F of C.

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:25.218
Now, this might seem a
little bit, you know,

00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:27.908
well, it might pop out
to you as being intuitive

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:29.900
or it might seem a little,
well, where did this come from,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.277
well, let's visualize it and hopefully

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.471
it'll make some intuitive sense.

00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:36.258
So, if you have a function,

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:37.300
so, let's actually look at some cases

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.080
where you're not continuous.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.966
And that actually might make
it a little bit more clear.

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:45.443
So, if you had a point
discontinuity at X equals C,

00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:48.459
so, this is X equals C, so, if you had

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.608
a point discontinuity, so,

00:03:50.608 --> 00:03:53.026
lemme draw it like this, actually.

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:55.645
So, you have a gap, here, and X equals,

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:59.779
when X equals C, F of C
is actually way up here.

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:03.475
So, this is F of C, and then,

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.744
the function continues like this.

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:09.170
The limit, as X approaches C of F of X

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.512
is going to be this value,
which is clearly different

00:04:13.512 --> 00:04:14.646
than F of C.

00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:17.433
This value right over here,
if you take the limit,

00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:22.414
if you take the limit as
X approaches C of F of X,

00:04:23.043 --> 00:04:24.272
you're approaching this value.

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.144
This, right over here, is the limit,

00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:30.945
as X approaches C of F of X,
which is different than F of C.

00:04:30.945 --> 00:04:33.410
So, it makes it, so, this
definition of continuity

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.204
seems to be good, at least for this case,

00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:38.980
because this is not a continuous function,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.900
you have a point discontinuity.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.399
So, for at least in this case, our,

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.671
this definition of
continuity would properly

00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:49.371
identify this as not
a continuous function.

00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:52.533
Now, you could also think
about a jump discontinuity.

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.679
You can also think about
a jump discontinuity.

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.068
So, let's look at this.

00:04:57.068 --> 00:05:00.110
And all this is, hopefully,
a little bit of review.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.045
So, a jump discontinuity
at C, at X equals C,

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:04.900
might look like this.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.598
Might look like this.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:11.343
So, this is at X equals C.

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:13.870
So, this is X equals C right over here.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.145
This would be F of C.

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:19.501
But, if you tried to
find a value at the limit

00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:21.935
as X approaches C of F of X,

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:24.041
you'd get a different
value as you approach

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.333
C from the negative side, you
would approach this value,

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:29.143
and as you approach C
from the positive side,

00:05:29.143 --> 00:05:32.246
you would approach F of C, and
so, the limit wouldn't exist.

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:34.103
So, this limit right
over here wouldn't exist

00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:37.503
in the case of jump, of this
type of a jump discontinuity.

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.547
So, once again, this
definition would properly

00:05:40.547 --> 00:05:43.808
say that this is not,
this one right over here,

00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:47.674
is not continuous, this limit
actually would not even exist.

00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:49.671
And then, you could even look at a,

00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:54.245
you could look at a function
that is truly continuous.

00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:57.346
If you look at a function
that is truly continuous.

00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:00.077
So, something like this.

00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:01.403
Something like this.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.337
That is X equals C.

00:06:03.337 --> 00:06:05.100
Well, this is F of C.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.940
This is F of C.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.843
And if you were to take the
limit as X approaches C,

00:06:09.843 --> 00:06:13.404
as X approaches C from
either side of F of X,

00:06:13.404 --> 00:06:15.371
you're going to approach F of C.

00:06:15.371 --> 00:06:19.234
So, here, you have the
limit as X approaches C

00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:22.873
of F of X, indeed, is equal to F of C.

00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:25.537
So, it's what you would expect
for a continuous function.

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:27.346
So, now that we've done that review

00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:29.669
of differentiability and continuity,

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.370
let's prove that differentiability

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.180
actually implies continuity,
and I think it's important

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.767
to kinda do this review,
just so that you can

00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:38.703
really visualize things.

00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:42.368
So, differentiability implies this limit

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.101
right over here exists.

00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:46.378
So, let's start with a
slightly different limit.

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:48.941
Lemme draw a line, here, actually.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.744
Lemme draw a line just so we're
doing something different.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:56.101
So, let's take, let us take the limit

00:06:56.101 --> 00:07:00.844
as X approaches C of F of X,

00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:04.511
of F of X minus F of C.

00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:07.175
Of F of X minus F of C.

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:09.046
Well, can we rewrite this?

00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:11.744
Well, we could rewrite this as the limit,

00:07:11.744 --> 00:07:14.739
as X approaches C, and
we could essentially

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:16.269
take this expression and multiply

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.236
and divide it by X minus C.

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:20.842
So, let's multiply it times X minus C.

00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:24.536
X minus C, and divide it by X minus C.

00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:28.608
So, we have F of X minus F of C,

00:07:28.608 --> 00:07:31.635
all of that over X minus C.

00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:33.980
So, all I did is I
multiplied and I divided

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.900
by X minus C.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.644
Well, what's this limit
going to be equal to?

00:07:38.644 --> 00:07:40.574
This is going to be equal to,

00:07:40.574 --> 00:07:42.700
it's going to be the limit,
and I'm just applying

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.507
the property of limit, applying
a property of limits, here.

00:07:47.507 --> 00:07:49.468
So, the limit of the product is equal to

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.581
the same thing as a product of the limits.

00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:55.365
So, it's the limit as X
approaches C of X minus C,

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:58.631
times the limit, lemme write this way,

00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:03.631
times the limit as X approaches C

00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:08.274
of F of X minus F of C,

00:08:08.274 --> 00:08:11.376
all of that over X minus C.

00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:15.344
Now, what is this thing right over here?

00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:19.707
Well, if we assume that
F is differentiable at C,

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:20.944
and we're going to do that, actually,

00:08:20.944 --> 00:08:22.443
I should have started off there.

00:08:22.443 --> 00:08:26.867
Let's assume 'cause we wanted
to show the differentiability,

00:08:26.867 --> 00:08:28.475
it proves continuity.

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:32.946
If we assume F differentiable,

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:37.667
differentiable at C, well then,

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:41.431
this right over here is just
going to be F prime of C.

00:08:41.807 --> 00:08:43.441
This right over here, we
just saw it right over here,

00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:45.407
that's this exact same thing.

00:08:45.407 --> 00:08:49.702
This is F prime, F prime of C.

00:08:50.104 --> 00:08:51.334
And what is this thing right over here?

00:08:51.334 --> 00:08:54.413
The limit as X approaches C of X minus C?

00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:55.679
Well, that's just gonna be zero.

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.180
As X approaches C, there's gonna become,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.900
approach C minus C, that's
just going to be zero.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:04.645
So, what's zero times F prime of C?

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:06.342
Well, F prime of C is just
going to be some value,

00:09:06.342 --> 00:09:09.276
so, zero times anything
is just going to be zero.

00:09:09.276 --> 00:09:10.942
So, I did all that work to get a zero.

00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:12.909
Now, why is this interesting?

00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:14.874
Well, we just said, we just assumed

00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:16.714
that if F is differentiable at C,

00:09:16.714 --> 00:09:20.803
and we evaluate this limit, we get zero.

00:09:20.803 --> 00:09:23.766
So, if we assume F is differentiable at C,

00:09:23.766 --> 00:09:27.946
we can write, we can write the limit,

00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:32.033
I'm just rewriting it, the
limit as X approaches C

00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:36.811
of F of X minus F of
C, and I could even put

00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:37.812
parenthesis around it like that,

00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:39.545
which I already did up here,

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:42.008
is equal to zero.

00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:43.100
Well, this is the same thing,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.379
I could use limit properties again,

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:46.066
this is the same thing as saying,

00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:47.406
and I'll do it over, well, actually,

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:49.514
lemme do it down here.

00:09:49.514 --> 00:09:54.514
The limit as X approaches C of F of X

00:09:55.235 --> 00:09:59.373
minus the limit as X approaches C

00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:04.634
of F of C, of F of C, is equal to zero.

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:06.967
The different, the limit of the difference

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:09.233
is the same thing as the
difference of the limits.

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:11.834
Well, what's this thing
over here going to be?

00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:13.301
Well, F of C is just a number,

00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:14.844
it's not a function of X anymore,

00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:17.637
it's just, F of C is going
to valuate it to something.

00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:20.668
So, this is just going to be F of C.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.646
This is just going to be F of C.

00:10:22.646 --> 00:10:25.303
So, the limit of F of X as X approaches C,

00:10:25.303 --> 00:10:27.878
minus F of C is equal to zero.

00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:30.733
Well, just add F of C to both
sides and what do you get?

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:34.933
Well, you get the limit as X approaches C

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:38.804
of F of X is equal to F of C.

00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:41.033
And this is the definition of continuity.

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:44.402
The limit of my function as X approaches C

00:10:44.402 --> 00:10:47.167
is equal to the function,
is equal to the value

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:49.068
of the function at C.

00:10:49.068 --> 00:10:53.340
This is, this means that
our function is continuous.

00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:57.347
Continuous at C.

00:10:57.347 --> 00:11:01.012
So, just a reminder, we started assuming

00:11:01.012 --> 00:11:03.609
F differentiable at C, we use that fact

00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:06.847
to evaluate this limit right over here,

00:11:06.847 --> 00:11:08.875
which, we got to be equal to zero,

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:11.075
and if that limit is equal to zero,

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:13.681
then, it just follows, just
doing a little bit of algebra

00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:15.380
and using properties of limits,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.736
that the limit as X approaches C of F of X

00:11:17.736 --> 00:11:20.771
is equal to F of C, and
that's our definition

00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:23.379
of being continuous.

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:26.345
Continuous at the point C.

00:11:26.345 --> 00:11:27.714
So, hopefully, that satisfies you.

00:11:27.714 --> 00:11:31.007
If we know that the
derivative exists at a point,

00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:32.707
if it's differentiable at a point C,

00:11:32.707 --> 00:11:35.780
that means it's also
continuous at that point C.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.513
The function is also
continuous at that point.
