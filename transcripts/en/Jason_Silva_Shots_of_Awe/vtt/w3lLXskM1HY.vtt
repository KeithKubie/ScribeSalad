00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.200
SPEAKER: So life.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.170
Life is an anti-entropic
phenomenon.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.870
In a universe in which the
second law of thermodynamics,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.180
entropy is breaking
everything down,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.500
life is a brief upwelling
of structure against chaos.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.390
Life moves towards greater
complexity and organization.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.520
Life overcomes limits.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.100
And as Bucky Fuller use to
say, "Life is anti-entropic."

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.570
But life means energy. .

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.190
And energy, my
friends, as you know,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.740
is a hot button
topic these days.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.060
The dream fusion huge, the
idea that you could put energy

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.560
into something and actually
get more energy out

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.010
of it than you put in.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.110
And so far, it has eluded us.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080
But it has captured
our imagination.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.530
And so now, in the south of
France, in the Alpine forest,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.070
a machine called the
International Thermonuclear

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.810
Experimental
Reactor is literally

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.960
the sparking and the controlling
of a self-sustaining, synthetic

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.850
star.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.386
This machine promises to
fulfill the dream of fusion.

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:19.580
It will literally be, honor,
a synthetic, self-sustaining

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.480
star.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.620
Mankind, the species that
overcomes and transcends

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.470
limits, humanity, is ushering
in its trans-humanity

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.950
by potentially solving
the problem of energy.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.340
A self-sustaining,
synthetic star.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.760
The dream to get more energy
out of it than you put in.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.700
So whether it ends up
working, we shall find out.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.870
But just the idea of it, I
cannot think of something more

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.600
magnificent.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.380
Maybe a little heretical,
as well, but magnificent.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.706
I just-- [SIGHS] we're
gonna create a star.

00:01:56.706 --> 00:02:00.810
We're gonna Create a star.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.794
Just thought it was amazing.

00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:03.460
All right, guys.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.875
So be sure to check out
our sister network, Seeker,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.740
As human beings, exploring
is in our nature.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.730
We want to learn and
discover until we

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.220
are able to better
comprehend not

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.940
only the world, but ourselves.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.780
What is without becomes within.
