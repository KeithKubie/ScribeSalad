00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.320
- [Instructor] So this
is your brain, say hi.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.200
Okay, it's a representation of your brain.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.350
Brains don't have hands, they have lobes

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.370
and other structures which we'll get to.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.240
But I wanna talk to you about your brain.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.360
You see, your brain is
capable of incredible things

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.800
but I think a lot of times,
we can feel pretty down

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.860
on our brains, on ol' Thinky Pinky here.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.990
We beat up on him, say bad things

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.543
about our brain's abilities.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.070
Say, we have trouble
understanding a subject in school

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.890
or solving problems or
learning a new skill.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.320
It's easy to say, oh I'm not smart.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.110
I'll always be this way.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.730
Hey, stop doing that.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.550
What we think of as intelligence,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.250
what we think of as
smartness, is not fixed,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.440
is not stuck in one
place, is not permanent.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.730
Your brain can improve.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.840
Your brain can grow.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.410
Come with me on a journey of discovery!

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.590
Here we go, into the brain.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.840
Excuse me, coming in hot.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.230
This is a thing called a neuron.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.663
Oh hey, welcome to the
inside of your brain.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.470
A neuron is a brain cell.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.720
There's over a 100 billion of these things

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.190
making up your brain.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.870
Put it this way, there are
over 13 times more neurons

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.570
in your skull than there
are human beings on Earth.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.590
Lot of 'em.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.230
They're the cells that help you think.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.830
Mind you, a single neuron,
and let's call her Nellie,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.430
hi Nellie the neuron, Nellie on her own

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.620
can't do all the thinking your brain needs

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.060
to even pick up a glass of water.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.790
Fortunately she's got friends.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.880
There's dendrite Dave,
there's Alonzo the axon,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.910
there's Magna myelin, and
look little Sally synapse.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.870
So teensy tiny.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.730
Your brain behaves like a muscle.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.720
If you're serious about
lifting weights, right,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.350
and you keep it up on a regular basis

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.410
for a long period of time,
weeks, months, years,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.657
you're gonna develop muscles.

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:51.820
But you don't grow
muscles by doing nothing.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.330
It takes effort, it takes struggle,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.563
repeated failures in fact.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.020
You mess up and then you learn,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.880
and then eventually you
manage to jump the log

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.170
or whatever problem
you're trying to solve.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.190
Wait, we've lost focus
here, back to neurons.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.680
When you struggle your
neurons are struggling too,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.430
and that's important because
when neurons struggle,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.170
they lean on each other.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.950
They make connections, they start to form

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.130
this densely connected
network inside your brain

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.790
allowing little jolts of
electricity to pass down them

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.520
more and more efficiently.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.020
That's thinking faster, that's
your brain getting smarter.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.780
That's your brain muscle
gettin' swole kid.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.910
So the next time you say to yourself

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.750
I can't do this, I'm just too dense,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.680
remember that brain
density is your friend.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.560
If fact the denser you
are the more connections

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.080
between Nellie and her
neuron pals that you got

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.780
inside your brain, the
stronger and more powerful

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.110
your thinking parts become.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.040
The more you work
through your frustrations

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.750
with the right learning
strategies, the more your neurons

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.620
get more used to working together,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.260
the closer you are to
being that much smarter.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.610
Now get out there and do your best.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.610
Don't give up, grow those
brains, and remember,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.053
you can learn anything.
