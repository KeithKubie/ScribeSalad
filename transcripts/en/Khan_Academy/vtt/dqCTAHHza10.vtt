00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.815
- [Voiceover] "f is a finite function
whose domain is the letters a to e.

00:00:05.815 --> 00:00:10.298
The following table lists the output
for each input in f's domain."

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:12.077
So if x is equal to a

00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:14.689
then, so if we input a into our function

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.402
then we output -6.

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:17.919
f of a is -6.

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.445
We input b we get three,
we input c we get -6,

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:24.542
we input d we get two,
we input e we get -6.

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:28.832
"Build the mapping diagram for f
by dragging the endpoints of the segments

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:31.858
in the graph below so that they pair
each domain element

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:36.078
with its correct range element.
Then, determine if f is invertible."

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.716
Alright, so let's see
what's going on over here.

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:40.548
Let me scroll down a little bit more.

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:44.501
So in this purple oval, this
is representing the domain

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:46.570
of our function f and this is the range.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.962
So the function is going to,

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:49.798
if you give it a member of the domain

00:00:49.798 --> 00:00:51.879
it's going to map from
that member of domain

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.291
to a member of the range.

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:56.681
So, for example, you
input a into the function

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.283
it goes to -6.

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:01.718
So a goes to -6, so I drag
that right over there.

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:07.247
b goes to three,

00:01:07.247 --> 00:01:09.645
c goes to -6, so it's already interesting

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:12.896
that we have multiple
values that point to -6.

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:15.464
So this is okay for f to be a function

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:17.805
but we'll see it might
make it a little bit tricky

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:19.427
for f to be invertible.

00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:23.660
So let's see, d is points
to two, or maps to two.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.949
So you input d into our
function you're going to output two

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:31.048
and then finally e maps to -6 as well.

00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:33.536
e maps to -6 as well.

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:36.866
So, that's a visualization
of how this function f maps

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.208
from a through e to members of the range

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:43.327
but also ask ourselves 'is
this function invertible?'

00:01:43.327 --> 00:01:45.274
And I already hinted at it a little bit.

00:01:45.274 --> 00:01:48.985
Well in order fo it to
be invertible you need a,

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:51.946
you need a function that could take

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:54.188
go from each of these points to,

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:56.581
they can do the inverse mapping.

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:58.567
But it has to be a function.

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:01.786
So, if you input three
into this inverse function

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:03.074
it should give you b.

00:02:03.074 --> 00:02:05.472
If you input two into
this inverse function

00:02:05.472 --> 00:02:07.814
it should output d.

00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:12.232
If you input -6 into
this inverse function,

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.909
well this hypothetical inverse function.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.488
what should it do?

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.992
Well you can't have a function
that if you input one,

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:22.623
if you input a number it could
have three possible values,

00:02:22.623 --> 00:02:26.575
a, c, or e, you can only map to one value.

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:28.540
So there isn't, you actually can't set up

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.173
an inverse function that does this

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:31.825
because it wouldn't be a function.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:34.297
You can't go from input -6
into that inverse function

00:02:34.297 --> 00:02:36.050
and get three different values.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.845
So this is not invertible.

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:41.188
Let's do another example.

00:02:41.188 --> 00:02:43.990
So here, so this is the same drill.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.717
We have our members of our
domain, members of our range.

00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:48.664
We can build our mapping diagram.

00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:51.390
a maps to -36,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.946
b maps to nine.

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:57.735
c maps to -4,

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:00.498
d maps to 49,

00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:04.990
and then finally e maps to 25.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.321
e maps to 25.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.245
Now is this function invertible?

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.510
Well let's think about it.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.725
The inverse, woops, the,
was it d maps to 49

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.589
So, let's think about what the inverse,

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.017
this hypothetical inverse
function would have to do.

00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:22.637
It would have to take each
of these members of the range

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:23.931
and do the inverse mapping.

00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:27.419
So if you input 49 into
our inverse function

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.495
it should give you d.

00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.356
Input 25 it should give you e.

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:32.393
Input nine it gives you b.

00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:34.618
You input -4 it inputs c.

00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:37.353
You input -36 it gives you a.

00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:40.794
So you could easily construct
an inverse function here.

00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:45.216
So this is very much, this
is very much invertible.

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:47.780
One way to think about it is these are a,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.404
this is a one to one mapping.

00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:53.679
Each of the members of the domain

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.989
correspond to a unique
member of the range.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.952
You don't have two members of the domain

00:03:57.952 --> 00:04:00.953
pointing to the same member of the range.

00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:03.142
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.
