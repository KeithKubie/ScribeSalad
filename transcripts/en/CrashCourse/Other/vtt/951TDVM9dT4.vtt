Hello, I'm Hank Green and this is Crash Course
Office Hours where I take some of the questions

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.679
and concerns that you had with the last episode
of Crash Course Biology and answer them or

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.679
address them.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.010
We have an excellent question from MsLebbel:
"What is meant by polar?"

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.880
Now, when we were talking about this in the
last episode, we're talking about chemical

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.460
polarity which is when a molecule has a part
of the molecule that's positively charged

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.840
and part of it that's negatively charged.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.120
Basically the molecule has become, itself,
a magnet.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.500
This happens in a variety of molecules.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.780
The reasons why it happens is very complicated,
but basically the electrons around the atoms

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.809
end up spending more time on one side of the
molecule than on the other side and so you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.440
have a negative side and a positive side.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.519
And that is what I meant by polarity.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.961
MartinSabatonFan wants to know if there are
any other elements besides water and carbon

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:55.410
that life could be based on, and Martin, well,
we all would like to know that very much.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.570
And my impulse is that, "No!

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.969
It could not possibly be possible.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.570
Everything we know is based on water and carbon."

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.110
But, ya know, things that I can't imagine
happen all the time in the universe, and so

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.409
maybe it is possible, but I don't think we're
gonna know until they come knocking on our

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.409
door.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.219
jamesahibbard asks, "Excuse me Mister Green,
but isn't steam, like a cloud, not a gas,

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.450
but a fine liquid?"

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.549
Uh, no, not really.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.509
What we generally call steam in our everyday
life, the stuff that comes out of a kettle

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.930
or the the mist in our shower, isn't actually,
technically, steam.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.740
That, as you say, is little tiny droplets
of water floating around in the air.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.579
When scientists are talking about steam, what
they mean is gaseous water, literally water

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.829
that has been converted into a gas.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.619
If you walked into a room filled with steam
instead of being like, "Ah, this is relaxing,"

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219
you would, your face would melt off, you would
die very quickly.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.100
It would be a very horrible horrible way to
die.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.850
Steam, by definition, is hotter than boiling
water and it is a clear gas and it is one

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.640
hundred percent water.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.780
Phylo45 and several other people pointed out
that, in fact, if ice were denser than water,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.600
icebergs sinking to the bottom of the ocean
would not, in fact, raise the sea level.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.569
And this is true and I apologize for misinforming
all of you.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.150
Basically, an ice cube already displaces its
entire mass if it's floating in water.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.420
But if the density was higher, higher than
water, and it was underwater it would actually

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.930
be smaller, taking up less space than an ice
cube floating on the surface of the ocean.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.650
And its a little bit complicated.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.099
But that person and the other ones who corrected
me on that, thank you.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.860
And finally marc46o compliments me on my skill
as a teacher, but wonders if I'm doing this

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.489
by myself and I am certainly not.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.760
Thank you to the people who are helping me
work on this.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.879
We have Jenkins back there, behind the camera.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.879
Come on out.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.920
[from back] No.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.870
[Hank] Nick is also editing these, thank you
Nick.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.569
And then we have Blake and Jesslyn helping
me write them, and Amber and Pete are the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.970
amazing people helping to do the graphics
on these.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.769
So, thank you to all of them and I will see
you very soon in the next episode of Crash

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.219
Course.
