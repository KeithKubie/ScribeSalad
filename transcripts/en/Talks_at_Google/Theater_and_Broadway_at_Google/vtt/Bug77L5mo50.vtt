ALAN: I'm Alan with the
Talks at Google team.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.599
Thanks for coming out and
sharing your Thursday--

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.640
I forget what day it is--

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.620
Thursday afternoon with us.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.830
We got a great little Q&amp;A
performance here for you.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.870
Inspired by the beloved
film, "Anastasia"

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.690
transports us from the
twilight of the Russian Empire

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.150
to the euphoria of
Paris in the 1920s,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.400
as a brave young woman
sets out to discover

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.580
that mystery of her past pursued
by a ruthless Soviet officer

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.140
determined to silence her.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.530
Anya enlists the aid of a
dashing, common, and lovable ex

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.520
aristocrat.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.590
Together they embark
on an epic journey

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.827
to help find her home,
love, and family.

00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:41.910
We're going to kick this
off with a little sizzle.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.160
And then go straight into a
little bit of performance.

JOHN BOLTON: It's

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.760

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.296
Let's go down the line here
and introduce yourselves

00:06:06.296 --> 00:06:07.580
and who you are in the show.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.455
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: My
name is Christy Altomare

00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:11.292
and I play Anya in "Anastasia."

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:12.500
JOHN BOLTON: I'm John Bolton.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.036
I play Vlad.

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:15.410
ZACH ADKINS: And
I'm Zach Adkins.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.050
I'm the understudy for
Dmitry in the ensemble.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.950
ALAN: How much of the original
movies did the three of you

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.980
actually know about before
getting cast in this?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.093
Cause it was based
on two movies, right?

00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:27.009
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yes.

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.170
The 1956 with Ingrid
Bergman and Yul Brynner.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.514
And then, the cartoon
with Liz Callaway and--

00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:35.430
ZACH ADKINS: Meg Ryan.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.555
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Meg Ryan.

00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:37.980
JOHN BOLTON: John
Cusack, Kelsey Grammer.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.063
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Oh yeah.

00:06:39.063 --> 00:06:40.244
Bernadette Peters.

00:06:40.244 --> 00:06:40.910
ALAN: Oh really?

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.280
Yeah.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.880
ZACH ADKINS: That's right.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.280
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
She played Lily.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.330
JOHN BOLTON: I knew more
about the history, though.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.260
The like, the actual--

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.002
because my parents had the
book "Nicholas and Alexandra"

00:06:48.002 --> 00:06:48.710
when I was a kid.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.510
And it hit true
crime, sort of, hit

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.760
the demise of the Romanovs,
and of course, Russian history.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.640
And there were photographs,
and there's kids in this story.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.320
I'm like, oh,
there's kids in it.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.270
And I didn't know they
were all murdered.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.494
But there were--

00:07:03.494 --> 00:07:05.660
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: And
"Nicholas and Alexandra," that

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.560
was a movie as well, wasn't it?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.330
JOHN BOLTON: A movie of
the '70s, sure, yeah.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.350
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.000
So lot of-- I mean, American
culture, it's very interesting.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.280
We know a lot about
this Romanov story.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.815
It's kind of infamous, in a way.

00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:15.260
JOHN BOLTON: Timeless.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.910
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Timeless.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.870
JOHN BOLTON: And an
eternal mystery, truly.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.610
Even though many
of the questions

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.010
have been fairly recently
answered in terms of DNA,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.590
there's still a mystery to it.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.290
And our production
takes the sort

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:33.170
of myth of the whole idea of
the facts of what happens.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.800
Pursues the fairy tale aspect
of it, the myth aspect of it.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.100
ALAN: And so this production,
gosh, the first reading

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.210
I could find record
of was April 24--

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.750
oh sorry, in 2012.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.070
You guys opened April 24, 2017.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.224
So the original production
had Angela Lansbury in it.

00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:51.140
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yes.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.556
ALAN: Sorry, the
original reading.

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:55.492
And so how did--

00:07:55.492 --> 00:07:57.200
were any of you in it
from the beginning?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.640
Can you speak about
the history of how

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.510
it got to where it is now?

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.170
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: I
don't think any of us

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.120
were in it from the
very, very beginning.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.020
ALAN: But you were in
it from the workshops?

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.500
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Well--

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.850
JOHN BOLTON: We did out of town.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.933
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: We did
the Hartford out of town.

00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:08.750
But I remember, I mean,
we had-- this show

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.620
had been kicked around
for quite some time.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.592
I would say about
three years maybe.

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:15.050
And so there were
lots of readings.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.260
And I'd gone in a few times.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.110
And they'd always say, oh, she's
too young, she's too young.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.850
So my last audition, I was
like, wearing long skirt--

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.994
like, I tried to look as old
and mature as-- and they said,

00:08:27.994 --> 00:08:28.910
you're old enough now.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.880
So grateful.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.444
Grateful.

00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:34.460
ZACH ADKINS: I mean,
kind of speak to that.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.620
When you're developing
a musical, it takes--

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.010
I mean, I don't think I
know of a musical that

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.500
didn't take at least eight
years to be brought to Broadway.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:40.909
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.049
ZACH ADKINS: So when
you're doing these readings

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.170
and workshops, a lot of the
projects you work on early on

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.370
will take many, many years and
many, many different creative

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.301
team changes even before you'll
see the final product of what

00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:52.800
you get.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.883
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: You can
even age out of the part

00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:57.310
that you played in a reading
in the very beginning stages.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.310
Yeah, that happens.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.910
ALAN: Or age into it.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.010
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Or age
into it like in my case.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.660
ZACH ADKINS: Even more so,
there was a conversation had

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.940
in rehearsals where
Stephen even mentioned

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.200
that he was trying to reconnect
with that '90s Stephen Flaherty

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.000
to figure out what
the sound was.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.400
When he was writing the movie
back in the '90s, or '80s even,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.270
what that sound was.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.980
Because he's progressed
so much as a composer.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.230
JOHN BOLTON: It's
20 years later.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.813
ZACH ADKINS: He was
like, oh how did I

00:09:21.813 --> 00:09:23.492
write when I was 30-something?

00:09:23.492 --> 00:09:25.700
And it was a really interesting
conversation to have.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.520
JOHN BOLTON: Because
you may know,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.010
they wrote a bunch of new
songs for the stage version.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.630
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: So many more.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.296
JOHN BOLTON: Five or
six from the film--

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:33.470
ALAN: Yeah and it was 24
new ones or something?

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.553
JOHN BOLTON: It's a bunch.

00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:36.530
There's a lot-- things
like reprises and stuff.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.250
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: So
you think, oh, it's

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.990
just going to be an
exact replication.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.350
There's so much that's
changed and there's so much--

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.320
I mean, if you
love our composers,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.914
the new music is unbelievable.

00:09:46.914 --> 00:09:48.080
JOHN BOLTON: It's beautiful.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.262
ALAN: Even the bad guy.

00:09:50.262 --> 00:09:52.220
The bad guy's totally
different from the movie.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.972
So there's no Rasputin, right?

00:09:53.972 --> 00:09:54.930
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.322
There's a handsome,
dark character.

00:09:57.322 --> 00:09:58.447
ALAN: Oh you like him, huh?

00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:00.488
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Well,
there's-- it leaves it up

00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:02.300
to interpretation, you know?

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.036
ALAN: I was going to
ask you later if--

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:06.410
do you want to
set up the context

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.754
for your possible
relationship with--

00:10:08.754 --> 00:10:09.920
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: With Gleb?

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.837
ALAN: With Gleb, yeah.

00:10:10.837 --> 00:10:12.545
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Well, so, what I really

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.210
love about this
musical is that it does

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.310
tie in real Russian history.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.030
And, as we all know,
during that time period,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.760
the fall of the
Bolshevik Revolution,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.210
which is where they went from
a monarchy to king and queen

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.620
to communism.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.370
And you have this
guy that's kind

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.589
of working his way up the ranks,
this evil character, Gleb.

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:35.630
And he's not really evil.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.400
He's just a misunderstood guy.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.800
His family-- well
I mean, his family.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.170
His dad, you find-- you
come to find out his dad

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.440
was a part of the firing
squad for the Romanov family.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.750
So he has a lot of guilt
inside of him dealing

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.040
with you know, and then,
dealing with his family

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.180
and what is honor and
what is the right thing

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.430
to do versus the wrong thing
to do when you're ordered

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.260
to kill a bunch of kids?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.010
So so over time,
he runs into Anya.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.310
And then, he kind of
has a crush on her.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.682
And also, it's kind of like--

00:11:05.682 --> 00:11:08.140
I think-- I feel like it's a
little bit like the hunchback,

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.030
where, if you know anything
about the hunchback,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.440
how it's kind of
like, he loves--

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.687
the bad guy loves Esmerelda
but also hates her.

00:11:13.687 --> 00:11:14.770
So it's kind of like this.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.359
He loves her, but he also wants
to kill her at the same time.

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:18.400
ALAN: And the Bolsheviks.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:18.850
Yeah.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.140
Yeah.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.390
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.700
It's like he-- Gleb is in
love with her, but also.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.080
Yeah.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.620
ALAN: So why-- but
why do you think

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.299
the choice was made
to actually switch

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:27.340
the character completely?

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.250
Just a magical sorcerer
was not going play?

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.942
JOHN BOLTON: Well, Rasputin
was not a magical sorcerer,

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:33.900
for those of you that--

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.810
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: The
real Rasputin existed.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.730
JOHN BOLTON: --that
only know the cartoon.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.245
He wasn't a jolly ne'er do well.

00:11:39.245 --> 00:11:40.870
He was a pretty
despicable human being.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.170
And he was long dead,
actually dead, had

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.860
been taken out by some of the--

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.680
not the Tsar, but those
directly underneath the Tsar.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.660
Because Rasputin was getting--

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.190
was way too close
to the royal family.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.350
He had the empress, Tsarina
Alexandra, under his thumb,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.970
in terms of, only I
can take care of you

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.567
your young, sick boy.

00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:06.150
Because there were
the four daughters.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.460
And the youngest boy
was a hemophiliac.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.930
And so Alexandra wanted to
do everything she could.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.870
And a friend of hers said,
get this mystic guy in.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.151
And all of a sudden, he was
hanging out in the grand

00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:20.650
duchess's--

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.910
the daughters'
bedrooms late at night.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.999
And a lot of the court
said, get him out.

00:12:25.999 --> 00:12:27.040
And so they murdered him.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.110
They had him brutally killed.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.659
And so he's-- if you
know the history,

00:12:31.659 --> 00:12:33.700
he's long dead when the
events of the show start.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.770
So I think that was the initial
way to create a more real--

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.440
ALAN: I didn't know
that historically,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.490
that it was different like that.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.390
That makes a lot of
sense to change it up.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:43.690
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
And it makes sense,

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.106
because the whole
thing is it took

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:46.254
a long time for him to die.

00:12:46.254 --> 00:12:47.920
Like, cause they think
he's this mystic.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.907
So they kept trying to
kill him in real life,

00:12:49.907 --> 00:12:50.740
and he couldn't die.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.960
So I think they used
that for the cartoon.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.032
It's like kind of a joke that
he's not really dead yet.

00:12:56.032 --> 00:12:57.582
Cause in real life-- anyway.

00:12:57.582 --> 00:13:00.040
ZACH ADKINS: I mean, if you
are a fan of the movie, though,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.691
the theme--

00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:02.440
Rasputin sings "In the
Dark of the Night."

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.060
I mean, it comes
up multiple times.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.160
Actually, it's the theme
of a song called "Stay,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.285
I Pray You" in our show,
which is a beautiful group

00:13:08.285 --> 00:13:11.452
number talking about leaving
your country for the last time.

00:13:11.452 --> 00:13:12.910
And so if you do
come see the show,

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.580
and you love Rasputin and
those numbers, they're there.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.740
You have to really,
really key in on that.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.110
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Same
thing with "At The Beginning

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.740
With You."

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.900
Some little underscoring.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.780
ALAN: So the characters
are obviously well

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.570
known, both, I
guess, historically,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.600
and from the movies now.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.150
Do you find that
people are always

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.010
trying to compare
you, like your roles

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.447
now to what was in the
movies, the characters?

00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:34.780
JOHN BOLTON: Well I think they--

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.190
they tend to say that we got it.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.292
But, you know, I like to
think that we acknowledged

00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:43.375
the character in the film.

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.310
They're animated
characters in the film.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.770
But certainly, the vocal,
the voice performance

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.860
is what we can take.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.670
Certainly what I took cues from.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.610
Kelsey Grammer's--

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.930
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: We honor it.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.680
JOHN BOLTON: You honor it.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.220
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: You honor it.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:54.719
You don't--

00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:57.490
JOHN BOLTON: But to do a slavish
imitation doesn't serve anyone,

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:57.989
really.

00:13:57.989 --> 00:13:59.330
And so I honor it.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.070
And, and--

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.030
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: I honor it.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.170
JOHN BOLTON: Add my
own stuff into it.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.370
ZACH ADKINS: I think once
you're seeing the show, you

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.860
kind of forget it was a movie.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.520
When you're sitting
in the theater,

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.470
you know, you come in
with this expectation.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.170
But once it starts,
we kind of pull you

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.100
in a lot of directions
right at the beginning.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.232
And we send you a million
different directions,

00:14:15.232 --> 00:14:16.440
a million different thoughts.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.267
And you don't really
think about, oh wait.

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:19.600
Well what happened in the movie?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.380
You know?

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.430
JOHN BOLTON: It's very much its
own theatrical event as opposed

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.152
to any sort of slavish
recreation of--

00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:27.610
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Exact recreation.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.720
JOHN BOLTON: --of
either of the films.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.420
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: It's not.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.070
ALAN: Well yeah.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.986
I want to talk about the
set too for a second.

00:14:31.986 --> 00:14:33.699
Because the set itself is--

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:35.490
gosh, I don't even know
how to describe it.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:39.934
There's like this
massive arc made of--

00:14:39.934 --> 00:14:42.100
you know, it's supposed to
be this marble thing or--

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.740
it's a castle, it's the
city, it's the walkway,

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.930
it's all this multi-purpose
set that doesn't move,

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.040
but yet rotates and changes.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.319
What was-- like, you guys,
when you first saw it,

00:14:53.319 --> 00:14:54.360
what did you think of it?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.210
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
That first day.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:55.770
JOHN BOLTON:
Absolutely thrilling.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.780
It's basically
508 or something--

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.220
506, 508 TV monitors.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.860
The entire back wall.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.230
And each monitor is responsible
for its own tiny little piece

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.920
of the--

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.420
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
The whole picture.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.200
JOHN BOLTON: --visual puzzle.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.460
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Like a puzzle, yeah.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.920
JOHN BOLTON: And they're able to
do some really amazing things.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.910
I believe we're
the only Broadway

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.230
show that uses that technology.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.820
I know it's been used at
Radio City Music Hall.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.760
But I believe we're
the first to use it.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.120
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: And do
you remember that first day

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.679
that he came in and showed us
what we were going to-- what

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:22.720
the show was going to be?

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.440
JOHN BOLTON: He would show
it to us on an iPhone.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.840
And then say,
here's what's going

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.270
to be happening behind you.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.020
You know, time it out.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.984
Go!

00:15:29.984 --> 00:15:31.900
But yes, there were days
where they brought us

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.358
all into the audience
and said, you

00:15:33.358 --> 00:15:35.115
need to sit and watch
what's going on.

00:15:35.115 --> 00:15:36.740
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: So
you know how cool.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.230
JOHN BOLTON: And
it's really amazing.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.610
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
It's pretty cool.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.130
JOHN BOLTON: It's
really spectacular.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:39.640
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.360
JOHN BOLTON: We do a
really cool view of Paris.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.526
They actually sent our
videographer, video designer,

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:47.520
Erin Ryan, went to Paris and
filmed a lot of the locations.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.810
Because Act 2 takes
place all in Paris.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.290
And they put together this
amazing video sequence

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.180
of a whirlwind
tour through Paris,

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.381
including an elevator ride to
the top of the Eiffel Tower.

00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:00.880
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: And you feel
like you're going to the top.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.780
JOHN BOLTON: You're
feel like you're going.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.670
And the train-- there's
a train ride we take,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.770
which was the trio we--

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:05.560
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: You feel
like you're on the train.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.460
JOHN BOLTON: It's
on the train, and--

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.470
ALAN: The train itself is
moving and spinning, yeah.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.100
JOHN BOLTON: Spinning around.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.540
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: And
you're moving with it, yeah.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.581
ALAN: That was probably
one of my favorite scene,

00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:14.440
like that and the
ballet too, the--

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.570
watching the train and
everything moving around it.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.340
Because like, you
get the perspective,

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.010
and the video changes with
the perspective as the train

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.080
is-- it's phenomenal.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.100
Go see it.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.391
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: It's so cool.

00:16:24.391 --> 00:16:25.290
It's so cool.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.120
ALAN: Yeah, so the costumes too.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.370
Let's talk about the costumes.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.496
ZACH ADKINS: Oh yeah.

00:16:28.496 --> 00:16:29.260
JOHN BOLTON: Oh my gosh.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.520
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Linda Cho.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.400
ALAN: Beautiful.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.860
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: So beautiful.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.840
ALAN: Like, period, accurate.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.730
Amazing.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.020
Do you trip on them?

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.770
JOHN BOLTON: Yeah.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.550
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: No.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.195
JOHN BOLTON: You don't?

00:16:38.195 --> 00:16:38.610
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: You do?

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.220
Oh I've tripped.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:39.520
JOHN BOLTON: I've trip on yours.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.654
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: I
tripped the other day.

00:16:40.654 --> 00:16:41.730
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.230
Yes.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.450
It happens.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.140
But--

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.920
JOHN BOLTON: But not enough.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.253
I mean, they're well-maintained.

00:16:46.253 --> 00:16:49.090
We have an amazing team
of wardrobe staff dressers

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.140
backstage.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.400
And each piece is handmade.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.650
They didn't just go somewhere
to go to Barney's Rack

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.000
and buy it or something.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.382
I mean, each one is designed--

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:57.840
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
The rhinestones--

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.180
JOHN BOLTON: Hundreds.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.388
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Themselves.

00:16:59.388 --> 00:17:01.990
Like, I remember, the
assistant was saying,

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.580
we've been up for
three days sewing

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.300
in rhinestones on your dress.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.009
And it really is.

00:17:06.009 --> 00:17:08.424
When you look at it, there's
just rhinestones every-- it's

00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:09.190
beautiful.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.430
JOHN BOLTON: And the tsarina,
Alexandra, her first dress,

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.440
when she first
comes out, seconds

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.430
after the curtain goes up,
the audience literally gasps.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.250
And often applauds.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.369
ZACH ADKINS: I
think she mentioned

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.035
the crown she actually
wears in the show

00:17:21.035 --> 00:17:23.359
is about 12 to 14 pounds.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.384
So she has a lot going
on on top of her head.

00:17:25.384 --> 00:17:27.050
JOHN BOLTON: And the
dress is 50 pounds.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:27.800
ZACH ADKINS: Yeah.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.359
She's--

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.150
ALAN: Is it really?

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.680
JOHN BOLTON: Yeah.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.310
ALAN: Wow.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.230
ZACH ADKINS: I mean, not to
take away, because me and John--

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.860
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
My dress is heavier.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.480
ZACH ADKINS: We
start the show and--

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.730
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Well, it is!

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.600
My red dress--my red
dress is actually--

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:37.840
JOHN BOLTON: That's true.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.950
And you don't have straps.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.491
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
No, it's strapless.

00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:43.280
JOHN BOLTON: We start the show
in about 80 pounds of fur.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.340
ZACH ADKINS: That we
make Russia look so cold.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.250
And I assure you, when you
get under those lights,

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.799
I've never sweated
more in my life.

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:53.090
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: My favorite
is Derek, who's not here.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.756
Like, he'll be halfway
through the show,

00:17:54.756 --> 00:17:57.457
and if I just go like this, it's
like mat-- it's like so sweaty,

00:17:57.457 --> 00:17:59.665
you know, when you're at
the point where just the top

00:17:59.665 --> 00:18:01.730
of your hand is sweating.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:02.230
Yeah.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.146
JOHN BOLTON: But no, the
clothes are stunning.

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:06.100
And she, Linda Cho,
our amazing designer,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.500
has been rightfully lauded
for not just her detail

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.120
to historical accuracy,
but for the whimsy

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.950
and the true artistry of making
it her own and theatrical.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.400
It's stunning, stunning clothes.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.240
We're lucky to wear them.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.320
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
We're so lucky.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.360
ZACH ADKINS: I mean,
the attention to detail.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.920
I do an ensemble
track in the show.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.200
And I change my
socks four times.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.989
Just my socks.

00:18:29.989 --> 00:18:31.780
To different colors
and different patterns.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.640
That's how-- and
everyone across the board

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.660
does that, which is just fun.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.434
It's the little
details like that.

00:18:37.434 --> 00:18:39.850
ALAN: I was going to ask you
about the ensemble bit of it.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.266
Because you go on every night
regardless of whether or not

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:43.930
you're in as one
of the leads here.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.970
So you play four different
characters total?

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.680
Or it it just four
different socks you share--

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.560
ZACH ADKINS: Four socks.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.610
ALAN: Four characters
who share socks.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.401
ZACH ADKINS: I have
filled out the ensemble

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:53.290
in many different
aspects where we

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.950
have a great group of people.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.700
And I might play, I think,
seven different characters

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.000
in the ensemble
throughout the show.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.590
They're all like
little bit parts.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.930
On the train, I
have a small scene.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.530
I'm a smoker.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.310
I'm a mean guy.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.780
So it's fun.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.410
It's fun.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.930
Because we are
around 230 shows, I

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.990
think, since we
officially opened.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.244
And sometimes, you get
into the groove, and then

00:19:16.244 --> 00:19:18.160
all of a sudden, I get
to do a different part.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.027
And it's really fun.

00:19:19.027 --> 00:19:20.110
And it's a nice change up.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.370
Nice change of pace.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.572
So I enjoy the gig.

00:19:23.572 --> 00:19:25.155
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
He's a great Dmitry.

00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:27.259
ALAN: How much notice
do you get normally?

00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:29.800
ZACH ADKINS: Typically, if I'm
lucky, someone has a vacation,

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.341
and then I'll know
months in advance.

00:19:31.341 --> 00:19:34.510
But it can be three
hours before the show,

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.860
30 minutes before the show.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.760
Or in a lot of cases--

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.330
not a lot of cases.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.080
But it's happened.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.610
Intermission will
be the latest you'll

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.770
go on, where that
first act happens,

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.330
and the actor's like, nope.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.917
And so, they'll let you know.

00:19:47.917 --> 00:19:50.500
And they'll be like, hey, you're
going to grab the second act.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.290
And be like, OK.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:51.790
So.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.540
ALAN: If you're going in the
second act, who's mean guy?

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.570
ZACH ADKINS: Mean guy,
well we all are like,

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.770
three people deep.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.060
So everybody has someone
behind them to step up.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.616
We are dripping with talent.

00:20:03.616 --> 00:20:06.250
ALAN: Dripping with talent.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.175
And fur sweat.

00:20:07.175 --> 00:20:08.414
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:08.414 --> 00:20:09.580
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Fur sweat.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.449
ALAN: The response
from the audience.

00:20:11.449 --> 00:20:13.240
I want you to talk
about that a little bit.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.280
Is it different
that you find from,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.110
like, maybe children
and young adults, who

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.780
are less familiar with
the movies versus people

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.572
that are a little bit
older who do know it?

00:20:21.572 --> 00:20:23.571
JOHN BOLTON: Well they
certainly always love it.

00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:24.610
They always go nuts.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.151
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Yeah, they go nuts.

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:28.340
JOHN BOLTON: It's an
instantaneous pat on the back.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.680
And of course, for any actor,
and incredibly satisfying.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.750
But sure, the young people
certainly like the kissing.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.360
Almost as some act of
horror for some of them.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.522
But they love it, and
scream and hoot and holler.

00:20:42.522 --> 00:20:44.980
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: It's crazy
how this show has a little bit

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.150
of something for everyone.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.917
It depends on-- you know, my
generation knows the cartoon.

00:20:48.917 --> 00:20:51.250
But then there's the generations
who don't and they just

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.570
love the story.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.270
And then there's people who
really love the history.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.560
So you get a little
bit of everything.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.060
Yeah.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.050
JOHN BOLTON: But we
don't get kid kids.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.470
We don't get like,
the itty bitties.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.511
It's not really for them.

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.310
It's like teenagers and up.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.572
You know, tweens and up.

00:21:04.572 --> 00:21:05.530
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.071
JOHN BOLTON: And
it's, I would think,

00:21:07.071 --> 00:21:11.400
mostly young women who grew up
with the film, loving the film.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.900
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: They say you
brought my childhood to life.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.120
Because they will
have stories of,

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.940
I sat every night after--
or after school every day,

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.640
I'd sit with my mother
and watch this movie.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.150
So you see people have a really
deep connection to this one.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.150
JOHN BOLTON: Absolutely.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.590
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.510
ALAN: That's interesting
you said that you don't

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.600
have like tiny, tiny ones.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.490
I would expect that--

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.350
JOHN BOLTON: No.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.230
ZACH ADKINS: It's not
really right for--

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.380
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Yes, there are some.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.210
ZACH ADKINS: I mean, but it--

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:33.880
JOHN BOLTON: Not like--

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.671
ZACH ADKINS: Comparatively,
to other shows,

00:21:35.671 --> 00:21:37.660
we would consider
family shows, I

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.270
would say that we have
an older demographic.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.610
ALAN: Is there any bit of
audience feedback that's like,

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.480
stuck out in your mind over
the 200-something shows?

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.590
JOHN BOLTON: Thank you.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.780
Thank you for making
this a stage show.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.050
I've been waiting for
this for 20 years,

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.429
is the time we hear the
most, and the thing that

00:21:54.429 --> 00:21:55.720
is the most satisfying to hear.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.300
And thank you for doing
it right is what is what--

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.380
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yes.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.840
And for me, once in
a while, somebody

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.350
from Russia who is much older
will come up and take my hand

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.057
and say--

00:22:06.057 --> 00:22:07.265
ALAN: You have so much sweat.

00:22:07.265 --> 00:22:08.640
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
It's so sweaty.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.145
Thank you.

00:22:11.145 --> 00:22:12.820
They'll say thank you so much.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.150
You brought my husband
back to Russia.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.380
And they'll have
tears in their eyes.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.161
So there's that too.

00:22:19.161 --> 00:22:20.410
ALAN: And they send you candy.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.670
We were talking
about it earlier.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.240
ZACH ADKINS: Oh yeah.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.690
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yes.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.640
The candy is the
best part of the job.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.820
ALAN: So you have a
little bit of sweet tooth.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.508
We were talking
about this at lunch.

00:22:27.508 --> 00:22:29.260
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yes.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.580
I love candy.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.424
And especially now,
I'm discovering candy

00:22:32.424 --> 00:22:33.340
from around the world.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.850
Because people from all over the
world come to see "Anastasia."

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.100
And they'll bring their candy.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.900
And so, I've been
getting a lot of candy,

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.660
specifically from Russia because
the show takes place in Russia.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.230
The first act.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.450
And it's a Russian story.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.400
So I have got a lot
of Russian candy.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.400
JOHN BOLTON: Keep sending
it, because it's good.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.934
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
It's really good.

00:22:52.934 --> 00:22:54.600
Yeah, if you haven't
had Russian candy--

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.970
JOHN BOLTON: It's very good.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.010
ALAN: Or stand outside
the stage door.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.390
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Or just
stand outside the stage door.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.860
ALAN: Zach, this is
your Broadway debut.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.320
ZACH ADKINS: Yup.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.236
ALAN: Congratulations.

00:23:02.236 --> 00:23:03.580
ZACH ADKINS: My first show.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.320
ALAN: Yes, yes.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.500
What was it like for you
to step out on stage like--

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.290
you only have one first, right?

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.769
Like, what was your
first time going on?

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:17.310
ZACH ADKINS: I think the better
story is the first time going

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.620
on for Dmitry.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.820
Where I had toured for a year
with another national tour

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.030
from a different show.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.280
And I was also an
understudy in that.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.560
So when you start to understudy,
when you get that call,

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.540
you know, you do a
lot of preparation.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.442
We're in rehearsal every
week, the understudies.

00:23:36.442 --> 00:23:37.650
And we're working towards it.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:39.608
And it's a lot like being
shot out of a cannon.

00:23:39.608 --> 00:23:41.010
There's a lot of adrenaline.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.290
And you have to be really
aware of how you're

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:47.820
monitoring your adrenaline
and how intense you come off

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.780
right away.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.700
You'll settle into it.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.410
But, and so, it's
all about keeping

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.350
a lid on it, and because
Broadway is all about ease.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.070
And so I'm a younger guy, so I
can get really excited really

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.880
easily.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.620
So it's really important
that right before the show,

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.744
I have this guy next to me.

00:24:02.744 --> 00:24:04.690
And we just kind of calm down.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.960
And then, we're like,
what's the story?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.860
What's important?

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.970
What's our relationship?

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.320
What's our relationship?

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.735
And it's about focusing on that.

00:24:11.735 --> 00:24:13.110
And I think it's
really important

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:16.110
because these relationships
are why people love the show.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.395
So you know, if there's
any kind of disconnect,

00:24:19.395 --> 00:24:23.210
if I'm thinking about how
I'm looking or how I sound,

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.110
they won't believe it, you know?

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.454
It has to be about genuine
connections on stage.

00:24:28.454 --> 00:24:30.120
So with these guys
who do it every night

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.280
with Derek, who's amazing.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.320
I have to find my own
connections with them.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.240
And it's not about
doing what Derek does.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.160
Because Derek is
true to himself.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.200
So I have to go out there
and do what Zach is.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.920
So my Dmitry's a little more
softer, a little more goofy.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.450
And it's about being
believable as an understudy.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.590
And it's fun.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.380
Because I get to work with so
many different incarnations

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.820
of the show already.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.500
Yeah.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.810
ALAN: That's phenomenal.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:00.884
And, I guess, if you go on--

00:25:00.884 --> 00:25:02.550
I guess, do you go
on frequently or not?

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.300
Or is it--

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.330
ZACH ADKINS: Just in
the last few months,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.140
I've really been frequent.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.050
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
You've been on a lot.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.770
ALAN: And then, have you
ever forgotten anything?

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.050
ZACH ADKINS: Oh yeah.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:08.700
ALAN: I've always wondered if--

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.440
ZACH ADKINS: The song
we're about to do,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.467
I dropped a whole verse of
last two times I was-- not--

00:25:13.467 --> 00:25:14.050
two shows ago.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.550
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Not a whole verse.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.490
ALAN: A half of verse.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.380
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: You
would have never noticed.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.530
JOHN BOLTON: You did
it with conviction.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:19.920
ZACH ADKINS: There you go.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.810
JOHN BOLTON: You dropped
it with conviction

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:22.890
ZACH ADKINS: Because,
I mean, sometimes,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.010
as an understudy, so
this would be like,

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.440
I've done maybe 10
shows performance.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.430
But I've maybe done 10
rehearsals, runs, of the show.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.070
So this is 20 times doing it.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.440
And once you start getting
comfortable with material,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.920
as you probably know, once you
start to memorize something,

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.560
you have this second layer
happening underneath it.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.387
You're like, oh,
I'm saying this.

00:25:46.387 --> 00:25:48.970
But I'm thinking about 10 other
things that's about to happen.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.350
And that's what happened
during "Petersburg."

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.347
I was like, OK, the
turntable's about to turn.

00:25:52.347 --> 00:25:53.680
I have to jump up on this bench.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.940
And I go, oh.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.630
What's the line?

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:56.338
What am I saying?

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:57.010
This is my solo.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:57.926
Like, what am I doing?

00:25:57.926 --> 00:26:00.550
There's 1,100 people
out there, and I'm

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.858
looking at Christy like--

00:26:01.858 --> 00:26:04.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:05.872 --> 00:26:07.580
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: But
yeah, it was great.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.320
JOHN BOLTON: We had
a version of that

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.577
during previews, where
we were rehearsing

00:26:10.577 --> 00:26:12.160
one version of the
show during the day

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.950
and performing another
version of the show at night.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.960
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
That was for you.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.320
JOHN BOLTON: That was--

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.690
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: He
had a completely--

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:17.220
didn't you have
like a completely--

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:17.770
JOHN BOLTON: Oh
yeah, we completely

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.355
redid the whole Paris sequence.

00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:20.980
But all of us, in
terms of little lines

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.380
here, verse changes,
lyric changes there.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.840
You know, you're rehearsing
one thing during the day

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.370
and performing the other, for
a paying audience at night.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.134
So that's a little
terrifying sometimes.

00:26:31.134 --> 00:26:33.550
ALAN: And the other two, I
assume both of you are perfect?

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.120
Yes.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.810
ZACH ADKINS: Always.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:35.685
ALAN: Always, always.

00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:36.310
Yes.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.184
JOHN BOLTON: Usually.

00:26:37.184 --> 00:26:39.125
No.

00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:41.500
ALAN: Christy, you had a lot
of theater credits yourself.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.666
And you know, you're on
tour as you're off Broadway.

00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:46.460
And of course, "Mamma
Mia" on Broadway.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.480
So has your career changed--
how has your career changed,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.530
I guess, since becoming Anya?

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.280
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: This
is a huge step for me.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.180
I mean, I've been--

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.570
I've been so lucky
enough throughout my life

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.000
to get to play so many
amazing leading roles.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.320
But it's every actor's dream,
I don't care who they are,

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.410
to get to originate.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.930
Because, it's like
you're the first person

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.800
to put your stamp
on a character.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.250
And this is my dream.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:16.300
And to have it be this
show, and these songs that I

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.870
love so much, and this role.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.070
It's just like everything
snapped into place.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.150
And there's just no words.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.350
I'm just so grateful.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.100
And in a way, as you know,
career wise, you know,

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.070
I didn't expect
it to be as crazy.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.990
Because I've always played--

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.580
I've played leads
before, you know?

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.760
So but it's completely
different from doing originate--

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.570
originating a role is completely
different from replacing,

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.590
in that there's so many
press events, like this.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.620
And there are so many--

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.590
you're put out in the
public eye more often.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.240
You're at photo
shoots sometimes.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.920
Or you're, you know, little--

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.420
yeah.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.710
Yeah.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:52.720
There's photo shoots.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.700
And there's all of these things,
all these events and things.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.040
And it's crazy.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.831
There's definitely a lot more
buzz and excitement around it.

00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:00.330
Yeah.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:00.830
ALAN: Yeah.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:01.790
That's incredible.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.290
And then, to stay
grounded, I guess,

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.499
I was reading something that
you learned the ukulele?

00:28:05.499 --> 00:28:06.581
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Oh yeah.

00:28:06.581 --> 00:28:07.480
I play the ukulele.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.380
I play the guitar.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.629
I write songs.

00:28:09.629 --> 00:28:10.170
ALAN: Do you?

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:11.128
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:28:11.128 --> 00:28:12.880
Yeah.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.959
ALAN: Do you keep
yourself, I guess, focused?

00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:18.250
I would think that with all
the whirlwind of everything

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.374
going around you that you
would need like something

00:28:20.374 --> 00:28:21.340
to center yourself.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.420
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.040
It's definitely
been a challenge.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.860
And I think the best--

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.300
the best thing--
the best advice I

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.460
could give for anyone
ever in this situation

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.540
is to look at people before you.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.550
I think, right before
I went into this show,

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.230
I went out to lunch
with Sierra Boggess,

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.289
who played the original
"Little Mermaid."

00:28:40.289 --> 00:28:40.830
ALAN: Really?

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.246
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
And I, you know,

00:28:42.246 --> 00:28:44.110
I questioned anyone
who has done this

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.550
before me, anyone who's ever--

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.360
I hung out with Laura Osnes, who
was just here for "Bandstand."

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:49.975
Or you know--

00:28:49.975 --> 00:28:51.310
ALAN: She was in for
"Cinderella" too.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.210
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Yeah, she was--

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.180
she was Cinderella.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.990
So talking to other
people was really helpful.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.600
And they all had their
own little helpful hints,

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.550
and like, little advice.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.180
Things that got them through
and gave them a cool head.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.470
ALAN: That's really cool.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.600
If any of you guys in the
audience have questions,

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.685
start lining up at the
mics in the aisles.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.940
John?

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.240
JOHN BOLTON: Yes, sir?

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.239
ALAN: You've got great
Broadway credits as well.

00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:17.260
Including one of my
favorites, "Dames at Sea"--

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:17.740
JOHN BOLTON: Oh gosh.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.160
ALAN: "Guys and Dolls,"
"Spamalot," "How to Succeed."

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.650
JOHN BOLTON: "Spamalot" was fun.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.916
ALAN: So what attracted
you to "Anastasia"?

00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:24.790
JOHN BOLTON: Oh gosh.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.100
Well, just the work.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.542
I knew it was
going to be a big--

00:29:29.542 --> 00:29:31.000
I figured it was
going to be pretty

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.420
big fancy show, because
it was the same director,

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.070
choreographer, and
designers of a show

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.660
that I have great
admiration for,

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.910
called "A Gentleman's
Guide to Love and Murder."

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.250
And I knew I wanted to
work with that team.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.430
And so they sent
me the materials

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.350
for the character, Vlad.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.010
And I thought, I think I know
who this guy is, or could be.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.630
And I rented the film
on Netflix, the cartoon,

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.520
because I'd never
seen it, and just

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.111
to get the flavor of Mr.
Grammer's vocal performance

00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:01.610
in my head.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.294
And I went in and,
you know, I figure

00:30:03.294 --> 00:30:05.710
my attitude is, you keep showing
up, you do your homework,

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.310
you do your best.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.268
Once in a while, it's
your turn to get the job.

00:30:08.268 --> 00:30:11.270
And that has served me
pretty well for 25 years.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.300
And it was my turn
to get the job.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.360
And I auditioned last.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.492
I went right after
Christy and Derek.

00:30:16.492 --> 00:30:17.950
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
We were together.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.810
JOHN BOLTON: Yeah, And they
called me 20 minutes later

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.460
and said, you're
going to get an offer.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.360
And that never happens.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.780
So it just seemed like it
was serendipitous, in a way.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.030
And it's been such a pleasure.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.570
Because I grew up loving
all the old cast albums.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:37.120
My parents had all the records
of "The Music Man" and "South

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.510
Pacific," and "Sound of
Music," all just the classic

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.510
shows that we had.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.070
And, you know, I've
originated other roles.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.101
But this is probably
one of two most--

00:30:47.101 --> 00:30:48.350
I enjoyed "A Christmas Story."

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.430
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Oh come
on, "A Christmas Story."

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.170
JOHN BOLTON: "A
Christmas Story" was fun.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.860
But I got to play the dad in "A
Christmas Story" on Broadway.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.060
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: So good.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:52.830
JOHN BOLTON: Which
was a lot of fun.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.440
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: A big
kick line with the legs.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.460
JOHN BOLTON: But
this one is special

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.793
because it's a really nice team.

00:30:56.793 --> 00:30:58.880
And I love-- I love doing it.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.320
And you know, just to--

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.360
the fact that some
kid now is listening

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.320
to us on an original cast
album like we used to do,

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.340
it's really thrilling.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.812
That's the real thrill for us.

00:31:08.812 --> 00:31:09.770
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:13.499
ALAN: And you also have been a
headliner at the New York Pops

00:31:13.499 --> 00:31:14.040
Philharmonic.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:14.900
JOHN BOLTON: I have.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:15.260
Sure.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:15.470
Yeah.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.540
ALAN: So could you explain what
that is for those who may not

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.470
have seen those concerts?

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.511
JOHN BOLTON: Oh well, OK.

00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:22.290
The New York Pops is an
amazing A-list orchestra

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.750
that plays at Carnegie Hall.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.820
And because I have--

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.420
because of my association with
"A Christmas Story," perhaps,

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.440
I am eternally Christmas
Guy, apparently.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.010
And so I host their,
and perform in,

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.666
their annual Christmas concert,
which is for young people.

00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:41.540
This past year, we did
"Twas The Night Before

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.470
Christmas," which I memorized,
thank you very much.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.720
And the past year was
the anniversary of-- it

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.260
was the 50th anniversary of
"Charlie Brown Christmas."

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.710
So here's the New York Pops,
this huge, amazing orchestra

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.790
playing that amazing
Vince Guaraldi score.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.890
It was just thrilling to
be on stage with that.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.910
And the year before was
the 50th anniversary

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.160
of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer Christmas Special."

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.530
So we did all the
music from those.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:07.632
And it's a thrill.

00:32:07.632 --> 00:32:09.590
And Carnegie Hall was
"Guys and Dolls" as well.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.210
So always a pleasure to
work there, a thrill.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.320
ALAN: So do you
enjoy having to, I

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.570
guess, the full orchestra
literally on stage with you,

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:18.110
behind you?

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.820
Or underneath the stage
and supporting you?

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.700
Stage versus--

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.830
JOHN BOLTON: As long as I
can hear them, I'm happy.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.090
And as long as I can--
well the challenge

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.180
with the orchestra at
the New York Pops is,

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.590
the conductor is behind you.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.720
And because of unions
and the way things are,

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.300
you've rehearsed it
once with the orchestra.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.190
And then it's sold
out Carnegie Hall.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.420
Go.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.730
So that can be a bit
terrifying and it usually

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.290
involves a lot of
homework on my end.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.530
But so I like the comfort
of having the orchestra

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.270
right there in front of me.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.466
ALAN: And you can actually--

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.340
the conductor, you can
see from stage, right?

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.423
JOHN BOLTON: Sure, like,
you know, you can see him

00:32:52.423 --> 00:32:53.810
without looking right at him.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:54.768
You see the hand going.

00:32:54.768 --> 00:32:56.690
We also have these
monitors mounted

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.240
on the lower part of the
balcony that the audience

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.580
doesn't see where we have a
good shot of the conductor.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.163
ALAN: Yeah, and do
you enjoy, I guess,

00:33:03.163 --> 00:33:05.240
the straight concert
style stand and sing,

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.200
or do you like being an anim--

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.019
you seem like an animated guy.

00:33:09.019 --> 00:33:10.060
JOHN BOLTON: I like both.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.110
You know, shake it up,
do a little of each.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.430
But the concerts, sometimes
right before you go on,

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.040
you think-- they're
usually a one off,

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.711
like, you do it once or twice
with very little rehearsal.

00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:20.210
And you, right
before you go on, you

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.710
think, why did I
say yes to this?

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.810
I'm absolutely mortified.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.210
But I like a mix of both.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.610
Because then you do it,
and hopefully it goes well.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.520
And you wind up
being proud of it.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.260
I like both.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.150
I like everything.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.189
I want to do it all.

00:33:34.189 --> 00:33:36.230
AUDIENCE: I want to thank
you so much for coming.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.117
"Anastasia" was my
favorite movie growing up.

00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:39.825
And then, I just moved
to New York and it

00:33:39.825 --> 00:33:40.970
as my first Broadway show.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.660
JOHN BOLTON: Oh my gosh.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for making

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.493
it a wonderful experience.

00:33:43.493 --> 00:33:44.810
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Thank you.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.956
AUDIENCE: I would just love to
know from the three of you what

00:33:46.956 --> 00:33:49.220
is the moment of the show
you most look forward to?

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.803
You know, before the
curtain comes up,

00:33:50.803 --> 00:33:54.280
what are you excited to
have happen on stage?

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.210
JOHN BOLTON: This is--

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.210
ZACH ADKINS: I have one.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.495
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: You say it.

00:33:56.495 --> 00:33:56.780
JOHN BOLTON: Go!

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.071
ZACH ADKINS: I only get to
go on every once in a while.

00:33:59.071 --> 00:34:02.180
So my favorite part is, I get
to make fun of John onstage

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.620
during "Learn to Do It."

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.050
And the line is, oh--

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.360
because Christy's
character is mad

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.010
that we're pushing her
too hard to be a princess.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:11.510
And--

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.830
JOHN BOLTON: This is
your favorite part?

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.413
ZACH ADKINS: This
is my favorite thing

00:34:14.413 --> 00:34:15.840
because it makes John laugh.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.420
And if you make a
funny person laugh,

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.330
it makes you feel really good.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:19.830
So--

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:24.350
--and so, with "Learn to Do It."

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.969
And I got a note, I
was on for the week.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.030
And I-- they were
like, oh, well, you're

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.639
not mimicking John's bow.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.431
The line is, "you're
bowing and kowtowing."

00:34:32.431 --> 00:34:34.305
It's all those years of
bowing and kowtowing.

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:36.322
That's why he can't stand
up straight anymore.

00:34:36.322 --> 00:34:38.780
And I asked John, and I was
like, can you show me your bow?

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.889
And he goes, oh, it's
the "Annie" pose.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.139
JOHN BOLTON: But I was joking.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.290
I didn't know you were serious.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.609
ZACH ADKINS: Oh, I
was very serious.

00:34:44.609 --> 00:34:45.000
Wait!

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.429
Will you do it?

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:46.637
Will you do the "Annie" pose?

00:34:46.637 --> 00:34:47.175
Yes!

00:34:47.175 --> 00:34:49.050
And we get out there
during "Learn to Do It."

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.050
And I just, I was like,
oh it's all these years

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.880
of bowing and kowtowing.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.132
And he broke.

00:34:54.132 --> 00:34:55.340
And I was having a good time.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.480
And that's my favorite moment.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.390
My favorite moment now is to
think of something else that

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.030
would make him laugh.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.620
Because making him
laugh makes me laugh.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.000
So.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.310
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Making
John laugh is pretty fun.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.720
ZACH ADKINS: Yeah.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.345
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
I'm not going to lie.

00:35:04.345 --> 00:35:06.207
[LAUGHS] Sorry, John.

00:35:06.207 --> 00:35:07.748
Once in a while,
you make John laugh.

00:35:07.748 --> 00:35:08.416
And it's funny.

00:35:08.416 --> 00:35:10.540
JOHN BOLTON: But you try
not to have the audience--

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.290
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: No, no.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:11.910
It's always tasteful.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.010
JOHN BOLTON: It's spoiling the
show, you don't want to do it.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.540
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: No, John
never spoils the show.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.831
JOHN BOLTON: I'd never do that.

00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:19.010
My favorite part, actually, I
love doing the train sequence.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.800
Because it's the happy village,
happy travelers, and we're

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.700
all hopeful.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.850
And I love doing the number with
Caroline, the big tango we do.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.620
The amazing Caroline
O'Connor plays

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.765
Lily, who I sing about
in what you just heard.

00:35:29.765 --> 00:35:31.140
And we have a good
time together.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.020
But my favorite part of
the show is getting ready.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.410
I know that sounds
so silly, but our--

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:34.970
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: It's so fun.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.760
JOHN BOLTON: Our dressing
rooms are Ramin, me, Derek.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.940
And we always blast
like, '70s or '80s rock.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.212
And it's just, we just have
a good time getting ready.

00:35:43.212 --> 00:35:45.170
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah,
I'll order dip usually.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.100
Like, I get to work.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.040
And then, there's like, this
dip that I order for the cast.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.210
My room ends up being
like, the green room

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.210
for the cast, because we
don't have a green room

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.220
like, an area for the
cast to congregate.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.840
So my room is larger.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.140
So we have--

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.950
I'll have snacks and
candy for everyone.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.200
And I buy this dip and
we eat it with pretzels.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.380
And it never gets old.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.330
We've been eating it--

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:05.960
ZACH ADKINS: For weeks.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.750
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: For many--

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.590
since the beginning.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.270
JOHN BOLTON: Now
they just deliver it.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.240
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: No, no, no.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.500
It's funny.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.990
Cause last time, they were
like, you should use the app.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.100
Because I've been
using Seamless.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.600
But they have their
own special app.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.560
They're like, 10% off
if you use the app.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.830
Cause I buy so much of this dip.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.680
And it just makes me
so happy as people

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.226
come in one after the next
before the show starts.

00:36:24.226 --> 00:36:25.850
JOHN BOLTON: But we
can't be, you know,

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.756
pounding this garlic
stuff all show.

00:36:27.756 --> 00:36:29.630
Because as you know, I
make out with Caroline

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.254
for an extended period
during the show.

00:36:31.254 --> 00:36:32.290
And you guys kiss.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.320
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: I
have a toothbrush.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.180
JOHN BOLTON: Oh, OK.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.726
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:37.032 --> 00:36:38.990
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: No, my
breath is pretty bad--

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.812
[LAUGHS] My breath is
pretty bad the whole show.

00:36:41.812 --> 00:36:44.270
JOHN BOLTON: We can tell when
she's been pounding that dip.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.110
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: I
also like to eat--

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.690
I also like to eat--

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.000
ZACH ADKINS: She
always apologizes.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.958
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: --green
salad during the show

00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:50.360
so my breath smells like
onion most of the time.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.320
ZACH ADKINS: It's a
really intense moment,

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.430
and she'll whisper, actually.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.180
JOHN BOLTON: But now--

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.471
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: I'm so sorry.

00:36:54.471 --> 00:36:55.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.390
I am so sorry.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.380
I'm very professional.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.980
ALAN: Yeah.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.773
OK.

00:37:02.773 --> 00:37:03.890
Yes.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:04.598
AUDIENCE: Uh, hi.

00:37:04.598 --> 00:37:08.450
I wanted to ask about the
process of recording the cast

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.060
albums.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.540
And like, how does that work?

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.600
Do you do it in a studio?

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.100
Or like, how is it
different for you

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.990
than like, performing on stage?

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.510
JOHN BOLTON: Well, we did
it in a very famous studio

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.329
on 53rd Street.

00:37:19.329 --> 00:37:20.370
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Avatar.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.245
JOHN BOLTON: Avatar
Studios, it's called now.

00:37:22.245 --> 00:37:25.010
But it's where like Springsteen
recorded "Born to Run."

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.360
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Is that
really where Springsteen

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.232
recorded "Born to Run"?

00:37:27.232 --> 00:37:27.630
JOHN BOLTON: Yeah.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.320
ZACH ADKINS: Lots of albums--

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.580
JOHN BOLTON: "Born in the
USA," that whole--that whole,

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:29.800
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.500
JOHN BOLTON: Well,
many, many iconic--

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.640
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Did
you see that documentary?

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:32.970
JOHN BOLTON: But it's--

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:33.350
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: So good.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.790
JOHN BOLTON: It's so good.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:35.580
But no.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.390
We go into a recording studio.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:41.310
It's usually, we have a
separate producer for that.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:46.200
Wonderful guy named Van Dean
who works at Broadway Records.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.370
There's usually a bidding--

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.020
a bidding war to
see which company

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.260
is going to release the CD.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.530
Or you know, the cast album.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.350
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
And it's one day.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.490
JOHN BOLTON: And
we do it in a day.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.064
And they augmented our-- we
already have a fairly large

00:37:59.064 --> 00:37:59.730
orchestra from--

00:37:59.730 --> 00:37:59.830
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Just a voc--

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.830
I mean, for the actors.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.040
JOHN BOLTON: We
added a few pieces.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.623
And you go in.

00:38:02.623 --> 00:38:05.140
You do it piece
by piece in a day.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:05.640
And--

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.060
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.476
JOHN BOLTON: You
know, we recorded

00:38:07.476 --> 00:38:10.080
"Learn to Do It," which
we do three people running

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.340
around the stage like crazy.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.800
We're in-- Christy was
in this room over here.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.000
I'm in this room over here.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.066
And Derek was over here.

00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:17.190
And we're on with the cans.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.170
So you hear everything.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.281
And the orchestra
is playing live.

00:38:21.281 --> 00:38:21.780
There.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.370
And--

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:23.328
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yeah.

00:38:23.328 --> 00:38:26.010
But I remember, after we did
it, the next couple of days,

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.870
I kept going to the
writers and being

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.431
like, if you want me to come
back in, like, and just sing

00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:32.180
"Journey to the Past"
a couple more times.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.388
And they're like, no we got
it, we got it, we got it.

00:38:34.388 --> 00:38:35.760
And I didn't leave them.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.790
And then when I heard the album,
they just did a fantastic job.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:41.400
JOHN BOLTON: But also, they
try to elicit more color

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.432
from your voice.

00:38:42.432 --> 00:38:44.640
Because the audience doesn't--
the listening audience

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.860
doesn't have the benefit
of the visual, obviously.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.560
So for a lot of things,
they were like, say that--

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.389
say that word like it
sounds, or like it feels.

00:38:52.389 --> 00:38:54.430
Because we don't have the
benefit of the visuals.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.930
So it's a different thing.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.980
But it sure is a fun thing.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.972
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
Yeah it's cool.

00:38:59.972 --> 00:39:01.680
ALAN: I've actually--
in all these things

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.510
that I've interviewed all
these Broadway events,

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.190
I've never asked that.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.210
That's a very interesting thing.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.090
I had no idea you
guys do that in a day.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:07.270
ZACH ADKINS: Yeah.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.769
I would say the hardest thing
is, what he was talking about,

00:39:09.769 --> 00:39:11.280
putting the color in your voice.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:11.850
You know?

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.520
Really communicating the
idea without your face.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.270
JOHN BOLTON: Yeah.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.690
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: It's crazy.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:16.260
ALAN: That's amazing.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:16.759
All right.

00:39:16.759 --> 00:39:18.730
Well we-- we have a
little bit of time left.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.400
I want to get to
these last two songs.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.105
But before we go, is there--

00:39:22.105 --> 00:39:22.980
is there one feeling?

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.564
Is there one just
moment that you

00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:28.230
wish people will take away, hope
people will take away with them

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.260
after seeing this show?

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.295
How do you hope their
lives are changed?

00:39:32.295 --> 00:39:34.670
JOHN BOLTON: Well, we're a
lot of people's first Broadway

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.460
show.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.280
Hello.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.340
And so I hope they come back.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.290
Not just to our show.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.960
But that they see, we are
a classic Broadway show.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.750
You know, we're not trying
to rewrite anything.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.110
But it's a classic,
beautifully designed

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.451
Broadway show with great tunes
and we think, exciting story.

00:39:54.451 --> 00:39:56.700
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: And in
this crazy world, to escape--

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.658
JOHN BOLTON: To escape.

00:39:57.658 --> 00:40:01.160
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: --and to
just feel that sense of warmth

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.941
inside is--

00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:02.690
JOHN BOLTON: Yeah.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.740
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
It's a nice feeling.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.031
JOHN BOLTON: And you see your
money, your ticket money,

00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:08.600
on stage, in terms of the
amazing sets and costumes.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.210
And so I would say, yeah.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.270
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: It's worth
the price of admission.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.061
JOHN BOLTON: It's worth
it-- come check out

00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:15.160
a classic Broadway show.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.480
ZACH ADKINS: And the nostalgia.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.813
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: The nostalgia.

00:40:17.813 --> 00:40:19.730
ALAN: Yeah the nostalgia,
at the movies, yeah.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.271
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
You're transported.

00:40:21.271 --> 00:40:23.210
ALAN: Well, we've got
one more question here.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.552
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask,
since you're all obviously

00:40:26.552 --> 00:40:28.280
very successful,
which is really great,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.762
but what was your like,
trigger, like, did you see like,

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.303
your first Broadway
show or something

00:40:33.303 --> 00:40:36.090
that you knew you
wanted to do this, or be

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.508
in this line of work?

00:40:37.508 --> 00:40:39.140
CHRISTY ALTOMARE: Yes.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.020
Who wants to start?

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:40.330
I could start.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.330
JOHN BOLTON: Go ahead.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.034
CHRISTY ALTOMARE:
So I guess my--

00:40:43.034 --> 00:40:44.450
I think it's an
interesting thing.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.180
When I was really
little, I used to run

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.680
around singing all the time.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.109
And I would make
a stage anywhere.

00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:53.150
If I was at the beach, I
would throw a towel down

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.950
and stand on it and
scream, this is my stage.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:59.900
And luckily, I had parents
who just fed that, and gave me

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.630
lots of lessons and gave me
the opportunity to do this

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.820
and told me that it
was possible to do

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.150
anything I wanted in my life.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:08.210
And I think that a lot
of times, you know,

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.950
people aren't as lucky.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.200
And I was just lucky
that it was something

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.667
I loved from childhood and
my parents just kept saying,

00:41:15.667 --> 00:41:16.250
you can do it.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.300
You can do it.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.400
It wasn't one specific
show or anything.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.620
I just always sort of--

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.450
it was in me from childhood.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.200
JOHN BOLTON: Cool.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.010
A similar thing.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:28.700
Grew up with the music of
the shows in the house.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.220
And then, when I was
very young, my parents

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.850
took me along to New York and
we saw "The Wiz" and "Annie."

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:36.960
And I, with "Annie,"
there were kids on stage.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.460
Oh my god.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.221
They're my age.

00:41:38.221 --> 00:41:39.220
Look what they're doing.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.740
This looks like the life.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.880
And so that's sort
of planted it.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.111
ALAN: No school!

00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:47.610
JOHN BOLTON: So a different
kind of school, that's for sure.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.520
But no, I majored in
journalism in college.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.160
I have a BA in journalism.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.910
Because it was never
really an option.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.807
No one ever said, do
you want to do this?

00:41:54.807 --> 00:41:57.140
And when I was in high school,
I certainly wasn't ready.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.400
I did high school musicals.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.630
But you know, I did my best.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.040
At best, I had energy.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.480
That was about the
most that could

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.207
be said about any
performance skill I had.

00:42:05.207 --> 00:42:06.290
So it was never an option.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.640
So I majored in journalism.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.280
But during college, I did a lot
of regional theater, community

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.010
theater, in the
Rochester, New York area.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.170
And learned from some people.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.790
And decided to put my toe
in the water in New York.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.681
And here it is, a
few years later.

00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:22.180
So.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:22.910
Yeah.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.284
ZACH ADKINS: I was
actually a late bloomer.

00:42:25.284 --> 00:42:27.200
I didn't really-- I
started theater as a hobby

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.760
in high school.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.710
Didn't really get into
it till my junior year.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.410
And senior year was
kind of rolling around.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.720
And I had another
option on the table.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.520
So it was either kind
of jump in and start

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.120
auditioning for these college
programs, or kind of walk away.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.240
So I had a mentor that
really believed in me.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.820
And she pushed me, and she
got my material together.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.903
And I went to all these
colleges and I auditioned.

00:42:48.903 --> 00:42:49.700
I went to college.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.200
And got a bachelor's of music.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.880
And I moved here.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.130
And it was really just--

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.690
the thing about this
business is it's

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.450
about being at the right
place at the right time.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.790
And then, having talent.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.900
Or having a good work ethic.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.400
And there's no one thing.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.640
It's a lot of it,
I account to luck.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.340
And a lot of it, it's
just about being prepared.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.330
So I kind of just
got swept up into it

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.160
when I was a senior
in high school

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.720
and never really looked back.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.090
And so, I do remember
one specific--

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:20.690
I used to go--

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.260
I'm from Cleveland, Ohio.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.826
And so I went to the
touring shows in Cleveland

00:43:24.826 --> 00:43:26.450
all the time when I
was in high school.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.839
And there was one production.

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:30.130
I was sitting out there with
my girlfriend at the time.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.963
And I turned to her,
and I went, you know, I

00:43:31.963 --> 00:43:33.980
think I could handle
myself with these people.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.050
I think I could
be at their level.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:38.720
I see myself as an equal.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.004
And from then on, I
was like, all right.

00:43:41.004 --> 00:43:42.045
We're going to go for it.

00:43:42.045 --> 00:43:42.770
You know?

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:43.500
No looking back.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.330
Either you do it or you don't.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.030
So.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.540
ALAN: Cool.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.100
Yeah, so everyone visit them.

Theater 235 West 44th Street.

this off with two more songs.
