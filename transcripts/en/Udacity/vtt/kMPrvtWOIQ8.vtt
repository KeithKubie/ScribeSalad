Hey, I'm Emily.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.670
&gt;&gt; And I'm Ajay.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.360
&gt;&gt; And we'll be your instructors.

We're here to help you learn about
using location within a website.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.080
Let's get started with some questions.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.990
Are you looking to build a dating site
for all the left handed vegetarians that

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.350
live within a one hour bike
ride of your parents house?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.540
Or, perhaps create an online
vacation planning experience for

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.290
users in Thailand.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.240
Or do you just want to add a
location-related feature into your site

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.870
that's instantly familiar to your users?

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.040
If you answered yes to
any of those questions,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.200
you've come to the right course.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.070
Google Maps is used by over 2
million developers worldwide.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.430
&gt;&gt; Using location adds another
dimension to a website and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.650
unlocks a huge palette of features.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.700
Using Google's Maps and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.320

familiar experience with reliable data.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.930
&gt;&gt; In this course you'll learn how to
use different Google Maps APIs to build

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.960
your very own location enabled site.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.500
You'll be able to use the tools
Google has available to display

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.810
a personalize map, and provide users
with fun and useful information.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.830

who has any level of experience in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.840

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.610
to build awesome stuff.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.140
Throughout this course, you'll see
us build a realistic listing app,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.560
with a variety of features that you'll
be able to use when you want to start

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.190
building your maps API
based application.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.728
&gt;&gt; Let's get started by creating
a developer project, and

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:32.220
