00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.710
NARRATOR: On the shore
of Lake Michigan located

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.380
just a few miles
south of Muskegon,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.830
Kevin Dykstra believes he
has located physical evidence

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.040
of an abandoned Confederate
train engine buried some four

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.460
feet beneath the sand.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.040
If he can dig an area
deep enough and wide

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.710
enough so that it
can be photographed,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.040
Kevin is hoping it will serve
as proof that will convince

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.080
fellow treasure hunter and
Michigan businessman Marty

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.380
Lagina to finance what
promises to be a very

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.920
expensive search to
find a boxcar filled

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.420
with lost Confederate gold.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.920
After the Civil
War ended in 1865,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.880
a company called the
Florida Rail Road reported

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.420
that a Confederate
locomotive had been stolen

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.250
in the city of Cedar Keys.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.080
KEVIN DYKSTRA: Who can steal
something from a railroad?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.920
Who can steal a train engine?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.080
I believe that it
was Colonel Minty.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.250
NARRATOR: Colonel
Robert H.G. Minty

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.420
was one of the Union officers
responsible for the arrest

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.670
of Jefferson Davis.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.120
According to Kevin
Dykstra's research,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.120
it was Minty who tipped off
Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.620
Pritchard to the fact that
the Confederate president was

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.750
fleeing south with the
Confederate treasury and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.460
to capture Davis at all costs.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.460
After the war, Minty
became the superintendent

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.710
of a number of
railroad companies,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.620
overseeing expansion projects
and general management.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.790
One of those companies
was the Florida Rail Road,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.880
which he joined around 1869,
one year before Kevin Dykstra

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.040
believes Minty arranged
for the gold that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.210
was secretly buried
in Georgia to be

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.750
brought to Michigan by rail.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.830
Kevin Dykstra must now
face a sobering reality.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.830
Even if a stolen Confederate
locomotive really

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.250
does lie buried
beneath the sand,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.500
it may be too close to the water
to be successfully exposed.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.330
I don't believe
there's anything more

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.460
physically that we could do.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.120
We brought in 20 people.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.330
The sand just keeps
washing back in.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.000
NARRATOR: Refusing
to give up on what

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.250
could be a historic
discovery, Kevin and his team

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.460
now shift their focus to
uncover what they believe to be

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.960
the abandoned railroad tracks.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.460
We're just under eight feet.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.460
That should have hit it
if you were going to hit it.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.460
NARRATOR: Eight feet down and
still no sign of the tracks?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.540
KEVIN DYKSTRA: I know
the tracks are there.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.880
I have to get down to that
railroad track for two reasons.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.830
One, because I will
not let it beat me.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.790
I will find that.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.210
I will get right to it.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.710
And the other is I want
to show it to Marty.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.670
Got something right there.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.380
Sweet.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.830
I heard it.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.880
That's got to be
the railroad track.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.210
NARRATOR: In an
attempt to create

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.540
a reinforced digging
shaft, the team

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.880
now uses a three-foot-wide
steel caisson.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.830
If they can pump water
out of the metal cylinder,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.040
they hope to confirm that the
object buried beneath the sand

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.210
is an abandoned train track.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.830
We got a ticking clock.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.380
I've got to get that sleeve
down about 2 and 1/2 feet.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.040
We're going to start extricating
all of that sand and mud.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040
That sleeve is going to go down.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.380
Will we get to that
railroad track?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.210
I believe we will.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.210
Can you take that probe
down and push down?

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.000
All right.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.170
It's right there.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.540
I think we can get to it.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.040
We just keep digging
and digging and digging.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.000
You probably should back up.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.710
[all exclaim]

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.540
NARRATOR: Suddenly, after what
seems like the perfect plan

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.080
to get deep enough to find
the suspected railroad tracks,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.830
the hole once again caves
in due to incoming water.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.540
You're losing the other bank.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.580
Big time.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.170
NARRATOR: But Kevin Dykstra
is not ready to give up.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.420
KEVIN DYKSTRA: All right.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.750
Start the generator
up, and let's try

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.580
to get some water out of there.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.040
Man, we're so close.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.880
[whirring]

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.960
NARRATOR: Although
Kevin's brother Al

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.750
can feel one of the metal tracks
buried deep below the sand,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.080
the influx of water is making
it impossible for the team

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.880
to expose it.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.710
KEVIN DYKSTRA: How can I get
down to that railroad track?

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.290
I mean, we put our hands on it.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.620
So I figured it out.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.290
We came out with a
38-inch tube to go

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.790
over top of the 36-inch tube.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.120
But it's much taller, so I can
stack one on top of the other

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.750
and get right down to
that railroad track.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.500
NARRATOR: For Kevin
Dykstra and his team,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.620
it has been a day of both
extreme highs and bitter lows.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.670
Although he is convinced he
has successfully located both

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.170
the stolen locomotive
and the abandoned

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.420
railroad tracks,
he cannot dig them

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.170
up sufficiently to prove it.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.000
I don't know what to do.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.920
As much as I want
to move forward from

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.960
this point right here, I can't.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.830
NARRATOR: If he is to secure
the necessary financing he needs

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.620
from Marty Lagina and undertake
a search for the gold that may

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.250
still lie at the bottom
of Lake Michigan,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.790
he will need a new strategy.
