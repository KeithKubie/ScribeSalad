00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780
important question because it actually
 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.680

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690
goes even beyond simply the relationship
 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.120

of the US and the Arab world I think

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
of the US and the Arab world I think
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.190
of the US and the Arab world I think

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
it's got a lot to do with attitudes

between religious cultures and
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.669
between religious cultures and
civilizations and especially in relation

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
civilizations and especially in relation
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.799

to the Muslim world and while obviously
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.140
to the Muslim world and while obviously
I'm not going to deny that there are

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
I'm not going to deny that there are
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.670
I'm not going to deny that there are
real political issues and real

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
real political issues and real
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.410
real political issues and real
differences as to how these are

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
differences as to how these are
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450
differences as to how these are
perceived and how people think we should

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
perceived and how people think we should
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490
perceived and how people think we should
be resolved at the heart of the problem

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
be resolved at the heart of the problem
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.259
be resolved at the heart of the problem
that you're pointing to I think is the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
that you're pointing to I think is the
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.240
that you're pointing to I think is the
question of respect and people want to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
question of respect and people want to
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.650
question of respect and people want to
be respected and what to feel that their

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
be respected and what to feel that their
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.770
be respected and what to feel that their
dignity is not something that is just

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
dignity is not something that is just
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.260
dignity is not something that is just
referred to verbally but is real in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
referred to verbally but is real in
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330
referred to verbally but is real in
terms of the way people understand the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
terms of the way people understand the
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.979
terms of the way people understand the
other and the way they relate to the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
other and the way they relate to the
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.690
other and the way they relate to the
other and in order to do that we need

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
other and in order to do that we need
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.520
other and in order to do that we need
