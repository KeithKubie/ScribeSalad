00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.360
Back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
as food began to be more and more mass produced

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.660
and shipped long distances, instead of locally
grown and sold fresh, it was basically the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.759
Wild West in regards to food production and
there were no real official regulations on

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.079
what you could add to food, or even that if
you labeled something chicken, that it had

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.260
to contain any chicken at all.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.239
And as there were also no rules about reporting
any ingredients, businesses pretty much did

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.040
whatever they pleased.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.760
To give you an idea of the kind of stuff the
food and drug industries were cramming into

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.409
things, secretly adding morphine to children’s
cough syrup was a thing and, more pertinent

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.550
to the subject at hand today, commonly used
preservatives back then included borax, formaldehyde,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.100
sulfuric acid, and copper sulfate, just to
name a few.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.570
It also wasn’t uncommon to use lead for
coloring candy or to do things like grind

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.530
up various organs and scraps from animals
and sell it as chicken meat; grind up white

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.330
rocks and clay to fill out flour; and use
sawdust, charcoal and ground up charred animal

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.869
bones to fill out coffee grounds.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.990
As an example of how widespread selling a
product as one thing when it was actually

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.000
something else was, in one experiment conducted
by our hero of the hour, Dr. Harvey Wiley,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.719
his team found that 9 out of the 10 maple
syrup brands sold in Indiana did not actually

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.000
include any maple syrup in their supposedly
pure maple syrup product.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.100
By the turn of the century, the state of the
food industry had become a major cause for

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.960
concern in terms of public health, but nobody
was bothering to do anything about.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.930
Enter Dr. Wiley and his Hygenic Table Trials.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.020
The experiments were designed to test the
safety of various preservatives commonly used

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.450
by the food industry at the time.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.390
Although they began in 1902, Dr. Wiley had
been petitioning the government to conduct

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.450
such experiments for a couple decades (reportedly
from almost the moment he scored the gig of

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.240
chief chemist at the Department of Agriculture
in 1883), only to be rebuffed by his bosses

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.330
when food industry lobbyists caught wind of
what he was up to.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.500
Finally in 1902 though, Wiley was given $5,000
(about $143,000 today) and permission to do

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.879
whatever was necessary to test the safety
of various food preservatives.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.459
Permission in hand, he set about finding 12
volunteers for a series of experiments the

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.370
media would come to dub “The Poison Squad
Trials”.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.010
While you might think finding volunteers to
potentially ingest something harmful to the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.680
human body would be difficult, Dr. Wiley would
later note that he was inundated with requests

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.909
from men (women weren’t allowed to take
part in the experiment) wanting to join.

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.010
For example, in one letter, the individual
in question wrote,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.010
Dear Sir,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.769
I read in the paper of your experiments on
diet.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.019
I have a stomach can stand anything.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.130
I have a stomach that will surprise you.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.860
I am afflicted with 7 diseases.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.379
Never went to a doctor for 15 years.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.960
They told me 15 years age that I could not
live 8 months.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960
What do you think of it?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.860
My stomach can hold anything…

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.590
Of course, it helped that Wiley was also offering
a bit of pay for the gig and providing free

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.060
lodging and prepared meals for a minimum of
six months, with the person otherwise being

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.120
able to go about their regular lives at normal
jobs and the like.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.409
Owing to the nature of the experiment, volunteers
were expected to be in perfect health and

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.120
during their time taking part were given the
best medical care money could provide.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.910
In return, all the volunteers had to do was
eat whatever Wiley put in front of them and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.299
agree not to sue him or the government if
they suffered serious complications.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.640
The general method used to ensure safety and
figure out if the doses in common product

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.750
were bad was to start with ultra low doses
and slowly ramp up over time until the subjects

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.019
started having adverse effects, if any.

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.209
As for the experiments themselves, they began
by establishing a baseline for vitals on each

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.010
subject over the course of weeks and then
the fun began, starting with borax which was

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.140
commonly used to preserve meat at the time.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.360
Initially the plan was to add the borax to
the food, but Wiley quickly noticed that as

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.129
the dosage ramped up volunteers started avoiding
anything the borax was added to due to its

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.270
strong, metallic taste.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.180
Thus, he simply began giving volunteers a
capsule full of borax at the end of each meal

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.180
instead.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.240
To keep track of any and all effects the borax
had on the volunteers, their vital signs were

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.870
carefully measured several times a day and
they were forbidden from eating any outside

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.060
food so as to not contaminate the findings.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.080
Each man’s poop and pee was also analysed
extensively and every volunteer was given

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.710
a medical satchel containing various vials
and containers they were asked to do their

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.580
business into during their day-to-day lives
away from the house the experiment was taking

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.580
place in.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.300
The effects of the borax were noticed within
weeks, with volunteers complaining of everything

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.990
from headaches to depression and symptoms
getting more and more severe as time went

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.990
on.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.940
That said, for the most part volunteers, who
were occasionally rotated out when transitioning

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.199
to a new substance to minimize the chances
of long term health problems, remained in

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.889
good spirits for the five years the experiments
took place.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.830
Notable exceptions to this were a few months
into the borax experiments where volunteers

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.580
briefly went on strike due to the symptoms
becoming severe, as well as during trials

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.699
involving formaldehyde.

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.650
At the time this was commonly used as a preservative
in various dairy products, but caused such

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.120
debilitating illness in volunteers almost
right away that Wiley cut the experiment short

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.810
out of concern for their safety.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.120
Other than this, the group that the media
would come to dub The Poison Squad seemed

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.139
to enjoy the experiments and some of the things
tested didn’t have any apparent adverse

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:41.840
effects, like sodium benzoate, making for
a rather pleasant few months for that set

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840
of volunteers.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.970
To add a touch of class to the proceedings,
volunteers would dress in formal attire for

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.280
evening meals, which, in addition to making
these meals seem fancy, made for excellent

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.990
publicity shots- shots which appeared in papers
across the country alongside stories discussing

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.069
the details of the experiments.

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.100
These stories were immensely popular with
the public, particularly when the substances

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.400
were causing ill effects.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.100
The food industry, however, were less enthusiastic
with the findings, which showed a lot of the

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.000
then common preservatives were really bad
for you.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.419
Thus, they used their collective might and
political sway to suppress papers Wiley wrote

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.840
on the experiments.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.979
These efforts were ultimately fruitless, however,
as Wiley saw to it that his reports got leaked

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.630
to the press anyway.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.020
When efforts to block the release of his findings
failed, various industry insiders took to

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.340
attacking Wiley’s credibility instead, as
well as spouting rhetoric like claiming he

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:41.120
was a “man who is doing all he can to destroy
American business” and the like.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.639
In the end, the mob was roused thanks to the
expirements, spearheaded by Women’s Clubs

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.400
across the country who tirelessly lobbied
for what would become the 1906 Pure Food and

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.539
Drug Act, aptly nicknamed The Wiley Act.

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.690
This Act, among other things, put in place
rules requiring listing ingredients on labels

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.160
so consumers could know, at least to some
extent, what they were actually getting.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.810
The idea at this point was not so much to
regulate the industries directly, but rather

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.919
increase transparency so the consumers could
decide whether they wanted to drink something

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:13.770
that used formaldehyde as a preservative,
for example.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.430
This Act, however, still left an amazing amount
of wiggle room for various companies to exploit,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.560
culminating in the infamous Elixir Sulfanilamide
Incident that condemned over 107 people (most

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.419
of whom were children) to a slow and excruciating
death thanks to the company involved adding

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:32.340
a known highly poisonous compound to their
product simply because it helped the main

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.550
ingredient dissolve well in the mixture…

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.169
Even when the death count started rolling
in almost immediately, the company still only

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:42.250
sent a telegram to doctors telling them to
return the product, but didn’t bother telling

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.349
them why or express the seriousness of the
issue, so many ignored the telegram and continued

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:50.480
to accidentally kill their patients.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.430
More on this shortly in the Bonus Fact below.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.450
Going back to the Poison Squad, the experiments
formally ended in 1907 and although Wiley

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.690
would eventually be credited as being instrumental
in the first significant step towards making

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.949
sure food consumed in the U.S. is reasonably
safe, the contributions of the members of

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:08.319
the Poison Squad have been largely overlooked.

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:12.659
This is largely due to the fact that volunteers
were anonymous, meaning in most cases their

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:18.020
names aren’t known, though their badass
moniker of “The Poison Squad” has certainly

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.099
endured.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.930
Bonus Fact:

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.410
As noted, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906,
still left an amazing amount of leeway to

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.310
poison people to save a buck without any real
consequences.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.060
This leads us to the Elixir Sulfanilamide
Incident.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.040
In a nutshell, sulfanilamide is actually a
perfectly safe antibiotic when administered

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.200
properly, and was used, among other things,
at the time to good effect at treating streptococcal

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200
infections.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.200
However, in an attempt to create a liquid
version of the drug (it normally came in either

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.140
powder or tablet form), the lead chemist at
S.E.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:58.570
Massengill Company, Harold Cole Watkins, mixed
it with diethylene glycol, commonly used today

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.710
in antifreeze and as a solvent.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.350
At the time, it was known that diethylene
glycol was highly poisonous to humans (most

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.920
notably causing kidney failure), but Watkins
did not know this when he decided to use it

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.920
in the company’s elixir.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.480
He chose it owing to how well sulfanilamide
dissolved in the substance and because diethylene

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.990
glycol tastes slightly sweet, making it particularly
good for getting children to take their medicine.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.140
In this case, even animal testing would not
have been required to discover the substance

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.180
was toxic.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.150
Watkins would have merely needed to do a surface
level look into the compound, with several

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.840
previous published studies noting diethylene
glycol, even in relatively small doses, would

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.790
cause kidney damage and potentially failure
of said organ.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.190
But no such due-diligence research nor testing
to determine the safety of such an elixir

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.510
before putting it on the market was required
at the time.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.290
Blissfully unaware that they were about to
start selling a tasty tonic of death to their

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.400
customers, S.E.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.990
Massengill sent out 633 shipments of the elixir
in the autumn of 1937 to pharmacists across

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.990
the nation.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.760
It didn’t take long for disturbing reports
to begin coming in, including news of deaths

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.490
trickling back to S.E.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:04.220
Massengill Co, resulting in them issuing telegrams
requesting the elixir be sent back for a full

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.440
refund, though not disclosing to pharmacists
the seriousness of the issue if they ignored

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.440
the telegram.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.340
This all was capped by a short and truly heart
wrenching letter by one Marie Nidiffer to

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.230
President Franklin D. Roosevelt describing
what happened in the days following administering

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.810
the drug to her 6 year old daughter, who at
the time was suffering from a sore throat:

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.900
The first time I ever had occasion to call
in a doctor for [Joan] and she was given Elixir

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.160
of Sulfanilamide.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.710
All that is left to us is the caring for her
little grave.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.080
Even the memory of her is mixed with sorrow
for we can see her little body tossing to

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.820
and fro and hear that little voice screaming
with pain and it seems as though it would

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.030
drive me insane.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.230
… It is my plea that you will take steps
to prevent such sales of drugs that will take

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:51.740
little lives and leave such suffering behind
and such a bleak outlook on the future as

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.840
I have tonight.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.560
As for Dr. Samual Evans Massengill, who owned
S.E.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.970
Massengill Co., he responded to the many dozens
of deaths caused by his company’s negligence

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.950
by issuing the following statement:

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:06.340
My chemists and I deeply regret the fatal
results, but there was no error in the manufacture

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.340
of the product.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.450
We have been supplying a legitimate professional
demand and no one could have foreseen the

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.770
unlooked-for results.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.350
I do not feel that there was any responsibility
on our part…

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.210
Needless to say, when all this came to light,
the public were more than a little outraged,

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.210
with S.E.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.730
Massengill’s somewhat brazen statement that
his drug company wasn’t responsible for

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.160
making sure their products weren’t simply
poison at the recommended dose before selling

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160
them.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.340
To add to the tragedy, it appears Harold Watkins
did not quite have the clear conscience of

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.830
Dr. Massengill, with Watkins sadly committing
suicide not long after it came to light that

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.040
his error had resulted in the deaths of over
100 people.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.820
In the end, the Elixir Sulfanilamide Incident
was the final straw, spurring an upgraded

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.530
to the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 in the
form of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.890
Act to hopefully prevent such a tragedy from
occurring again.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.340
Among other things, the Act required that
for the first time in US history, drug makers

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.720
had to demonstrate to the FDA that drugs were
reasonably safe before they could be marketed

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.130
to the public, set standards for how different
kinds of food should look and be packaged,

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.980
and specified legal maximums for “certain
poisonous substances” commonly added to

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:19.230
food and drink at the time.
