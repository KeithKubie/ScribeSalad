00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.629
These days, it’s not enough to take a film
at face value.

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.610
Viewers are always analyzing each scene for
a deeper meaning or subtext, trying to uncover

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.630
any hidden messages the filmmakers may have
been planting.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.970
Sometimes it’s just for fun, a product of
having watched a movie several times over.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.610
Then there are the cases where fans might
be on to something, letting others see the

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.070
final product in a new light.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.730
We’ll let you be the judge for our next
list: 10 amazing movie theories that totally

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.380
change everything.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.550
The Hobbit trilogy

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.120
After the highs of the Lord of the Rings films,
the Hobbit trilogy was a bit of a disappointment.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.820
The plot of one book was stretched over the
course of three long films, which were all

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.220
over-reliant on CGI.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.240
There could be a good reason for that.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.280
One theory suggests that what we’re seeing
on the screen is Bilbo’s “reimagining”

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.440
of his adventures as he writes his book, spicing
everything up so they’re more extravagant.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.140
It wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for Bilbo
to get a little fantastical as he tells his

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140
story.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.829
It sounds nice, but it’s probably Peter
Jackson’s fault for going into the project

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.819
without a final plan.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:16.819
The Dark Knight

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.170
Heath Ledger’s Joker is given no backstory
in this comic book sequel, so fans had to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.630
devise one on their own.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.090
A popular belief is that the Joker is a veteran
of the Iraq War and suffers from PTSD.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.200
This would explain his intricate knowledge
of weapons and ability to conceive one master

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.590
plan after another to terrorize Gotham.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.439
He also mentions that people don’t think
twice about a “truck load of soldiers”

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.909
blowing up, almost in a disdainful manner.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.459
If the Joker served in the military, that
line receives a whole new context and is arguably

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:47.459
sympathetic.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.609
We’ll never know the truth behind Nolan’s
Joker, but this is as good a guess as any.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:53.609
The Prestige

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.399
Christopher Nolan’s tale of magicians is
full of twists and turns as it is.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.509
What about one more?

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.069
The main trick in the film is the Transported
Man, which Borden achieves with a twin, while

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.070
Angier uses a machine that clones – and
drowns - himself on a nightly basis – or

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.500
so it would seem.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.540
One theory proposes that Angier always used
a double and didn’t introduce the drowning

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.230
aspect until the final night, when he knew
Borden would investigate behind the stage,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.010
framing his rival for murder.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.290
Earlier scenes in the film seem to work against
this, but it would be a crazy revelation if

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.319
it turned out to be true.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.319
Inception

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.480
By now, most people are familiar with the
theory that Cobb’s wedding ring is his real

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.519
totem, but there’s another hypothesis about
this master thief.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.519
While is accomplices refuse to tell anyone
about their totems out of fear for the consequences,

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.890
Cobb openly discusses how his spinning top
works with others, suggesting that he intentionally

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.090
is leaving himself open for a dream attack.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.310
Cobb is slowly but surely losing his grip
on reality and could be becoming suicidal,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.409
inviting a life forever in the dream world.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.840
It puts a dark spin on the material, but at
least he always gets his happy ending with

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.099
his family.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.180
Inside Out

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.390
The death of Bing Bong was one of the most
heartbreaking moments in Pixar history, as

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.910
the lovable imaginary friend sacrificed himself
so Joy could get back to HQ.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.030
But maybe things didn’t end that tragically.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.819
A theory claims that Bing Bong ended up at
Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends, the

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.849
famous Cartoon Network series.

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.390
It sounds like wishful thinking, but it adds
up.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.250
Foster’s home is where imaginary friends
go when their kids outgrow them, and Bing

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.969
Bong’s unique design makes it easy for him
to fit in with the collection of eye-catching

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.370
creatures that live there.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.590
We certainly prefer this to something so incredibly
sad.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.260
Toy Story 2

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.329
In this Pixar sequel, Jessie breaks our hearts
when she sings about the great times she had

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.040
with her original owner, Emily.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.049
Could that be Andy’s mom?

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.049
One theory seems to think so, pointing out
a strong connection between the cowboy hat

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.810
Andy wears in the first film and the one Emily
has in the second.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.969
Though viewers never get a great look at Emily,
her appearance could resemble a younger version

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.670
of Andy’s mom, and we never learned her
last name.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.980
Pixar’s no stranger to fan theories, and
this one takes the cake as the most emotional.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.670
Jessie ended up back with Emily, even though
she never knew it.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.620
Titanic

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.810
James Cameron is one of the most famous sci-fi
directors of all time, and he may have slipped

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.510
some of the genre into his Oscar winning period
piece.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.730
There are some who believe Jack Dawson is
a time traveler who came on the ship to save

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.960
Rose from suicide.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.950
During his time with Rose, Jack mentions a
man made lake that wasn’t created until

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.380
five years after the Titanic sank and promises
to take Rose on a roller coaster that wouldn’t

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.340
exist until 1916.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.420
His hairstyle and backpack are also unfit
for the era, having been popularized in the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.420
1930s.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.210
Historical inaccuracies happen all the time
in Hollywood, but Cameron never could have

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.690
bet on this happening.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.070
Ferris Bueller’s Day Off

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.000
One interpretation of the classic teen comedy
is that it’s a John Hughes version of Fight

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Club.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.350
Some fans think the whole film takes place
in Cameron’s head as he stays home from

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.380
school sick.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.600
Cameron is a loner who doesn’t get along
with his father, so he creates an ultra-popular

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.320
friend to hang out with, and Ferris’ girlfriend
Sloane is based on a girl Cameron has a crush

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.320
on.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.221
The film does dive into the fantastical with
all of the “SAVE FERRIS” movements, which

00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:21.960
could be read as wish fulfillment on the part
of Cameron.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.040
It’s also worth noting that Ferris leaves
Cameron once he decides to stand up against

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.110
his father, indicating he’s no longer needed.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.480
Iron Man 2

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.170
At long last, Spider-Man can play in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.410
Peter Parker made his debut in Captain America:
Civil War, but did audiences meet him much

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.410
earlier?

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.170
One theory floating around suggests Peter
is the small kid wearing an Iron Man mask

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.690
at the Stark Expo in Queens, ready to take
on a robot.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.150
Peter is revealed to be a fan of Stark’s,
so it makes sense he would want to attend

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.170
the event.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.840
And since Parker is a high-schooler in the
MCU, the age lines up as well.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.880
Obviously, Marvel couldn’t use Peter’s
name since they didn’t have the rights,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.690
but it’s nice to think in retrospect this
is what happened.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.690
Star Wars

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.020
It’s well documented that many Star Wars
fans hate Jar-Jar Binks.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.490
But what if the Gungan was a sinister being?

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.590
Some feel that Jar-Jar is actually a Sith
Lord co-conspiring with Palpatine to rule

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.750
the galaxy.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.280
Binks uses his outward appearance as a buffoon
as a ruse to mislead others, similar to Yoda

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.030
in The Empire Strikes Back.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.770
The theory also suggests that Jar-Jar used
a mind trick on the Senate when he proposed

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.100
Palpatine receive emergency powers, leading
to the formation of the Empire.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.460
There’s no denying it’s a fun concept,
but Disney isn’t going to touch Jar-Jar

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.380
with a 10 foot pole, so we’ll have no idea
if it’s true.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.380
Conclusion

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.380
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.050
Do these theories change the way you view
popular films?

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.610
Which ones are your favorites?
