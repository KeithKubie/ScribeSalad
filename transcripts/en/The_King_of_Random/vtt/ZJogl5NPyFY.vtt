00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Bottle! Look at the  bottle! It cracked it!

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.620
Whats up guys we're back I'm Grant Thompson ' The King Of Random' And I'm Lance Stewart.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.700
And today we are playing with science!

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.960
What are we doing today Lance?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360
I have no idea somethings going to explode, apparently.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.340
He has no idea, but you guys remember this thing we did a experiment a little while ago

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.780
where you asked us to make carbonated drinks with dry ice

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.280
and we did it and we used apple juice to turn it into that sparkling cider.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.720
and we did it and we used apple juice to turn it into that sparkling cider.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.340
which is amazing we kept the bottle for this experiment today.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.620
So here's how it's going to work, Lance my friend is going to take some water

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.500
We're going to put a little bit of water of each of these bottles here

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.600
We're also using this Nantucket Nectars from his friend Aiden

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.820
Who happily donated to the cause today

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.160
And we're just going to stick these things in the microwave for about 2 minutes

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.940
what that's going to do is let the water heat up until its boiling

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.340
We are going for Lance's we're going to create steam
the steam is going to fill the bottles

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.320
we're going to take it out the microwave
turn upside down and stick it into this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
bowl of water right here just to see
what happens let's check it out cool all

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.850
right Lance this is the part where we
put our gloves on for safety glasses on

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.940
for safety so the reason we're using two
different bottles is because of the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.930
shape and size of that obviously this is
a lot bigger the necks are about the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.650
same but we're going to see how they
react differently with the steam

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.860
starting off would be N and then
whatever juice this is we're just going

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.159
to pour a little bit of water in there
it doesn't take much because when water

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.479
turns to steam it increases in volume
dramatically now we're going to do is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.909
take this bottle we're going to stick it
in the microwave for two minutes we're

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.259
going to vaporize most of that water so
we do that next do it two minutes please

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.600
and you can just set the bottle on its
side our microwave already had like a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.009
little bit of destruction a little bit
of a mess unlike previous experiment put

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.970
it in there for two minutes and it put a
little ice in this bowl just to cool it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.060
down a little bit because the colder we
can get the water the faster the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.210
reaction is going to take place unless
is wondering what kind of reaction are

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.049
we talking about no idea what is going
to happen guess that's what we got to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.539
see going explode in my face probably
oh yeah I think that's ready so guys our

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.659
time is up what Lance is going to do now
is open the microwave he's going to grab

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.450
the bottle bring it over here pour out
any excess water so the bottle is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.229
completely empty then dunk it down below
the water line so it's underneath the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.069
ice hold it very firmly in place and
we're going to wait all right let's try

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:23.120
it out there you go perfect ready hold
it a little bit

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.319
whoa whoa it sucked all of it up that
was pretty cool that was quick

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.160
as the steam condensed the water went up
to fill the bottle I think we can make

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.290
it a little more dramatic so there's a
couple things we can do differently

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.800
let's do the same thing again but this
time we're not going to press it down to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.750
the bottom because when you have it
against the bottom it's going to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.330
restrict the flow yeah and second of all
I think it's gonna be a really good idea

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.530
to remove this label so we can exactly
see what's going it was literally just

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.769
like a complete vacuum homemade vacuum
cleaner

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.230
all right that should be enough time
let's go ahead and pull this thing out

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.680
so we're going for round two we've nuked
this bottle again it's full of steam

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.470
this time when we put the bottle down
into the water it's going to go just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.049
below the surface it's not going to
touch the bottom just going to hold it

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.230
in place let's try it out go for it
hot hot stuff hold it at the top here

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:19.920
there you go oh whoa that's so hot but
that is sick it takes a couple of

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.069
seconds but it just it completely sucks
it all off that's very cool I need to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.130
see how like filled the entire bottle
yeah it goes all the way to the edge so

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.940
that's the power of like how you can use
steam to create a vacuum so now that we

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.430
know the works of this bottle what do
you think would happen if we try it with

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.280
this bottle we get it to fill entirely
any difference do you think it would

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.709
fill entirely or do you think it will
fill like most of the way but not all

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.280
the way Dingle not fill at all this is
the tenth how much water we put in there

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.090
as well to begin with that's a good
question what if we only put a tiny bit

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.870
of water in there what's your prediction
if we want to put that much water in

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.170
there I still think it's gonna fill
entirely let's give it a try

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.270
okay so guys that last one was kind of
cool right I mean yeah you put the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.320
bottle in a syllabic water nothing super
dramatic lapses over here is like the

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.500
big deal like what are we doing is this
going to be a dramatic I don't know I

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.180
guess we're going to find out I'm
getting a hint that it might say perfect

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.630
alright here we go a moment of truth is
hot stuff okay we go three two one

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.220
oh we were going to sucked up the ice
we've had a couple ice cubes in there as

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.730
well that was quick
how fast was that that was really quick

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.340
that's a little bit more what I was
expecting guys so it seems like the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.610
longer you make these things the harder
it gets the quicker the reaction takes

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.860
place I mean look at that that jar went
from zero to full in point point zero

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.050
three six second we spin it we can get a
little corn a Doyle thing oh that's dope

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.140
stuff that's pretty sweet huh oh it was
that a little bit more way better

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.100
laughter worthy yeah a couple years ago
I had a friend called Darren Dyke come

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.340
over with a slow-motion camera we tried
this with one of these like gallon apple

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.850
juice containers we actually filmed it
in 4,500 frames per seconds we could see

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.720
what's happening and even at that frame
rate it happened so quickly we couldn't

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.620
see the transition point between when
water started and when it slows the

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.980
whole dark that is insane it literally
like what's happening is the steam in

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.520
here is contracting so fast that it's
sucking up the water which cools down

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.970
more steam it's like this
self-perpetuating cycle it's almost like

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.050
an explosive reaction so let's throw
this in microwave one more time for mr.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.590
Lapp Stuart I want to give you this
experience probably I feel he's gonna

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.800
suck it like it looked like it sucked
your hand all the way in yeah it was

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.950
like you got to do it you gotta hang on
to it tight cousins left yeah thanks for

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.980
right so the key it looks like it's to
put it in the microwave a little bit

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.450
longer we're doing this one for four
minutes to get that water superheated

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.550
you know this stuff getting ready when
the bottle starts jumping in the

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.260
microwave like the water starts
exploding

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.080
yeah you can hear it rolling in there
very very dangerous situation it's a

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.220
very very good sign because that's
exactly what we're looking for I add

00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:04.619
boiling you can see it popping off yeah
steam three two one let's do it

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.509
okay
the whole thing's heard like it pull at

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.740
news you see you shot backwards bull
jumped over it's a good thing I didn't

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.470
step back or else I wouldn't be able to
go inside in public with any kind of

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.490
dignity because oh my gosh I was like
all over waist level there it's dripping

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.919
everywhere I gotta clean this all the
neighbors down below or like what the

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.030
heck it's raining we're going to do one
more experiment of this with a slo-mo

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:39.650
for you guys let's see how this look
here we go oh look at the bottle look at

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.669
the bottle look at the bottle exactly
well I wasn't strong enough to hold it

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.210
and they just like slammed it down on
the counter and busted okay well we're

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.940
going to call that good because I'm not
doing that again yeah the whole bottle

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:59.240
is crap look at that Wow okay you could
just see the steam rising out wow I was

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.940
not strong enough to hold that it
literally ripped the bottle right out of

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.650
my hand slammed it into the countertop
and busted it that's been sane so

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.229
there's one of those experiments you try
at home no this is one of those

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.370
experiments you try Lance's home okay
well guys big thanks to Lance Stewart

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.310
for letting us crash this place today
and try a little mad science out here on

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.400
Vine Street and you can go check out on
the links down in the description I'll

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.220
put a link he does daily vlogs and he's
always getting up to some pretty crazy

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.970
stuff what do you want these guys to
know about you and so for example me and

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.870
grant has filled our bodies with gasses
and see how they reacted our body and

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.159
the one made my voice like Cooper crazy
it was almost like demonic sounding oh

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:37.520
yeah it's can go check the link in the
description go check out lamp store he's

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.250
got good times for you and thanks again
for joining us for this experiment guys

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.240
we'll be looking for you in the next one
doc you then pouring water looks just

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.680
science when you're wearing gloves and safety glasses right
