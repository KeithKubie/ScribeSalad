as Mark would tell you I I tend to miss

01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320
as Mark would tell you I I tend to miss
 

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.750

read what I'm reading so therefore I'm

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760
read what I'm reading so therefore I'm
 

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.880
read what I'm reading so therefore I'm
not sure it's Pilate or me that I'm

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:39.890
not sure it's Pilate or me that I'm
 

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:44.920
not sure it's Pilate or me that I'm
drawing but doesn't matter it's a way of

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:44.930
drawing but doesn't matter it's a way of
 

01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:47.560
drawing but doesn't matter it's a way of
looking at the work I want to suggest

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:47.570
looking at the work I want to suggest
 

01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:53.260
looking at the work I want to suggest
that that I believe that all

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:53.270
that that I believe that all
 

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:56.500
that that I believe that all

that issue that there are no agreed-upon

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:00.290
that issue that there are no agreed-upon

that issue that there are no agreed-upon
sign systems that you can look at things

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360
sign systems that you can look at things
 

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.010
sign systems that you can look at things
as as Guido did or mark did in one way

01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:06.020
as as Guido did or mark did in one way
 

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.410
as as Guido did or mark did in one way
or another way you can see battle

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:08.420
or another way you can see battle
 

01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:13.120

formations you can see mutations you can

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:13.130
formations you can see mutations you can
 

01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:15.580
formations you can see mutations you can
see whatever you want to see and I

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:15.590
see whatever you want to see and I
 

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:21.100
see whatever you want to see and I
actually believe that's true and how do

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:21.110
actually believe that's true and how do
 

01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:42.830
actually believe that's true and how do
I get the first slide

01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840
 

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.030
this is the corner of the Palazzo

01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040
this is the corner of the Palazzo
 

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.780

Deucalion orbino and the reason why I
 

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:55.720
Deucalion orbino and the reason why I
showed you I think is a an idea of a

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:55.730
showed you I think is a an idea of a
 

01:24:55.730 --> 01:25:00.830
showed you I think is a an idea of a
formal resolution to a a corner where

01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840
formal resolution to a a corner where
 

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.810
formal resolution to a a corner where
you can see the doubling of the columns

01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:04.820
you can see the doubling of the columns
 

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:08.839
you can see the doubling of the columns
the flattening of the columns and you

01:25:08.839 --> 01:25:08.849
the flattening of the columns and you
 

01:25:08.849 --> 01:25:15.680
the flattening of the columns and you
clearly read corner and and on to the

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:15.690

of all a very strange courtyard because

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:30.270
of all a very strange courtyard because
 

01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:33.410
of all a very strange courtyard because
it's a for opening courtyard and there

01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420
it's a for opening courtyard and there
 

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.350
it's a for opening courtyard and there
very few with a column in the center

very few with a column in the center
 

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.939
very few with a column in the center
which is a no-no and in all of the books

01:25:40.939 --> 01:25:40.949
which is a no-no and in all of the books
 

01:25:40.949 --> 01:25:45.430
which is a no-no and in all of the books
of history that we know about that

basically I would call this a a virtual

01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:50.580
basically I would call this a a virtual
 

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.629
basically I would call this a a virtual
court in the sense that Bramante had a

01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639
court in the sense that Bramante had a
 

01:25:53.639 --> 01:25:56.240

pre-existing scheme it didn't fit into

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:56.250
pre-existing scheme it didn't fit into
 

01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.790
pre-existing scheme it didn't fit into
the site and therefore you get the

01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800
the site and therefore you get the
 

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.430
the site and therefore you get the
strange conditions of of a corner where

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440
strange conditions of of a corner where
 

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.700
strange conditions of of a corner where
we have this rosette left over from

we have this rosette left over from
 

01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:12.229
we have this rosette left over from
columns so that I think that they're

very different the courtyard and orbino
 

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:19.250
very different the courtyard and orbino
is a formal resolution and the courtyard

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260
is a formal resolution and the courtyard
 

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:22.430

what I call gasket space the circulation
 

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:20.180
what I call gasket space the circulation
space and then the compression of this

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:20.190
space and then the compression of this
 

01:32:20.190 --> 01:32:31.040

compressed this layer is behind the wall
 

01:33:36.869 --> 01:33:41.509
compressed this layer is behind the wall
of the garden and you see how this would

be the layers of this virtual villa and
 

01:33:46.889 --> 01:33:55.250
be the layers of this virtual villa and
how they then become compressed as the a

the C being the only space left as it
were intact and then again the C space

01:34:10.479 --> 01:34:10.489
were intact and then again the C space
 

01:34:10.489 --> 01:34:15.109
were intact and then again the C space
being acted upon from both the front and

being acted upon from both the front and
 

01:34:15.119 --> 01:34:18.529
being acted upon from both the front and
rear causing what would be normally a

oval or more circular space to be a
 

01:34:24.899 --> 01:34:30.229
oval or more circular space to be a
compressed lozenge shape and one sees it

in that there see this I feel for me is
 

01:34:39.989 --> 01:34:44.029
in that there see this I feel for me is
a very useful exercise because I can

very serious discussion they are
interesting and illuminating too

was the Logitech Capitano and now I find

01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:46.780
was the Logitech Capitano and now I find
 

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:49.170
was the Logitech Capitano and now I find
out it's the low Judah copy tomahto and

out it's the low Judah copy tomahto and
 

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:51.660
out it's the low Judah copy tomahto and
I never heard that before in my life

what we call the front was a larger
 

01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:20.290
what we call the front was a larger

can't even remember what that is all I

can't even remember what that is all I
 

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:26.380
can't even remember what that is all I
can remember is that corner is something

I say to my students hey see that that's

01:54:29.709 --> 01:54:29.719
I say to my students hey see that that's
 

01:54:29.719 --> 01:54:33.310
I say to my students hey see that that's
architecture and take a look at it I

01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320
architecture and take a look at it I
 

01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.979

I don't believe whether they could tell
 

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.900
I don't believe whether they could tell
me what the function was would help them

that corner for me is is one of the
 

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.970
that corner for me is is one of the
great corners in architecture and I know

01:54:51.970 --> 01:54:51.980
great corners in architecture and I know
 

01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:54.790
great corners in architecture and I know
there's a functional reason for it to be

there's a functional reason for it to be

there's a functional reason for it to be
that way but nevertheless the the magic

that way but nevertheless the the magic
 

01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:59.840
that way but nevertheless the the magic
is still

part relates you what's interesting is

01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719
part relates you what's interesting is
 

01:58:16.719 --> 01:58:20.220
part relates you what's interesting is
is there are five part relationship from

01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:20.230
is there are five part relationship from
 

01:58:20.230 --> 01:58:23.419
is there are five part relationship from

squares yes see that's what I mean it's

01:58:27.450 --> 01:58:27.460

not it's not it's not really it is it is
 

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:33.090
not it's not it's not really it is it is
actually both nine and twenty five yeah

01:58:33.090 --> 01:58:33.100
actually both nine and twenty five yeah
 

01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:35.250

watching I I think I think that's a

really crucial question but I I think

02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719
really crucial question but I I think
 

02:09:08.719 --> 02:09:11.680
really crucial question but I I think
that that after a few more we should

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:11.690
that that after a few more we should
 

02:09:11.690 --> 02:09:14.440
that that after a few more we should
take that up so it's a long answer I

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:14.450
take that up so it's a long answer I
 

02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:15.700
take that up so it's a long answer I
think it would be a different answer for

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:15.710
think it would be a different answer for
 

02:09:15.710 --> 02:09:18.910
think it would be a different answer for
each of us but I think it's a it's a

how you perceive the unit and from where
and how it would reposition to use that

and how it would reposition to use that
 

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:31.780

think that's a crucial question for all
 

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:37.030

couple more questions so Frederic yeah

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:45.130
 

02:09:45.130 --> 02:09:47.410
you mentioned that you were looking for

you mentioned that you were looking for
 

02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:55.750
you mentioned that you were looking for
this inside and I think we know your

02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760
this inside and I think we know your
 

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.600
this inside and I think we know your
desire for looking for pleasure of the

02:09:58.600 --> 02:09:58.610
desire for looking for pleasure of the
 

02:09:58.610 --> 02:10:01.200

02:10:01.210 --> 02:10:04.210
mind that is built within the
environment and do you think that

02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:04.220
environment and do you think that
 

02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:06.610
