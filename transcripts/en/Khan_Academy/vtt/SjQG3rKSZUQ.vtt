00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.370
We know what a chemical equation
is and we've learned

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.530
how to balance it.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.340
Now, we're ready to learn
about stoichiometry.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.320
And this is an ultra fancy word
that often makes people

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.850
think it's difficult.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.640
But it's really just the study
or the calculation of the

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.310
relationships between
the different

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.530
molecules in a reaction.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.360
This is the actual definition
that Wikipedia gives,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.790
stoichiometry is the calculation
of quantitative,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.790
or measurable, relationships
of the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.760
reactants and the products.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.980
And you're going to see in
chemistry, sometimes people

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.560
use the word reagents.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.880
For most of our purposes you can
use the word reagents and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.170
reactants interchangeably.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.340
They're both the reactants
in a reaction.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.830
The reagents are sometimes for
special types of reactions

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.310
where you want to throw a
reagent in and see if

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.070
something happens.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.980
And see if your belief about
that substance is true or

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.620
things like that.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.100
But for our purposes
a reagent and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.790
reactant is the same thing.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.390
So it's a relationship between
the reactants and the products

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.050
in a balanced chemical
equation.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.670
So if we're given an unbalanced
one, we know how to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.735
get to the balanced point.

00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:05.410
A balanced chemical equation.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.200
So let's do some
stoichiometry.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.660
Just so we get practice
balancing equations, I'm

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.860
always going to start with
unbalanced equations.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.483
Let's say we have iron
three oxide.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.590
Two iron atoms with three
oxygen atoms.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.180
Plus aluminum, Al.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:40.070
And it yields Al2
O3 plus iron.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.200
So remember when we're doing
stoichiometry first of all, we

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.540
want to deal with balanced
equations.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.250
A lot of stoichiometry problems
will give you a

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.030
balanced equation.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.090
But I think it's good practice
to actually balance the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.825
equations ourselves.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:50.970
So let's try to balance
this one.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.240
We have two iron atoms here
in this iron three oxide.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.750
How many iron atoms do we have
on the right hand side?

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.570
We only have one.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.430
So let's multiply this
by 2 right here.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.920
All right, oxygen, we have
three on this side.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.479
We have three oxygens
on that side.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.740
That looks good.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.480
Aluminum, on the left hand
side we only have

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240
one aluminum atom.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.540
On the right hand side we have
two aluminum atoms. So we have

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.700
to put a 2 here.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.260
And we have balanced
this equation.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.670
So now we're ready to do
some stoichiometry.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.450
There's not just one type of
stoichiometry problem, but

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.550
they're all along the lines of,
if I give you x grams of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.250
this how many grams of aluminum
do I need to make

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.320
this reaction happen?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.480
Or if I give you y grams of this
molecule and z grams of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.680
this molecule which one's
going to run out first?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.610
That's all stoichiometry.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.460
And we'll actually do those
exact two types of problems in

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.680
this video.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:00.010
So let's say that we were given
85 grams of the iron

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.260
three oxide.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.120
So my question to you
is how many grams of

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.370
aluminum do we need?

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.800
Well you look at the equation,
you immediately

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.150
see the mole ratio.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.190
So for every mole of this, so
for every one atom we use of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.840
iron three oxide we need
two aluminums.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.390
So what we need to do is figure
out how many moles of

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.420
this molecule there are in 85
grams. And then we need to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.930
have twice as many moles
of aluminum.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.910
Because for every mole of the
iron three oxide, we have two

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.800
moles of aluminum.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.750
And we're just looking at the
coefficients, we're just

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.850
looking at the numbers.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.910
One molecule of iron three
oxide combines with two

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.750
molecule of aluminum to make
this reaction happen.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.380
So lets first figure out how
many moles 85 grams are.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.620
So what's the atomic mass
or the mass number

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.210
of this entire molecule?

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.620
Let me do it down here.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.430
So we have two irons
and three oxygens.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.220
So let me go down and figure out
the atomic masses of iron

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.610
and oxygen.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.089
So iron is right here, 55.85.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.420
I think it's fair enough
to round to 56.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.770
Let's say we're dealing with
the version of iron, the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.890
isotope of iron, that
has 30 neutrons.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.990
So it has an atomic
mass number of 56.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.810
So iron has 56 atomic
mass number.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.500
And then oxygen, we already
know, is 16.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.240
Iron was 56.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:56.310
This mass is going to be 2
times 56 plus 3 times 16.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.460
We can do that in our heads.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.180
But this isn't a math
video, so I'll get

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.430
the calculator out.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:16.760
2 times 56 plus 3 times
16 is equal to 160.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.120
Is that right?

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.960
That's 48 plus 112,
right, 160.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.450
So one molecule of iron three
oxide is going to be 160

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.410
atomic mass units.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:41.620
So one mole or 6.02 times 10
to the 23 molecules of iron

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:55.800
oxide is going to have
a mass of 160 grams.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.820
So in our reaction we said we're
starting off with 85

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.510
grams of iron oxide.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.010
How many moles is that?

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.430
Well 85 grams of iron
three oxide is equal

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.510
to 85 over 160 moles.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:21.240
So that's equal to, 85 divided
by 160 equals 0.53125.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.200
Equals 0.53 moles.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.730
So everything we've done so far
in this green and light

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.410
blue, we figured out how
many moles 85 grams of

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.530
iron three oxide is.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.310
And we figured out
it's 0.53 moles.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.320
Because a full mole would
have been 160 grams. But

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.680
we only have 85.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.540
So it's point 0.53 moles.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.890
And we know from this balanced
equation, that for every mole

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.780
of iron three oxide we
have, we need to have

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.100
two moles of aluminum.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.340
So if we have 0.53 moles of the
iron molecule, iron three

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.540
oxide, then we're going to need
twice as many aluminum.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:06.540
So we're going to need 1.06
moles of aluminum.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.140
I just took 0.53 times 2.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.510
Because the ratio is 1:2.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.150
For every molecule of this, we
need two molecules of that.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.810
So for every mole of this, we
need two moles of this.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.210
If we have 0.53 moles, you
multiply that by 2, and you

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.360
have 1.06 moles of aluminum.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.330
All right, so we just have to
figure out how many grams is a

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.240
mole of aluminum and then
multiply that times 1.06 and

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.280
we're done.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.680
So aluminum, or aluminium as
some of our friends across the

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.700
pond might say.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.400
Aluminium, actually
I enjoy that more.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.070
Aluminium has the atomic
weight or the

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.800
weighted average is 26.98.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.420
But let's just say that the
aluminium that we're dealing

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.120
with has a mass of 27
atomic mass units.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.650
So one aluminum is 27
atomic mass units.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:12.560
So one mole of aluminium is
going to be 27 grams. Or 6.02

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.295
times 10 to 23 aluminium atoms
is going to be 27 grams. So if

00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:21.970
we need 1.06 moles, how many
is that going to be?

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:31.810
So 1.06 moles of aluminium is
equal to 1.06 times 27 grams.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.060
And what is that?

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:41.090
1.06 times 27.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.809
Equals 28.62.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:51.330
So we need 28.62 grams of
aluminium, I won't write the

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.560
whole thing there, in order to
essentially use up our 85

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.720
grams of the iron three oxide.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.570
And if we had more than 28.62
grams of aluminium, then

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.600
they'll be left over after
this reaction happens.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.660
Assuming we keep mixing it
nicely and the whole reaction

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.540
happens all the way.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.810
And we'll talk more about
that in the future.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.950
And in that situation where we
have more than 28.63 grams of

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.620
aluminium, then this molecule
will be the limiting reagent.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.710
Because we had more than enough
of this, so this is

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.100
what's going to limit
the amount of this

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.090
process from happening.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.770
If we have less than 28.63 grams
of, I'll start saying

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.260
aluminum, then the aluminum will
be the limiting reagent,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.500
because then we wouldn't be able
to use all the 85 grams

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.610
of our iron molecule, or our
iron three oxide molecule.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.875
Anyway, I don't want to confuse
you in the end with

00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:50.640
that limiting reagents.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.400
In the next video, we'll do
a whole problem devoted to

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.030
limiting reagents.
