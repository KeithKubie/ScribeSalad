00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Before describing it mathematically, I'm going to describe it

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
as an analogy to paint mixing, and this analogy comes from Simon Singh

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
from "The Code Book," which is a really fun book about the history of cryptography.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have our usual suspects, Alice and Bob, that want to establish a shared key,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and they're going to do this by first picking a public color.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's say they both like yellow.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And they'll start with cans of identical yellow paint.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Both Alice and Bob start with a can of yellow paint.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then each party will pick their own secret color.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's say Alice picks a greenish color,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and Bob picks a purplish color.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then what they do is mix their secret colors with the public color.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They're going to mix those two, and the green and yellow

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
will make some ugly green color,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and Bob will do the same thing, mixing the yellow and purple

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to get some new ugly color.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
At this stage, they change colors.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Alice gives Bob the ugly green color that she got by mixing her secret color with yellow.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Bob gives Alice the ugly pinkish color he got by mixing yellow with his secret color.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Once they've received the other party's colors,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
they mix their secret color with the other party's mixed color.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
At this stage, both parties should have the same color.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Alice mixed her green with the pink that came from yellow and Bob's secret color,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and that will give some new color probably uglier than the grey that I'm drawing,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but Bob will get the same thing because Bob is mixing the yellow,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Alice's secret color, and Bob's secret color and getting the same color.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This gets them the same color. They've mixed the same 3 colors together.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It would be secure if someone who knew yellow

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and could intercept these 2 transmissions

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
couldn't guess the secret colors.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This assumes that paint unmixing is impossible.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Probably not a very good assumption, and certainly not a practical way to actually do this.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What we want is to do the same thing with mathematics.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is also the main operation we used in symmetric ciphers.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
XOR = + mod 2.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
To do key agreement, though, plus is not going to be the main operation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The main operation we'll use is multiplication.
