fantastic now if you've ever been
interested in data compression if you've

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220
interested in data compression if you've
 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.410
interested in data compression if you've
ever tried to make an attempt to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
ever tried to make an attempt to
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.270
ever tried to make an attempt to
understand the algorithms but found that

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280
understand the algorithms but found that
 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.400
understand the algorithms but found that
the math is really weird or it's too

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410
the math is really weird or it's too
 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.020

have actually got together and we've
 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.830
have actually got together and we've
actually written a data compression book

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840
actually written a data compression book
 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.660
actually written a data compression book
and we took a different approach to it

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670
and we took a different approach to it
 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.749
and we took a different approach to it
we threw out all the math all of that

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
we threw out all the math all of that
 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.759

the other side of things is all of the

will go very very deep into that subject

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720
will go very very deep into that subject
 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.270
will go very very deep into that subject
so make sure you stick around for that

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280
so make sure you stick around for that

one thing you notice here though is that
images actually show up in both of these

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590
images actually show up in both of these
 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.800
images actually show up in both of these
categories and that's why we're focusing

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810
categories and that's why we're focusing
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.060
categories and that's why we're focusing
on our images today because quite

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070
on our images today because quite
 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.610
on our images today because quite
frankly images are awesome right round

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620
frankly images are awesome right round
 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.520
frankly images are awesome right round
of applause for images yeah

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530
 
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.980
 
I promise you I will ask you to applaud

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990
I promise you I will ask you to applaud
 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.949
I promise you I will ask you to applaud
weirder and weirder stuff as the talk it

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959
weirder and weirder stuff as the talk it
 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.880
weirder and weirder stuff as the talk it
was time okay like who likes gummy bears

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890
was time okay like who likes gummy bears
 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.740
was time okay like who likes gummy bears
yeah there we go we have to have an

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750
yeah there we go we have to have an
 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.970
yeah there we go we have to have an
understanding as an audience in a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980
understanding as an audience in a
 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.740
understanding as an audience in a
presenter that's how this works right

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
presenter that's how this works right
 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.990
presenter that's how this works right
the images are fantastic we use them in

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000
the images are fantastic we use them in
 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.449
the images are fantastic we use them in
our applications we convey emotion and

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459
our applications we convey emotion and
 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.580
our applications we convey emotion and
power in information and all this other

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590
power in information and all this other
 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.530
power in information and all this other
great stuff but images also have a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540
great stuff but images also have a
 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.600
great stuff but images also have a
problem is that they're easy to bloat

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610
problem is that they're easy to bloat
 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.820
problem is that they're easy to bloat
they're easy to get too big and too many

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830
they're easy to get too big and too many
 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.800
they're easy to get too big and too many
resolutions and too many pixels and that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810
resolutions and too many pixels and that
 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.320
resolutions and too many pixels and that
causes problems for your users because

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330
causes problems for your users because
 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.630
causes problems for your users because
bigger images take longer to download

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640
bigger images take longer to download
 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.670
bigger images take longer to download
which means that there's more bits on

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680
which means that there's more bits on
 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.030
which means that there's more bits on
the wire

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
the wire
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.490
the wire
which cost your users more money to

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500
which cost your users more money to
 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.930
which cost your users more money to
download them because they're on metered

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940
download them because they're on metered
 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.150
download them because they're on metered
plans and their cellular radio is on

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160
plans and their cellular radio is on
 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.220

longer downloading the larger images

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230
longer downloading the larger images
 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.770
longer downloading the larger images
you're eating their battery more all of

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780
you're eating their battery more all of
 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.480
you're eating their battery more all of
these little things add up when you

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490
these little things add up when you
 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.580
these little things add up when you
start bringing these images down which

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590
start bringing these images down which
 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.980
start bringing these images down which
is why making sure that your images are

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990
is why making sure that your images are
 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.719
is why making sure that your images are
compressed as good and as small as

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
compressed as good and as small as
 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.120
compressed as good and as small as
possible is super important to make sure

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130
possible is super important to make sure
 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.800
possible is super important to make sure
that your users are having the best

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810
that your users are having the best
 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.680
that your users are having the best
experience and in general there's a lot

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690
experience and in general there's a lot
 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.969
experience and in general there's a lot
of different things you could do with

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979
of different things you could do with
 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.040
of different things you could do with
images but as Android developers there's

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050
images but as Android developers there's
 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.680
images but as Android developers there's
really only four data formats we care

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690
really only four data formats we care
 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.760
really only four data formats we care
about PNG s

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770
about PNG s
 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.760
about PNG s
vector drawables JPEGs and WebP II now

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770
vector drawables JPEGs and WebP II now
 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.260
vector drawables JPEGs and WebP II now
the rest of the talk that we're going to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270
the rest of the talk that we're going to
 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.090
the rest of the talk that we're going to
go into today is gonna be opening up

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100
go into today is gonna be opening up
 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.430
go into today is gonna be opening up
each one of these formats taking a look

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440
each one of these formats taking a look
 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.320
each one of these formats taking a look
at how it works internally and how you

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330
at how it works internally and how you
 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.409
at how it works internally and how you
can squeeze out every bit of data from

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419
can squeeze out every bit of data from
 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.580
can squeeze out every bit of data from
these things possible sound good

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590
these things possible sound good
 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.360
these things possible sound good
sound good don't worry you'll get the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370
sound good don't worry you'll get the
 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.130
sound good don't worry you'll get the
hang of the applause cues they they took

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140
hang of the applause cues they they took
 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.510
hang of the applause cues they they took
down the sign that I asked for later

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520
down the sign that I asked for later
 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.200
down the sign that I asked for later
that's okay

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210
that's okay
 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.400
that's okay
all right so let's start at the top with

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410
all right so let's start at the top with
 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.460
all right so let's start at the top with
PNG files PNG s have to be one of the

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470
PNG files PNG s have to be one of the
 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.070
PNG files PNG s have to be one of the
most amazing formats in terms of Android

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080
most amazing formats in terms of Android
 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.779
most amazing formats in terms of Android
development they've been here as long as

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789
development they've been here as long as
 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.170
development they've been here as long as
anybody has seen they provide amazing

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180
anybody has seen they provide amazing
 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.029
anybody has seen they provide amazing
quality and actually pretty good data

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039
quality and actually pretty good data
 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.620
quality and actually pretty good data
compression so let's figure out what's

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630
compression so let's figure out what's
 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.540
compression so let's figure out what's
going on under the hood so let's say we

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550
going on under the hood so let's say we
 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.610
going on under the hood so let's say we
have an image the way PNG compression

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620
have an image the way PNG compression
 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.550
have an image the way PNG compression
works is that we take every row of

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560
works is that we take every row of
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.370
works is that we take every row of
pixels in that image one at a time we

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380
pixels in that image one at a time we
 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.469
pixels in that image one at a time we
process each row individually and what

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479
process each row individually and what
 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.090
process each row individually and what
we do is we apply something called a

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100
we do is we apply something called a
 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.219
we do is we apply something called a
filter to it now the filter itself is

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229
filter to it now the filter itself is
 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.190
filter to it now the filter itself is
basically a modified Delta processor

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200
basically a modified Delta processor
 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.360
basically a modified Delta processor
right so basically it's going to try to

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370
right so basically it's going to try to
 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.399
right so basically it's going to try to
subtract the current pixel in the row

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409
subtract the current pixel in the row
 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.170
subtract the current pixel in the row
from the previous pixels of the one

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180
from the previous pixels of the one
 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.270
from the previous pixels of the one
and do all this weird math the point of

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280
and do all this weird math the point of
 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.060
and do all this weird math the point of
the filter is simple it wants to produce

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070
the filter is simple it wants to produce
 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.490
the filter is simple it wants to produce
the most number of zeros and duplicate

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500
the most number of zeros and duplicate
 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.990
the most number of zeros and duplicate
values possible that's it

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000
values possible that's it
 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.840
values possible that's it
that's all it wants to do the output of

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850
that's all it wants to do the output of
 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.350
that's all it wants to do the output of
that is then fed into a very common

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360
that is then fed into a very common
 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360
that is then fed into a very common
super everywhere encoding system called

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370
super everywhere encoding system called
 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.469
super everywhere encoding system called
deflate anybody familiar with deflate

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479
deflate anybody familiar with deflate
 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.070
deflate anybody familiar with deflate
and get him a t-shirt that's right we'll

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080
and get him a t-shirt that's right we'll
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.620
and get him a t-shirt that's right we'll
get to you later

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630
 
 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.700
 
deflate is actually comprised of two

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710
deflate is actually comprised of two
 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.320
deflate is actually comprised of two
main compression algorithms the first

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330
main compression algorithms the first
 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.540
main compression algorithms the first
one is called lz77 if you've watched my

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550
one is called lz77 if you've watched my
 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.370
one is called lz77 if you've watched my
compressor head video then you'll know

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380
compressor head video then you'll know
 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.310
compressor head video then you'll know
that lz77 is a dictionary algorithm that

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320
that lz77 is a dictionary algorithm that
 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.980
that lz77 is a dictionary algorithm that
tries to match runs of duplicate

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990
tries to match runs of duplicate
 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.950
tries to match runs of duplicate
characters multiple times in a stream of

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960
characters multiple times in a stream of
 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.290
characters multiple times in a stream of
data the output of that is in toss to a

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300
data the output of that is in toss to a
 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.850
data the output of that is in toss to a
Huffman encoder which is a statistical

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860
Huffman encoder which is a statistical
 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.159
Huffman encoder which is a statistical
encoder if you've ever been to cs101

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169
encoder if you've ever been to cs101
 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.839
encoder if you've ever been to cs101
you've probably dealt with Huffman in

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:45.849
you've probably dealt with Huffman in
 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:47.460
you've probably dealt with Huffman in
some form now this is again it's done on

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470
some form now this is again it's done on
 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.350
some form now this is again it's done on
a single line and the output of deflate

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360
a single line and the output of deflate
 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.870
a single line and the output of deflate
is then picked out to disk now what

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880
is then picked out to disk now what
 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.839
is then picked out to disk now what
these two stages mean is very important

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849
these two stages mean is very important
 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.839
these two stages mean is very important
in areas of your image where there's

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849
in areas of your image where there's
 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:59.879
in areas of your image where there's
very similar pixels or there's very

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889
very similar pixels or there's very
 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:01.920
very similar pixels or there's very
there's a lot of duplicate pixels that

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930
there's a lot of duplicate pixels that
 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.930
there's a lot of duplicate pixels that
filtering stage is going to produce a

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940
filtering stage is going to produce a
 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.820
filtering stage is going to produce a
lot of zeros it's gonna produce a lot of

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830
lot of zeros it's gonna produce a lot of
 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.100
lot of zeros it's gonna produce a lot of
duplicate symbols which means the lz77

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110
duplicate symbols which means the lz77
 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.779
duplicate symbols which means the lz77
and the deflate stage is going to come

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789
and the deflate stage is going to come
 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:11.189
and the deflate stage is going to come
through and basically make that stuff

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199
through and basically make that stuff
 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.830
through and basically make that stuff
disappear so areas of similarity are

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840
disappear so areas of similarity are
 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.810
disappear so areas of similarity are
going to get great compression and we're

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820
going to get great compression and we're
 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.700
going to get great compression and we're
however areas of noise where there's not

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710
however areas of noise where there's not
 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.020
however areas of noise where there's not
a lot of similar pixels where there's

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030
a lot of similar pixels where there's
 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.640
a lot of similar pixels where there's
different colors that may not be a joint

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650
different colors that may not be a joint
 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.050
different colors that may not be a joint
to each other are actually gonna have

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060
to each other are actually gonna have
 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.210
to each other are actually gonna have
worse compression and that's what you

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220
worse compression and that's what you
 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.219
worse compression and that's what you
get with this trade-off of the filtering

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:26.229
get with this trade-off of the filtering
 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:28.939
get with this trade-off of the filtering
stage with the deflate stage right now

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:28.949
stage with the deflate stage right now
 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.610
stage with the deflate stage right now
with this in mind we can obviously see a

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620
with this in mind we can obviously see a
 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.710
with this in mind we can obviously see a
couple places that PNG s can be

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720
couple places that PNG s can be
 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.810
couple places that PNG s can be
optimized a little bit more right the

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:36.820
optimized a little bit more right the
 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.730
optimized a little bit more right the
first of course is less input colors if

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:38.740
first of course is less input colors if
 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.920
first of course is less input colors if
we've got less input colors coming into

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930
we've got less input colors coming into
 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.260
we've got less input colors coming into
the filtering stage that means that

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.270
the filtering stage that means that
 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.640
the filtering stage that means that
we're gonna have less unique colors

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:44.650
we're gonna have less unique colors
 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.899
we're gonna have less unique colors
coming out and we're gonna get better

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:45.909
coming out and we're gonna get better
 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:47.820
coming out and we're gonna get better
compression the other thing is actually

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.830

smarter filtering I won't get into it

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:49.659
smarter filtering I won't get into it
 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:51.540
smarter filtering I won't get into it
right now there's a different post on it

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:51.550
right now there's a different post on it
 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.740
right now there's a different post on it
but there's like five different

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750
but there's like five different
 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.300
but there's like five different
filtering modes that the encoder can

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.310
filtering modes that the encoder can
 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.860
filtering modes that the encoder can
choose on and all that other stuff and

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:55.870
choose on and all that other stuff and
 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.710
choose on and all that other stuff and
there's a lot of math and accelerations

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720
there's a lot of math and accelerations
 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.300
there's a lot of math and accelerations
that go into finding that in a way

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310
that go into finding that in a way
 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.620
that go into finding that in a way
that's not going to take ten years to

that's not going to take ten years to
 

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.779
that's not going to take ten years to
compute it the other thing is a better

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:03.789

deflate algorithm I believe

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199
deflate algorithm I believe
 

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:07.050
deflate algorithm I believe
deflate isn't the best version of

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.060
deflate isn't the best version of
 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.790

that's actually a tricky one that I'll

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:16.539
that's actually a tricky one that I'll
 

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.450
that's actually a tricky one that I'll
get to in a minute but I know what

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:18.460
get to in a minute but I know what
 

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.800
get to in a minute but I know what
you're saying like hey wait a minute all

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:19.810
you're saying like hey wait a minute all

of that stuff should be happening for me

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.180
of that stuff should be happening for me
 

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.640
of that stuff should be happening for me
right I mean there's this really cool

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.650
right I mean there's this really cool
 

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.529

this should be doing all that for you
 

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.860
this should be doing all that for you
right it should be crunching your pngs

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:34.870
right it should be crunching your pngs
 

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.659

point out that while the AAP tool is

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:49.750
point out that while the AAP tool is
 

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.840
point out that while the AAP tool is
there to actually try to make your PNG

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:51.850
there to actually try to make your PNG
 

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.019
there to actually try to make your PNG
file smaller it doesn't do everything it

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:55.029
file smaller it doesn't do everything it
 

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:57.449
file smaller it doesn't do everything it
could a apt tool does three things

00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:57.459
could a apt tool does three things
 

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:59.550
could a apt tool does three things
specifically no more no less

the first thing it does is analyze your

00:09:01.319 --> 00:09:01.329
the first thing it does is analyze your
 

00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:03.509
the first thing it does is analyze your
PNG files to see whether or not you're

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519
PNG files to see whether or not you're
 

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:06.750
PNG files to see whether or not you're
only using grayscale colors so for

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760
only using grayscale colors so for
 

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.310
only using grayscale colors so for
example if you're red green blue

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320
example if you're red green blue
 

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.380
example if you're red green blue
channels are all the same color it will

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:10.390
channels are all the same color it will
 

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.389
channels are all the same color it will
actually make your entire image into

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399
actually make your entire image into
 

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.780
actually make your entire image into
single 8-bit alpha Channel that's it

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:15.790
single 8-bit alpha Channel that's it
 

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.730
single 8-bit alpha Channel that's it
goes right down to grayscale the second

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:17.740
goes right down to grayscale the second
 

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.810
goes right down to grayscale the second
thing it will look for is whether or not

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:18.820
thing it will look for is whether or not
 

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.490
thing it will look for is whether or not
you're actually using your transparency

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:20.500
you're actually using your transparency
 

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.319
you're actually using your transparency
channel if you've got a fully opaque

00:09:22.319 --> 00:09:22.329
channel if you've got a fully opaque
 

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:24.150
channel if you've got a fully opaque
image that's not using any transparency

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160
image that's not using any transparency
 

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.680
image that's not using any transparency
bits it'll actually get rid of that

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:25.690
bits it'll actually get rid of that
 

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.480
bits it'll actually get rid of that
entire channel and save it out to be

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.490
entire channel and save it out to be
 

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.400
entire channel and save it out to be
smaller and the final thing and this is

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:29.410
smaller and the final thing and this is
 

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.050
smaller and the final thing and this is
this is the one that's pretty awesome

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.060
this is the one that's pretty awesome
 

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.910
this is the one that's pretty awesome
it'll actually scan your entire image

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920
it'll actually scan your entire image
 

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.040
it'll actually scan your entire image
and determine whether or not you're

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.050
and determine whether or not you're
 

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.139
and determine whether or not you're
using 256 unique colors if you're using

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:40.149
using 256 unique colors if you're using
 

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:42.900
using 256 unique colors if you're using
256 unique colors it'll save your image

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:42.910
256 unique colors it'll save your image
 

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.759
256 unique colors it'll save your image
in a piloted format which all basically

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:46.769
in a piloted format which all basically
 

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:49.769
in a piloted format which all basically
decreases the size by some insane amount

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:49.779
decreases the size by some insane amount
 

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:52.110
decreases the size by some insane amount
right basically all of the 32 bit per

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120
right basically all of the 32 bit per
 

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.569
right basically all of the 32 bit per
pixel data gets quantized into a little

00:09:54.569 --> 00:09:54.579
pixel data gets quantized into a little
 

00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:55.949
pixel data gets quantized into a little
table like that that we call a pallet

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959
table like that that we call a pallet
 

00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:57.900
table like that that we call a pallet
and it's replaced with an 8-bit pointer

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:57.910
and it's replaced with an 8-bit pointer
 

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.790
and it's replaced with an 8-bit pointer
into that pallet so instead of 32 bits

00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800
into that pallet so instead of 32 bits
 

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.470
into that pallet so instead of 32 bits
per pixel you're now down to 8 good

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480
per pixel you're now down to 8 good
 

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.480
per pixel you're now down to 8 good
savings right so the question that I

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
savings right so the question that I
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.879
savings right so the question that I
have though is ok aapt is really good

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:05.889
have though is ok aapt is really good
 

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:08.400
have though is ok aapt is really good
but how good is it and to answer that I

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:08.410
but how good is it and to answer that I
 

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.069
but how good is it and to answer that I
had to open up an application and take a

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079
had to open up an application and take a
 

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:13.590
had to open up an application and take a
look at how a apt was impacting and

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600
look at how a apt was impacting and
 

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.569
look at how a apt was impacting and
affecting that application to see

00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:15.579
affecting that application to see
 

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:16.949
affecting that application to see
whether or not it was doing a really

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959
whether or not it was doing a really
 

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:17.880
whether or not it was doing a really
good job or if there's somewhat

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:17.890
good job or if there's somewhat
 

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.310
good job or if there's somewhat
improvement

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320
improvement
 

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.010
improvement
to be made so being I oh I felt maybe we

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:21.020
to be made so being I oh I felt maybe we
 

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.630
to be made so being I oh I felt maybe we
should do a call back to last year's i/o

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640
should do a call back to last year's i/o
 

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.780
should do a call back to last year's i/o
shed application and see how well a apt

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:25.790
shed application and see how well a apt
 

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.770
shed application and see how well a apt
was doing with that

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:26.780
was doing with that
 

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.540
was doing with that
so anyone looked through the source code

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.550
so anyone looked through the source code
 

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.220
so anyone looked through the source code
of the i/o scheduler application from

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:30.230
of the i/o scheduler application from
 

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.820
of the i/o scheduler application from
last year round of applause yeah did

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:33.830
last year round of applause yeah did
 

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.140
last year round of applause yeah did
anyone find the hidden easter egg in the

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.150
anyone find the hidden easter egg in the
 

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.380
anyone find the hidden easter egg in the
source code no then forget I said

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:38.390
source code no then forget I said
 

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.640
source code no then forget I said
anything so when we open up this file

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:42.650
anything so when we open up this file
 

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.440
anything so when we open up this file
there's a lot of assets now there's two

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:44.450
there's a lot of assets now there's two
 

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.000
there's a lot of assets now there's two
things to compare here of course first

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.010
things to compare here of course first
 

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.430
things to compare here of course first
is the source code files in github and

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.440
is the source code files in github and
 

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.020
is the source code files in github and
then there's the apk that you can

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.030
then there's the apk that you can
 

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.250
then there's the apk that you can
actually download from the Play Store

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:51.260
actually download from the Play Store
 

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.630
actually download from the Play Store
unzip and take a look at the assets

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640
unzip and take a look at the assets
 

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.040
unzip and take a look at the assets
right so I wanted to look at between

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.050
right so I wanted to look at between
 

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.410
right so I wanted to look at between
these two because if a apt is doing a

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:56.420
these two because if a apt is doing a
 

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.360
these two because if a apt is doing a
great job I should see a big change

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.370
great job I should see a big change
 

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.700
great job I should see a big change
between those two file sizes right so I

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:00.710
between those two file sizes right so I
 

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.960
between those two file sizes right so I
opened up the file and it just picked

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:01.970
opened up the file and it just picked
 

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.550
opened up the file and it just picked
some random graphic this was the one I

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560
some random graphic this was the one I
 

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.480
some random graphic this was the one I
happen to look at

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.490
happen to look at
 

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.260
happen to look at
that's a 144 by 144 pixel PNG file and

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.270
that's a 144 by 144 pixel PNG file and
 

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:14.950
that's a 144 by 144 pixel PNG file and
that's 6k that's huge right sorry this

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:14.960
that's 6k that's huge right sorry this
 

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.690
that's 6k that's huge right sorry this
is in the the source code repo right now

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:16.700
is in the the source code repo right now
 

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.190
is in the the source code repo right now
when I open up the apk and take a look

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200
when I open up the apk and take a look
 

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.650
when I open up the apk and take a look
at it it's actually only 2k which is

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:20.660
at it it's actually only 2k which is
 

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.940
at it it's actually only 2k which is
better but still way too big for 144 by

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:24.950
better but still way too big for 144 by
 

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.190
better but still way too big for 144 by
144 pixels like that's that's massively

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200
144 pixels like that's that's massively
 

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.190
144 pixels like that's that's massively
huge right and so I said well hold on

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200
huge right and so I said well hold on
 

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.920
huge right and so I said well hold on
that something's missing here obviously

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:32.930
that something's missing here obviously
 

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.840
that something's missing here obviously
we've got some optimization let's figure

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:34.850
we've got some optimization let's figure
 

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.070
we've got some optimization let's figure
out what's going on so I opened up this

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.080
out what's going on so I opened up this
 

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.470
out what's going on so I opened up this
image in Photoshop and I saved it for

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480
image in Photoshop and I saved it for
 

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.550
image in Photoshop and I saved it for
the web there's a difference between

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560
the web there's a difference between
 

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.460
the web there's a difference between
file save and file save for web there's

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:42.470
file save and file save for web there's
 

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.840
file save and file save for web there's
a whole different process in there in

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:43.850
a whole different process in there in
 

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.060
a whole different process in there in
that process I actually quantized it to

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.070
that process I actually quantized it to
 

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.970
that process I actually quantized it to
only use 256 colors as you can see when

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:48.980
only use 256 colors as you can see when
 

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.130
only use 256 colors as you can see when
I did that we got about the same size as

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:51.140
I did that we got about the same size as
 

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.530
I did that we got about the same size as
was in the apk so we can see that hey

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:53.540
was in the apk so we can see that hey
 

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.420
was in the apk so we can see that hey
then apt did its job

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:55.430
then apt did its job
 

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.880
then apt did its job
it probably quantized this to an indexed

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:57.890
it probably quantized this to an indexed
 

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.010
it probably quantized this to an indexed
image right but here's the problem

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:00.020
image right but here's the problem
 

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.320
image right but here's the problem
take a look at that image does it look

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.330
take a look at that image does it look
 

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.130
take a look at that image does it look
like it's using 256 colors No so let's

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.140
like it's using 256 colors No so let's
 

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.690
like it's using 256 colors No so let's
crank it down a little bit here's what

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:07.700
crank it down a little bit here's what
 

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.400
crank it down a little bit here's what
64 colors looks like anybody see a

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:09.410
64 colors looks like anybody see a
 

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.580
64 colors looks like anybody see a
change let's go even more 32 over 16

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:12.590
change let's go even more 32 over 16
 

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.230
change let's go even more 32 over 16
colors still don't see a change 8 colors

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240
colors still don't see a change 8 colors
 

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.970
colors still don't see a change 8 colors
still don't see a change or if you do

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:18.980
still don't see a change or if you do
 

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.850
still don't see a change or if you do
your eyes are better than mine the point

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:21.860
your eyes are better than mine the point
 

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.680
your eyes are better than mine the point
here is that we went from 256 unique

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:23.690
here is that we went from 256 unique
 

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.270
here is that we went from 256 unique
colors down to 8 unique colors and

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:25.280
colors down to 8 unique colors and
 

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.920
colors down to 8 unique colors and
didn't see a change in visual perception

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:26.930
didn't see a change in visual perception
 

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.260
didn't see a change in visual perception
the difference in file size though was

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:29.270
the difference in file size though was
 

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.400
the difference in file size though was
huge right

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.410
huge right
 

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.259
huge right
because we were able to find a smaller

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:33.269
because we were able to find a smaller
 

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:35.840
because we were able to find a smaller
color size so let's let's look at a

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:35.850
color size so let's let's look at a
 

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.300
color size so let's let's look at a
different a different example here so

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.310
different a different example here so
 

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.920
different a different example here so
this is one of the big banners big

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:39.930
this is one of the big banners big
 

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.180
this is one of the big banners big
banner images that you see inside of the

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:41.190
banner images that you see inside of the
 

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.189
banner images that you see inside of the
application that's a forty nine point

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199
application that's a forty nine point
 

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:46.400
application that's a forty nine point
five k in the github repo and 32 k

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.410
five k in the github repo and 32 k
 

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.530
five k in the github repo and 32 k
inside of the APK so again there's some

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540
inside of the APK so again there's some
 

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.650
inside of the APK so again there's some
some smaller modifications going on here

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660
some smaller modifications going on here
 

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.350
some smaller modifications going on here
to the AAP tool but still let's see if

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360
to the AAP tool but still let's see if
 

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.929
to the AAP tool but still let's see if
our trick works here - right so let's

00:12:56.929 --> 00:12:56.939
our trick works here - right so let's
 

00:12:56.939 --> 00:12:59.869
our trick works here - right so let's
actually down raise it to 32 colors this

00:12:59.869 --> 00:12:59.879
actually down raise it to 32 colors this
 

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:02.090
actually down raise it to 32 colors this
one isn't that good right I mean you can

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100
one isn't that good right I mean you can
 

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.460
one isn't that good right I mean you can
see some banding and the gradients there

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.470
see some banding and the gradients there
 

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.079
see some banding and the gradients there
you can see that some of the colors just

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:06.089
you can see that some of the colors just
 

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.119
you can see that some of the colors just
aren't looking as true as you can

00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:08.129
aren't looking as true as you can
 

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:10.759
aren't looking as true as you can
so let's bump that up to exactly 256

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:10.769
so let's bump that up to exactly 256
 

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:12.949
so let's bump that up to exactly 256
colors here you can't actually see any

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959
colors here you can't actually see any
 

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.769
colors here you can't actually see any
visual difference right but notice the

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779
visual difference right but notice the
 

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:17.150
visual difference right but notice the
difference in the file size this is only

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160
difference in the file size this is only
 

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.720
difference in the file size this is only
18 K instead of the 36 K right so this

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:20.730
18 K instead of the 36 K right so this
 

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.569
18 K instead of the 36 K right so this
image actually only needed 256 colors

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579
image actually only needed 256 colors
 

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:25.610
image actually only needed 256 colors
but maybe the source image didn't have

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620
but maybe the source image didn't have
 

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.079
but maybe the source image didn't have
that and this is the problem with the

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:27.089
that and this is the problem with the
 

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:29.749
that and this is the problem with the
AAP tree tool it does a great job of

00:13:29.749 --> 00:13:29.759
AAP tree tool it does a great job of
 

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:32.569
AAP tree tool it does a great job of
those exact three things and no more

00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579
those exact three things and no more
 

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:34.490
those exact three things and no more
than that so in the first case we had an

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500
than that so in the first case we had an
 

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.530
than that so in the first case we had an
image that obviously needed less colors

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540
image that obviously needed less colors
 

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.509
image that obviously needed less colors
right and could have been optimized more

00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519
right and could have been optimized more
 

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:40.129
right and could have been optimized more
and in the second case we had an image

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:40.139
and in the second case we had an image
 

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:43.910
and in the second case we had an image
that had maybe just over 256 colors that

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920
that had maybe just over 256 colors that
 

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.129
that had maybe just over 256 colors that
if we set it to 256 it's still what it

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139
if we set it to 256 it's still what it
 

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:48.889
if we set it to 256 it's still what it
looked fine right AVT does neither of

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899
looked fine right AVT does neither of
 

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:50.660
looked fine right AVT does neither of
these for you which means that it's your

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:50.670
these for you which means that it's your
 

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.629
these for you which means that it's your
job as a developer to step past that and

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639
job as a developer to step past that and
 

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:55.519
job as a developer to step past that and
start doing additional methods to reduce

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:55.529
start doing additional methods to reduce
 

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:58.850
start doing additional methods to reduce
the size of your PNG files so let's take

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860
the size of your PNG files so let's take
 

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.100
the size of your PNG files so let's take
a look as I said before how easy it is

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.110
a look as I said before how easy it is
 

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.230
a look as I said before how easy it is
to mess this up so you've actually just

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240
to mess this up so you've actually just
 

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.240
to mess this up so you've actually just
take a 16 pixel by 16 pixel alread PNG

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.250
take a 16 pixel by 16 pixel alread PNG
 

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.150
take a 16 pixel by 16 pixel alread PNG
file file save as from Photoshop look at

2k that's 64 pixels that 2k the funny

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120
2k that's 64 pixels that 2k the funny
 

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.400

thing right now is everyone in the room

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:19.410
thing right now is everyone in the room
 

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.840
thing right now is everyone in the room
is doing a gut check about whether or

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:20.850
is doing a gut check about whether or
 

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.240
is doing a gut check about whether or
not their designers are using file save

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.250
not their designers are using file save
 

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.799
not their designers are using file save
as from Photoshop to save their pngs

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:24.809
as from Photoshop to save their pngs
 

00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:28.579
as from Photoshop to save their pngs
right right when you save it for web

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:28.589
right right when you save it for web
 

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:30.350
right right when you save it for web
though you end up at 121 bytes which is

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360
though you end up at 121 bytes which is
 

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.059
though you end up at 121 bytes which is
better which is obviously better that's

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:32.069
better which is obviously better that's
 

00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:33.619
better which is obviously better that's
the thing we want to see this is how

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:33.629
the thing we want to see this is how
 

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:36.860
the thing we want to see this is how
easy it is to mess up this problem now

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:36.870
easy it is to mess up this problem now
 

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.240
easy it is to mess up this problem now
the good news is though that you don't

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.250
the good news is though that you don't
 

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.650
the good news is though that you don't
have to go into crazy town

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660
have to go into crazy town
 

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.449
have to go into crazy town
with trying to optimize all those things

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:41.459
with trying to optimize all those things
 

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:42.829
with trying to optimize all those things
we talked about before with the

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839
we talked about before with the
 

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:44.210
we talked about before with the
different stages of PNG

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220
different stages of PNG
 

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.720
different stages of PNG
PNG optimization is an old problem old

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:47.730
PNG optimization is an old problem old
 

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.030
PNG optimization is an old problem old
meaning the 90s right I mean some of you

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040
meaning the 90s right I mean some of you
 

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.450
meaning the 90s right I mean some of you
were alive in the 90s right okay yeah

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:53.460
were alive in the 90s right okay yeah
 

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.950

professional people yeah the truth is

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:05.310
professional people yeah the truth is
 

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.310
professional people yeah the truth is
that there is a plethora a plethora of

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320
that there is a plethora a plethora of
 

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.870
that there is a plethora a plethora of
tools out there that have already been

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880
tools out there that have already been
 

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.190
tools out there that have already been
solving this problem for almost two

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:10.200
solving this problem for almost two

decades you don't got to do the heavy

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:11.910
decades you don't got to do the heavy

of these really they all do different

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:16.710
of these really they all do different
 

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.200
of these really they all do different
stuff and have different algorithms and

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.210
stuff and have different algorithms and
 

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.430
stuff and have different algorithms and
different needs and different settings

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440
different needs and different settings
 

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.470
different needs and different settings
and whatnot but if you just add any one

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480
and whatnot but if you just add any one
 

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.090
and whatnot but if you just add any one
of these to your existing asset chain

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100
of these to your existing asset chain
 

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.500
of these to your existing asset chain
you're gonna get an immediate reduction

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:24.510
you're gonna get an immediate reduction
 

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.300
you're gonna get an immediate reduction
and an immediate improvement in file

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:26.310
and an immediate improvement in file
 

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.150
and an immediate improvement in file
size now that being said there are some

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160
size now that being said there are some
 

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.550
size now that being said there are some
things that you can do to make it even

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560
things that you can do to make it even
 

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.700
things that you can do to make it even
better in terms of file sizes and I only

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:34.710
better in terms of file sizes and I only
 

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.530
better in terms of file sizes and I only
mention these two things because I'm

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540
mention these two things because I'm
 

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.020
mention these two things because I'm
seeing them a lot in applications that

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.030
seeing them a lot in applications that

a pretty simple quantization step you

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:57.780
a pretty simple quantization step you
 

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.210
a pretty simple quantization step you
just tested you take a look at it here

00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220
just tested you take a look at it here

Channel so here's what's happening this
is this I've seen this quite a bit and a

00:16:58.319 --> 00:16:58.329
is this I've seen this quite a bit and a
 

00:16:58.329 --> 00:17:00.889
is this I've seen this quite a bit and a
lot of the the files I've opened so

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899
lot of the the files I've opened so
 

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:03.329
lot of the the files I've opened so
visually you can see that the last frame

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:03.339
visually you can see that the last frame
 

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:05.039
visually you can see that the last frame
is what the user sees here but when you

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:05.049
is what the user sees here but when you
 

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:06.240
is what the user sees here but when you
open this thing up and you take a look

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.250
open this thing up and you take a look
 

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.130
open this thing up and you take a look
at the RGB channels in the a channel

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:08.140
at the RGB channels in the a channel
 

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.079
at the RGB channels in the a channel
separately you can see that the RGB

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.089
separately you can see that the RGB
 

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.179
separately you can see that the RGB
actually has a ton of data that gets

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:12.189
actually has a ton of data that gets
 

00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:14.340
actually has a ton of data that gets
masked out by the alpha value the end

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:14.350
masked out by the alpha value the end
 

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.620
masked out by the alpha value the end
result is the same visual image to the

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:16.630
result is the same visual image to the
 

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.280
result is the same visual image to the
user but to the compressor we still have

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:20.290
user but to the compressor we still have
 

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.520
user but to the compressor we still have
to compress all of that RGB data the

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:23.530
to compress all of that RGB data the
 

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.929
to compress all of that RGB data the
filtering stage house still has to be

00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:24.939
filtering stage house still has to be
 

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:26.340
filtering stage house still has to be
run on it the output of that sauce will

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:26.350
run on it the output of that sauce will
 

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:27.809
run on it the output of that sauce will
be run through a deflate algorithm and

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:27.819
be run through a deflate algorithm and
 

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.640
be run through a deflate algorithm and
because there's a lot of non-uniform

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:29.650
because there's a lot of non-uniform
 

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.350
because there's a lot of non-uniform
pixels there the result is going to be a

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360
pixels there the result is going to be a
 

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.240
pixels there the result is going to be a
lot of bloat in your compressor right

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.250
lot of bloat in your compressor right
 

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.310
lot of bloat in your compressor right
however if we try to pre multiply this

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320
however if we try to pre multiply this
 

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.810
however if we try to pre multiply this
stuff and mask out the pixels that we

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:36.820
stuff and mask out the pixels that we
 

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.880
stuff and mask out the pixels that we
know are never going to be seen we end

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:38.890
know are never going to be seen we end
 

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.980
know are never going to be seen we end
up with a much smaller file size I've

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:40.990
up with a much smaller file size I've
 

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.049
up with a much smaller file size I've
been seeing this in applications popping

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:43.059
been seeing this in applications popping
 

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:45.270
been seeing this in applications popping
up lately a lot more than I'd like to

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280
up lately a lot more than I'd like to
 

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.590
up lately a lot more than I'd like to
say so take a look at this now one of

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600
say so take a look at this now one of
 

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.789
say so take a look at this now one of
the final things I need to point out if

00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799
the final things I need to point out if
 

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:51.930
the final things I need to point out if
you're gonna go down this path and

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:51.940
you're gonna go down this path and
 

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.669
you're gonna go down this path and
you're gonna add in some of these

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679
you're gonna add in some of these
 

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:55.980
you're gonna add in some of these
awesome pre-processing tools to your

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:55.990
awesome pre-processing tools to your
 

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.419
awesome pre-processing tools to your
chain and get it all working with Gradle

00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:57.429
chain and get it all working with Gradle
 

00:17:57.429 --> 00:17:58.710
chain and get it all working with Gradle
and you're gonna tell your designers to

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720
and you're gonna tell your designers to
 

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.060
and you're gonna tell your designers to
not do that thing I just said and try to

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.070
not do that thing I just said and try to
 

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.430
not do that thing I just said and try to
make index files you may run into a

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440
make index files you may run into a
 

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.810
make index files you may run into a
really weird issue so let's say we've

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:03.820
really weird issue so let's say we've
 

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.090
really weird issue so let's say we've
got this great image it's about 2 16 K

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:06.100
got this great image it's about 2 16 K
 

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.890
got this great image it's about 2 16 K
and we actually run it through Zoff PNG

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:07.900
and we actually run it through Zoff PNG
 

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.190
and we actually run it through Zoff PNG
horizontally PNG which is a fantastic

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200
horizontally PNG which is a fantastic
 

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.210
horizontally PNG which is a fantastic
open source tool that it's a better

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:12.220
open source tool that it's a better
 

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.610
open source tool that it's a better
deflate algorithm compressor for PNG

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:14.620
deflate algorithm compressor for PNG
 

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.950
deflate algorithm compressor for PNG
files and we get it down to about 185 K

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960
files and we get it down to about 185 K
 

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.560
files and we get it down to about 185 K
but when you build it it actually goes

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:19.570
but when you build it it actually goes
 

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:24.240
but when you build it it actually goes
through a apt and it bloats to 201 k the

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:24.250
through a apt and it bloats to 201 k the
 

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.659
through a apt and it bloats to 201 k the
reason for this is that the AAP tree

00:18:27.659 --> 00:18:27.669
reason for this is that the AAP tree
 

00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:29.220
reason for this is that the AAP tree
tool doesn't know that you've

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.230
tool doesn't know that you've
 

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.500
tool doesn't know that you've
pre-processed your image right again

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:31.510
pre-processed your image right again
 

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.909
pre-processed your image right again
it's only checking for those three

00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919
it's only checking for those three
 

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:34.860
it's only checking for those three
things and so it's gonna look at your

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:34.870
things and so it's gonna look at your
 

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.930
things and so it's gonna look at your
image and it's gonna try to make it into

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:36.940
image and it's gonna try to make it into
 

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.060
image and it's gonna try to make it into
a B or C format and then it's just gonna

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.070
a B or C format and then it's just gonna
 

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.890
a B or C format and then it's just gonna
save it right to disk the problem with

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:40.900
save it right to disk the problem with
 

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.940

to get around this in your application

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:47.860
to get around this in your application
 

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.350
to get around this in your application
you need to specify the commit the

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360
you need to specify the commit the
 

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.539

the problem though is that once you do

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840
the problem though is that once you do
 

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.480
the problem though is that once you do
this it's kind of on you to make sure

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.490
this it's kind of on you to make sure
 

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.340
this it's kind of on you to make sure
that all of your images are awesome at

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:14.200
 
all right now the back row let's try the

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.210
all right now the back row let's try the
 

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.710
all right now the back row let's try the
front row again that's good

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720
front row again that's good
 

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.909
front row again that's good
that's good I'm sorry the front row is

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919
that's good I'm sorry the front row is
 

00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:20.349
that's good I'm sorry the front row is
winning back row you want to try again

00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:20.359

we'll try again later

00:19:28.749 --> 00:19:28.759
we'll try again later

so you don't end up actually bloating

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:36.950
so you don't end up actually bloating
 

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.019
so you don't end up actually bloating
images that you've already taken the

time to compress now probably one of the
biggest things that you can do though in

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:42.289
biggest things that you can do though in
 

00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:44.320
biggest things that you can do though in
terms of file savings is actually

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.330
terms of file savings is actually
 

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.940
terms of file savings is actually
consider replacing your PNG s all

all this other stuff but this is the
 

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.229
all this other stuff but this is the
gist of the problem there's another way

to approach this issue and it's the

00:20:15.729 --> 00:20:15.739
to approach this issue and it's the
 

00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:17.409
to approach this issue and it's the
concept of actually drawing your images

00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:17.419
concept of actually drawing your images
 

00:20:17.419 --> 00:20:19.659
concept of actually drawing your images
with code so that same picture what if

with code so that same picture what if
 

00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:21.460
with code so that same picture what if
we took a stab at it saying this lets

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:21.470
we took a stab at it saying this lets
 

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.960
we took a stab at it saying this lets
emit a byte code that actually draws a

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:22.970
emit a byte code that actually draws a
 

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.669
emit a byte code that actually draws a
white background and then another code

00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679
white background and then another code
 

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:26.979
white background and then another code
that actually draws a red circle now if

00:20:26.979 --> 00:20:26.989
that actually draws a red circle now if

that actually draws a red circle now if
we create our custom dsl language and

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:29.210
we create our custom dsl language and
 

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.549
we create our custom dsl language and
whatnot we could actually get this into

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559
whatnot we could actually get this into
 

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:32.409
whatnot we could actually get this into
you know one byte per instruction and

00:20:32.409 --> 00:20:32.419
you know one byte per instruction and
 

00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:34.359
you know one byte per instruction and
actually end up at about 15 bytes to

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:34.369
actually end up at about 15 bytes to
 

00:20:34.369 --> 00:20:37.509
actually end up at about 15 bytes to

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:38.889
represent the same thing the result of
this is that we can generate those same

00:20:38.889 --> 00:20:38.899
this is that we can generate those same
 

00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:41.139
this is that we can generate those same
three images at any of these three sizes

image formats right basically we take

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:50.570
image formats right basically we take
 

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.509
image formats right basically we take
some sort of stream that represents how

to draw primitives on a screen we

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:54.470
to draw primitives on a screen we
 

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.590
to draw primitives on a screen we
actually execute those rasterizing those

primitives to a bitmap and cpu memory we
 

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.549
primitives to a bitmap and cpu memory we
upload that to the GPU and then we end

upload that to the GPU and then we end
 

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.840

the benefit you get here is much smaller

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:04.580
the benefit you get here is much smaller

the benefit you get here is much smaller
file sizes the downside though is you

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:06.769
file sizes the downside though is you
 

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:09.190

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:04.490
through here we saw some wins the
 

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.249
through here we saw some wins the
downside though is that this is an

00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:06.259
downside though is that this is an
 

00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:07.720
downside though is that this is an
automated tool right I mean this is only

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:07.730
automated tool right I mean this is only
 

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:08.799
automated tool right I mean this is only
a test we're just trying to figure out

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:08.809
a test we're just trying to figure out
 

00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:09.970
a test we're just trying to figure out
how all this stuff works together and

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:09.980
how all this stuff works together and
 

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.830
how all this stuff works together and
obviously there were some failures uh we

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840
obviously there were some failures uh we
 

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.419
obviously there were some failures uh we
missed some interspersion detail

00:23:13.419 --> 00:23:13.429
missed some interspersion detail
 

00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:14.889
missed some interspersion detail
obviously we're not getting the exact

00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:14.899
obviously we're not getting the exact
 

00:23:14.899 --> 00:23:17.200
obviously we're not getting the exact
representation and it just fell over and

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.210
representation and it just fell over and
 

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.720
representation and it just fell over and
died on the i/o algorithm right the

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:19.730
died on the i/o algorithm right the
 

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.629
died on the i/o algorithm right the
result though I think was a good test to

00:23:22.629 --> 00:23:22.639
result though I think was a good test to
 

00:23:22.639 --> 00:23:24.609
result though I think was a good test to
figure out what you could save so

00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:24.619
figure out what you could save so
 

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.320
figure out what you could save so
running things through Pio Trace we

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:26.330
running things through Pio Trace we
 

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.759
running things through Pio Trace we
actually ended up with only a hundred

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:27.769
actually ended up with only a hundred
 

00:23:27.769 --> 00:23:29.259
actually ended up with only a hundred
and fifty three files because we didn't

00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:29.269
and fifty three files because we didn't
 

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:30.759
and fifty three files because we didn't
have to want to have one for each rep

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:30.769
have to want to have one for each rep
 

00:23:30.769 --> 00:23:32.000
have to want to have one for each rep

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.010
resolution
 

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.730
resolution
and the result was actually 149 K that's

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740
and the result was actually 149 K that's
 

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.880
and the result was actually 149 K that's
84 percent reduction in asset sizes by

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:37.890
84 percent reduction in asset sizes by
 

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.530
84 percent reduction in asset sizes by
just moving everything to be a vector

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:39.540
just moving everything to be a vector
 

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.650

drawable which is a pretty good savings

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:42.660
drawable which is a pretty good savings
 

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:47.600
drawable which is a pretty good savings
yes this pot yes this man yes you

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:47.610
yes this pot yes this man yes you
 

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.539
yes this pot yes this man yes you
started the clap sir you are awesome yes

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:50.549
started the clap sir you are awesome yes
 

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:51.950
started the clap sir you are awesome yes
so 84 percent smaller that's a pretty

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960
so 84 percent smaller that's a pretty
 

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.370
so 84 percent smaller that's a pretty
good deal

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:52.380
good deal
 

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.169
good deal
right now it's worth noting this was

00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179
right now it's worth noting this was
 

00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:56.210
right now it's worth noting this was
just a test you can't just go run P Oh

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220
just a test you can't just go run P Oh
 

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.310
just a test you can't just go run P Oh
trace and convert everything over I mean

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320
trace and convert everything over I mean
 

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.440
trace and convert everything over I mean
it spits out the EPS files and that's

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:00.450
it spits out the EPS files and that's
 

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.909
it spits out the EPS files and that's
not the same as VG files and oh by the

00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919
not the same as VG files and oh by the
 

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:03.230
not the same as VG files and oh by the
way there's actually a chance that you

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240
way there's actually a chance that you
 

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.760
way there's actually a chance that you
could optimize stuff further right

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:04.770
could optimize stuff further right
 

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.350
could optimize stuff further right
instead of just importing from SVG if

you did stuff by hand you may actually

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860
you did stuff by hand you may actually
 

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.200
you did stuff by hand you may actually
be able to get stuff down even smaller

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.210
be able to get stuff down even smaller
 

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.480
be able to get stuff down even smaller
than that so but the main point is you

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:11.490
than that so but the main point is you
 

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.370
than that so but the main point is you
can get a lot of savings here by ruling

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380
can get a lot of savings here by ruling
 

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.530
can get a lot of savings here by ruling

we could put them just the raw math of
the situation take a look at this so

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000
the situation take a look at this so
 

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.730
the situation take a look at this so
when you encode a JPEG here's what's

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740
when you encode a JPEG here's what's
 

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.130
when you encode a JPEG here's what's
going on you take your source RGB image

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140
going on you take your source RGB image
 

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.780
going on you take your source RGB image
and the first thing that happens is we

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:08.790
and the first thing that happens is we
 

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.250
and the first thing that happens is we
actually convert it to a separate color

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260
actually convert it to a separate color
 

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.799
actually convert it to a separate color
space the reason for this is that human

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:12.809
space the reason for this is that human
 

00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:15.140
space the reason for this is that human
eye the psychovisual differences in the

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:15.150
eye the psychovisual differences in the
 

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.640
eye the psychovisual differences in the
human eye are less susceptible to the

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:18.650
human eye are less susceptible to the
 

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.220
human eye are less susceptible to the
ycbcr color space or the chroma lumens

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:22.230
ycbcr color space or the chroma lumens
 

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.350
ycbcr color space or the chroma lumens
color space right we're actually more

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360
color space right we're actually more
 

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.150
color space right we're actually more
tuned the human eye is more tuned to see

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:26.160
tuned the human eye is more tuned to see
 

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.610

differences in our GPS than we are ycbcr

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620
differences in our GPS than we are ycbcr
 

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.950
differences in our GPS than we are ycbcr
so the first thing that JPEG does is

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960
so the first thing that JPEG does is
 

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.500
so the first thing that JPEG does is
convert us to that space the next thing

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:33.510
convert us to that space the next thing
 

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.539
convert us to that space the next thing
is we actually reduce the size of the

00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:35.549
is we actually reduce the size of the
 

00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:37.460
is we actually reduce the size of the
Seabee the chroma channels see B and C

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:37.470
Seabee the chroma channels see B and C
 

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.260
Seabee the chroma channels see B and C
are channels again the human eye doesn't

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:39.270
are channels again the human eye doesn't
 

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.630
are channels again the human eye doesn't
notice as much changes in that spectrum

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640
notice as much changes in that spectrum
 

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.820
notice as much changes in that spectrum
so it doesn't worry about it after that

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:43.830
so it doesn't worry about it after that
 

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.200
so it doesn't worry about it after that
we actually go through and block up our

go to the output JPEG file now here's

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.470
go to the output JPEG file now here's
 

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.970
go to the output JPEG file now here's
the weird thing

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980
the weird thing
 

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.600
the weird thing
this is awesome this is totally crazy

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:47.610
this is awesome this is totally crazy
 

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.619

one slider all of this chaos is hidden
 

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.190
one slider all of this chaos is hidden
behind one slider when you export an

behind one slider when you export an
 

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.830
behind one slider when you export an

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840
image that's impressive on its own right
 

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.779
image that's impressive on its own right
now the question is what should this

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:05.789
now the question is what should this
 

00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:07.610
now the question is what should this
value B this is the JPEG quality when

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620
value B this is the JPEG quality when
 

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.409
value B this is the JPEG quality when
you export a JPEG we asked you what

00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419
you export a JPEG we asked you what
 

00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:11.149
you export a JPEG we asked you what
quality you wanted out pour that right

00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159
quality you wanted out pour that right
 

00:27:11.159 --> 00:27:12.560
quality you wanted out pour that right
and so the question is what should this

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:12.570
and so the question is what should this
 

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.509
and so the question is what should this
be right so let's take a visual look at

00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:14.519
be right so let's take a visual look at
 

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:16.789
be right so let's take a visual look at
what the Photoshop would actually output

00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799
what the Photoshop would actually output
 

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:19.009
what the Photoshop would actually output
us so here's a PS 12 so this is would be

00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:19.019
us so here's a PS 12 so this is would be
 

00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:22.220
us so here's a PS 12 so this is would be
a hundred percent JPEG quality right 263

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:22.230
a hundred percent JPEG quality right 263
 

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:28.490
a hundred percent JPEG quality right 263

go down to 4 so this is quality 4 you

00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559
go down to 4 so this is quality 4 you
 

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.019
go down to 4 so this is quality 4 you
see a lot more ringing artifacts here

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:42.029
see a lot more ringing artifacts here
 

00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:43.490

I'll get to in another slide the the
 

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.529
I'll get to in another slide the the
real solution here is to automate this

real solution here is to automate this
 

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:14.549
real solution here is to automate this

exported quality was and then put it
 

00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:31.680
exported quality was and then put it
together in a table so you can actually

together in a table so you can actually
 

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.870
together in a table so you can actually
see what everyone is exporting things at

now the ones with ranges are actually
really impressive because it means that

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600
really impressive because it means that

jpg file at some quality right we
 

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.810
jpg file at some quality right we
convert that jpg back to a PNG so we

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:18.820
convert that jpg back to a PNG so we
 

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.669

let's just say it's 2.0 randomly then we
 

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.710
let's just say it's 2.0 randomly then we
return that quality value so does this

you can see really quickly we found that

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480
you can see really quickly we found that

you can see really quickly we found that
about quality sixty we passed the 2.0

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:45.610
about quality sixty we passed the 2.0
 

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.750
about quality sixty we passed the 2.0
threshold right and then it actually was

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760
threshold right and then it actually was
 

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.640
threshold right and then it actually was
able to dive in a little bit more and

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:50.650
able to dive in a little bit more and
 

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.680

what we're doing here remember that the

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:01.970
what we're doing here remember that the
 

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.029
what we're doing here remember that the
first thing that JPEG does is split your

in its own leak I've done compression

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:06.710
in its own leak I've done compression
 

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.829
in its own leak I've done compression
for a long time it's in its own league I

00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839
for a long time it's in its own league I
 

00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:11.079

mean on one side you've got a whole

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:11.089
mean on one side you've got a whole
 

00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:13.660
mean on one side you've got a whole
suite of algorithms that applies so we

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:13.670
suite of algorithms that applies so we
 

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.519
suite of algorithms that applies so we
can keep up with the lossy type of

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:15.529
can keep up with the lossy type of
 

00:36:15.529 --> 00:36:17.260
can keep up with the lossy type of
compression that JPEG does on the other

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:17.270
compression that JPEG does on the other
 

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:18.549
compression that JPEG does on the other
side of it it's got this whole separate

00:36:18.549 --> 00:36:18.559
side of it it's got this whole separate
 

00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:20.440
side of it it's got this whole separate
filtering and prediction policy so it

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:20.450
filtering and prediction policy so it
 

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.480
filtering and prediction policy so it
can do lossless encoding just like PNG

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:22.490
can do lossless encoding just like PNG
 

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.779
can do lossless encoding just like PNG
it's even got some lz77 and dictionary

00:36:25.779 --> 00:36:25.789
it's even got some lz77 and dictionary
 

00:36:25.789 --> 00:36:27.339
it's even got some lz77 and dictionary
encoding in there so we can do that the

00:36:27.339 --> 00:36:27.349
encoding in there so we can do that the
 

00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:30.640
encoding in there so we can do that the
result is pretty simple across the board

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:30.650
result is pretty simple across the board
 

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.140
result is pretty simple across the board
all of these optimizations and

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:32.150
all of these optimizations and
 

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:35.200
all of these optimizations and
techniques make it competitive with both

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:35.210
techniques make it competitive with both
 

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.620
techniques make it competitive with both
