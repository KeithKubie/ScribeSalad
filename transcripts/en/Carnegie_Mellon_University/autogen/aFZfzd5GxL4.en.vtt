in vehicles to detect damage so we mount

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490
in vehicles to detect damage so we mount
 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.540

this in the windshield you can put this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550
this in the windshield you can put this
 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.029

every neighborhood once a week so you

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469
every neighborhood once a week so you
 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.700
every neighborhood once a week so you
could inspect the whole city once a week

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710
could inspect the whole city once a week
 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.669
could inspect the whole city once a week
this data then is downloaded through

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679
this data then is downloaded through
 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.250
this data then is downloaded through
Wi-Fi through cloud onto our computers

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
Wi-Fi through cloud onto our computers
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.610

then we look at these images and analyze

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620
then we look at these images and analyze
 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.279
then we look at these images and analyze
and find out how many cracks we can see

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289
and find out how many cracks we can see
 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.919
and find out how many cracks we can see
in those images so here you see a map a

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929
in those images so here you see a map a
 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.950
in those images so here you see a map a
street map of Pittsburgh and all these

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960
street map of Pittsburgh and all these
 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.289
street map of Pittsburgh and all these
little dots are the images which we

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299
little dots are the images which we
 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.090
little dots are the images which we
collected the color of these dots

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100
collected the color of these dots
 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.850
collected the color of these dots
indicate the condition of the road very

road conditions we did do a test put the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960
road conditions we did do a test put the
 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.190
same system on snow plows while it's
plowing we look outside to see if the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
plowing we look outside to see if the
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.830
plowing we look outside to see if the
road if it's just wet or if they're

the roads cracks on the roads and the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230
the roads cracks on the roads and the
 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.690
the roads cracks on the roads and the
traffic signs and we have started to

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700
traffic signs and we have started to
 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.570

look at street lamps at the lane

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580
