00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.829
 
well I was a skydiver before I was a

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
well I was a skydiver before I was a
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.990
well I was a skydiver before I was a
computer scientist so I started

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
computer scientist so I started
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.180
computer scientist so I started
skydiving when I turned 18 I wrote my

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
skydiving when I turned 18 I wrote my
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.459
skydiving when I turned 18 I wrote my
first computer program probably when I

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469
first computer program probably when I
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.160
first computer program probably when I
was 19 so the order is definitely

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
was 19 so the order is definitely
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.590
was 19 so the order is definitely
skydiving then computer science but I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
skydiving then computer science but I
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.210
skydiving then computer science but I
scout out for a very long time I've

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
scout out for a very long time I've
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.490
scout out for a very long time I've
obviously worked in the technology field

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
obviously worked in the technology field
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980
obviously worked in the technology field
for a lot for a long time I'd pretty

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
for a lot for a long time I'd pretty
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.589
for a lot for a long time I'd pretty
much given up skydiving at one point and

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
much given up skydiving at one point and
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.560
much given up skydiving at one point and
when I moved out to California in 1984

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
when I moved out to California in 1984
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470
when I moved out to California in 1984
and didn't make another skydive for a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
and didn't make another skydive for a
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930
and didn't make another skydive for a
very long time meanwhile I started

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
very long time meanwhile I started
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150
very long time meanwhile I started
flying airplanes and you know working in

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
flying airplanes and you know working in
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.380
flying airplanes and you know working in
technology companies working on

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
technology companies working on
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.170
technology companies working on
management and it wasn't till I don't

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
management and it wasn't till I don't
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.319
management and it wasn't till I don't
know maybe six or seven years ago that I

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
know maybe six or seven years ago that I
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.979
know maybe six or seven years ago that I
got the bug to skydive again and so for

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
got the bug to skydive again and so for
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.610
got the bug to skydive again and so for
that I got Reath qualified in skydiving

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
that I got Reath qualified in skydiving
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.760
that I got Reath qualified in skydiving
and then it's a long story but I ended

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
and then it's a long story but I ended
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.270
and then it's a long story but I ended
up deciding to try a stress-free skydive

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
up deciding to try a stress-free skydive
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.750
up deciding to try a stress-free skydive
as well

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
as well
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.380
as well
well the key insight that I think I had

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
well the key insight that I think I had
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.880
well the key insight that I think I had
and the team had wasn't trying to build

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
and the team had wasn't trying to build
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730
and the team had wasn't trying to build
a capsule I mean a large capsule may be

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
a capsule I mean a large capsule may be
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.550
a capsule I mean a large capsule may be
pressurized to maybe not with lots of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
pressurized to maybe not with lots of
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.240
pressurized to maybe not with lots of
the infrastructure for going up was not

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
the infrastructure for going up was not
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.160
the infrastructure for going up was not
the best way to accomplish what we're

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
the best way to accomplish what we're
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289
the best way to accomplish what we're
trying to accomplish it was also not

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
trying to accomplish it was also not
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539
trying to accomplish it was also not
necessarily safest or the cheapest way

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
necessarily safest or the cheapest way
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.510
necessarily safest or the cheapest way
and to get in the stratosphere and for

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
and to get in the stratosphere and for
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.100
and to get in the stratosphere and for
us we wanted to take the analogy of

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
us we wanted to take the analogy of
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230
us we wanted to take the analogy of
scuba diving that if you're a scuba

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
scuba diving that if you're a scuba
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899
scuba diving that if you're a scuba
diver you take exactly what you need

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
diver you take exactly what you need
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.179
diver you take exactly what you need
with you and nothing else underneath the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
with you and nothing else underneath the
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399
with you and nothing else underneath the
water and we wanted to find a stress

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
water and we wanted to find a stress
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.260
water and we wanted to find a stress
ferric equivalent and so that's where we

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
ferric equivalent and so that's where we
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.350
ferric equivalent and so that's where we
built scuba diving for the stratosphere

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360
built scuba diving for the stratosphere
 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.179
built scuba diving for the stratosphere
the suit was designed by alcide over and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
the suit was designed by alcide over and
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.130
the suit was designed by alcide over and
they built all the Apollo suits they

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
they built all the Apollo suits they
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740
they built all the Apollo suits they
built all of the extra vehicle activity

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
built all of the extra vehicle activity
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.190
built all of the extra vehicle activity
suits for you know the you know space

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
suits for you know the you know space
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.889

American astronauts they had a lot of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
American astronauts they had a lot of
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490
American astronauts they had a lot of
experience building building spacesuits

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
experience building building spacesuits
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499
experience building building spacesuits
the challenge in this case was they were

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
the challenge in this case was they were
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.940
the challenge in this case was they were
doing a lot of things that they had

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
doing a lot of things that they had
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.690
doing a lot of things that they had
never done before

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
never done before
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.219
never done before
first they had never worked with a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
first they had never worked with a
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.620
first they had never worked with a
private citizen on a project they were

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
private citizen on a project they were
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.960
private citizen on a project they were
used to these very long

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
used to these very long
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.660
used to these very long
government programs that take years and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
government programs that take years and
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.480
government programs that take years and
years even to get and the approval to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490
years even to get and the approval to
 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.730
years even to get and the approval to
move to the next step and here they were

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
move to the next step and here they were
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.530
move to the next step and here they were
acting like a startup company they had

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
acting like a startup company they had
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.590
acting like a startup company they had
they built a suit from scratch you know

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600
they built a suit from scratch you know
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.560
they built a suit from scratch you know
to deployment and testing you know

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570
to deployment and testing you know
 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.060
to deployment and testing you know
probably in a period of a year or two

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070
probably in a period of a year or two
 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.580
probably in a period of a year or two
and that probably is about the same time

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
and that probably is about the same time
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.020
and that probably is about the same time
that they put in a proposal for

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
that they put in a proposal for
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.940
that they put in a proposal for
something else it was the first suit

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
something else it was the first suit
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.300
something else it was the first suit
that had been certified from scratch and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
that had been certified from scratch and
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.660
that had been certified from scratch and
put into production in probably 30 years

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670
put into production in probably 30 years
 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.010
put into production in probably 30 years
so it was a big undertaking for them to

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
so it was a big undertaking for them to
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.470
so it was a big undertaking for them to
do as far as the technology for the suit

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
do as far as the technology for the suit
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.750
do as far as the technology for the suit
and no suit had ever been heated before

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
and no suit had ever been heated before
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.850
and no suit had ever been heated before
it only been cooled this suit was had an

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860
it only been cooled this suit was had an
 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.130
it only been cooled this suit was had an
internal frame that was used to support

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
internal frame that was used to support
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.240
internal frame that was used to support
the the equipment module it had to have

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
the the equipment module it had to have
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.310
the the equipment module it had to have
you know thermal connections between it

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320
you know thermal connections between it
 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.130
you know thermal connections between it
the suit architecture was very different

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140
the suit architecture was very different
 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.450
the suit architecture was very different
because we wanted to make sure that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460
because we wanted to make sure that
 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.520
because we wanted to make sure that
there was no fogging and we also needed

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530
there was no fogging and we also needed
 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.620
there was no fogging and we also needed
to guarantee that we would use a minimum

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
to guarantee that we would use a minimum
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.020
to guarantee that we would use a minimum
number of a amount of oxygen so normally

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
number of a amount of oxygen so normally
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.240
number of a amount of oxygen so normally
these systems flood oxygen by you and so

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
these systems flood oxygen by you and so
 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.380
these systems flood oxygen by you and so
they don't have to worry about carbon

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
they don't have to worry about carbon
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.300
they don't have to worry about carbon
dioxide but we wanted to use much less

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
dioxide but we wanted to use much less
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.070
dioxide but we wanted to use much less
oxygen and we want to eliminate the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
oxygen and we want to eliminate the
 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.780
oxygen and we want to eliminate the
possibility that you would end up with

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
possibility that you would end up with
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.780
possibility that you would end up with
any kind of moisture or freezing on the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
any kind of moisture or freezing on the
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.910
any kind of moisture or freezing on the
faceplate so we had to design an

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920
faceplate so we had to design an
 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.530
faceplate so we had to design an
entirely new architecture and they were

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540
entirely new architecture and they were
 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.520
entirely new architecture and they were
fantastic we had five airplane jumps

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530
fantastic we had five airplane jumps
 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.350
fantastic we had five airplane jumps
where we got used to flying the suit and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360
where we got used to flying the suit and
 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.300
where we got used to flying the suit and
ii learned a little bit about how to

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310
ii learned a little bit about how to
 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.000
ii learned a little bit about how to
control the suit in freefall and we

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010
control the suit in freefall and we
 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.130
control the suit in freefall and we
followed that up by three balloon jumps

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140
followed that up by three balloon jumps
 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.440
followed that up by three balloon jumps
first from 57,000 feet a second from one

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
first from 57,000 feet a second from one
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.360
first from 57,000 feet a second from one
hundred five thousand feet and the third

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
hundred five thousand feet and the third
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.860
hundred five thousand feet and the third
was a record jump from one hundred and

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870
was a record jump from one hundred and
 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.540
was a record jump from one hundred and
thirty five thousand eight hundred

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550
thirty five thousand eight hundred
 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.330
thirty five thousand eight hundred
ninety feet the speeds that we acquired

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
ninety feet the speeds that we acquired
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.830
ninety feet the speeds that we acquired
during that jump were

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840
during that jump were
 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.300
during that jump were
we broke Mach 1 in about 37 seconds of

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
we broke Mach 1 in about 37 seconds of
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.030
we broke Mach 1 in about 37 seconds of
that freefall and we reached our highest

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
that freefall and we reached our highest
 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.260
that freefall and we reached our highest
speed 822 miles an hour in about 51

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270
speed 822 miles an hour in about 51
 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.900
speed 822 miles an hour in about 51
seconds I mean the problems where the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
seconds I mean the problems where the
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.910
seconds I mean the problems where the
capsule are you know they're big

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920
capsule are you know they're big
 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.770
capsule are you know they're big
complicated they're heavy which requires

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
complicated they're heavy which requires
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.140
complicated they're heavy which requires
a very very large balloon to be able to

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150
a very very large balloon to be able to
 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.520
a very very large balloon to be able to
lift them and so that because the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
lift them and so that because the
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.380
lift them and so that because the
balloon so large it actually requires a

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
balloon so large it actually requires a
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.340
balloon so large it actually requires a
different launch to

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350
different launch to
 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.130
different launch to
Niq not to use so by making the system a

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140
Niq not to use so by making the system a
 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.640
Niq not to use so by making the system a
lot smaller and a lot lighter what you

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650
lot smaller and a lot lighter what you
 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.590
lot smaller and a lot lighter what you
could use is a much smaller balloon and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600
could use is a much smaller balloon and
 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.540
could use is a much smaller balloon and
then in turn the smaller balloon allows

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550
then in turn the smaller balloon allows
 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.640
then in turn the smaller balloon allows
you to use a much simpler and I think

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650
you to use a much simpler and I think
 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.820
you to use a much simpler and I think
safer launch system so at the start we

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830
safer launch system so at the start we
 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.920
safer launch system so at the start we
had a lot going for us the second thing

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930
had a lot going for us the second thing
 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.300
had a lot going for us the second thing
is the interconnection between the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310
is the interconnection between the
 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.700
is the interconnection between the
balloon and the skydiver has caused

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710
balloon and the skydiver has caused
 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.420
balloon and the skydiver has caused
issues in the past I mean you know in a

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
issues in the past I mean you know in a
 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.770
issues in the past I mean you know in a
previous attempt for instance somebody

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780
previous attempt for instance somebody
 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.510
previous attempt for instance somebody
was unable to disconnect the oxygen and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520
was unable to disconnect the oxygen and
 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.650
was unable to disconnect the oxygen and
therefore had to ride down with the

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660
therefore had to ride down with the
 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.200
therefore had to ride down with the
balloon and you know there's a harrowing

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210
balloon and you know there's a harrowing
 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.140
balloon and you know there's a harrowing
experience when Joe Kittinger in 1960

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150
experience when Joe Kittinger in 1960
 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.470
experience when Joe Kittinger in 1960
tried to get out of his balloon you know

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480
tried to get out of his balloon you know
 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.270
tried to get out of his balloon you know
he had trouble getting out of the seed

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280
he had trouble getting out of the seed
 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.460
he had trouble getting out of the seed
so there was lots of different issues

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470
so there was lots of different issues
 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.950
so there was lots of different issues
associated with capsules and the other

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
associated with capsules and the other
 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.900
associated with capsules and the other
really bad thing about a capsule is if

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910
really bad thing about a capsule is if
 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.760
really bad thing about a capsule is if
you're depending on the ship's oxygen

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770
you're depending on the ship's oxygen
 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.860
you're depending on the ship's oxygen
for most of the trip and you're just

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870
for most of the trip and you're just
 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.000
for most of the trip and you're just
going to have what's called a bailout

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010
going to have what's called a bailout
 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.010
going to have what's called a bailout
bottle of oxygen as soon as you

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020
bottle of oxygen as soon as you
 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.230
bottle of oxygen as soon as you
disconnect from that capsule you know

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240
disconnect from that capsule you know
 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.990
disconnect from that capsule you know
the the time is set you have exactly

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000
the the time is set you have exactly
 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.120
the the time is set you have exactly
maybe 15 minutes to get into a

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130
maybe 15 minutes to get into a
 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.430
maybe 15 minutes to get into a
breathable air or you're gonna die then

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440
breathable air or you're gonna die then
 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.160
breathable air or you're gonna die then
the nice piece about a scuba like system

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170
the nice piece about a scuba like system
 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.580
the nice piece about a scuba like system
is that I have you know five hours of

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590
is that I have you know five hours of
 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.520
is that I have you know five hours of
oxygen so there's nothing compelling for

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530
oxygen so there's nothing compelling for
 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.010
oxygen so there's nothing compelling for
me to get out disconnect and get down

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020
me to get out disconnect and get down
 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.350
me to get out disconnect and get down
right away I have lots of time so if the

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360
right away I have lots of time so if the
 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.570
right away I have lots of time so if the
parachute opens hi that's not an issue

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580
parachute opens hi that's not an issue
 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.850
parachute opens hi that's not an issue
so there's a lot of safety aspects that

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860
so there's a lot of safety aspects that
 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.250
so there's a lot of safety aspects that
come in to this particular design a lot

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260
come in to this particular design a lot
 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.590
come in to this particular design a lot
of redundancies that came in to this

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600
of redundancies that came in to this
 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.080
of redundancies that came in to this
design to make it you know much safer on

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090
design to make it you know much safer on
 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.780
design to make it you know much safer on
a lot of different dimensions how do you

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790
a lot of different dimensions how do you
 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.650
a lot of different dimensions how do you
look at a problem area and try to

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660
look at a problem area and try to
 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.360
look at a problem area and try to
understand whether the approach that's

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370
understand whether the approach that's
 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.860
understand whether the approach that's
always been taken is the right one or

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870
always been taken is the right one or
 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.670
always been taken is the right one or
not and I think the biggest thing for me

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680
not and I think the biggest thing for me
 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.550
not and I think the biggest thing for me
is you kind of try to go back to first

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560
is you kind of try to go back to first
 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.470
is you kind of try to go back to first
principles what is the problem that

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480
principles what is the problem that
 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.660
principles what is the problem that
you're trying to solve and don't look at

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670
you're trying to solve and don't look at
 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.840
you're trying to solve and don't look at
every other solution in that space but

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850
every other solution in that space but
 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.060
every other solution in that space but
look at solutions in other spaces around

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070
look at solutions in other spaces around
 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.780
look at solutions in other spaces around
it and try to figure out parallels so in

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790
it and try to figure out parallels so in
 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.270
it and try to figure out parallels so in
my case what I wanted to do is be able

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280
my case what I wanted to do is be able
 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.520
my case what I wanted to do is be able
to explore the stratosphere I wanted to

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530
to explore the stratosphere I wanted to
 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.020
to explore the stratosphere I wanted to
be up in the stratosphere and I wanted

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030
be up in the stratosphere and I wanted
 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.820
be up in the stratosphere and I wanted
to be able to do anything once I'm in

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830
to be able to do anything once I'm in
 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.470
to be able to do anything once I'm in
the stress

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480
the stress
 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.290
the stress
so a capsule idea doesn't really get you

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300
so a capsule idea doesn't really get you
 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.970
so a capsule idea doesn't really get you
it's hard to get the capsule in

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980
it's hard to get the capsule in
 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.680
it's hard to get the capsule in
stratosphere it's complicated but the

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690
stratosphere it's complicated but the
 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.290
stratosphere it's complicated but the
the main issue is it doesn't allow me to

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300
the main issue is it doesn't allow me to
 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.030
the main issue is it doesn't allow me to
do anything that I'd want in the

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040
do anything that I'd want in the
 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.860
do anything that I'd want in the
stratosphere so let's say I want to take

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870
stratosphere so let's say I want to take
 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.570
stratosphere so let's say I want to take
a balloon trip and then come back down

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580
a balloon trip and then come back down
 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.940
a balloon trip and then come back down
with a balloon well if I build a capsule

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950
with a balloon well if I build a capsule
 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.770
with a balloon well if I build a capsule
then I have to have a whole different

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780
then I have to have a whole different
 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.500
then I have to have a whole different
capsule designed for going up and coming

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510
capsule designed for going up and coming
 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.600
capsule designed for going up and coming
down or let's say I all of a sudden

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610
down or let's say I all of a sudden
 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.850
down or let's say I all of a sudden
decided I wanted to go up in a sail

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860
decided I wanted to go up in a sail
 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.070
decided I wanted to go up in a sail
plane you know there's some fabulous

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080
plane you know there's some fabulous
 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.050
plane you know there's some fabulous
efforts right now to see if you can use

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060
efforts right now to see if you can use
 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.290
efforts right now to see if you can use
you know around the Andes and even in

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300
you know around the Andes and even in
 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.210
you know around the Andes and even in
South America these polar lifts that

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220
South America these polar lifts that
 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.490
South America these polar lifts that
they think might be able to allow sail

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500
they think might be able to allow sail
 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.230
they think might be able to allow sail
plane to get up to maybe a hundred

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240
plane to get up to maybe a hundred
 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.360
plane to get up to maybe a hundred
thousand feet so if you've got this

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370
thousand feet so if you've got this
 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.060
thousand feet so if you've got this
capsule well now I want to use a sail

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070
capsule well now I want to use a sail
 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.350
capsule well now I want to use a sail
plane right so I have to start over

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360
plane right so I have to start over
 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.560
plane right so I have to start over
because I have to combine building an

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570
because I have to combine building an
 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.480
because I have to combine building an
aircraft and a life-support system

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490
aircraft and a life-support system
 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.250
aircraft and a life-support system
but let's imagine separating those two

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.260
but let's imagine separating those two
 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.510
but let's imagine separating those two
let's say I'm just gonna build a

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520
let's say I'm just gonna build a
 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.220
let's say I'm just gonna build a
life-support system then I could

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230
life-support system then I could
 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.110
life-support system then I could
conceivably just go into any sail plane

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120
conceivably just go into any sail plane
 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.110
conceivably just go into any sail plane
and be able to do that so you know the

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120
and be able to do that so you know the
 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.130
and be able to do that so you know the
key for me is step away from it look at

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.140
key for me is step away from it look at
 

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.930
key for me is step away from it look at
the problem you're trying to solve and

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940
the problem you're trying to solve and
 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.660
the problem you're trying to solve and
then start looking at all the possible

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:47.670
then start looking at all the possible
 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.320
then start looking at all the possible
solutions for that class a problem in

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.330
solutions for that class a problem in
 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.940
solutions for that class a problem in
all the domains that are rounded and if

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:52.950
all the domains that are rounded and if
 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.300
all the domains that are rounded and if
you do that you'll often find insights

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.310
you do that you'll often find insights
 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.430
you do that you'll often find insights
to make the problem that used to be

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440
to make the problem that used to be
 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.980
to make the problem that used to be
incredibly complex and incredibly

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:00.990
incredibly complex and incredibly
 

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.740
incredibly complex and incredibly
expensive you can find a different

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:03.750
expensive you can find a different
 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.200
expensive you can find a different
approach that might be a lot cheaper you

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.210
approach that might be a lot cheaper you
 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.390
approach that might be a lot cheaper you
know might be a lot easier might be a

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400
know might be a lot easier might be a
 

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.480
know might be a lot easier might be a
lot safer might cost a lot less but you

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.490
lot safer might cost a lot less but you
 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.880
lot safer might cost a lot less but you
know the issue is when you first come up

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:13.890
know the issue is when you first come up
 

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.230
know the issue is when you first come up
with it people are gonna kind of think

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240
with it people are gonna kind of think
 

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.700
with it people are gonna kind of think
you're crazy because the first the first

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:19.710
you're crazy because the first the first
 

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.950
you're crazy because the first the first
time you ever think about something in a

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960
time you ever think about something in a
 

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.340
time you ever think about something in a
totally new domain the initial reaction

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:25.350
totally new domain the initial reaction
 

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.690
totally new domain the initial reaction
is always going to be negative not

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:26.700
is always going to be negative not
 

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.160
is always going to be negative not
because the people don't love you not

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.170
because the people don't love you not
 

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.630
because the people don't love you not
because they don't care about you

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:29.640
because they don't care about you
 

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.720
because they don't care about you
but because nobody's seen this problem

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:32.730
but because nobody's seen this problem
 

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.700
but because nobody's seen this problem
in that dimension and they'll continue

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:34.710
in that dimension and they'll continue
 

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.770
in that dimension and they'll continue
for a while and then there's this moment

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:36.780
for a while and then there's this moment
 

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.980
for a while and then there's this moment
which I love which is when something

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:39.990
which I love which is when something
 

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.960
which I love which is when something
goes from the impossible and it will

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:41.970
goes from the impossible and it will
 

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.530
goes from the impossible and it will
quickly go to the inevitable and so it's

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540
quickly go to the inevitable and so it's
 

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.680
quickly go to the inevitable and so it's
that moment of impossible to inevitable

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:48.690
that moment of impossible to inevitable
 

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.259
that moment of impossible to inevitable
in many technologies that swap happens

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:51.269
in many technologies that swap happens
 

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:55.670
in many technologies that swap happens
not over 20 years but over a month and

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680
not over 20 years but over a month and
 

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.740
not over 20 years but over a month and
that's what excites me

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:01.750
 
 

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.139
