Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.400
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
I'm Stephanie Marcus

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.840
from the Science, Technology
and Business Division.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.030
I think it was appropriate that
we had a mini derecho last night

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.330
in advance of our talk on water.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.520
Today we're going to not look
into outer space, as we often do

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.140
in these lectures, but we're
going to look at our own planet,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.780
and learn how NASA is using
satellite observations

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.100
to monitor water and its
sustainability and security.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.000
And we're lucky today
to have Dr. John Bolten

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.490
from NASA Goddard.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.090
And I will have to read his
title, because they always have

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.500
so many titles at NASA.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.900
But for today he is the
Associate Program Manager

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.150
of Water Resources for the
NASA Applied Sciences Program.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.230
Dr. Bolten's background is
in geology, with an emphasis

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.850
on hydrology and remote sensing.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.510
So please help me welcome
Dr. Bolten to the Library.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.180
[ Applause ]

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.480
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Thank
you so much.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.780
And thank you everyone
for coming

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.210
and spending an hour
with me today.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.960
It's quite an honor to be here.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.940
So today I'm going to be
telling a bit of a story

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.540
about Earth science,
and what NASA does.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.670
We have a lot of
activities that are focused

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.000
on observing the earth, and
using all these fancy tools

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.990
and technology that's
being developed at NASA

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.230
for observing the earth.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.090
And my focus today
will be on water,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.000
and how we use observations from
satellite, numerical modeling

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.340
for water security and
global water sustainability.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.710
So a quick background.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.600
A lot of people say, "What is
NASA doing with Earth science?"

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.390
In fact, we do quite a bit

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.320
of Earth-science-focused
research and applications.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.050
In the NASA Applied Sciences
Program the mission statement is

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.950
to provide innovative
solutions of applications

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.870
of NASA satellites
and numerical modeling

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.510
for improving decision making.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.980
And we work with a lot of
institutions around the world

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.890
for improving their
decision making,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.370
and also integrating these
solutions into their policies

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.060
and their business solutions.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.590
So let's take this.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.130
Does anyone know what this is?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.430
Does that look familiar?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.730
This is a quiz.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.590
It's a current event,
this, in the news a lot.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.600
What this is is actually
a cattle farm.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.140
Okay? And you're seeing
the cattle farm surrounded

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.800
by agricultural fields.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.100
So why is this relevant?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.400
Why is this important?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.410
Well, we've heard about
the recent E.coli outbreak.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.410
Now in a cattle farm if
there's too much moisture

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.140
in the soil, it breeds disease.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.880
And if there's too
little, it leads to dust.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.580
And that dust can carry
bacteria, including E.coli.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.590
And it can spread to
the surrounding fields.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.260
So this is one quick example

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.680
of how Earth science can be
applied, and is contributing

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.710
to our better understanding
of our world in recent events.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.060
Here's another recent event.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.650
This is in Cape Town,
South Africa.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.890
So you may have heard of
Cape Town's recent struggle

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.190
with water.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.710
So they actually have
something they call "Zero Day."

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.910
This is the day that Cape
Town will run out of water.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.050
And this is an unprecedented
event where a town, Cape Town,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.190
I think the population is
roughly half a million people.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.360
And they expect to
run out of water.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.760
Initially it was going
to be in June 2018.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.820
And they've moved it
forward a bit to 2019.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.180
So there's a lot of
focus on Cape Town.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.020
I'll come back to this.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.320
But it's a really good example.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.410
So within water you don't
want to have too little of it,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.060
you don't want to
have too much of it.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.010
Right? And that's what
I'll be talking about.

in Ellicott City.

now in a restaurant --

[ Video Ends ]

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.070
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: So that was
an attention-grabbing video.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.270
But this happened a mile from
my house in Ellicott City.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.610
In fact, an hour before this
event happens I bought a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.910
Japanese pressing

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.570
of Led Zeppelin IV right
in this record store.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.000
And I was actually
talking to the store owner

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.340
about what hydrology is.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.900
And I said, "Well, hydrology
is the study of water

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.440
and the forecasting of
floods and droughts."

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.000
I saw him the next
day, gave him a hug.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.470
And he said, "Hydrology.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.560
I know what that is."

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.490
But a lot of people's lives
were uprooted from this event.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.790
Two people lost their lives.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.520
And a lot of people
were seriously injured.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.580
So it really brings it home.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.390
This is only a few miles
away in Ellicott City.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.470
And on that note, roughly 90%

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.500
of natural disasters
are related to water.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.400
Okay? And, in fact,
water is now recognized

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.540
as the number one threat
multiplier in the world.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.360
So why is NASA interested
in water?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.080
You know? It's because water
is used for agriculture.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.440
It's used for a lot of things.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.040
Agriculture is a
global enterprise.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.580
So the cost of wheat

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.460
in the United States is directly
relevant to the productivity

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.970
of wheat in South
America or Central Asia.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.270
Okay? So for that reason we need

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.550
to set our sights a
little bit broader

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.790
than just the United States.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.560
So on that note, this is one

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.060
of the most iconic
images ever taken.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.240
Right? So this is
"The Blue Marble."

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.560
And it really is blue.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.110
Everything you see here
that's blue or white is water.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.720
Right? And if you go down
through the numbers here,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.490
and you think, "Well, let's
go back to junior high school.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.200
Let's go back to
the water cycle."

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.300
Right? It's pretty simple.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.700
Water falls from
clouds, precipitates.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.650
Some of it is stored in snow,

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.500
and some of it's
stored in glaciers.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.390
Some of it runs down.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.070
It's stored in surface
water and in reservoirs

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.740
and lakes and in streams.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.570
Some of it meets groundwater.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.710
It makes its way
back to the oceans.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.490
And, eventually,
evaporates up to clouds.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.180
Right? Pretty simple.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.860
So our challenge here is to,
as accurately as possible,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.190
characterize, understand

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.270
and predict each component
of this water cycle.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.720
Right? And from that we'll have
a better idea of how to assess

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.560
and mitigate extreme
events like these floods

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.280
and drought events
that are occurring.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.850
So, you know, we are
in "The Blue Marble."

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.680
Right? Because over 70% of the
planet is covered by water.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.390
Right? However, only
a tiny portion,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.030
about 2.5% is fresh water.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.890
So it's a very small fraction.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:22.930
In fact, of that 2.5% over
half of it is in glaciers.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.810
There's only a small
portion that is fresh water

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.450
that is available to us through
surface water or ground water.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.180
Okay, and if you look
at that, okay, well,

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.480
there's lots of water.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.780
There's a little bit left.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.080
Where is that water going?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.360
Most of its used
for agriculture.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.510
Right? And, so, this
is where, you know,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.720
with the Applied Sciences
Program at NASA we're looking

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.360
at innovative solutions
of monitoring water use.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.100
You can actually
measure the amount

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.030
of water that's being applied
and lost through plants.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:57.820
So we can encourage people
to move from flood irrigation

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.000
to drip irrigation, more
efficient uses of water.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So I have a five-year-old
daughter.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.300
Her name's Lily [assumed
spelling].

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.520
Right? By the time she's my age
there'll be roughly nine billion

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.820
people on the planet.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.600
When I was born there
was nearly four billion.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.480
Okay? That's a pretty extreme
trend here we're seeing.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.360
So the challenge is
how do we prepare

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.190
for this increased
population globally.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.420
What is their relationship
with water going to be?

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.120
Is there enough water
to go around?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.720
I'll tell you right now
there is enough water.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.130
But if we look at
the distribution

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.740
of the global population
density, we see some areas

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.280
where there's a high population.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.460
Right? And if we look at
a map of water stress,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.290
so simply the ratio
of water withdrawal

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.960
to water availability, we
see in these similar areas,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.930
the same areas we're
seeing with high population,

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.770
there's high-water stress.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.730
So, in fact, a lot of the areas
that have water insecurity

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.810
and food insecurity are these
areas with high population

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.110
and future population
increases that are projected.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.940
So our challenge here is to find

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.770
out how we can keep
what we have,

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.870
properly manage the
water that is available.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.550
Now a similar trend that we
see here, this is Moore's Law.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.430
Okay? And it, essentially, says
that every two years the number

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.860
of transistors in a
circuit will double.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.630
Right? So my iPhone here,
if you look at this, oh,

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.190
this was another quiz.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.890
Does anyone know what this is?

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.190
&gt;&gt; The ENIAC?

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.490
&gt;&gt; The ENIAC computer.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.100
Right. So this is in 1946.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.220
This is considered the
first quote/unquote

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.880
"general-purpose computer."

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.750
Right? So my iPhone here
is 230 million times faster

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.680
than the ENIAC computer.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.690
And that's just 70 years ago.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.390
So technology is advancing,

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.150
population increase
is also advancing.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.710
So we have all kinds
of fancy tools and ways

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.000
to measure different parts
of the global water cycle.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.490
Right? We can go out and
measure the amount of rainfall.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.210
Right? It's not rocket science.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.860
Okay? We can also
look at snow depth.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.160
This definitely isn't
rocket science.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.740
They literally just
take a meter stick,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.020
and measure the amount of snow.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.160
But, in fact, if you look at,
let's see, San Joaquin Valley

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.100
in California, most of their
water is sourced by snowpack.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.860
Okay? So if they're going to
prepare for the amount of water

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.390
in the next season, they go
out, they get a bunch of people

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.700
where they go out and
use these meter sticks,

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.210
and they measure the
amount of snowpack.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.440
Okay? And from that they
derive a Snow Water Equivalent,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.080
the amount of water
that's held in that.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.890
And from that they can determine
how much water will be available

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.190
next season.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.470
Okay. You can also look at
how much water is evaporating

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.550
from the land surface
and from plants

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.790
through evapotranspiration.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.500
Okay? These are different
sensors of doing this.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.520
You can also use something
called a "ThetaProbe," which,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.800
essentially, measures
the electronic resistance

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.100
of the soil.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.400
So the amount of water

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.530
in the soil is measured
by this instrument.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.210
It gives you the
amount of soil moisture.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.070
You can also look at river flow.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.480
Okay? All these gauge stations,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.600
all these in situ
datasets are great.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.700
And you can also
look at groundwater.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.960
You can go out somewhere,
and you dig a well,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.300
and you have an idea of
how much water there is.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.140
Now the problem with this is

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.740
that ground stations
are expensive,

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.930
and they are difficult
to maintain.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.150
And if you look at
just the distribution

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.790
in the United States, this
is groundwater, right,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.420
Groundwater Climate
Response Network.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.790
There's not many now.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.680
There's not many
observations here.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.860
If you look globally, this is
the Global Telecommunication

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.740
System, you can see
there's a lot of areas

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.140
without a yellow dot on it.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.320
And, so, the message here is
that ground data is expensive,

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.110
it's difficult to maintain.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.500
And especially when
you're concerned

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:00.030
about transboundary aquifers and
crossing political boundaries,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.910
it's very difficult
to share data.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.220
You know, you can have my
data, but you can't have it.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.260
I can have it, but I'm not
going to give it to this guy.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.560
It's a huge issue.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.910
But when you're dealing with a
watershed, when you're dealing

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.040
with a resource that's
common to everyone,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.620
you need this common sharing
of water and water data.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.720
So going back also to 1946,
this is October 26, 1946.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.790
This is the first image ever
taken of the planet Earth.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.290
Some scientists launched
a Delta II rocket

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.950
from the White Sands Air
Force Base in California.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.340
And they were lucky
enough to get this picture.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.040
And initially they were all
concerned about the clouds.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.000
They're like, "Oh,
these clouds are,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.350
you know, messing up our view."

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.930
But, in fact, we know now
that's really what we're after.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.330
So if we go back
again to junior high,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.630
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:58.040
Right? So our eyes
capture the ambient light.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.030
We see colors.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:04.010
These colors, in fact, are
only a very small fraction

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.170
of the total electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.310
Right? We're only
seeing a little bit.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.370
So all this energy's
down from the sun.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.920
Some of it's reflected
through visible light.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.380
Some of it is reflected
through x-rays

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.350
and ultraviolet microwaves
and radio waves.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:26.700
So we can use these other parts
of the electromagnetic spectrum

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.640
to assess parts of the
global water cycle.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:36.560
A tree looks very different
in infrared or near frared

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.280
than it does in visible light.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.490
In fact, it tells us
different information

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.200
than the visible light.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.580
So we get beautiful pictures
like this, but we're also able

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.970
to look at not only is the
tree green, is it yellow,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.590
but is it healthy, is its
senescing, is it growing,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.800
how much water is it using.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.870
So we can also use
different parts

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.660
of the electromagnetic
spectrum, like microwaves,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.960
which are correlated with the
amount of moisture in soil.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.650
So we're combining all these
different technologies trying

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.440
to tell that story of
the water landscape

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.680
at that global water
cycle, different components,

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.580
each different component,
how can we measure

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.170
and predict each part.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:24.610
So if you fast forward to 2018,
NASA has a whole constellation

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.490
of satellites that utilize
different components

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.930
of the electromagnetic
spectrum for focusing

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.250
and monitoring different
components of the water cycle.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.830
And we're also collaborating

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.680
with the International
Space Station.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.900
We have instruments
there that stay on for

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.620
about one to three years.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.810
And what's unique about the
ISS is it has a slightly

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.160
unique orbit.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.460
So it captures things

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.070
that aren't captured
by other satellites.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:59.120
So the whole idea is, let's
see, as frequently as possible

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.390
and as accurately as possible,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.240
monitor different parts
of that water cycle.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.020
So I'm going to show
a few examples

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.870
of what we're seeing from space.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.750
This is one of NASA's recently
launched satellites called the

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.120
"Global Precipitation
Measurement Mission," GPM.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.670
So instead of just having a
few gauges all over, you know,

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.880
we can now have every 30
minutes on the planet,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.370
we have an estimate
of precipitation.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.590
Right? Not just over land,
but over sea as well.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:35.740
And this is extremely powerful
if your business is hydrology,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:42.240
okay, and figuring out where
the water is and where it isn't.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.190
Another satellite that is
widely used is "MODIS."

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.510
It's the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.690
And what's really neat about
this is you see this sort

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.010
of pulsing, this
breathing of the planet.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.950
And you see it growing and
senescing of vegetation.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.890
Right? And this is
sped up, obviously,

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.670
but through MODIS we get
frequent observations

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.270
of vegetation health.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.780
And this is one of the
most widely used satellites

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.640
that NASA has.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.670
A couple missions that
are up and coming,

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.390
about to be launched,
are exciting.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.760
One of them is called "ICESat."

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.740
And this is using Lidar,
or laser altimetry.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.190
And think about this.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.970
From space, from several
hundred kilometers up,

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:39.590
you can detect the height
of water or a glacier

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.320
with an accuracy of centimeters.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.290
Okay? This is a highly
anticipated mission,

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.740
as well as the Surface
Water Ocean Topography,

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.640
or SWOT, Mission.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.730
This uses a slightly
different technology.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.590
It's a synthetic aperture
radar interferometric system.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.960
I was nervous about
saying that, but I did it.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.930
But the idea here is to measure
the topography of the ocean,

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:11.450
of the ocean surface and also
the rivers and reservoirs.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.160
So I just find it pretty
amazing to think from hundreds

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.420
of kilometers up you're able to
tell the height of a reservoir

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.420
or lake, or even a river, within
the accuracy of centimeters.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.620
That's pretty wild.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.230
One of my favorite missions
I talk about is "GRACE."

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.010
It's stands for the Gravity
Recovery and Climate Experiment.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.570
And there's a follow-on
mission to be launched here

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.670
in about the next month, a
GRACE II, or a GRACE follow-on.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.910
But what makes GRACE unique?

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.060
It's not a satellite
looking down at the earth.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.250
In fact, it's two
satellites flying in tandem

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.550
that are looking at each other.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.230
They're not looking down.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.530
So they're looking
at each other.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.340
Right? They're looking
at each other,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.530
and they're measuring
this horizontal distance

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.870
within the accuracy
of one red blood cell,

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.170
if you can believe that.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.360
Right? So if there's a mountain
or a large landmass here,

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.230
that first satellite will be
pulled forward just slightly.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.560
And this horizontal
distance will change.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.330
Okay? And they keep on doing
that, they go around the planet,

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.630
go around and go around.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.700
And what they're doing
is they're mapping the

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.990
gravitational pull of the earth,
of the different land masses.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.910
And a change from one month

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.330
to the next is a
gravitational anomaly.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.580
Now mountains really
don't move that quickly.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.500
So if you see a large anomaly,
you can infer a movement

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.800
of water, because
water has mass.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.000
And, so, in fact, what
you're seeing here,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.060
these different colors
are the terrestrial water

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.730
storage anomalies.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.720
And this was really a game
changer for hydrology,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.470
because we're always trying
to solve the water budget for

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.160
"our residual is
always groundwater."

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.970
You know, what's
the Delta storage?

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.350
What's the change in storage?

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.020
Well, now we have a
direct observation

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.340
of that change in storage.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:06.840
And it's a truly novel satellite
mission launched by NASA.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.000
Now this is really cool.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.370
First of all, I think that Bob
Ross would probably be super

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.180
jealous of the happy
clouds here.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.460
Because what you see, all this
is is two satellite observations

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.780
laid over each other.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.800
So you have a satellite-based
soil moisture observation shown

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.470
here in blue and orange.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.650
These are soil moisture
anomalies.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.280
And the yellow and red
are GPM precipitation.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.750
Right? It kind of makes sense.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.260
Where it rains the
soil gets wet.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.600
Right? But it's really useful
for helping convey this concept

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.390
of precipitation memory.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.570
Where is it raining
and where is it not?

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.450
Where is the water
holding water,

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.770
or where is the soil holding
water, where is it not?

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.600
And it's become a pretty
cool educational tool.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.360
But it also is really useful
for just showing the utility

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.790
of combining multiple
datasets from satellite,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.420
and helping tell this story

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.280
of the global water
cycle more completely.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.050
So back to the water cycle.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.350
All right.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.650
So we have all these
different observations.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.950
We're sensing precipitation.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.960
We can detect rivers and
reservoirs, and all this stuff.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.700
Okay? But what do
you do with it?

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.170
Well, where the rubber
meets the road really is

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.870
through numerical modeling
and land surface modeling.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:31.180
And all that is is an
estimation of reality.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.230
Right? It's based on physical
equations that are, hopefully,

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.900
physically consistent.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.610
You're trying to mimic
what you see in nature.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.110
You're trying to mimic if a
certain temperature and pressure

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.820
in this cloud, when will
it precipitate water.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.820
Right? It kind of makes sense.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.990
A lot of these equations have
been derived in laboratories.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.840
And then they're applied

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.360
to real-world applications
like we see here.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.680
So we have all kinds
of different equations,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.170
numerical models that we
integrate these observations

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.800
of satellite, we take
these observations

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.130
of in situ observations and
gauge data, and we just try

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.850
to tell that story more
completely in a way

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.700
that is physically consistent

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.220
and makes sense and
that we can use.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.700
And when you understand
what's happening now,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.580
you have a better idea of
what's going to happen tomorrow.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.870
And that's what it
all boils down to.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.570
So back to "The Blue Marble."

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.800
Where are we?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.790
So it's something that I
think most people are familiar

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.910
with is the drought
that occurred

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.990
in California a couple
years ago.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.290
So if you just look

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.230
at the terrestrial water
storage changes in California

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.910
from the GRACE satellite,
and you can see here,

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.370
what we're seeing, there's
a little red dot that goes.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.650
And you can see this trend,
a significant decrease

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.150
in terrestrial water storage.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.480
And, again, it repeats.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.500
And this made a lot of headlines
in the news, because, for one,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.810
it's very easy to
see, "Okay red is bad.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.250
Blue is good."

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.530
You know, California,
it's going down.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.110
But what it did is
help tell part

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.970
of that water landscape
story for California.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.910
Now if we go back to Cape Town,
right, so let's say, "Oh, yeah,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.820
Cape Town, it says they're
going to run out of water.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.590
They're experiencing a drought."

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.880
Okay. Well, what does that mean?

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.930
How can water managers
there prepare?

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:27.850
What are they going to do?

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.150
Is it really a drought?

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.450
And how extensive will it be?

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.070
And how long will it last?

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.410
You know? What happens?

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.730
So the first thing they do is
you look at the climatology,

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.170
which is, essentially, just a
long-term record of weather.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.710
And, you know, every area
has this unique climatology.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:46.310
So this is what's happened in
the past, and what is it going

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.160
to look like today or
tomorrow or next year.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.790
So we use numerical modeling
to look at seasonal forecasts.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.240
Okay? And you say, "Okay, well,
what may it look like in May

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.110
to July of 2018, all the way
up to September, October 2018?"

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.410
It's very similar.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.710
In fact, it's the same
thing you see when you turn

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.170
on the Weather Channel.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.290
Right? Those are
short-term forecasts.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.770
Well, there's long-term
forecasts as well,

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.510
but they're all based
on the same thing.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.800
You need accurate observations
to initialize those models.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.540
And you're providing
estimates, in this case,

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.550
of a future climatology, or
future forecasts of the weather.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.170
So what does soil moisture
look like in Cape Town?

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.100
And how is that related
to the drought?

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.250
Well, the whole idea is
having a long-term record,

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:40.360
have a historical perspective
of all of these variables

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.060
of the global water cycle.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.420
So we see here, if we look at
an anomaly of soil moisture,

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.020
we can look at this year's
soil moisture compared

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.320
to last year's.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.540
It's very straightforward,
very simple for that point.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.740
But then if you isolate
different areas, in this case,

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.400
of southern Africa that are
used for agriculture, well,

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.250
soil moisture is a
leading indicator

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.350
of agriculture, of drought.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.990
Right? So we say that
the soil moisture now,

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.080
the soil moisture anomaly we
have now is a leading indicator

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.640
of vegetation next
month or next week.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.330
So we use this as a way

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.860
of forecasting future
agricultural drought.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.650
In fact, the definition

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.710
of agricultural drought is
the deficit of soil moisture.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.820
Soil moisture's dear
to my heart.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.760
I've been studying it for years.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.490
And it's turned out to be one
of the most important variables

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.520
in hydrology, because
it's a boundary condition

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.010
between the land surface
and the atmosphere.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.790
Just like your body, when you
get hot, your body sweats.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.660
Right? And that evaporative
cooling cools your body down.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.420
The same thing happens
on the land surface.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.050
So the amount of moisture
in just the top one

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.450
to five centimeters of
soil has a direct influence

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.190
on that local weather
and global climate.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.090
And it's really used for
initializing climate models.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.780
So this image shows the
African Drought Monitor.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.880
This is by the Climate
Analytics Group from Princeton.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.530
And you see this, and
they've taken these data,

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.970
and they derived the Soil
Moisture Ground Index.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.940
And you just see from one
change, this is April 22,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:19.990
2018 to April 29, 2018.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.490
And the whole idea is putting
this in a story that makes sense

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.190
that is relevant to
the previous day's

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.430
and future forecast
for that area.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.930
So I'm focusing on Cape
Town for a couple reasons.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:34.990
One is because it's in the news.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.790
And two is that we're
collaborating

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:42.920
with several other agencies to
try to assess and help the city

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.890
of Cape Town, and the
country of South Africa,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.220
for assessing their
current drought conditions.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.350
And, so, we were working
with the Department of State.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.220
And we had a bunch of people
come in, and say, "Well,

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.620
what's happening right now?"

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.930
Well, if we look at the
reservoirs, you know,

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.040
thankfully, we have a
relatively long-term record

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.720
of reservoir storage.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.650
So these are the six main
reservoirs that feed Cape Town.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.770
And you don't need to be a
hydrologist, you don't need

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:15.100
to be someone from NASA to look
at this graph, and say, "Hm.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.820
I see a trend.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.320
These are decreasing."

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.320
Okay? Well, it's not just that.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.480
It's about how much
water's being used, right,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.960
and how much you expect to have.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.370
You can also look at
stream flow within the area.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.490
But what if there
aren't gauges there?

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.770
What if there's a
lack of, you know,

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.310
it's a poorly (inaudible)
network of stream gauge data?

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.720
Well, we can model
that stream flow.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.590
And, so, that's what
we're showing here.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.360
We have several different
models.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.330
And we're looking at our
modeled stream flow compared

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.420
to our observed stream flow.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.410
And what does groundwater
look like?

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.710
So we're using GRACE.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.750
So this is in the Orange
River Basin in that same area.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:00.800
So you have historical record
of terrestrial water storage,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.980
and evapotranspiration as well.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.390
So my point here is we're going

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.530
through all the different
components of that water cycle

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:09.000
that I showed earlier, and
saying, "Well, you know what?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.840
From MODIS and numerical
modeling, and other things,

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.240
we're able to look, in this
case, at evapotranspiration.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.850
And what does the
spatial distribution

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.930
of evapotranspiration
look like in that area?

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:27.120
You boil this all
down, and what you want

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.650
to get is a metric
of water stress.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.400
You know, we're not interested
in just pretty pictures.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.190
We want to know what's it look
like, what's really happening.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.510
Okay? But where it
really matters, okay,

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.970
you take all this data and all
these fancy pictures and stuff,

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.050
and this is a busy
slide on purpose.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.370
Okay? What this is
this is moving

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.240
from data to decision making.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.200
Okay? And this is a
dashboard that's been provided

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.540
to the city of Cape Town.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.370
And they have a percent

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.110
of dam storage that's
currently available,

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:03.220
the future yield changes,
and they have a lot

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.670
of historical perspective
put in and tied

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.330
to the current conditions
of Cape Town, all relating

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.330
to reservoir storage,
current drought conditions,

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.510
current precipitation and
future forecasts of that water.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.350
And that is what it's all about.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:24.120
Now if we go back to flooding,

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.060
Ellicott City was a
pretty scary video.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.740
Right? Well, the
Applied Sciences Program

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.380
of NASA has been partnering
with Thailand and groups

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.510
in the Lower Mekong River Basin.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.500
So we've been working with
the Mekong River Commission

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.220
and the Asian Disaster
Preparedness Center,

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.020
working with them, because in
the Lower Mekong River Basin

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:50.190
there's nearly 60 million
people who live there,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.340
and their livelihoods
depend on the Mekong River.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.520
That's their main
protein source.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.870
But it's also one of the
most heavily dammed areas

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.330
in the world.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.040
And it's affecting
a lot of things.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.450
And it's also an area
that is extremely prone

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.220
to massive flooding.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:12.820
So we've developed a system for
assessing near real-time mapping

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.260
of flooded areas, right,

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.140
combined with socioeconomic
data.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.090
Okay? So you can say, "Hey,

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.510
it flooded there
yesterday I can see,

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.170
because the MODIS data looks
a little bit different.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.180
This vegetation is covered."

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.480
Okay. That's great.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.480
But in addition to just where
your boots are going to get wet,

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.810
what's really useful is saying,
"Well, this is the percent

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.250
of the population
that's affected.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.410
These are the acres of rice
that have been inundated.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.250
These are the number of
schools and hospitals

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.590
that have been flooded
by the event

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.240
that happened 12 hours ago."

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.690
That's moving from data
to decision making.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.320
So what we've come up
with, and this is a paper

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.790
that was just published two
weeks ago, we've tied this

00:30:54.790 --> 00:31:00.110
with a damage assessment
system, where, essentially,

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:05.240
levels of flooding are tied
to a monetary value of damage.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.600
And, so, we can tie
this all in together.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:14.200
We can come up with a rapid
assessment of dollars of damage.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:20.070
And from that you can allocate
resources, you can focus areas

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:25.390
of interest for mitigating
flood damage and flood risks.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.500
So we're working
with our friends here

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.660
from the Asian Disaster
Preparedness Center.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.970
We're all huddling around.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.740
This image was not
staged at all.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:37.450
But we're huddling around
and we're building a system.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.930
And the idea is that we're
taking this technology that's

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.040
constantly developing,
and we're working

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.560
to develop something novel.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.490
And this is a little video of
something that we're developing

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:54.230
for the Asian Disaster
Preparedness Center,

00:31:54.230 --> 00:32:01.080
so that they can take this
data, and then they can use it

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.660
to tease out information
and improve management of,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.810
in this case, the Flood
Management Mitigation Program.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.830
This was sent to me this
morning at 6 a.m. from Bangkok.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:24.170
So for me it's really exciting,
because we're, you know,

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.320
taking all the great
innovative data and cool things,

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.660
and working towards
capacity building,

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.470
working towards understanding
our world better, and managing

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.150
that water in a more
efficient way.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.300
So we have lots of satellites.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.130
We have lots of data.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:47.000
I had some crazy stats about
how fast computers are now.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.690
Well, this graph
is also following

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.690
that same population
trend graph.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.970
But what you see, actually it
shows the archive volume just

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.830
from NASA alone of data stored.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:03.610
And on your y axis here,
this is petabytes of data.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.660
So we are inundated with data.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.630
There's tons and tons
and tons of data.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.290
And this is only
going to increase.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:15.550
Right? And for that reason
we're embracing high-performance

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:20.880
computing and cloud computing,
especially if you're interested

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.700
in providing solutions
for areas of the world

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.020
that are water insecure
and food insecure.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.770
A lot of times these are
the areas of the world

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.570
that also lack high-computing
capabilities.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.170
They don't have giant
Linux servers,

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.470
you know, readily available.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.730
Or they don't have
the time or technology

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.090
for storing all this data.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:44.300
So by moving towards cloud
computing we can develop

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.070
solutions here that is
widely usable by people,

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.630
and it's easily accessible.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:55.490
So this is a new trend
on the horizon here.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.610
So I've given you a
very quick overview

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.700
of some water resources
applications and things.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.780
But I encourage everyone
to check

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.690
out the NASA Applied
Sciences Program.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.990
It's a wonderful program.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:10.860
We have many, many,
many exciting things

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.730
that I didn't get a
chance to discuss today.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.720
So I encourage you to
go to the website here.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:20.090
We have examples of different
projects, and an entire list

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:24.010
of all our partners and end
users that we are working

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.230
with to develop these
innovative solutions.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:31.590
And my last slide,
this is my daughter.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.720
And this is water.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.020
She's in the shower.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.300
So I just want to leave you
with, like, our task here is

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:45.090
to really embrace
technology, understand science.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.000
We see that just within the last
70 years we've had a dramatic

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.650
increase in our computing
capability.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.750
We've had a dramatic increase
in the number of satellites,

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.870
or ways to view the
planet Earth from space.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:03.500
And now we have the ability
to integrate all these data

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.750
and all these new technologies,
and provide them to people

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.060
for improved capacity building,

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.740
and improved understanding
of our world.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.560
And I'm always thinking,
"What, you know,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.210
what kind of world am I going
to leave for my daughter?

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.520
What is her relationship
with water going to be?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.340
Will it be better or worse?"

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.260
Well, she's smiling
right now, so I'm happy.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.510
Thank you so much.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.150
[ Applause ]

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.450
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Thank you.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.150
Actually, you said you like to
talk when you've got more time,

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.850
but, hopefully, we'll
have a lot of questions.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.610
And you can always fill them
out with more information.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:45.910
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Sure.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.210
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: We'd like
you to repeat the questions

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.890
so that everyone can hear it.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.210
And go right ahead.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.510
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Yes, sir?

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.810
&gt;&gt; Are there any
plans to deploy any

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:58.550
of this water technology towards
other planets in our search

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:02.150
for water on Mars
and other places?

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.170
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: So, yeah, the
question is do we apply some

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.260
of these technologies
for other planets.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.970
Well, a lot of these
technologies have developed

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.570
in parallel with, it's
the same technology.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:18.050
In fact, the GRACE satellite
that I showed that actually came

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:21.220
from I believe it
was a lunar mission.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.890
And, so, the answer
is, "Yes, there's,

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:27.470
I'm sure you're familiar with
the Mars and the Mars Rover."

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.420
I actually share a
coffeepot with these guys.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.720
And they're on Martian time,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.900
because they have to
babysit the Rover.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.650
But that's using
similar technology.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:41.120
So the answer is yes.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.100
But it's more difficult to
get some of these in space.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.400
The Soil Moisture
Mission that I showed,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.800
the Soil Moisture
Active Passive Mission,

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.440
you really need a
passive instrument,

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.740
or a passive aperture, or radar,
or sorry, antenna in space.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.410
And it's really difficult to get
something that's, in this case,

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.330
in the microwave in
the L Band frequency.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.660
So the wavelength is pretty
long, about 21 centimeters.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.060
So to get something in
space that can capture

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.560
that relatively weak signal,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.800
they had to develop this
very novel dish system

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.240
that would fold up
into a rocket.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.400
And then it launched into
space, and then it folded

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.900
out into this beautiful
array of antennae.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.750
And that was the
first of its kind.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.230
And that was just
launched in 2015.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.130
And the future looks bright.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.430
Yeah. Yes?

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:39.670
&gt;&gt; Do you have a slide
that talks about how much

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:43.620
of our fresh water
[inaudible] declining glacier?

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.120
So is that affecting our
ability to have fresh water?

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.420
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Yes.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.980
So the question is
is the decline

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.470
in glaciers affecting
our fresh water.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:57.790
So this is an entire
area of research

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:03.240
that is widely focused
on right now.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.370
I mentioned the ICESat Mission.

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:11.650
And one of its purposes
is measuring glaciers,

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:18.190
the change in glaciers, and the
change in ice storage of water.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.730
And I also mentioned Cape Town.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.730
And it's really not
a joke anymore,

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:26.910
but they've actually estimated
it would cost a $130 million

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.250
to tow a glacier to
the city of Cape Town

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.130
to provide fresh water.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.500
And this is seriously
being considered right now.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.680
But as far as climate change,

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.480
and understanding global
climate, and relating

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.240
that to glaciers, what
we're seeing is the

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.740
declining glaciers.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.330
It's a significant
part of that equation

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:51.190
of the global water cycle.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.020
So the answer is yes.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.920
And I could talk about
this all afternoon.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.800
But it has a major impact
on ocean circulation

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.280
and resulting climate.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.910
So there's all these
future, I showed a few

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.500
of the climate forecasts,

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.510
where there's a big school
these forecast systems

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:15.160
that incorporate global
ocean circulation,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.080
and also incorporate
future climate scenarios,

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:23.120
where they have a scenario
analysis of withdrawing glaciers

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.790
and melting of that water,
and the additional fresh water

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:30.550
into that system,
and what will happen.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:31.890
Yes?

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.190
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] going forward,

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:37.310
are you making long-range
forecasts

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.780
about future sustainability

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:46.700
and what the [inaudible] options
might be for addressing them?

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.000
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Good question.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.220
The question is looking
at future sustainability

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.320
and future implications
of water sustainability.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.750
And the answer is yes.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.450
And what I showed here
was really just one part

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.750
of that equation.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.050
Right?

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.350
I showed the earth observations.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:06.150
Another part is management
of water, political will,

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:11.450
which is a huge component, and
management of those resources.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:15.080
And that's where it takes
more than just someone looking

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.660
at satellite observations

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.980
or numerical modeling
saying, "Okay.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.540
This is what might happen,"

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.870
but also a sharing
of those resources.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.870
If I can encourage a group
of people to move away

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.290
from flood-based irrigation
towards drip irrigation,

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.320
or if I can encourage
them to say, "Well, look,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.930
this is the impact that
building 13 dams on this river

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.590
in the next ten years will
have on the fisheries industry,

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:44.800
will have on the local
agriculture industry."

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:50.280
And that's where we take
these scenarios we have and,

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:56.120
hopefully, we can work with
governments and, hopefully,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.420
inform these future decisions.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.240
So the answer is yes.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.440
And, you know, not everything
can be solved by a satellite.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.350
A lot of it comes down to
working closely with people

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:12.000
in that country, because,
let's see, every disaster

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.290
and every water need is unique.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.120
And every solution must
be unique to meet that.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.870
And that's what's really cool.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:21.380
It's kind of job security for us

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.900
and the Applied Sciences
Program, because there's

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.760
so much need for
understanding water.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.370
If you have these scary
statistics, and say, yes,

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:33.530
the number one threat multiplier
in the world, there are, well,

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.800
I'm not going to go into it,
but there's a lot of examples

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.580
of where water has led
to a lack of water,

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:47.480
or too much water has led to
uprisings, and not good things.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.560
Thanks for the question.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:56.100
Yes? In the back, in the back.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.400
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.610
This is a related question,
but maybe a little bit more

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.860
on the technology end.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:12.300
I apologize I came in a little
bit [inaudible] touched on this

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.600
in the beginning [inaudible].

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:20.700
But it seems to me that when
you're dealing with satellites

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:27.050
and sensing of what's
happening with water,

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:33.080
you're also wrestling
with really three forces

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.160
that are hard to wrestle
with [inaudible] a lot

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.460
of smart [inaudible]

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:45.530
and probably data isn't
available through satellite.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.840
One is just natural
variability [inaudible].

00:42:49.840 --> 00:43:00.560
Second [inaudible] talked about
a fair amount in climate change.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.390
So there's a long wiggle as well

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.550
as a short wiggle going
[inaudible] wiggle [inaudible]

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.380
the long-term trend.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:21.280
But the third is also
the demand component.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.040
What's happening with
human demand for water--

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.340
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Right.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.210
&gt;&gt; Which is much
harder to get at.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:37.970
And I'm just curious as to
how you wrestle with that,

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:43.620
and integrate that
into, for example,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.220
a consideration of drought.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.090
Drought is, in some
ways, a natural event,

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:53.150
but it also is affected by the
demands the farmers are making

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.490
on the soil, for example,

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.550
on irrigation [inaudible]
population, generally.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:03.790
For example, in Cape Town during
this whole crisis Cape Town's

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:08.550
population has continued
to grow by tens

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:09.850
of thousands of [inaudible].

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.230
More and more people
are [inaudible] water.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.430
[inaudible] research question
I've been [inaudible] Lake Chad

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.460
is disappearing [inaudible]
something similar

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.560
to the Aral Sea.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.690
Some people say that there's
climate change at work.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.010
And other people point
out that the number

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.770
of farmers withdrawing water

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:33.610
from Lake Chad has been
increasing dramatically

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:37.490
as the population growth is
extremely rapid in that area.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:42.420
And I'm just wondering
do you integrate some

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:48.200
of your satellite measurements
with demographic analyses

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.840
and socioeconomic analyses

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.230
that actually show [inaudible]
increasing demand, and how much

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.530
of the big picture is that.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.830
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Excellent
question.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.500
If I can boil it
down, essentially,

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.800
that how do you capture
demand for water,

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.340
and how do you capture local
management and local demand

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.780
into these strategies.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.160
And, well, using Lake Chad as
an example, I was planning to go

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.410
over there and dig
a number of wells

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:18.710
with the local universities,
but Boko Haram came in,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.010
and I wasn't allowed to go.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:24.060
But it's difficult to learn
more than you can by working

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.620
with locals, because they
have their local practices,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.810
and they have their
local demands.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.890
Right? In regard to the climate
change question and all this,

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.980
it all boils down
to understanding

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.430
and capturing the processes, in
this case, of the water cycle

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.600
and the energy cycle
and the carbon cycle,

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.970
because they're all
interrelated.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.230
Right? And moving from
the very different thing

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.240
between beliefs and knowledge.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.700
Okay? Well, I know something,
because I observed it.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.660
I know something, because I've
observed it and I predicted it,

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.960
and I've 've seen it again.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.260
And if you don't
believe in something,

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.560
that's something
entirely different.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.860
So it all comes down to
repeating these observations,

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.160
having a historical long-term
record of observations.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.460
In this case, as you mentioned,
there's different scenarios

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.760
or different causes and
components of climate change,

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.060
and how it will be realized.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.360
But something that
we are observing is

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.660
that it'll be realized
mostly in the water cycle.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:09.960
Okay? And that's being seen.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.260
It's been seen for
years and years.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.560
So as far as integrating these
main local management practices,

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.860
that is kind of in this
field of applied sciences

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.160
and water management, it's one
of the most difficult things

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.460
to work and take in the local
approaches to, in this case,

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.760
agriculture, right, if
you're looking at Lake Chad,

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.060
or if you're looking
at Cape Town.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.360
And to find a solution that if I
come and say, "Oh, you guys need

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.660
to change everything
you're doing.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.960
We know everything."

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.260
That's not going to work.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.560
It definitely will not work.

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.860
But if you try to embrace a
bit of what they're doing,

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.160
and try to integrate
in a meaningful way,

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.460
so we can compare apples
to apples, saying, "Okay.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.760
Well, the soil moisture

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.060
that you're seeing here is
directly related to the amount

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.360
of crop yield you will have
in two months or three months.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.660
And we can use this as a way of
forecasting that future yield."

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.960
That's very powerful.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.260
And it's very powerful for
helping, in this case, a country

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.560
or a region change their
management practices in regards

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.860
to agricultural productivity.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.160
Yes, sir?

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.460
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.760
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.060
Yes? Sorry.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.860
She was up first.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:54.100
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.690
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: So the question
is are there other areas

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.040
that are experiencing the
same conditions as Cape Town.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.970
Yes, absolutely.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.560
In the United States alone,
let's take the United States,

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.130
in 2017 there was a
widespread drought

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:09.240
in the northern United States,

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.460
in 2012 there was a widespread
drought in the United States

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:16.010
that led to over a $50
billion loss in revenue just

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.070
from agriculture alone.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:25.850
There are a number of examples
of increased water stress,

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:29.690
and an increased
demand on that water.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:32.500
If we go back to the
global population increase,

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.290
and what that really means.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.790
If you look at, you
know, a lot of the area

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:39.450
of increase was in
India and Asia.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:42.440
Right? That increase
in population,

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.840
and also the increase
in technologies,

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.080
leading to an increase
in middle class.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.780
Middle class are consumers.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.090
We consume more.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.410
And we eat better food.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.550
We eat more meat.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.100
That meat requires
more water to produce.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.990
All these things were taken into
the calculation of water demand.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.320
It's not just how much water
I use to brush my teeth

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.150
in the morning, or how
much I drink every day.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.190
What also needs to be
considered is the amount of food

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.470
that I consume, the amount
of energy that is being,

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.630
or water that's being
used for hydro production,

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.940
and water seized in other ways
of industry and agriculture,

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.690
as we saw is the
number one use of water.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.050
Yes, sir?

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:31.070
&gt;&gt; Could you say something
about desalination?

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:32.370
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Desalination.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.670
So the question is desalination.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:39.730
So desalinization is the
removing of salt from water.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:44.740
Right? And even though 70% of
the planet is covered by water,

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.250
most of it's salt water.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.470
Desalinization, a few
issues with desalinization,

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:55.560
I think it's a great
area of research,

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.590
but it is extremely inefficient.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:03.280
It takes a lot of energy
to remove salt from water.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.810
If you look at the
city of Dubai,

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:11.900
almost all of their water is
sourced by desalinization.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.840
So I heard a stat, don't quote
me on it, even though I'm

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.510
on video and at the
Library of Congress,

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.000
but I heard that without
desalinization they would run

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.700
out of water within
roughly a week's time.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.000
But I did see a presentation
just last week

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.020
about the whole slew of new
desalinization approaches.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.090
And something that they're
moving towards is sort

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:38.590
of a sustainability approach
of desalinization based

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:42.960
on solar panels in other
ways where you can overcome

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:49.240
that relatively expensive
part of desalinization.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.850
But it seems like it would be
a, you know, hit the nail right

00:49:52.850 --> 00:50:01.140
on the head as far as a way
for finding fresh water.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.440
I think you had one?

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.590
&gt;&gt; Well, I was just wondering
about other space agencies

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:07.320
or countries in the
developed world

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.780
and coordinating with them.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.500
They must have their
own fleet of satellites

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.800
who do the same thing,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.100
or do they just feed
off your [inaudible]?

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.400
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: No, no, no, no.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.330
So the question is about other
agencies and other countries

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.630
that we're working with.

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.540
So NASA partners
with all of them.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.930
And we're developing a sensor
called "NICER," that's developed

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.480
by the Indian Space Agency.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.780
We're working with a lot

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.570
of the European Space
Agency satellites.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:35.650
There's sentinel satellites
that complement a lot

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.110
of the observations
that I showed today.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:41.960
We're working with JAXA,
the Japanese Space Agency.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.260
All of them.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.560
And this is what's
really exciting,

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.450
because you're partnering with
all these different countries

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.810
and different agencies, and
they have their own approaches

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.860
and unique solutions to
driving a lot of these.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.590
And some of these
we partner with them

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.490
in the development
of these satellites.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:02.060
And it's a really good excuse
for running around the world,

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.400
and working with
incredibly smart people.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.870
Yes, ma'am?

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.990
&gt;&gt; You've been talking
about government agencies

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:13.190
and many different countries.

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:18.600
What about the international
corporations as drilling water

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.600
from the earth and sell it.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:25.720
I mean, I drink bottled water,
so I'm one of the sinners.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:30.040
But do they use the information
that you are developing,

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.640
these international
corporations, which are sort

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:41.920
of countries of their own
[inaudible] in many ways--

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.220
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Sure.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.520
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] for
information [inaudible]?

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.820
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Yes.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.120
So the question is of
international corporations

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.510
and how they apply the
data that I showed today.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.840
And the answer is yes.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.970
And international organizations,

00:51:56.970 --> 00:52:00.290
if you mean a for-profit
institution,

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.920
if you take Coca-Cola,
for example,--

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.130
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Most of their
business is based on water.

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:07.720
Right? And, in fact,
we are partnering

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.600
with Coca-Cola in
a number of ways.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.530
I forgot to mention, I should
have said this at the beginning,

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.900
but every single piece of data

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.200
that I showed today is
in the public domain.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.260
Everything NASA does
is free for use.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.740
And that's what makes
us a bit different.

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.500
And we encourage
organizations to embrace this.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.350
If you understand, in this
case, where the water isn't

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:34.580
and where the water is,
hopefully, that will be managed

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:39.170
in a way that's for
the greater good.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.550
But I have no idea of the
number of users of NASA data,

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:44.330
or how that's being applied.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:46.470
But I do know that we
work with organizations

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:48.310
such as the United Nations.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:50.000
We have a couple
projects I didn't show

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.760
that are actually endorsed
by the G20 Initiative

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.220
that are focused on
providing global pictures of,

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.880
in this case it's the GEOGLAM
Project, which is focused

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:04.160
on water and its relationship
to global agricultural yield.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.720
We're partnering with
USGS and other agencies

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.040
for a project called
"FuseNet", which is focused

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.270
on the food insecure
areas of the world.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:17.100
Okay. But we're also
enabling people

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.260
like these international
agencies

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.090
to have their own solutions
for water management.

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:26.660
And that's something
that NASA is proud of,

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:31.510
this open data policy.

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:34.070
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:37.880
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Well, they
find water and use water

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.220
to develop their product.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.520
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] you say
you have a partnership.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.850
I'm just wondering--

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:43.150
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Yes.

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:44.450
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] your
question [inaudible].

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:45.750
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Oh, sorry.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.050
So the Coca-Cola is
interested in looking

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:48.350
at the forecasting of water.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.250
I mean, exactly what
we're looking at here.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.980
So they have bottling plants.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.350
They have areas where
they're collecting water

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.650
and using water.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.040
So how much water is available,

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.440
how much water will be
available tomorrow or next year.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:05.130
&gt;&gt; So you're directly working
with [inaudible] that happen.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.430
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: They
are one of our end users

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.590
for the Applied Sciences
Program, yes.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:12.970
Yes, ma'am?

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:14.800
&gt;&gt; Drone use for the
[inaudible] is very active now.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.650
And [inaudible] any
collaboration

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:20.120
to finetuning the
information is, you know,

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.420
something I support [inaudible].

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.140
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Ah.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.440
That's a good question.

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.890
So the question is about drones
or unmanned aerial vehicles.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:34.700
So this is a really
exciting field.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.030
And the answer is yes.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:41.420
So NASA, in fact, has a lot
of drone technology as well,

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.820
because as the technology
advances the sensors get

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.980
smaller, things get lighter,
you have more storage,

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.730
and you can throw something on a
tiny little helicopter or plane.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.400
And we also have something,
I forgot to mention as well,

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.300
called "CubeSats,"
which is a cool word

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.880
for just small satellite.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:02.010
So you have a satellite about
as big as this water pitcher

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:06.320
that you can throw in space,
and for a fraction of the price

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.820
of a traditional
satellite mission.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.340
And NASA is famous for having
some wonderful, amazing,

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.940
very impressive and
long-lasting satellite missions.

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:21.310
But I think something on
the rise in here is the UAVs

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.170
and the CubeSat technology.

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:28.910
Because you can throw a swarm of
CubeSats in space for a fraction

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:34.980
of price, and this whole
lifecycle of concept to launch,

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.710
which is relatively long when
you think of a long satellite

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.490
or a large satellite mission,
it's a little bit smaller

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:43.520
when you have CubeSats and UAVs.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.650
But I've seen a lot of
UAVs used particularly

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:50.380
in agricultural applications
for precision AG.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:56.470
You can throw a thermal
sensor on a drone,

00:55:56.470 --> 00:56:02.890
and other sensors now,
and it's really neat.

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:06.460
And just in the past ten or
15 years, because of the speed

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.400
of computing and how
cheap data storage is,

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.700
you're able to do that.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.180
So it's a really
exciting innovation.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.590
Yes, sir?

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:22.330
&gt;&gt; So have we been collecting
data of this type long enough

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:27.290
to [inaudible] that make
[inaudible] predictions?

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:28.830
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Have
we been able to?

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:31.370
&gt;&gt; Right. Because I don't
know how long this kind

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:34.800
of detailed data has
been actually collected.

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.100
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Okay.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.400
So I guess the question is how
long have we been collecting

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.620
data for these to put it in
a historical perspective.

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.420
So--

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.710
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:51.540
Right? And I can give you
sort of a weird answer.

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:55.620
But each one of these, let's
say, if we take soil moisture,

00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.820
so I deal with soil
moisture a lot.

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.530
And if I have one or two
years of soil moisture,

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.900
I'm not really going to be able

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.900
to derive a reliable
anomaly from that.

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.700
Okay? But if I have ten
years, maybe I will.

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.280
The idea with soil
moisture related

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.230
to agriculture is you want to
see several growing seasons.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:20.400
And you want to capture extremes
in those growing seasons,

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.870
and extremes in that hydrology.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:25.120
If you're looking at flooding,
you want to see a year

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.060
that was at an extreme.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.710
You would want to see
a year that was also

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:31.580
at a very low extreme,
so you can capture those.

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:37.880
And when you do that,
you have a better sense.

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:41.610
The lifespan of NASA satellite
missions are all unique.

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:43.880
But I think to be conservative
they throw them up there

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.990
to be roughly three
to five years.

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:51.760
But many satellites have
lasted longer than ten.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.360
I'm not on a soapbox, but
if I was, the importance

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.680
of having concurrent
observations,

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.120
and keeping this
consistent record.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.280
That's why in the next
few weeks we're going

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.560
to have a GRACE follow-on
mission,

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.850
because the GRACE satellite,
or the GRACE Mission just died.

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:10.150
You know, it's still
floating around there.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.650
But it stopped sending data.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:17.880
But if we miss a few months of
data, it's really a huge loss

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.300
if you're trying to, you know,

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.000
paint this historical
perspective.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.750
If you're looking at the state
of California, okay, well,

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:28.060
I know what happened
from 2010 to 2015.

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.010
But if there's a couple-year
gap there, that's going

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:33.710
to be a really big loss
for that dataset alone.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:37.270
And that's something
that I'm always trying

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.740
to remind people of,
this important stuff.

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.880
You need to plan now
for the next ten years.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.440
And we need to start planning
for throwing a mission

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.270
up that can contribute and
capture the same observations,

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:53.130
so that we have that that
will improve the utility

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.430
of that data record.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:58.140
Thanks for the question.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.010
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Any
others before we end?

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:01.610
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:02.910
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Sure.

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:07.390
&gt;&gt; So are you working with
an interagency working group

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:11.960
that takes your data and tries

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.740
to develop applications
[inaudible]?

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.040
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Yes.

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.340
The question is are we working

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.640
with an interagency
working group.

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:19.940
In fact, we work with the USAID.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:21.320
We work with the World Bank.

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.220
We work with the United Nations.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.020
There's a separate
subgroup of the Department

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.980
of State called the "Interagency
Water Working Group" that,

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:33.090
in fact, I showed one or two
slides from those meetings.

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:37.070
And the answer is a big yes.

00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:38.370
Yes, sir?

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:39.670
&gt;&gt; I don't want to
make you uncomfortable,

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:40.970
but the political
[inaudible] are good

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:42.850
for your [inaudible]
consistency.

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:49.380
Isn't the NASA budget that
the Trump administration is

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:54.880
[inaudible] Congress [inaudible]
pushing more toward [inaudible],

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.200
but sliding the budget
for [inaudible]?

00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.500
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Right.

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.110
So the question is in regard
to the current administration

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:07.500
and the focus on,
let's see, oh, yeah,

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.800
we're not supposed to talk.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.650
But the answer is the current
administration has been very,

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:19.190
we've fared very well with
the NASA Earth Science budget.

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:22.780
And we have a lot of exciting
missions on the horizon.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.080
So--

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.380
&gt;&gt; Safely said.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.680
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: Thank you.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.980
Thank you so much for coming.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.280

You as well.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.580
&gt;&gt; John Bolten: And
I'll be around,

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.880
and I'd love to talk about it.
