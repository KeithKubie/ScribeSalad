The distance from the earth to the sun is approximately 1.5 times 10 to the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.102
eleventh meters. And light travels at about 3 times 10 to the eight meters per

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:13.096
second. We just found that time is equal to distance over speed. So can you

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.111
tell me how many seconds it takes for light to travel from the sun to the

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:20.461
earth? You can use your calculator or you can try to think of another way to do

00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:21.379
this.
