00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.780
So when you use your app and
it sends the hits to Analytics,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.950
it might take a while for the data to
show up in the Analytics dashboard.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.826
If, like me,

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:14.923
you need the instant gratification
of seeing the hits being sent.

00:00:14.923 --> 00:00:18.711
You can check the logs
in Android Studio.

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:21.320
So you're going to need to
enable verbose locking.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.750
Can do that in startTracking method in
your application sub-class, like this.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.360
You get the GoogleAnalytics instance and
then you set the logger level,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.740
and you set it to VERBOSE.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.236
You're also going to need
to import the logger class.

00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:41.230
So when you've made these
changes run the app again.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.700
Make sure your phone's connected to
Android Studio, and run the app again.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.170
Now, down here in the logcat window,
make sure you're showing the logcat

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.450
window, set the logging
level to Verbose.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.899
Make sure you have No Filters and
search, for sending hit.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.344
If you have anything there already,
go ahead and clear it all, so

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:03.870
that you can start with a clean slate.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.790
This is what your logging
settings will look like.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.703
Then grab your phone and use the app,

00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:11.623
and you should see the logging
entries showing up here.

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:15.066
And each time you go to
a screen in your app,

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:19.208
you'll get more entries
showing up in the logcat.

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:21.750
So eventually you're going to
get a bunch of log entries for

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.550
each hit that gets sent.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.800
So let's scroll down and
look at one of the hits.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.230
So an is the application name.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.290
In my case, What's for Dinner?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.182
And cd is a screen name, so
I went to the Show Recipe screen.

00:01:35.182 --> 00:01:38.531
And I think the cd is for
content description, but

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.379
here it is the screen name.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:42.507
Ul is the language.

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:43.934
US English.

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:48.920
And t is the hit type,
which in this case is the screenview.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.090
And the tid, this down here,
is the Analytics account ID.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.960
This gets taken directly
from the config files.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.050
So if you've got the count
ID wrong in the config file,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.440
it's going to be sent wrong in the hit.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.784
There's no actual verification done to
make sure that this is a correct value.

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:11.210
And down here, aid is the package name.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.790
So seeing these log entries tells
us that hits are being sent.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.420
Now we can go look for
the data in the Analytics Dashboard.
