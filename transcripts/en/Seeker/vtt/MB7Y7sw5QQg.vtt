00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.630
Take cropleek and garlic, of both equal quantities,
pound them well together… take wine and

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.230
bullocks gall, mix with the leek… let it
stand nine days in the brass vessel

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.440
While not exactly something Snape would assign,
new research shows this ancient potion might

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.730
have healing powers.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.310
Hey muggles, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.750
So that sounds like something out of a spell
book eh?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.570
Well actually it’s a remedy found in a thousand
year old Anglo-Saxon book.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.960
Modern researchers found that this concoction
conjured up a cure for eye stye.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.480
That’s when you get an annoying painful
bump on your eyelid, from an infected hair

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480
follicle.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.390
Scientists from University of Nottingham,
in England recreated the recipe using ingredients

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.390
as close to ancient as possible.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.980
Which was a little tricky, I mean leek and
garlic have been bred over the centuries and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.970
probably look pretty different from what the
recipe called for.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.739
Wine was fairly easy, the researchers got
it from a historical vineyard, and the bullocks

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.739
gall?

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.890
Parts of cow stomach, was easy to get too.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.270
After being mixed together and left to sit
for nine days, the researchers tested the

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.050
potion on scraps of mouse skin.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.109
The skin had been infected with a super bug
version of MRSA.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.909
Surprisingly, it worked!

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.320
It killed 90% of the bacteria, pretty much
equivalent to modern day antibiotics typically

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.660
used to treat MRSA.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.070
The researcher found that it wasn’t just
one ingredient that killed of the bad bugs,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.550
but the combination of them!

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.939
While this is rather exciting, this research
isn’t published yet, it will be presented

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.870
at the 2015 Society for General Microbiology
conference.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.200
Other researchers tried to recreate the potion,
but it uh.. didn’t go so well.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.390
Their concoction turned into a “loathsome,
odorous slime", so more research is needed.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.299
As we face the rise of antibiotic resistant
superbugs like MRSA, looking into the past

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.790
might be the way forward.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.350
Scientists think ancient cultures like Egyptians,
Chinese, Greeks and Nubians and many more,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.570
were purposefully making antibiotics to use
in medicine thousands of years before the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.250
discovery of penicillin in 1928, which marks
the dawn of the age of modern antibiotics.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.140
Like, Sugar and honey have been used in dressing
wounds for over 4,000 years and can even be

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.960
traced back to the ancient Egyptians.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.610
More recent research found that the Egyptians
were on to something.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.490
Honey which is mostly made up of sugar, kills
bacteria with a kind of one-two punch.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.440
High sugar concentrations draws out water
from bacteria, which basically kills them

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.440
through dehydration, but other properties
like honey’s acidity also hamper the bacteria.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.830
This is different from modern antibiotics
which usually damage bacteria’s growth processes,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.970
which bacteria is quickly able to develop
a resistance too.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.390
Or maybe ancient cultures used beer to fight
bad bacteria.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.270
One study published in the American Journal
of Physical Anthropology suggests that Ancient

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.810
Nubians, a people who lived in present day
Sudan, made “gold beer” with antibiotic

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.810
properties.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.690
The researchers looked at bones from between
A.D. 350 and 550 and found traces of Tetracycline,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.340
a type of antibiotic made from soil bacteria.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.420
The researchers think the ancient culture
used the beer to treat certain diseases, just

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.980
like how Ancient Egyptians and Jordanians
used beer to treat gum disease.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.720
There’s loads of other examples of ancient
medicine proving itself in modern times.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.540
Like a Chinese plant used to fight malaria
or mugwort treating herpes.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.370
Now I’m not saying all natural remedies
are effective, there are some shady shams

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.560
out there, but it’ll be a cool area of research
to keep an eye on.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.680
Alright guys, what do you think?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.670
What ancient remedy would you try?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.650
