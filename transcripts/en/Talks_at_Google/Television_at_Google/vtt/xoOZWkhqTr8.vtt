KEVIN VLK: Hello everyone.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.170
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:02.930
I'm Kevin Vlk.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.590
And today we welcome the cast
of the Netflix original series,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.200
"Marvel's Daredevil."

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.340
So let's bring them on up.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.900
We have Charlie Cox, Deborah
Ann Wool, Elodie Yung,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.700
and John Bernthal.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.230
Very smooth guys.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.040
Welcome.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.410
We're so excited to
have you guys here.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.030
Absolutely phenomenal
first season.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.810
So now we're in season two.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.030
Charlie, talk to us just about
what brought you to the series

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.561
and just how you guys developed
the tone of "Daredevil," season

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:49.060
one.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420
CHARLIE COX: I mean
neither of those things

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.320
really did I have much input in.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.440
I mean, I just auditioned
like everyone else I guess.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.970
I went through quite a rigorous
audition process, probably

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.414
the most intense audition
process I've been through.

00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:09.080
And really the tone
of the show, I mean,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.121
I read the scripts I knew
when I read the script,

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.050
I knew that there was
something special about them.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.070
I was invited to go
to Disney in London

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550
and I was in a room with
two guys whose job it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.537
was to watch me read
the scripts and making

00:01:22.537 --> 00:01:24.620
sure I wasn't photographing
or anything like that.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.490
And I walked out of there and
I sent in an email to my agent

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.435
just saying I'd play
any part in this.

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:32.470
This is really, really special.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.839
And then once we
started filming,

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:37.380
all the internal stuff is kind
of completely out of my hands.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.630
And it wasn't until I saw
the show, I saw the trailer,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.500
and I saw the show,
and I saw what

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.220
they had done cinematically
and all aspects of the show

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.842
from the costumes to the
cinematography and the music

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:52.300
and all of that,
all of that stuff,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.750
it was all out of my control.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.677
And I thought they did
a really wonderful job

00:01:56.677 --> 00:01:57.510
with all that stuff.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.360
KEVIN VLK: So what was your
take on Matt Murdock when

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.915
you go in to do the audition.

00:02:01.915 --> 00:02:03.290
How did you look
at the character

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.200
and what was your take that
you think that won them over?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.616
CHARLIE COX: Well
the good news is

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:09.289
I never read a Daredevil comic.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.360
In fact I had this
kind of a story

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.230
I tell which is that when I got
the audition, in the email that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.200
came from agents there was a
list of character attributes

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.380
that this guy-- it was a fake
name in the first audition.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.650
They called him Alex.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.000
And they said, Alex
is tall and red haired

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.390
and charismatic and strong and
sexy, all these kind of things.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.200
And then I was working on the
audition with a friend of mine,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.780
and they said to me in an email,
they think this is Daredevil.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.560
And the guy said, I think
this guy, I think he's blind.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.350
And I was like no, no,
no, definitely not.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.040
I'm pretty sure they would have
told me if the guy was blind.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.104
But then getting the part,
I guess what was good

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.520
was I was able to
read the scripts

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.550
and get a sense tonally what
the show was going to be like

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.320
and who this character was in
those original Drew Goddard

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.080
episodes, one and
two of last year.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.630
And then I was able to take that
knowledge and go to the comics

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.330
and sift through
them all and find

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.180
the different runs and
the different illustrators

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.530
and writers who best
captured what I think

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.069
the show was trying to do.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.610
And then I could
concentrate on them.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.727
So there's a wonderful series.

00:03:16.727 --> 00:03:18.435
There's lots of great
series, but there's

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:26.540
a particular run of issues by
Brian Bendis and Alex Maleev

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.550
that I concentrated on.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.450
And I felt like they
suited the show that

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.352
was being written very well.

00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:33.560
KEVIN VLK: It was phenomenal.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.726
I think it blew everyone
away because the tone of it

00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:40.440
is much more mature and much
more adult and gory and just so

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.400
freaking awesome.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.380
And so Deborah--

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.820
CHARLIE COX: You a fan?

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.492
KEVIN VLK: Little bit.

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:43.830
Little bit.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.830
Little bit of a fanboy.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.641
But Deborah, then you did
phenomenal in season one

00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:48.140
as well.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.330
And you're back in season
two as Deborah-- that's

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.370
your name-- as Karen Page.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.410
And tell us about where
your character is now

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.672
after season one and what
she's doing in season two?

00:03:58.672 --> 00:03:59.630
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: Sure.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.100
I mean, I think we meet
Karen sort of broken.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.580
And we see her trying
to build up from that.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.790
But of course we end in a
very dramatic place as well.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.290
So I think we're
allowed to say we

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.084
skip six months between
the first season

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:16.000
and the second season.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.110
And so I think we start
with our sort of Scooby gang

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.980
in a good place.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.840
Things are going well and
they're happy with each other.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.836
But because of this one,
stuff quickly goes awry.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:31.460
KEVIN VLK: Jon.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.460
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: Which
was true on set as well.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.785
Jon came in and everything
just went to hell.

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:36.660
That's what happened.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.649
JON BERNTHAL: That's it, yeah.

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:40.690
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: I mean,
it's hard to talk about

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.148
without giving anything away,
but I think Karen's grappling

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:45.440
with what she did last year.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.250
People talk a lot about
how it's so funny or it's

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.874
so bad that Matt and Foggy
are keeping the secret

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.290
that Matt is
Daredevil from Karen.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.665
I'm like, but Karen has got
two big secrets, one of which

00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:58.610
is I killed the guy that
she is keeping from them.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.767
So she's got to deal
with that I think.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:01.600
KEVIN VLK: I gotcha.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.620
And Elodie, Jon, welcome to
the Marvel and Netflix family.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.300
This is awesome.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.490
I think people were freaking
out about season two

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.470
and what characters
were they going to be?

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.630
Was it going Elektra?

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.640
Oh, we have Elektra.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.737
We got to have-- I
think Bullseye was one

00:05:16.737 --> 00:05:18.320
that the fans were
really pushing for.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.750
And then when
Punisher got out, it

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.640
was like oh, who are they
going to case as Punisher?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.490
And I think a lot of people
were pushing for Thomas Jane

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.920
because of what he did
in his past series.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.080
And then when you
were cast, I think

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.910
everyone was like, oh
my god, it's perfect.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.850
It's absolutely perfect casting.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.864
And so Jon, can talk about, did
you study the character before?

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:34.780
Did you know about it?

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.800
Did you actively pursue it?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.174
Or was it one of
those things you

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:39.532
were even surprised they
were coming to you for it?

00:05:39.532 --> 00:05:40.240
JON BERNTHAL: No.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.730
I, like Charlie, audition
came from my agents.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.125
Charlie and I actually have
had the same wonderful agent.

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:48.500
CHARLIE COX: Like
a package deal.

00:05:54.614 --> 00:05:56.530
JON BERNTHAL: It's
an iconic character,

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.080
so obviously I had some
sort of sense of who he was.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.970
But kind of digging
into the source material

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.080
was a real joy, a
real pleasure for me.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.920
And I think that there's
been many iterations

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.780
of the character, but
I feel like I found

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.300
his main kind of conflict.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.339
And the crux of what I think
he's really going through,

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:19.880
to me, it came right
from the comics.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.450
And I feel like because so
many of the different lines

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.270
of comics, Punisher
comics that came out,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.080
they're delivered
in soliloquy form.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.200
It's perfect fodder for acting.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.950
But once I saw season one and
I saw what these guys did,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.632
I saw that really, to me,
it wasn't a superhero show,

00:06:44.632 --> 00:06:45.840
but it was a character study.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.360
And it was such a human
show and such an honest show

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.220
and raw show, I thought
it was the perfect sort

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.760
of stage for this character
to be brought back.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.869
So I'm unbelievably honored
and grateful to have

00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:59.535
the opportunity.

00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:01.500
KEVIN VLK: Was there's some
nervousness about taking

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.697
on this kind of character?

00:07:02.697 --> 00:07:04.280
And you guys, I mean,
you guys are not

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.320
exactly friends for the majority
of this, from what I can tell.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.590
In just the trailers and just
seeing some of the episodes

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.324
already, you guys are
fighting a little bit.

00:07:14.324 --> 00:07:16.365
But you guys actually have
some of the same goals

00:07:16.365 --> 00:07:18.010
it seems like too.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.420
JON BERNTHAL: Yeah, I
think as you'll see,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.430
literally in the same
conversation where

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.240
I was welcomed to Marvel, I
was told, keep your mouth shut.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.640
So they're very
clear about that.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.630
So I'm not going
to give much away.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.840
Again, I think these
characters, they're iconic.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.170
And they matter so
much to so many people.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.310
So there's an enormous
amount of pressure

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.370
and a real desire to
not mess this thing up,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.610
especially when you have a show
that was so good in season one.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.810
The bar was set high.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.476
KEVIN VLK: For sure,
you did a great job

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.730
skirting that question.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.990
Elodie, tell us about Elektra.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.970
Everyone's excited.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.620
It was referenced
a little bit, very,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.921
very briefly in season one.

00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:06.920
And now you're freaking
Elektra and you're back.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.880
So tell us about the
character and your take on it.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.050
ELODIE YUNG: What do
want to know about her?

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.515
KEVIN VLK: So how about your
relationship, because there's

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:17.830
a little bit of romance
it seems from some

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.642
of the trailers with
these two over here.

00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:21.183
And then all of a
sudden you come in.

00:08:21.183 --> 00:08:23.610
ELODIE YUNG: I don't know if
Elektra really likes that.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.930
We meet Elektra at this
point 10 years after Matthew

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.260
and her left each
other or broke up.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:42.070
So it's an old flame.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.370
It's her first love.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.120
And Elektra probably misses
Matthew a little bit.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.510
So that's why maybe she
comes back into his life.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.600
I can't say much
really about it.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.800
I believe that she misses
him as much as she needs him

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.980
for some stuff.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.830
CHARLIE COX: Not
that kind of stuff.

00:09:06.844 --> 00:09:08.260
ELODIE YUNG: And
it was just great

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:16.040
for me to get to play this
incredible, interesting, crazy,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.250
wild character.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.450
And like my colleagues, I
didn't know much about her.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:30.060
It was just a completely
new game field for me.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.770
And it was very interesting for
me to get to read the comics

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.800
and build this
fantastic character.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.320
I had a lot of fun doing it.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.555
And I hope people will like
her as much as I loved her.

00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:48.680
KEVIN VLK: And what did
you bring to the character?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.180
Did you know any-- I mean,
she's amazing in the series

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.620
and her fighting skills.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.380
Did you have any
training before or did

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.588
you have to go through really
crazy intense training?

00:09:57.588 --> 00:09:59.775
ELODIE YUNG: You know,
I have to be honest,

00:09:59.775 --> 00:10:01.400
we don't have the
time really to train.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.901
I mean Charlie's very
committed to his work.

00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:08.280
I'm a bit more lazy.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.535
We had to pick up things
like this, on the spot.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.730
Thankfully, we were surrounded
by amazing, amazing stunt guys.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.530
And I've practiced karate
and all these martial arts

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.130
back in the day.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.120
So I could pick
up choreographies.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.380
But yeah, we had days
where we had to go

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.350
through the whole fight scenes.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.966
And it was painful,
but also you're

00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:40.340
so happy when you
see the result.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.020
I think it's incredible
what they did.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.930
And I'm proud that
I was able to do it.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.319
So no training for me, but still
I had to do the fights, yes.

00:10:56.319 --> 00:10:58.360
CHARLIE COX: I feel like
I have to add that she's

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.230
incredible at that stuff.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.110
She's got a black belt in three
different martial arts and kung

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.220
fu.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.030
ELODIE YUNG: No, just one.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.530
They

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.850
CHARLIE COX: Show
the choreography

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.040
and she adds to it.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.050
I mean, she's amazing.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.650
KEVIN VLK: That's great.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.540
And Charlie and Deborah, you
guys, coming into season two,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.374
you guys have new
showrunners on it.

00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:17.790
Can you talk about
the differences

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.956
and what they brought to it.

00:11:18.956 --> 00:11:21.420
Because I think, were they
writers on the season one,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:21.920
right?

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.570
And so what did they bring
as actual showrunners

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.837
and taking "Daredevil"
to the next level?

00:11:27.837 --> 00:11:29.920
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: I feel
very safe in their hands.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.160
I feel like they
love these characters

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.159
the same way that we do.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.580
Because when you take on a
character like this, you do,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.640
you start to love them like
you love a little sister

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.479
or a little brother.

00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:40.020
And you want to
protect them and also

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.170
make sure that they're well
rounded and three dimensional.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.840
So it was nice, every time I
ever spoke with Doug and Marco,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.330
I felt that they cared
about Karen as much as I did

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.860
and wanted to do right by her.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.135
So that enthusiasm--

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:55.510
KEVIN VLK: Was
there a little bit

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.630
that you could play
with a little bit more

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.940
with Deborah-- or with Karen.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.170
I keep calling her Deborah.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.930
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: Funny.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.890
KEVIN VLK: Usually it's
the opposite, right?

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.034
With the Karen character,
because if you change too much

00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:07.200
of Daredevil or you change
too much of the Punisher,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.283
people get a little upset.

00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:11.710
But with Karen, did you have
a little more freedom to do--

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.770
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: Karen is
almost two distinctly different

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.110
characters in the comic books.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.570
I mean, she kind of
started as one thing

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.240
and ended as a
completely different one.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.390
So I know what we wanted to
do was find our own Karen.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.080
And maybe that did give us a
little more freedom with her

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.550
that her backstory can be
anything that we want it to be.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.050
We don't necessarily
have to follow

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.151
what has been done before.

00:12:33.151 --> 00:12:34.900
KEVIN VLK: She has a
very mysterious past.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.380
DEBORAH ANN WOLL:
It's so exciting.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.470
I know everything.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.430
KEVIN VLK: You know it.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.930
DEBORAH ANN WOLL:
I know everything.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.930
I haven't even told these guys.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.820
KEVIN VLK: And you know
Charlie, Catholicism is

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.070
a huge part of the character.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.530
And it's unique because it's not
really part of any other Marvel

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.030
character.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.880
They're not really
tied to a religion.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.350
But it's this battle of,
he's trying to do good,

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.450
but he's doing bad.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.420
He's asking for forgiveness
for not what he's done

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.520
but what he's about to do.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.340
So the role of religion
with the character,

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.340
how is that shaping him,
and where does that kind of

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.100
find him in season
two at the battles

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.977
that he's facing
with Jon's character?

00:13:10.977 --> 00:13:13.310
CHARLIE COX: I mean, I think
it's still very much there.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.480
It's still very much like a kind
of a shadow over his shoulder.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.050
In the first season, the way
that the first season was

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.030
structured, Matt
was kind of obsessed

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.800
with this man and the finding
of this man and the belief

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.144
that if he could bring
this one guy to justice,

00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:31.060
everything else would
kind of fall into place.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.900
And in that process there
was a lot of time where

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.599
he didn't have a next move.

00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:36.890
He didn't know what else to do.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.473
And so there was a
lot of time for him

00:13:38.473 --> 00:13:41.550
to spend in his apartment
and with those feelings

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.440
and with that guilt, that
Catholic guilt, and wondering

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.630
about, does he have the right
to do this because his gifts are

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.350
in some ways God given?

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:56.850
And at the same time, is he kind
of playing god, if you like.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.350
This season I think that those
feelings are still there.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.770
It's just that the
season is structured,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.390
there's so much happens to Matt.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.270
I mean, he's pulled in so
many different directions.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.220
And he's got the Punisher.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.170
There's different
gangs, Irish gangs.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.950
There's biker gangs involved.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.060
Elektra shows up.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.340
He's trying to kind of find
a vulnerability with Karen.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.660
It just goes so crazy for him
that he almost didn't have time

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.920
to think about that stuff.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.890
So in a way, it's still there
and it's still hopefully

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.419
present in his thinking
and in his feelings,

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:33.960
but it's not something that we
investigate to the same degree

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.020
as we did last year.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.895
KEVIN VLK: I got you.

00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:38.230
And Introducing
two huge characters

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.660
with the Punisher and
Elektra, but this is still

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.360
Matt Murdock's story.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.610
And so what was the
balance of that,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.600
just making sure that
everyone got their proper time

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.000
on screen, but develop their
stories, their backstories,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.422
but still keeping it
Matt's kind of [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:57.422 --> 00:14:59.380
CHARLIE COX: The honest
answer is I don't know,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.370
because I wasn't really privy
to any of those conversations.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.270
I'm sure those are conversations
that happened in the writers

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.228
room and with the show
runners and with Netflix

00:15:05.228 --> 00:15:06.380
and that stuff.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.710
But that's not really my job.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.126
My job is just to
read the scripts

00:15:09.126 --> 00:15:13.050
and kind of bring
these moments-- make

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:18.410
this journey and these scenes
as truthful as possible.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.160
It's kind of related,
but what I will say

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.320
is what I thought the
writers did spectacularly

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.480
well this year is that
obviously the show had

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.830
a degree of success.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.910
And so we want to kind
of keep the same idea.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.750
We want to maintain
the tone of the show

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.590
and many aspects of the show.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.470
But we also want to do
something new, second season.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.230
And what they did really
wonderfully well was whereas

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.820
for the first season there was
this drive towards this one guy

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.000
who was kind of the villain.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.401
He was the big bad.

00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.900
And the good and evil was kind
of maybe a little bit clearer

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.380
last year.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.510
And this year it's not the case.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.926
You know, Frank
Castle was kind of

00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:57.530
known as an antihero
rather than a villain.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.250
And although initially
when he shows up, I think

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.660
Matt would like to
pigeonhole Frank Castle.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.940
He'd like to say, well this
is another Wilson Fisk.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.170
He needs to be put away.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.450
He needs to be taken care of.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:13.210
And what Karen suggests
quite early on to Matt

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.197
is that actually maybe
they're very similar.

00:16:16.197 --> 00:16:17.780
Maybe they're cut
from the same cloth.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.360
And that idea, that
concept is anathema to Matt

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.040
because it means
that if that's true,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.800
then really, well he's
responsible for all

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.819
this mayhem, and he
needs to kind of hang up

00:16:28.819 --> 00:16:30.360
the suit, which is
probably the thing

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.822
he wants to do least of all.

00:16:31.822 --> 00:16:34.280
KEVIN VLK: And so Jon, in your
character with Frank Castle,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.610
the Punisher-- you were
phenomenal in "Fury,"

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.340
in David Ayer's "Fury."

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.900
Because Frank Castle is a little
similar in that he's a war

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.762
veteran and he's-- was there
anything that you brought from

00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:49.970
"Fury" or you learned from
that film that you brought

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.915
into the character?

00:16:51.915 --> 00:16:52.790
JON BERNTHAL: Thanks.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:01.610
I think you have to bring so
much of yourself to each part.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.599
And I think that these are all--
it's kind of a hokey answer,

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.859
but these are all part of your
sort of collective experience.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:12.150
And I think that "Fury," that
experience with those guys

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.819
and with David is really
burned into my soul.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:19.880
So yeah, I think part
of the military aspect

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.610
and part of the training, I'm
sure, really came in handy.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.360
I just think this whole
thing is different.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:36.130
I think this is the
age of television.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.800
And there's no place
that I'd rather be.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.490
It's an unbelievable
opportunity.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.200
And I think the
Netflix model, it

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.780
gives you the
opportunity, I think,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.700
to really be bold enough
to abandon the audience

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.980
and turn your back on them.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.750
And I think with a
character like this,

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.040
I think, look, we're telling
the story of Matt Murdock.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.240
And I think for me to be
able to play this character

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.720
and know that I can do something
so deplorable and so full

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.830
on that the audience-- you can
go as far to say I genuinely

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.400
do not care if the audience
completely abandons

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.020
this character because in two,
three episodes down the road,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.450
I get a chance to win them back.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.230
And the cool thing is they're
not waiting two or three

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.389
weeks for that episode.

00:18:23.389 --> 00:18:25.180
And so it was constantly
sort of this push,

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.210
especially having
the freedom of it

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.120
not being your
character's story,

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.380
you can really sort of
push the envelope there.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.650
And I think that you don't
get those opportunities

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.652
I feel like in film.

00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:39.610
KEVIN VLK: And just from
you guys' perspective,

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:44.390
coming into the superhero
realm now and superhero movies

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.830
and what the show is, it's
just completely, completely

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.330
different.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.950
So what do you think the
impact-- or what surprised you

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.975
about what the show has done
with the superhero genre.

00:18:52.975 --> 00:18:55.350
Because like I said, it's
something completely different.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.641
Even though it's still in
the MCU, the Marvel Cinematic

00:18:57.641 --> 00:19:00.680
Universe, it's
completely different.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.020
ELODIE YUNG: For me, it doesn't
really feel like [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:10.490
to step in a superhero world
because the writing is so good.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.680
And this project,
it's so characters

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.330
driven that you just feel
that you-- it's very grounded.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.090
And I think none
of our characters

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.190
are these superheroes
or the villains that

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.020
are saving the world.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.700
It just feels that
there's so much

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.440
of ourselves in these characters
and will from the writers

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.910
to make them more humans
that it doesn't feel really

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.827
like a superhero show.

00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:44.160
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: Well I think
for me along those lines,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.520
it's the idea of consequences.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.850
That when the bad guys
are Nazis or aliens,

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.975
you can kind of kill
indiscriminately

00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:53.850
because they're evil.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.050
And so that's over.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.210
But our villains, if you
want to call them that,

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.880
are human beings.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.370
You know, Fisk thought he
was doing the best that he

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.780
could for his community.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.920
And Frank Castle
thinks that he's

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.890
going to take down
the people who are

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.780
making this world a bad place.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.290
I like that our show doesn't--
it stays in the gray.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.255
It doesn't try to label.

00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:21.130
KEVIN VLK: We'll be
taking audience questions

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.670
in a few minutes if you guys
want to start lining up.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.240
Being in that and
being so different,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.660
and it's amazing
because you guys aren't

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.430
gods or super soldiers or have
Stark technology or anything

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.010
like that.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.360
But you're still in that world.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.950
And this is hypothetical.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.595
This is the geekiness, is if
you were to join the Avengers--

00:20:39.595 --> 00:20:41.720
hypothetical, because you
guys can't talk about it.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.340
But hypothetically,
if you were to,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.725
what could your characters
actually bring to help them?

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.210
DEBORAH ANN WOLL:
No, I think it's--

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.820
KEVIN VLK: Hypothetically.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.611
DEBORAH ANN WOLL:
They're saving the world,

00:20:53.611 --> 00:20:56.090
and Matt Murdock is
defending the crap out

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.500
of 10 blocks of Manhattan.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.830
Like, that his role.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.570
CHARLIE COX: If you
read "Civil War,"

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.440
Daredevil is in "Civil War."

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.760
And if you read, if you were to
isolate the panels that include

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.060
Daredevil from "Civil
War," from those issues,

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.170
It's the same Daredevil that
we have on our show I think.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.992
Because he's in the background.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:26.200
He's aware that he doesn't
quite have the same powers

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.660
as the other guys in the room.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.010
So he's a little bit moody
and he's in the background.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.830
And he kind of makes sinister
comments every now and again

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.240
and puts everyone
in their place.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.980
And he's kind of a key
element in the whole way

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.080
that that story
unfolds, in the way

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.637
that his abilities
allow him to be.

00:21:41.637 --> 00:21:43.970
When you read that comic, you
don't question it tonally.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.030
So I don't see how that
would be a problem.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.320
So put us in The Avengers.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.200
KEVIN VLK: You guys
just remaining silent.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.580
You've got this down Jon.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.934
We'll start with Elodie.

00:22:05.934 --> 00:22:07.600
What are your
characters-- we'll go down

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.703
the line-- what are your
characters' greatest weakness?

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.910
ELODIE YUNG: At
first when I started

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.620
working on this character, I
really had no clue who she was.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:28.170
And I did some research
and read the comics,

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.090
and then I came across an
interview of Frank Miller.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.390
And he said that,
for him, Elektra-- it

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.130
wasn't the case of
finding out if she

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.410
was a good girl or
a bad girl, but she

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:46.800
was one of those villains who
have a weak streak in them.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.760
And so I was wondering, what
was this weakness, this failure?

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.340
And I believe that it's the
love she once had for Matthew.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.270
I think it's really what
makes her a bit more

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:07.510
human than the sociopath that
the writers wanted me to be.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:15.630
And I really tried to bring this
in my character in this season.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.820
I think that's her weakness,
the love that she--

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.660
And you find it in the comics.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.090
She left the world she
didn't believe in because

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.770
of the death of her dad.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.430
And she tried really
to get rid of Matthew

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.930
because that was
the only thing that

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.340
would attach her to this past.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.340
So I think that's
really her weakness.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.380
She's capable of love, as much
as she's capable of killing,

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.920
of course.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.020
But she is capable of love.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.070
KEVIN VLK: Jon?

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.870
JON BERNTHAL: Look,
a couple of things.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.980
I think what first
jumps into my mind

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.034
and I think what just
sort of thematically

00:23:53.034 --> 00:23:54.700
what we're talking
about about this show

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.660
and I think what makes
this show really powerful

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.036
is that it's not
about, like we said,

00:24:02.036 --> 00:24:03.160
it's not about superheroes.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.094
It's a really human
centered show.

00:24:05.094 --> 00:24:07.010
And I think in any human
being, the thing that

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.732
makes you the most
powerful is also

00:24:08.732 --> 00:24:09.940
what makes you the most weak.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.620
And what you love about
people, often times,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.110
is very much cousin to what
you could hate about them.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:23.890
And I think with Frank,
he has no superpower.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:28.544
He's really, really,
really, angry.

00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:30.910
He's got a lot of range.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.850
And it's what makes
him so strong.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.936
He's not the best fighter.

00:24:38.936 --> 00:24:41.090
He does not have
any super strength.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.510
But you better kill him.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.060
Because of that, that's
also his weakness.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.970
I think that he's so driven
and this mission that he's on

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.140
is so unbelievably personal.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.170
And I think that Frank
Castle that you're

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.160
going to see in season
two of "Daredevil"

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.130
is not necessarily
the Punisher yet.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.550
I think you're going
to see a guy who is not

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.900
really concerned with the
safety of Hell's Kitchen,

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.020
not really concerned with
ridding the world of bad guys.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.470
He is trying to find the
people that killed his family

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.530
and kill them in the
most brutal way possible.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.900
That's his mission, and
it's very, very personal.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.630
And morality, consequence,
right or wrong,

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.800
all that's out the window.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.510
So that's also puts him in an
extremely vulnerable position

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:35.330
because he may do things
that-- at the end of the day,

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.260
he is a human being.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.750
And he may end up doing
things there that he regret

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:44.540
and that completely do not go
along with what he believes in.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.250
And I think what these
writers were smart enough

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.600
to do is you have a character
who's put so much time

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.920
and effort in building this
wall around his morality

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.681
and making himself as
impenetrable as possible,

00:25:55.681 --> 00:25:58.180
but I think what's cool is these
great characters around him

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.230
penetrate that wall.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.188
And at the end of the
day, he is a human being.

00:26:01.188 --> 00:26:06.084
So it's a long ass answer
to a short ass question.

00:26:06.084 --> 00:26:07.000
KEVIN VLK: It's great.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.829
And really quickly,
it's interesting,

00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:11.620
because you were saying
about the fighting,

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.120
he's not the best
fighter and stuff.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.660
It's really interesting
to see your character,

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.526
Matt Murdock, Daredevil,
try to fight him,

00:26:18.526 --> 00:26:19.900
because he has
guns and something

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.619
like he's never handled before.

00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:23.160
It's just interesting
because they've

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.350
changed your fight style.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.730
They've change his approach to
actually taking down enemies.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.517
It's been pretty interesting.

00:26:30.517 --> 00:26:32.350
More of a statement I
guess than a question.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.580
Back to Deborah.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:40.410
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: Honestly, I'm
so floored by that question.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.936
I don't know, it
really got to me.

00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:48.550
I feel like in our identities,
in our sense of ourselves,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.200
we have our two sides.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.920
We have the side
that we wish we are,

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.540
the side that we
hope that we are,

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.074
and then we have the side
that we're afraid is true.

00:26:56.074 --> 00:26:57.740
And I think about
that a lot with Karen.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.840
I think about that a lot.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.620
I think about how there's the
person that she wants to be

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.455
and the heroes that
she sees around him

00:27:04.455 --> 00:27:06.287
and being terribly,
terribly afraid

00:27:06.287 --> 00:27:08.620
that she will never live up
to that, that she will never

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.420
be the person that
she wants to be.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.700
That this person who
can stop injustice--

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.950
I think about this season
and the corruption,

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.350
and the word that comes
to mind is impotence,

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.280
this feeling that there
is nothing I can do.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.150
As hard as I try, I'm a bitch.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.710
As hard as I try, I am pushy.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.460
As hard as I try, I'm impotent.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.325
I have no power.

00:27:29.325 --> 00:27:30.890
I have no control.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.490
And it's heartbreaking.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.550
And I feel like that
doubt, that fear,

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:42.180
is Karen's weakness,
that it keeps her

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.470
from feeling like
she has any power

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:48.080
or any-- can change anything.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.600
And that's why she looks up
to people like Daredevil.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.507
And I wish she could
see it in herself.

00:27:54.507 --> 00:27:56.340
And I think I'm emotional
because I probably

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.740
have some-- this is me too.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:02.590
This is my little sister too.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.412
But yeah, that's my long answer.

00:28:05.412 --> 00:28:06.620
KEVIN VLK: Well, follow that.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.620
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: Sorry.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.942
I'm so sorry.

00:28:08.942 --> 00:28:10.150
JON BERNTHAL: Deal with that.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.248
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:15.867 --> 00:28:18.200
CHARLIE COX: Yeah I was just
thinking, god, [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.585
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: I'm so sorry.

00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:22.960
CHARLIE COX: You know, I'm
going to go relatively quickly

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.030
because I'd love to get to the--
I think that Matt's biggest

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.410
weakness probably is that--
probably the worst thing that

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.951
could have happened to Matt was
defeating Wilson Fisk because

00:28:30.951 --> 00:28:33.490
with every day that passes,
with every successful night

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:37.026
out bringing people down,
he's getting more arrogant.

00:28:37.026 --> 00:28:38.400
There's more of
a swagger to him.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.400
There's more confidence.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.510
There's more feeling
of invincibility.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.120
And he's more convinced that
he can do this by himself.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.750
And I think what he's going to
have to learn at some point--

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.110
maybe this season, maybe
not-- that he can't.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.290
There you go.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.552
KEVIN VLK: Wonderful.

00:28:54.552 --> 00:28:55.439
Yep, you.

00:28:55.439 --> 00:28:57.230
AUDIENCE: First of all,
I want to say thank

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.052
you so much for coming here.

00:28:59.052 --> 00:29:02.300
I just want to ask, while you
all were working on the show,

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.930
did you feel there are any
differences because of Netflix

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.563
versus shows you worked
on another network

00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:08.862
like HBO or AMC?

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.110
CHARLIE COX: I think there are
tremendous differences, yeah.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.090
The main one, the thing
I noticed first of all,

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.890
was the start of writing.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.140
Because it's not
appointment television,

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.250
you don't have to spend any time
at the beginning of an episode

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.720
or at the end of an episode
either reminding people what

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.312
happened before or creating
enough of a dramatic ending

00:29:34.312 --> 00:29:35.770
so that you will
bring people back.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.550
You'll put that
thing in someone that

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.050
says I've got to find out what
happened to those characters.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.720
You know what I mean?

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.310
And so you're gaining an
extra five, 10 minutes

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.162
either side of an episode
where you can just

00:29:48.162 --> 00:29:50.620
continue telling story, continue
being with the characters.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:55.990
And you can allow it to kind
of flow more succinctly.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.810
I said once before,
it feels more

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.510
like a kind of a 13
hour movie than it

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.472
does episodic television.

00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:05.930
And the other thing is what
they're discovering on Netflix,

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.340
more and more as well even
as more shows come out,

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.750
is that we don't have to conform
to what we know as television.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.040
We can do what we want.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.090
They can do what they want.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:18.890
So an episode now doesn't
have to be a set time.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.104
It doesn't have to come in at
55 minutes with enough time

00:30:22.104 --> 00:30:23.020
for commercial breaks.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.566
It can be anywhere from
35 minutes to 55 minutes.

00:30:25.566 --> 00:30:27.190
When you turn on
Netflix, you can watch

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.372
that episode of television.

00:30:28.372 --> 00:30:30.330
You'll see every episode
is a different length.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.700
So you can edit each
episode so that it

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:39.410
works best, that story in
that one hour works best,

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.280
without having to kind
of find a few minutes

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.010
or lose a few minutes
to make the time.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.670
I just think all that
makes for just much more

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.935
kind of creative work.

00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:50.768
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.170
AUDIENCE: So another
new Netflix show

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.716
has come out about a superhero
since the first season

00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:01.590
of "Daredevil" was
released, "Jessica Jones."

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.014
And I'm wondering if you guys
are fans of Jessica Jones

00:31:04.014 --> 00:31:06.588
and if we'll see her at all
in "Daredevil" this season

00:31:06.588 --> 00:31:08.657
or potentially in the future.

00:31:08.657 --> 00:31:10.990
KEVIN VLK: Well you guys have
"The Defenders" coming up.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:14.040
This is all leading up to the
big team up of "The Defenders."

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.248
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: No comment.

00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:16.249
KEVIN VLK: No comment.

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:17.790
AUDIENCE: Are you
guys at least fans?

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.830
CHARLIE COX: Yeah, I
love "Jessica Jones."

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:21.970
I thought it was fantastic.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.630
And I don't really want
to hog another question,

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.854
but what I would say
is having seen it

00:31:27.854 --> 00:31:29.520
and recognize that
how totally different

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.269
it is from the first
season of "Daredevil"

00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:34.340
and how brilliant it is, I'm so
interested to see how those two

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.389
characters, that world
combines, including

00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:38.680
the world that they create
for Luke Cage and Iron Fist.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.800
I think that's going to
answer a lot of the questions

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.300
that people have about whether
it works within The Avengers,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.660
because those two shows
were very different.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.660
But I think we can
see how they will

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.196
exist in the same universe.

00:31:51.196 --> 00:31:52.754
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:31:52.754 --> 00:31:53.590
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.370
I love the show.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.680
Thank you so much for coming.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.810
It's great to see you guys.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.185
I actually live
in Hell's Kitchen

00:31:58.185 --> 00:32:01.372
and it's a super pleasant
and safe place [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:01.372 --> 00:32:04.871
So it's really fun to watch
the show and look out my window

00:32:04.871 --> 00:32:07.540
and go, OK, whatever.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.270
My main question
is, you guys have

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.099
such complicated and amazing
fighting choreography

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:14.140
during the show, especially
kind of thinking back

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.900
to that one ridiculous hallway
scene where Daredevil is just

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.182
really beating up
a ton of people.

00:32:19.182 --> 00:32:20.890
When you guys are
doing really big scenes

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.160
like that where you want
it to kind of be one shot,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.180
how much time and
preparation and practice

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.342
do you guys go through, and how
many takes do you guys end up?

00:32:29.342 --> 00:32:31.050
Specifically for that
one scene, how many

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.380
takes before you actually
got the final cut?

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.770
And then as a
follow up, Charlie,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:38.040
how well can you actually
see through that mask

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.290
that you wear during the show?

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.860
Before the red suit of course.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.700
CHARLIE COX: So great question.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.670
So the first thing I will say
is, Phil Silvera, our stunt

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.030
coordinator, a genius.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.949
My stunt double, Chris Brewster,
is as an extraordinary human

00:32:54.949 --> 00:32:57.365
being, as well as being one
of the nicest people I've ever

00:32:57.365 --> 00:32:57.510
met.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.500
I mean, some of the stuff
he pulls, it's like--

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.380
I remember saying a
cut piece of footage

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.060
from one of the
episodes last year

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.050
and thinking that
they'd slowed it

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.290
down or something,
because I didn't

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.110
realize a human being could
sat in the air as long as that.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.250
But they didn't.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.270
As Elodie said, we
get very little time.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.484
The stunt team are
rehearsing through the week.

00:33:19.484 --> 00:33:20.650
We're shooting other scenes.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.240
And then we come in and we
learn most of the fights.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.270
It's shot as you would shoot a
scene, so it's shot in pieces.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:31.579
So I'm able to learn between
six and 10 moves at once.

00:33:31.579 --> 00:33:32.870
And I learn that as best I can.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.060
We shoot that and we move
onto the next section.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.560
And we go about it that way.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:42.040
The fight that you're referring
to in season one was one take.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.930
And what was cool
about that was we

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.950
spent the whole morning--
we had a day to do it.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.890
We spent the whole morning
just rehearsing the camera

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.870
movements, so just basically
plotting the action.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.030
And it was just all
about the camera.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.630
We then started shooting it.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:02.554
And take two or three
was pretty good.

00:34:02.554 --> 00:34:04.220
We got through it,
you know what I mean?

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.580
And everyone was like,
that was pretty good.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.940
And then someone went, I think
we could probably do better.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.100
And then at midnight,
we were still there.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.649
And we were like
literally on our--

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:19.190
because it's a long take-- we
were either on our 12th or 13th

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.690
take.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.920
And we were like OK,
we'll do it one more time.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.300
Chris Brewster got
injured at one point

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.633
and we weren't sure if was
going to be able to continue.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.409
And we did one more
and that was the one.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.440
It just all came into place.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.389
And the thing I always think
is memorable about that scene,

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.440
and it's something that
we kind of- maybe this

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.565
isn't true-- but I was
thinking we kind of stumbled

00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:41.929
upon it accidentally,
was that Daredevil

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.520
and the other characters
need time to breathe.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.570
They get out of breath.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.780
And there's moments where
both of them are kind of,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.120
they know they've got to
go back at each other,

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.429
but they're prolonging
it because they're

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.345
catching their breath.

00:34:51.345 --> 00:34:54.580
And that was true
because it was happening.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.580
You know what I mean?

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.621
They were trying to give
themselves as much time.

00:34:57.621 --> 00:35:00.540
And I think that's
what a fight is like.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.110
You can't keep going like that.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.860
You are destroyed.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.340
And I think that that may change
how people do fight scenes

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.032
in-- stop looking at
your watch-- change

00:35:13.032 --> 00:35:15.720
how people do things
in the future.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.530
KEVIN VLK: That wasn't for you.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:20.131
Got Netflix looking at me.

00:35:20.131 --> 00:35:22.940
AUDIENCE: Hey guys,
huge fan of the show.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.860
I was just wondering,
so obviously Wilson Fisk

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.380
gets locked up at the
end of season one.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:34.503
Can we expect for him to
make a cameo in season two

00:35:34.503 --> 00:35:36.704
or in the upcoming seasons?

00:35:36.704 --> 00:35:37.912
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: No comment.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.312
CHARLIE COX: We literally
can't answer that question.

00:35:46.312 --> 00:35:48.270
AUDIENCE: And the next
question is for you Jon.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.775
Being that your character
uses such military precision,

00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:53.150
can you tell us
a little bit more

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.816
about what you did to
prepare for the role?

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.440
JON BERNTHAL: I mean as far as
the physicality and the weapons

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.636
training, I think when
you prepare for a part,

00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:11.489
it's twofold, right?

00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:12.780
There's all the physical stuff.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.140
There's how is he going to walk?

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.139
How is he going to talk?

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:19.840
How is he going to handle the
familiarity with the props,

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.880
the weapons, and
so on and so forth?

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.710
But then there's the
real deal preparation.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.500
And that's the diving
in, the emotional stuff.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:34.850
And I've said before, I'm
a husband and I'm a father.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.760
And I think that
there's no way I

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.440
could begin to even attempt
to tackle this part until I

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.510
got there.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.950
I think until I really
realized and know

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.250
in my bones what it's like to
love people so much more than I

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.860
love myself and so willingly
would give up my life for them,

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.080
how can I begin to imagine what
it would be like for this man

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.210
if somebody took his family?

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.590
And what that
requires, for me, is

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:09.080
going to a really, really scary,
really, really dark place.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.610
And since it scared the living
shit out of me, I was like,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:12.670
I really got to do this.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.480
I really got to try this.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.472
But that's where it kind of all
sort of starts with me is that.

00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:22.180
Sorry, that doesn't
answer your question,

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.179
but that's where-- yeah.

00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:24.454
Sorry.

00:37:24.454 --> 00:37:25.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.429
KEVIN VLK: Last question.

00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:28.220
AUDIENCE: Hey guys.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.203
Thank you for coming along.

00:37:29.203 --> 00:37:31.550
It's been a pleasure seeing
you guys answer questions

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.800
and discuss them.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.227
One question for
you Karen is, being

00:37:37.227 --> 00:37:41.305
in the middle from the
perspective of seeing Daredevil

00:37:41.305 --> 00:37:44.246
do what he does in
helping out the community,

00:37:44.246 --> 00:37:47.630
but also in season two
seeing Punisher kind of exact

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.810
his revenge of what the
normal citizen would

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.410
want if he was in that
predicament of losing someone,

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:55.320
how do you feel her
character interprets

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.087
the right moral
choice as [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:57.087 --> 00:37:58.420
CHARLIE COX: Oh, great question.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.270
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: I mean, you've
hit upon Karen's storyline

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:03.844
for season two, essentially.

00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:05.260
I think if you
look at someone who

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.843
has this questionable
past-- we're not

00:38:06.843 --> 00:38:08.860
quite sure what
that is, but we do

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.630
know about what
happened with Wesley.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.520
Now if the whole world looks
at Frank Castle and says,

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.539
he's a monster, then
Karen's a monster.

00:38:16.539 --> 00:38:18.080
If the whole world
looks at Daredevil

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.690
and says Daredevil's a hero,
well, Karen took it too far.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.770
So I think she looks at
these examples of people

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.560
who are doing
things in her life,

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.390
and she has to determine
for herself whether she

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:33.070
thinks what she did was right.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.412
And it's an
unanswerable question.

00:38:36.412 --> 00:38:37.870
I mean, there is
no answer to that.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.670
It's not right,
and it's not wrong.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:45.650
And she was in a situation that
none of us-- we hope none of us

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.900
will ever be in.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.480
So I think I can go so far to
say that Karen is fascinated

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.610
by Frank Castle and what he
means, what he represents,

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.170
because in some ways
he represents her.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.400
AUDIENCE: Thank so much.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:58.790
KEVIN VLK: Thank you.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:59.430
Great question.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.929
And quickly, because
I know you guys

00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:04.170
got to go, just through your
guys' development from season

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.830
one now to season two, and now
you guys joining on season two,

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:10.160
just from the beginning
of that to the end, what

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.950
did you find in your characters
that surprised you the most

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.408
or that excited you the most
about each of your characters?

00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:18.710
ELODIE YUNG: You looking at me?

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.210
KEVIN VLK: I'm
looking right at you.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.256
You haven't spoken in a while.

00:39:22.256 --> 00:39:24.880
ELODIE YUNG: I don't think there
is one thing I could pick from

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.200
this character that
really [NON-ENGLISH]--

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.780
stands out more for me.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.880
It's not English,
but you guys got it.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.900
You know, Elektra is
such a complex character.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.570
For me, just having
the opportunity

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:48.660
to get to know what-- just go
back to the essence of Elektra

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.250
and discover this
world of comics

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.080
was something new and
fascinating for me.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:59.170
Trying to capture the essence
and put it in this character

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.685
that we built for the
show was exciting.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.590
I talked a lot with
the writers, and they

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.260
wanted her to be a sociopath.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.650
So I had to do some
homework and really

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:19.490
trying to find out
what a sociopath is.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:23.630
Yeah, playing someone that
seemed to be very cold,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:30.500
that has no remorse, no sense
of guilt, no sense of empathy

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.940
or who doesn't care about
the well-being of others,

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.910
that was something actually
pretty interesting for me.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.040
All this aspect, all this
side was really good.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:45.670
But then tapping into my own
emotions and my own experience

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:54.560
to bring some of her more human
side and some of this failure

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.810
that I talked about with this
relationship and this love

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.810
she had once for
Matthew, that was also

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.770
very-- that was great
as an actress to do that

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.490
as well, in some scenes.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.550
So the whole thing.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.480
I mean, I just love
Elektra, and that's it.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.060
It was just good for me.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.477
It was really good.

00:41:17.477 --> 00:41:18.810
JON BERNTHAL: What surprised me?

00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:32.070
I think that he's in
such a dark sort of cloud

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.630
of rage and anger, but
within that, his ability

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:41.910
to be not just tactical
in terms of how he fights,

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.130
but psychologically tactical.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.090
And he's got the
ability to manipulate.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.060
And he can be cunning.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:53.690
And that was a pleasant surprise
that they let me kind of play

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.774
with that, I guess
his intelligence.

00:41:56.774 --> 00:41:58.440
DEBORAH ANN WOLL: I
won't cry this time.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:08.450
I, Deborah, am sort of a
silly, dare I say dorky person.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.312
And I never really saw
much room for that in Karen

00:42:11.312 --> 00:42:12.020
at the beginning.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.510
She seemed like
such a serious sort

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.080
of intelligent minded person.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.730
And this year I
think I was surprised

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.550
I was able to find more
of that aspect of myself

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.260
in it, that there
were moments where

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.000
she felt a little awkward.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.375
I feel like she cannot keep
her cool around Matt Murdock.

00:42:26.375 --> 00:42:30.084
And there are some
really fun moments

00:42:30.084 --> 00:42:31.750
that I can't talk
about too specifically

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.750
where serious, serious
things were happening.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.490
And then we did a
scene following it,

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.170
and there were moments where
I found myself cracking jokes

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.320
that I didn't even know
were in the script,

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.430
and sort of laughing in them.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:50.390
And I don't know, it was a
surprising, cool thing to find.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.940
CHARLIE COX: A
really good question.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.000
The thing that sprung to
mind was that, I guess,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.170
what surprised me
about the character,

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.996
but also I think about all
characters, all people,

00:42:59.996 --> 00:43:01.870
is that we're kind of
walking contradictions,

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.960
you know, and we can
simultaneously believe

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.560
two very, very opposite things.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.060
I think it's a Kris
Kristofferson song where

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.870
he says we're walking
contradictions

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.420
or something like those things.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.890
And I think with
Matt that's probably

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:26.340
the thing that confuses
the most is that he's

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.830
one person with Karen.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.242
And that is very true.

00:43:29.242 --> 00:43:30.200
That is very authentic.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.574
That is really how he believes
and what he wants in life.

00:43:32.574 --> 00:43:35.300
And then he's a very
different person with Elektra.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.430
That side of himself is
also valid, is also real.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:42.080
And yet if, as an
outsider, if you

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.872
were to see those
behaviors, you would say,

00:43:43.872 --> 00:43:44.830
that guy's a hypocrite.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:46.340
But I'm not sure
that that's true.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.712
And I think often we relate to
those kind of things as people.
