00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.837
In today's video,

00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:03.300
we're going to be teaming up
with Flite Test to see

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.300
if we can build a toilet
that flies through the skies.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.480
[Music]

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.250
What are we doing
with all this foam, Nate?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.100
Guys, we've got a lot of foam,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.900
and we are going to turn
it into a toilet.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.960
Fully functioning toilet.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.980
Is that right?

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:22.803
No.

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:24.500
Yeah, he's gonna test it.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.960
That's not going
to happen either.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.380
He even brought his own poop.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.950
We will have something
that lets us use the poop.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.800
However, it will not be
a fully plumbed toilet,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.300
because it's going to be made
out of Styrofoam.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.400
But what's even cooler

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.500
about it is we are going
to take this toilet,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.600
after we've carved it,
we're going to put in a box,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.300
and we're going to ship it over
to the guys at Flite Test.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.800
So the guys over
at flight tests are incredible.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.300
They make things fly
that shouldn't fly.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.100
So, why not a toilet?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.100
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.800
We've got a lot
of white styrofoam.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.300
We're going to stack it up,
and glue it together,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.326
and then carve it
into the shape of a toilet.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.030
It will then be shipped
to Flite Test,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.160
who's going to attach wings
and make it soar.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.100
They've got wings,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.900
they've got motors,
they've got rotors,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.400
and with all of that added on,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.294
they should be able
to take our toilet shape

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:06.094
and make it fly.

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:07.700
One other thing we
are hoping to do,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.400
we want to take the toilet,
like a back of it,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.900
where the plumbing
would come out,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.433
and make a little chamber
for our poop emoji.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.940
So that by remote control,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
they can make it drop
out of the toilet onto whoever

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.100
happens to be below.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.800
Let's cut up some
sheets of Styrofoam,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.600
and glue them together
using expanding foam.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.420
♫ Everybody is Kung Fu fighting. ♫

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.420
On... You just...

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.360
There we go.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.740
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:02:16.200
[Music]

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.774
So we're going to
start carving this,

00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:19.480
and we're going to turn
it toilet shaped,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.900
and we're going to be using like
saws and stuff to cut it up.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.700
So the reason
that were using this type

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.623
of foam instead of the usual
smooth insulation foam is,

00:02:26.623 --> 00:02:27.800
while that does have

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.100
a nicer finish, this
is going to be a lot lighter,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.400
it's probably going to fly
a little bit easier.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.800
It's also easier to carve,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.600
and it's the color that we
want it to end up, white.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.200
[Music]

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.640
We are not super concerned

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.600
with getting exact measurements
for any particular toilet.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.707
There's thousands of types
of toilets in the world.

00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:49.400
Everyone has a different design,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.900
and as long as we have something
that's generally toilet shaped,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.375
we're going to be
pretty happy with it.

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.200
But I do just want to get
a couple measurements,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.180
like okay the back to tank,
it's about 18 inches wide,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.800
8 or 9 inches deep,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.900
and 16-17 inches tall.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:13.360
[Music]

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.400
The styro-slicer might be good
for fine details,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.000
but in the beginning here,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.900
there's really no good
way to do this.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:04:29.140
[Music]

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.400
We've got our toilet,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.900
and there's some pits and stuff
where the styrofoam

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.700
broke occasionally,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.700
and so we're just gonna use
a little bit of spackle,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.000
patch those up,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.400
give that a 30-45
minutes it needs to dry,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.200
and then we're going to paint
it all with white paint.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.548
Hopefully, that'll give it
just a little bit more gloss,

00:04:43.548 --> 00:04:45.000
and make a little
more toilet like,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.700
as well as keeping it
from flaking off quite so much.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.600
And then after that,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.960
we're going to be adding
in a trapdoor,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.100
and some poop.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.940
Yeah.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:22.720
[Music]

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.100
Our toilet has now dried.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.300
We've put all the spackle
and the paint on it,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.300
and it's still
in two separate pieces.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.700
So the tank comes off,
and I'm about to mount that.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.180
But I did go ahead,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.600
and add a little trapdoor
on to the bottom.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.100
So, how this is going to work,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.075
we're going to have
our little poops,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.940
and we're going to make
a parachute for a poop.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.800
And then this thing right here,
drops open so we'll be able

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800
to have our poop up
inside of the toilet,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.405
and then the Flite Test guys
are going to probably

00:05:50.405 --> 00:05:51.700
change out this latch.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.600
So they have something on
with a remote control.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.560
So while our toilet is flying
around, poop just fall out,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.600
and they'll sail
down on parachutes

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.590
that look like toilet paper.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:16.420
[Music]

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.480
We are gonna be adding
some expanding foam

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.300
into these as well to hold
them just a little bit more.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:59.320
[Music]

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.600
We've got our toilet built,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.600
our poops have their little
toilet paper parachutes.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.200
We even have a poop cam.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.397
Now, we're just gonna take
a couple minutes, and see

00:07:08.397 --> 00:07:10.200
if we can throw
our parachute poops,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.400
and get them to glide
down nicely into our bowl.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.200
After that, we're going to be
sending this off to Flite Test,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.400
and it's gonna be
up to them to make it fly.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.206
There's like the tiniest bit
of breeze that direction,

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:20.789
so let's...

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:21.760
Uh-huh.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.440
Not that much.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.990
There wasn't that much breeze.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.600
Oh boy.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.840
[Music]

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.180
Oh, no, the breeze
is coming back towards us.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.300
[Music]

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.820
Nope.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.760
[Music]

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.100
Slowest one yet.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.520
Don't go on the roof.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.620
[Music]

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.480
No.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.440
Hi.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.180
[Music]

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.180
Better.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:13.640
[Music]

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.180
Come on.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.820
Come on.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.440
No!

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:26.800
[Music]

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.040
Yeah!

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:45.260
[Music]

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.040
Nice.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.600
All right.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.180
I'm just gonna--

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.691
I win!

00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:48.660
I'm gonna cheat.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.040
Oh, I did it.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.880
Yeah!

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.060
High-fives all around.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.940
I'm proud of you.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.880
Yeah!

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.118
Toilet's complete,
parachute poop is working great,

00:09:01.118 --> 00:09:02.000
trap doors installed,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.600
it's time to send this
off to Flite Test,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.400
and take a look at
how they've turned this

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.600
into an airplane
that flies through the air.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.600
Hopefully, dropping little
parachute poops on command.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.620
What do you got, Dude?

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.004
Yeah.

00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:16.200
I have a little present
from our friends

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.780
over at King of Random.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.620
King of Random.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:30.800
[Music]

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.300
We still gotta put wheels on it,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.400
we still gotta put a lot
of extra items on,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.620
last-minute moment things,

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.400
but I think,
we're less than 24 hours

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.500
of work away from having
this ready to fly.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.247
Guys, if you want to see
more of this build,

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.297
or just what Flite Test did

00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:44.356
to our toilet, head on over
to the Flite Test Channel.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.600
They've got more for you to see.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.700
Guys, that's not all.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.123
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:50.234
That box up at the top will take
you to Flite Test video,

00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:51.892
showing you how they put
wings on this guy,

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:53.154
and got it to soar
through the air.

00:09:53.154 --> 00:09:54.210
The other box will show you

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.952
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:09:55.952 --> 00:09:57.100
If you hit this bomb the middle,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.275
