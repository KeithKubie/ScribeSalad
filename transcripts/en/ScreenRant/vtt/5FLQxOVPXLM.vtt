00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.340
When some people think of anime, images of
Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh and other children’s shows

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.550
come to their brain, but there’s a whole
other world of smart, animated entertainment

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.160
that comes out of Japan.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.590
And over the years, these movies and TV shows
have become primo inspirations for Hollywood

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.270
movies, whether they get credited or not.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.020
So with that in mind, Screen Rant presents
10 Movies That STOLE From Anime Without Getting

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.020
Caught.

The Matrix/Ghost in the Shell
The Matrix has a lot of iconic moments, but

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.059
the most famous is probably the digital “rain”
of green letters, an advanced coding system

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.859
which determines what goes on within The Matrix.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:55.859
But guess what?

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.399
It didn’t originate from the Wachowskis.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.819
Cyberspace is signified by a similar green
waterfall of digits in Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:07.540
in the Shell, a hugely influential cyberpunk
anime from 1995.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.630
The Wachowskis’ also borrowed the image
of someone being “plugged in” through

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.049
a port on the neck.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.549
You can also see elements of Ghost in the
Shell in James Cameron’s Avatar, Steven

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.520
Spielberg’s Minority Report and Joss Whedon’s
Dollhouse.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.299
It gets around!

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.210
Pacific Rim/Gigantor
Guillermo Del Toro’s Pacific Rim is an homage

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.820
to the Japanese kaiju and mecha animes of
the past, and there are a lot of series and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.230
movies that inspired it.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.780
But the film also takes directly from Gigantor,
an animated TV show from the 1950s that aired

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.340
pretty regularly on both Japanese and American
television.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.479
The main giant robot, or “Jaeger,” of
the film, is called “Gipsy Danger,” and

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.060
its design is clearly derived from Gigantor,
the first giant robot of anime.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.399
It makes sense within the context of the film,
as “Gipsy Danger” is an older, obsolete

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.450
Jaeger, which, ironically, is exactly what’s
needed to save the day.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.110
Requiem for a Dream/Perfect Blue
Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream was

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.010
praised for its innovative way of using montage
to demonstrate the effects of drug use.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.049
The result is a visceral immersion into the
world of addiction, but little did people

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.910
know that Aronofsky was stealing techniques
from across the Pacific Ocean.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.930
The famous “bathtub scene” - in which
an in-withdrawal Jennifer Connelly screams

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.220
into the water - was actually taken directly
from a similar scene in Perfect Blue, a 1997

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.299
anime thriller.

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.970
In fact, Aronofsky actually bought the rights
to Perfect Blue just so he could copy that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.590
scene.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.159
Avatar/Princess Mononoke
We already discussed the influence of Ghost

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.840
in the Shell on Avatar, but James Cameron
also stole some ideas from Hayao Miyazaki’s

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.870
classic Princess Mononoke, which is about
the spirits of a forest and their struggle

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.829
against the humans who want to exploit it
for resources.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:05.909
Does that sound familiar?

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.850
Well, maybe because it’s just like the environmentalism
Avatar, which is about the Na’vi species

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.019
and their struggle against human colonizers
of Pandora.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.220
Is it a coincidence?

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.000
We think not… as we’ve already established
that James Cameron is a fan of anime.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.510
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World/Naruto
Edgar Wright’s Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.019
is based on a comic by Daniel Lee O’Malley,
and the inspiration of anime and manga on

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.010
that comic is obvious from O’Malley’s
drawing style.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.170
But one anime stands out in particular.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.920
In Naruto, the title character dreams of becoming
the most powerful ninja in his town, which

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.970
resembles the young Scott Pilgrim’s quest
to win the Battle of the Bands.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.550
In addition, Pilgrim is clearly modeled on
Naruto, and even uses some of the catchphrases

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.700
that come from the Naruto TV show.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.079
Looper/Akira
Akira is one of the most famous animes of

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.860
all time, and in 1989 it set the stage for
the Japanese animation invasion of the 1990s,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.879
when American TV screens were filled with
imported Japanese series.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.840
The darkly comic cyberpunk tale has inspired
everything from Christopher Nolan’s Inception

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.610
to the music video for Kanye West’s “Stronger.”

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.290
One movie that really takes from it, however,
is Rian Johnson’s Looper, about a time-traveling

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.750
hitman who gets sent back in time to be killed
by his own hand.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.670
Johnson has called his movie a cross between
The Terminator and Akira, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.580
character bearing a surprising resemblance
to the anime’s Tetsuo.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.260
Her/Chobits
The premise of Her is that Joaquin’ Phoenix’s

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.160
lonely introvert falls in love with a Siri-like
operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.300
- or, as the jokes put it: he falls in love
with his phone.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.630
But director Spike Jonze wasn’t the first
to latch on to this basic idea.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.110
In the anime Chobits, which came out in 2002,
the main protagonist falls in love with an

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.110
android.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.020
Both films make a point not to mock their
lonely main characters, and embrace the idea

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.760
that artificial technology can be an intellectual
match for humans.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.150
Unlike some of the directors on this list,
however, Jonze has never spoken of his anime

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.420
influences.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.810
Man of Steel/Birdy the Mighty
Zack Snyder is known for his super-stylish

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.910
action, and Man of Steel is no exception to
this.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.130
We all know that the movie is based on DC’s
famous Superman comics, but Snyder also, obviously,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.660
had a source of inspiration from across the
sea.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.820
The main fight at the end of the film -- in
which Superman and General Zod battle it out

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.190
and destroy Metropolis in the process -- bears
a strong resemblance to the city-destroying

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.690
battles in an anime called Birdy the Mighty.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.310
So if you’re wondering where Snyder’s
visual panache comes from… start checking

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.210
out some anime.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.000
Transcendence/Serial Experiments Lain
The Johnny Depp-starring Transcendence was

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.370
a box office disappointment when it came out
in 2014, but you can’t say it wasn’t ambitious.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.850
In the film, Depp plays a scientist whose
body dies, but he manages to stay alive in

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.510
computerized form, eventually growing in power.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.330
It’s weird for a Hollywood film, maybe,
but the premise is pretty normal for an anime.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.630
In fact, it was done 16 years earlier in Serial
Experiments Lain, in which a teenage girl

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.740
dies, but continues to contact her friends
digitally, and also begins to grow in power.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.960
Inception/Paprika
And the grandaddy of all Hollywood anime-thefts:

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.900
Inception.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.250
When this brain-teaser came out in 2010, it
wowed audiences with its idea of using technology

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.000
to invade people’s dreams.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The only problem?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.770
That’s also the premise for Satoshi Kon’s
modern classic Paprika, which came out four

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.530
years before Nolan’s film.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.280
In fact, the premise was so similar that a
planned American adaptation of the anime was

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.180
cancelled before production.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.830
Most anime fans, however, would argue that
Kon’s film is the more imaginative and entertaining

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.400
one.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:10.110
Are there any other movies that stole ideas
from anime?
