and you take advantage of device
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.780
and you take advantage of device
capabilities but with every new feature

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
capabilities but with every new feature
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.840

you obviously increase the app size and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850
you obviously increase the app size and
 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.880

that increasing the app size comes with
downsides and I'm sure some of you have

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340
downsides and I'm sure some of you have
 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.920
