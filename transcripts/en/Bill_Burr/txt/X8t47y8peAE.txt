Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:09          Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:10          I'm just checking in on you. I'm taking time out of my day to read advertising to make a little more scratch, just to make sure that your week is going okay. All right. That's all I'm trying to do here. Jesus Christ's I hear one more fucking asshole. Bring up that stupid Michael Jackson video. I don't know. What are they going to dig them up and arrest them?

Speaker 4:          00:37          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:37          You know and I, I love when anybody did you see that thing on murder mountain? Did you see the making of a murderer? And you go in there and you listen. You basically you are watching, you're watching the prosecution's case. That's not how a case works. Then you had the defense. All right. And I think it's kind of fucked up that you can have something come out about a dead guy and then everybody's just going to be like, all right, now we know definitively that this guy, he should be allowed to refute moonwalk out of the grave and be like, listen, just because I talk like this and I like castles and have a giant ice cream machine in like 17 doors, that lock or the weight in my bedroom doesn't even fucking a child. He should be able to say that and that because I think he's innocent a, it's, it's for you and me.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Right? So we get the chance to do that. So some day, you know, somebody can't just say, Hey, I saw this guy with this tally whacker fucking wagon out of the zipper there. Right? You have a chance to defend yourself and what this new fucking bullshit of the Internet where they just all do processes thrown out the fucking window. The amount of people that I've seen accused of this me too, Shit. And then people just immediately go. Like I always knew he was at Pz Shit. It's just like you haven't heard, you've, you've heard an accusation. But having said that, having said that, it makes me feel better about the suffering of humanity, right? Cause when you look at human being suffering, if you're any sort of a human being, it bothers you. All right? But when you see 90% of them on the Internet going, N***a, you, that guy, will you be you? Yet at that point you're like, well maybe I baby, maybe they don't need that much food.

Speaker 2:          02:17          Oh that was just me, Bill, that was to meet for the morning. I am a little bit of a disappointing morning. I was going to go fly a helicopter and we couldn't get the fucking thing started. This our 22 I don't know what the deal is. Like if you try to start it before eight, the magnetos are too cold, it's too cold outside this time of year and it just doesn't want to start. So we've, we brought a car up to jump in, which we'd done before and it has been fine. It looks funny as hell. But if you just don't look at the fact that it's a car and it's a helicopter and you just look at the engine and you're like, oh, it's the same fucking so fucking gas combustion engine. All right. Same fucking principles here. Um, I was really looking forward to flying and I know what a lot of you guys are saying like, oh my God, I know why.

Speaker 2:          03:00          There's no fucking way I want to floats up that I had invited y'all shot. I know, I know what you'll get in your car that fucking every time you drive over a puddle at fucking Jesus in your face, right? Coming up through the rusted out floorboards as you're texting, driving 90 miles an hour right down the fucking street. We'll say 50 drive and 50 looking down at your fucking phone and there's no guardrail and there's somebody driving 50 miles an hour, just one, not even like three feet up. You. Have you ever noticed that when you drive down the fucking street, just on a two way street, like the fact that you're going 50 and the other guys going 50 and it never dawns on you like, what is that guy just fucking swerved over. We'd both be fucking dead. It's like you're doing like what the, the blue angels fly at each other.

Speaker 2:          03:41          The last second they turn away. You're doing that with complete strangers. You're not on the radio talking to each other and every day, every day somebody on their fucking phone, they drift over headlight, the front headlight, Bam. Right brain smashing on the inside of the skull or what do people say? What do people say? Oh my God, it's a fucking shape. That's it. But the next time you go to get in a car and nobody says like, Hey, I'll go, maybe you should walk. You're going to fucking die. Sorry. I'm trying to preempt everybody who's going to sit there and fucking say a bunch of fucking shit here. Anyways, plowing ahead. Guess who finally figured out how the Moto GP website works. Not this guy. Somebody gave me the Lincoln show me and then I was able to put in my password and a so thank you to the, to the listener who helped me out and I got to watch that race. The first one of the Aaron [inaudible] or a, what do they call k Tar? The English guys?

Speaker 5:          04:38          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          04:38          like every little fucking word they say different than us. It's amazing that we speak the same language over here. We say Ducati, they see do catty Oregano or a Ghana, tomato, tomato, Qatar, Qatar. I didn't know that the scene or Qatar, Qatar is, they think God was saying it. Um, I don't know when I just hear shit like that. I really, and to start to understand how difficult it is to be a spy, because that's, that's the shit that gets you caught. You get the accent down, you know, you watch a little peaky blinders and you go over there and next thing you know you're in Buckingham Palace and you fucking snooping around to find out what those balding concert doing in there with all the goddamn money. Right. And then all of a sudden, what do you do? You let it do, you got, uh, uh, Duke, a Ducati. Forgot how he said it. A Ducati slip, then that's it, right? The queen pushes a button. You go through the floor right down to the royal alligators. Um,

Speaker 5:          05:38          yeah,

Speaker 2:          05:38          there's the, I'm gonna tell you right now, but motor GP, this is the best fucking racing that is out there.

Speaker 2:          05:44          All right. On the final lap, the two, the two people, Andres Divisio so, and Mark Marquez in first and second place, they change leads. The delayed changed three times in the final fucking, even though I knew it would happen, I was still up off the couch, you know, everybody was asleep. So I was screaming quietly watching it. Um, and amazing race. Uh, a little bit of controversy though. Huh? Do Ducati's the Ducati's they got this new little piece that they have underneath the bike that uh, allegedly is kicking up air to cool off the rear tire. And these guys, I guess they chew up their tires big time. So if he has this little bit of an advantage, so Davitt CEO. So one Ducati, one, uh, the team and immediately four teams complaint, which I'm guessing is Honda Suzuki. Uh, by the way, how come there's no Harleys are fucking Indians in the Goddamn race? Well, what happened? My country, we started making fucking motorcycles before all of these constantly. I gotta look this up.

Speaker 2:          06:55          It's so funny that like, Indians in like Honda's, it just for like fat fucks, not Honda's Harleys. Essentially. It's for old guys want to sit down. I like the pegs up nice and highs my fucking air up my old fucking ball bag as I drive down the fucking street and all the Japanese bikes and the Italian bikes, they're all for the young guys who think they're gonna live forever. Right? Having said all this, having talked to all this shit, you know, if I was going to get a bike, which I would love to, um, if I wasn't, you know, live in for somebody else now, but even then, even before he had a kid, like, I always liked my legs. Um, I like my feet pointing in the direction they're supposed to be rather than turned around like I'm fucking like daffy duck's bill. Every other cartoon. Um, all right. What the hell was I looking up?

Speaker 5:          07:49          Oh,

Speaker 2:          07:50          first motorcycle built. All right, let's see who built it first. Oh, I got the bad internet. Huh? Sometimes you get the bad cocaine. Sometimes you get the bad internet. What the fuck are you doing here? Can I only white one first?

Speaker 5:          08:11          Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:11          Fucking motorcycle ever built.

Speaker 5:          08:17          That's going to bring a porno of,

Speaker 2:          08:21          as I said, fucking in it. Come on, come on. You can load. You can, you can load if you want to. You can answer my fucking question.

Speaker 2:          08:31          What is the AH, Jesus fucking Christ. How much do you have to pay? How much I am fucking pay nine grand a month for fucking write the first motorcycle international combustion petroleum field motorcycle was was the damn. You're right. Vogle that sounds like German. It was designed and built by the German inventors. Ah, you fucking son's up. Is there anything worse than when you think a man did something or America did it and you find out they didn't still worst? I feel like the world's smiles when that happens. A motorcycle often called a bike or a motorbike or a cycle. I know what that is. Okay. 1,894 Hildebrand and Wolf Mueller became the first series production motorcycles and the first to be called a motorcycle in 2014 the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume or Honda? Yamaha and the hero motor corps. I don't know. It's in India.

Speaker 5:          09:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:31          All right. So we're not the only ones making motorcycles. Then on in Moto GP.

Speaker 2:          09:36          What is it about like Italians in, in uh, Japanese motorcycles that they just make the fastest ones they got, they got that on lock down and look at fucking, um, Japan. They got Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha. So what I'm finding out is this Suzuki's of the best in the corners, but then the Ducati's and Honda's just have too many horses when they go down the straightaway, which is fucking weird to me. You know, I guess it would depend on the track because the one they were riding riding on head like two long straightaways so when he sort of fucking ground the dude and the Suzuki would gain, he would just lose it every time you would go by the grand stairs over there. All right. Enough motorcycle talk. But I really enjoyed it. Uh, if you want to jump on board, there's only like 20 fucking racist. They're like 22, 2124 laps. They fly by and you're watching guys going 200 fucking miles an hour on a motorcycle, like an eighth of an inch away from each other. It's done. I'll tell you, it's unfucking believable. I've been given Yannis Pappas Shit. One of my favorite comics out there. Absolutely brilliant guy. But he's like the classic fucking New Yorker where he did this Instagram post, right? And uh,

Speaker 5:          10:49          yeah,

Speaker 2:          10:49          he's like in Philadelphia and he goes, look at these, these go and look at the buildings, look at buildings, buildings. And he goes, every city looks like New New York City for a block and a half. And then the whole thing falls apart. You know? And I this, there's something just so fucking funny about the way New Yorkers travel.

Speaker 5:          11:08          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:08          You know, every place they go to, if they can't do exactly what the fuck they can do in New York City, the place sucks. It's like you're in Philadelphia. Why would it look like New York City? That's why you travel. Oh, where are all the fuck you'd build thing? The tristate area is arguably the biggest collection of meatheads in the United States of America. And I, and this is saying something cause I grew up in Greater Boston, you know, and if you want to see the level of meat had, just watch a Boston sporting event when they pay into the crowd.

Speaker 5:          11:46          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:47          All right. And I'm not talking down. I know I'm part of the problem.

Speaker 5:          11:51          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:52          So I've just been leaving all these fucking messages.

Speaker 6:          11:54          How New Yorkers just think everything sucks. This such fucking moron. Oh, I went to fucking used it. Right. I mean Houston, Texas. So I ordered the linguine and the fuck else. You fucking terrible.

Speaker 4:          12:07          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          12:07          Okay. Good. Good Italian. And use the Texas. Why didn't you get the barbecue? You dumb. Fuck.

Speaker 4:          12:13          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:13          Why don't you get some Tex Mex

Speaker 6:          12:17          [inaudible] I went to buffalo, right. I fucking went to the buffalo wild wings and fucking wigs. I tag good

Speaker 2:          12:26          fucking morons. They are fucking morons. It, you know what's funny? I um, I went to the Brody Memorial, right? I can't remember. I talked about this on Monday. I still can't get over this. This guy was eulogizing is that the right word? Brody Stevens. And he somehow was able to trash Boston twice. It is fucking eulogy. It was one of the high points of it cause it was, you know, it was really uplifting, but it was sad. But it was kind of funny to see that New York fans are that fucking annoyed that we won some championships finally,

Speaker 4:          13:03          you know,

Speaker 2:          13:05          finally won a couple, you know, and that, that it's bothering them so much that they're now reduced to making fun of our skyline.

Speaker 4:          13:13          Uh,

Speaker 2:          13:13          and that's stupid shit that ESPN came up with where they would like say that Boston had an inferiority complex is one of my favorite with New York is one of my favorite thing ever. I don't have the heart to tell New York is that like, yeah, we don't even, we didn't even know that. We didn't know what the fuck it looked like. He'd given us too much credit. Um, I want to say, I already talked about this on Monday, but you know, like whenever they fucking show New England, whenever there's a game in New England, they're always showing some sort of foliage. Uh, something about the revolutionary war and then somebody is eating a fucking oyster is something and it's just like, that's really, that's, that's not a good, uh, that's not a good indication of what's going on. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          13:59          yeah,

Speaker 2:          14:04          yeah. So somebody in a dive bar with a beer and a fucking shot that, yeah, maybe, and don't, don't go to the bull and finch, that stupid fucking cheers thing or whatever the hell it is. Um, anyways, having said that to all the New York is listening, I absolutely love your city. I love the people. I just don't like the Yankees. That's it. Everything else about it. I absolutely love having said that. I love Philadelphia too. I enjoy Washington DC. Milwaukee is one of my favorite cities. I don't fucking, cause when I go there I don't try to get fuck it. Don't, let's get some fucking killer fucking clam chowder is shocked in Green Bay job.

Speaker 4:          14:41          MMM

Speaker 2:          14:45          Dude. I, I fought in, I go, I go to fucking Argentina. Right dude, I'm fucking down yet. And I, and I say to guy, can I get a fucking Sam Adams? [inaudible] got an email she had no Sam Adams.

Speaker 5:          14:58          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:58          So I told this fucking place sucks.

Speaker 5:          15:03          MMM.

Speaker 2:          15:04          Did anybody else, do you have any stories like that? I shouldn't really just blame New Yorkers, but does anybody else have like, cause I think country people are like that too, where they just kind of look

Speaker 7:          15:12          to [inaudible] y'all deal. There's all these broken people out here, man. You give me the wild open spices mile property.

Speaker 2:          15:21          Get me a four wheeler and a good woman who does now the self esteem to walk off. Right. She knows I'll fucking club or over the head and feed her to my pigs. I've done it before. She knows it. We never talk about it. But she knows that she goes out when she goes to feed the pig. She sees a couple of thugs hanging on a nail. She knows what that means. I told her I've been married twice before she gets it.

Speaker 8:          15:48          MMM.

Speaker 2:          15:48          Yeah. People, the purpose of traveling is, is, is the when in Rome, right? When in Rome do as the Romans do. That's what you do. All right. You fucking go over there. Do you go over to fucking, you know, uh, the UK, right? Premiere League. See, get yourself a fucking pint in a scarf and start singing some socks. All right.

Speaker 5:          16:07          Okay.

Speaker 2:          16:08          You know, pull a very busy, like an in a study and you talked to some 90 year old woman over there, you know, in blazing fast English. Go in like, Hey, do you know where we can watch the NFL divisional round playoffs?

Speaker 4:          16:25          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          16:25          You know what it is? I think about New Yorkers, they've just, they've just some too many fucking songs about your city and then all these meatheads who really didn't do that well in school, they think they're part of the success rather than the digits background in the movie. Um, as I've always said, Frank Sinatra was bridging

Speaker 8:          16:41          tunnel. He was a Jersey guy,

Speaker 2:          16:44          four x, and he lives in nowhere. There's no buildings and fucking place sucks.

Speaker 5:          16:49          Yeah.

Speaker 8:          16:50          Um, alright. Plowing ahead here. Uh, I did some stand up the other night, first time since Royal Albert Hall. I had a good time trying out new shit. Just like, just nothing. I got nothing. So I'm going to go down to the comedy store possibly this weekend. Well, maybe not this week and maybe next weekend and I'm just gonna fucking,

Speaker 8:          17:14          I'm just going to do 20 minutes of new shit. I'm just going to have like four or five, six subjects written down and I'm going on stage and I'm just going to stand there and fucking take it. Um, and it's one of my favorite things in the world to do. Um, I was just listening to Brody special, the one that he has on fucking iTunes and uh, I just, I don't know, just listening to that guy plowing through this, just one of my favorite things. Definitely gonna miss that guy. Um, but it was an incredible memorial service, which I really would think that I talked about it on Monday. I believe I did. I just kept no fucking short term memory. So anyways, Hayden was funny was right before I started, I asked my wife if she could just go talk in the other room because she was talking, she had a phone on speaker and you know, I'm just recording. Just didn't want that shit in the background at all. My God, the fucking look she gave me. It's unbelief. Anal.

Speaker 8:          18:11          She's asking me to do shit all the fucking time. Can you go here? Can you pick up this? Can you do this? Can you do that? I'll ask to do, it was just move down one room, close the door. She just looked at me cause I know what she's going to say. You fucking talk. So fucking lad. When you then effecting third get get the [inaudible], you know it's always, it always comes back. Always come back. Hey de Rosa sent me some, I guess they got this new fucking Charlie Manson movie that's coming out, whether they're trying to make the women that Charlie convinced to kill those people. Victims.

Speaker 4:          18:48          Okay,

Speaker 2:          18:49          I don't give a fuck if you're a victim or not. If you are dumb enough that you let some fucking psycho look in Jesus, talk you into murdering a pregnant woman and then trying to cut the

Speaker 8:          19:00          baby out. Yeah, you shouldn't be walking around in society.

Speaker 2:          19:06          This is the new fucking thing. The new fucking thing now is to go back in time and find a bunch of selfish cons and then somehow blame it on guys. And in order to started with it started with that stupid movie monster.

Speaker 5:          19:20          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:20          Well that fucking loan at tech was a serial killer and I'm watching the movie and they're trying to make me feel guilty. Like I'm, I'm, I'm part of the problem. I'm the reason why she became one. I saw the Jeffrey Dahmer movie. They didn't do that. They just like, this guy's out of his fucking mind and he's eaten people.

Speaker 8:          19:36          Um, I don't know, but it's a woman. There has to be a reason. Maybe she just came out of the womb a complete fucking psycho. Right? Maybe that's what it was. I don't fucking know. I think they tried to like find some sort of trajectory in the madness of Jeffrey Dahmer, but at no point did they blame women. Um, although in fairness to though they, um,

Speaker 5:          20:04          okay.

Speaker 8:          20:05          Who's that guy? That Ed Game Guy, that guy from fucking Wisconsin. Um, they did try to s they did say that his mother fucked him up. So I don't know. Maybe I'm just being a baby, you know, maybe I should have moved to a one room over. Is that, is that what I should've done? Um, all right. So as I mentioned, the Bruins lost two in a row, two in a row, hoping to get back on track here. Um, I'm going to the fucking Gad and dreams April 2nd, everybody. April 2nd. I'm doing the garden of dreams with, uh, John Stewart.

Speaker 2:          20:39          Oh, this is in New York City by the way. Oh my God. They read is unbelievable. It's so much nicer than a Rita's another fucking shit. Cities

Speaker 8:          20:47          I'm doing. It's Jerry Seinfeld. Jon Stewart, Elijah Schlesinger. You're okay.

Speaker 9:          20:55          Uh,

Speaker 8:          20:56          who else? Who else? Who else? I forget who else. Those are the names that I remember. Oh, and yours truly. How could I forget? Lovely mate. Lovely baldy that embolding balled me. Um, that's the name of my one show. One man show. Lovely balled me. I've chosen me. I've decided to ignore all the advertising did sing that I'm not good enough and to say that I am good enough. How fragile is your fucking psyche that you fucking sit there looking at advertising and it fucks with you to that level that you're walking out behind a fucking Papa John's throwing up into a handicapped parking spot right now. I know what you think of bill. Why would you suggest that Papa John's puts the handicap parking behind? I've never eaten it. Papa John's. All right.

Speaker 5:          21:54          Yeah,

Speaker 8:          21:56          I like Papa Ginos Nice fucking Italian. I didn't want some guy named John Making my goddamned pizza. All right. I want someone who can get a fucking tank. That's something that Burns in fucking April. Um, what was I talking about? The I've just, yeah, I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you? First of all, the arrogance of you that you look at a Victoria's secret model and you feel like you have to compete with that. First of all, you can't any more than I can compete with a Brad Pitt. So what is the fucking problem? And the second of all, when's the last time you saw a Victoria's secret model walk into the bar that you're drinking at? All right. You fucking regular looking person. You're an irregular looking person bar, you know with me and the second and eight walks in the room, everybody fucking turns like, like Bo Derek just came walking in and that movie 10 Hollywood just create season. Possible Standard. Yes. It's a movie. I don't understand. Like I like when they do this reboot Buddha top gun. I'm not going to feel like I need to learn how to fly a fucking fat to wherever the fuck they're flying. Was it f 19? [inaudible] are they up to the 19? What are they up to now?

Speaker 8:          23:18          Let's see. Uh, you as a top fighter jet. All right. What do we got here? Don't even fucking tell me. It's called this the sue [inaudible] sue 57. Is it made in Japan? Do we make anything here? Please tell me. An Asian American came up with that and they make this an please for the love of God. Do you guys have fucked up? That was if all our fighter jets are made in Japan and then we have beef with them again and it's like, hey man, can you keep making, making this jet so like we can get you back for bombing the other part of Hawaii now, uh, top 10 best fighter jets in the world. The top seven US fighter jets. I'll come. They're not, not doing the, uh, the f anymore. The JTTF 22. Dude, I'm so old. I remember, I remember the [inaudible], they have 16 was the bump and I remember a two 40 z before the two 80 z before the 300. All right. I remember the f 100. I don't, who's the F-150 in f two 50. I just needed another example was another one where they just kept going up the Mazda rx seven. What are they up to nine.

Speaker 8:          24:42          I love how they think. They say they don't start it. One like Jordan's like the sneakers, you know, then was a Jordan twos, Jordan threes. They started like seven or a hundred. Um, if you wonder what the fuck I'm talking about. I don't, I don't know either. All right. I have no idea. But anyways, I'm doing the gap dreams on, uh, April 2nd. It's in the, uh, it's the theater at Madison Square Garden. As I mentioned on Monday, this is where Eddie Murphy did, uh, the raw special. So I always think about that. So I will be there and I'm also the day before I'm going to go try to go to a Brooklyn Nets game. Now, I haven't gone to a pro game in a minute as far as checking another one off the list and I'd forgotten. I only need like six more teams and I've been to a home game of every protein in all four fucking sports.

Speaker 8:          25:35          Now there's a very select few of you that thinks that's awesome and that's who I'm talking to right now. The rest of you could just fucking zone out because this part of the podcast, it's not about you any more than than an average looking woman. It has to feel intimidated because you know there's another Cindy Crawford coming along, her is now going to make a whole other generation of people not feel pretty enough and I got to tell you something there. There is a beauty in coming to the realization that you, you aren't pretty enough. And just embracing that and just being like, you know what? I'm going to be the coolest six that walks into this bar tonight.

Speaker 8:          26:18          It's all right being a sixth. Then you just add add to it, you know, telecom, couple of jokes, learn how to juggle. You know what I mean? It's like you ever see somebody when they get a three, a Chrysler 300 and they try, they try to make it look like a Bentley. That's what you do. But at no point do you actually say that you're a fucking Bentley or do you get mad that somebody is making a Bentley? Is any of that makes sense? I don't fucking know. Um, this is usually the point here when I would read some advertising, but I didn't get any so far. I wonder why. Probably because I shit on every goddamn one of them. You know, and they fucking sensitive. Think these women today have fucking sensitive. Do you think these millennials get their feelings hurt? See, these fucking advertising companies can't say a goddamn thing. Um,

Speaker 5:          28:16          Okay.

Speaker 8:          28:19          And it's now time to talk about,

Speaker 5:          28:22          yeah,

Speaker 8:          28:22          soccer, I guess Liverpool, my adopted team is still down to point to those men. City cuts. All right. What? Their, uh, wait, wait. Did they get their money from somebody told me, God damn it, it's not Saudi Arabia is it? You know, did they get it from air? Emirates does that when they get it from the airline.

Speaker 5:          28:45          Okay.

Speaker 8:          28:46          Throw some of their first class fucking ticket money at them. I don't remember.

Speaker 2:          28:53          Anyways, they're down a point that down a point and they've got a game. Liverpool's got a game on Monday. They pay full M is, I would say, so they're probably full hand. Boom. You go buy Bulla Wall on Saint Patty's Day. All Saint Paddy's Day you got to get out there where you're green plastic cat.

Speaker 8:          29:08          You know,

Speaker 2:          29:09          where's my Hashtag on that day where I get offended? Everybody going at agreed alligator and allowing net goes,

Speaker 8:          29:15          yeah,

Speaker 2:          29:16          yeah. Everyone's getting shit for you. Don't realize how fucked up that is. You know how funny it is? Irish people are part Irish people. They go out and they just like, there's no other fucking holiday. You know where people go out in, in people who are that nationality literally go out and do the most

Speaker 8:          29:35          like negative stereotype of themselves. You know, black history month, everybody's on their best behavior, right? Jewish holidays, everybody's fucking Schilling. Saint Patty's Day. What happens I, everybody goes out and gets drunk in the fucking street. Dresses like a Leprechaun and passes out in the gutter. That's what happens, right? Fucking corn, beef sandwich. Fucking hanging out of the side of your mouth. Well, that's what I always hated about that holiday. It's like we're one of the prides of the Irish is not only do you drink, you can handle your fucking liquor. Don't, but don't. Can you guys just don't. Just don't make a messy yourself. Fucking sitting there drinking green beer.

Speaker 8:          30:24          The fuck are you doing? Oh Shit. Odell Beckham Jr goes from the giants to the Cleveland browns. Cleveland Brown fans beside themselves can't believe their good fortune. Now they got out, they got that kid there. What's his face there? They got the quarterback. I just spaced on his name. Baker Mayfield, right? He's got a little bit of a swagger. He likes talking a little bit of Shit, right? He likes doing something and doing a little dance in front of the fucking crowd. Now he's got a wide receiver. Right. So what's, this might work if they have like an Al Davis old school sort of thing. Because this reminds me of what the Raiders used to do, where they would take the fucking people. Everybody said don't take, are the outcasts from other teams. And then they would go in there. Everybody would just be themselves and they would have a good time.

Speaker 8:          31:19          I hope it works out for the browns. My Gut says, I can't say that it won't. It just all depends on the coach. The personality. Like that's a good rex Ryan team. Cause then he's talking shit. Oh, Dell's talking shit. Baker's doing what the fuck he does. Uh, but it's definitely going to be exciting. But I actually think, I think it was a good move for the giants. He didn't kind of fit into their, they have vibe defensive minded organization. You look at Eli shows up, he's got Khakis on, he tucks his shirt in. I mean that's, that's what the giants, I guess have become, I don't know, you listened to some of those lt stories. Oh, Dosha fit right in. But, um, I dunno, it was a big move and I don't, I don't think they had to give all, give up too much for the guy and they got a lot of draft picks, see what they do. And uh, I've gotten a couple of friends of mine that a Cleveland Brown fans and they're all saying that GM knows what he's doing. So who knows?

Speaker 5:          32:20          Okay.

Speaker 8:          32:21          The only thing I need out of Cleveland fans is to stop calling you stupid city. The land, the land. Ugh. Fucking Midwest people. The land, the Berg, did they call Cincinnati the natty.

Speaker 4:          32:41          Okay.

Speaker 8:          32:42          Get on the bus. You're in Columbus. You get it the day. Welcome to the day. Is that what they say? Dayton? Huh? Um, all right. Sorry. I'm being a cunt, but it's what I do. All right. That's it. I'm going to be, uh, out and about in La doing some spots bombing this weekend. Uh, probably be down the store on Friday. That's the deal. All right, so go Bruins, go Celtics. Baseball is starting up. A interesting stat here, man. This is something that on the success of the New York Yankees, do you realize the New York Yankees is so fucking successful? That sense they got babe Ruth all right. From the 1920s to this decade, they've only gone one decade where they didn't win a war, at least one world series. And that was the 1980s. And even still, they went to a world series in [inaudible] 81 in lost. Right. If they don't win this year, this'll be the first time that that's the only second time this has happened since women were allowed to vote. Okay. Which was another huge, huge fucking mistake by this country.

Speaker 4:          33:58          Okay.

Speaker 8:          34:00          You should have kept those fucking broads in the kitchen. No. Um, I think it's great that they can talk more. Um, anyways. Am I the only one who's like not looking forward to this next election, presidential election? I just, I just don't see this. I just didn't see it being ever repeat of a few years ago and it's just going to be a fucking train wreck.

Speaker 4:          34:31          MMM.

Speaker 8:          34:32          Until you get that cancer out of the locker room. I just don't know what it's going to be. I, if I, you know, if I was running for president on the democratic side, what I would learn how to do is talk some shit. All right? Stop trying to talk about issues. What you need to do is you need to go in there and you need, you need to make fun of his hair. Make Fun of that to pay. Make Fun of his fucking big motherly hips. You gotta you gotta go after him like that. All right? Why is, why is your face orange and underneath your eyes, his ghost white? Do you have a tanning bed? Is that some sort of cream that you put under your eyes for puffiness? That's what you do. Do not go up there and try to talk policy and interrupt the shit out of them. Just do what he does. Completely ignore all the fucking rules. And then when you get called on it just act like a victim. All right? That's what it's going to be. This is what politics is fucking become. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          35:26          MMM.

Speaker 8:          35:28          I mean I'm acting like it was on the up and up before that. But uh, I dunno. We shall see. Although I do have to give Trump some props ground in that, that airplane, he did do that. He did try to pull the troops out of Syria. You saw the Democrats and Republican. Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Well, yeah, probably fairly in the building. Thanks Richard. I got your checklist for the Trump roast section. Oh, it's going to be [inaudible] we, we were behind a monitor that was showing the rows behind it on the second floor. Dude, everyone's going in the main ballroom and we handed our tickets like, oh, we're going to be hobnobbing with the, the top celebrities in New York. Right. All of a sudden the usher, it looks at our tickets and goes, Oh God, take that elevator. But the, and then you're thinking, all right, well, you know, it's an elevator. You ever see a roast with as an upstairs? It's always, it's the, the day is, and the tables upstairs that are roasts. So at first we're like, all right, well we'll follow all the other people that have seats in that area.

Yeah, that's what it was. They were all tech guys. Gaffers, they are heading for the fucking mixing board. So we're heading for the walkways high above. So we leave. The roasts were walking back towards the station and uh, we were right behind Cheryl Tiegs and her white old Sechi has like how bad did it looked at? I mean, here's what I'm saying, for an old old lady, she probably isn't that bad.
