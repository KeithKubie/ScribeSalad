00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.900
"When I was four years old, as I well
remember, I was brought from Boston to

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.559
this my native town, through these very
woods and this field, to the pond. It is

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.680
one of the oldest scenes stamped on my
memory. And now tonight my flute has

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.200
awakened the echoes over that very water.
The pines still stand here older than I;

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.680
or, if some have fallen, I have cooked
my supper with their stumps, and a new

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.760
growth is rising all around." What we're
looking at on the upland side is the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.430
site of Henry David Thoreau's cabin
where he lived for two years and two

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.200
months in the 1840s. It was a one-story, I think, 10-by-15 or

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.859
thereabouts structure with a window, a
fireplace, native wood; on the downhill

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.990
what we see is his viewscape, his view
of the pond towards what he sometimes

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.409
called "my cove" so he could muse when he
looked out over the pond and think that

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.049
he was seeing as far away as the Plains
of Tartary, as he called it. If there is

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.369
one bottom line, it would have to do with
the ability of not just Thoreau but any

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.799
person to kick start your own renewal, a
new beginning in life. At the very end he

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.530
kind of sums it up by saying, if you
advance resolutely in the direction of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:50.070
your dreams, you will meet with a success
unanticipated in your common hours. Well, the more the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.409
natural world, the other-than-human world
is under stress, under siege, threatened,

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.890
the more the eloquent testimony by the
self-appointed protectors, as Thoreau

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
often described him as being, the more
they become relevant and the more our

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.670
economy becomes interdependent and
people feel powerless, the more the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.810
desire to break away.
That's another way of describing the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.680
Thoreau bottom line in "Walden."
It's a breakaway book, a book about

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.530
breaking away from life as usual. "I went
to the woods because I wished to live

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.760
deliberately, to front only the essential
facts of life, and see if I could not

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.700
learn what it had to teach, and not, when
I came to die, to discover that I had not lived."
