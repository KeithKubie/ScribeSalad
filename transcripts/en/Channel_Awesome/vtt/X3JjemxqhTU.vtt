00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.100
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
Well, I was right.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400
IT'LL NEVER LEAVE!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.400
♪ [DuckTales theme] ♪

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.900
I just got that song out of my head, and it's back!

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.100
It's friggin' back!

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.900
In February 2015, it was announced Disney was rebooting one of their most beloved classic shows, DuckTales.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.360
At first, people didn't know what to think of it. Reboots were everywhere and overdone.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.640
But at the same time, it's DuckTales. It seems like there's possibilities for it.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.400
Then the premiere of the intro was put on YouTube, and it was actually pretty damn good.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.500
It mixed modern animation with the classic Disney comic book style of the 50s.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.100
It was both a great update as well as a great throwback.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.900
Then they did something even cooler.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.760
They released the first episode on YouTube.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.000
Yeah, you can go to Disney XD's YouTube and watch the premiere right now.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.100
Oh, good, I didn't wanna have to borrow someone's Disney Go password.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.500
I guess they're that confident that you'll like it and keep coming back for more.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.900
As you've probably noticed, we've talked about DuckTales several times on this show, so it only makes sense to see if they were right.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.900
Is it as good as they're hyping it up to be and will we come back for more?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.700
Let's find out by taking a look at the first episode of the DuckTales reboot.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.740
It opens with a seagull flying through the air and a bunch of feathered sailors shooing it away.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.300
They're all birds! How does this work?!

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.900
When is Pluto gonna walk Goofy?!

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.060
IT'S NEVER EXPLAINED!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.100
We see some ducks on the water, though, as a boathouse containing Donald Duck and his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie--

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.400
Huey: Good morning, Uncle Donald!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.200
Louie: You can't wear this to your job interview!

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000
NC: Who are presumably now little people in their 20's--

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.400
try to get Donald to his job interview so they can take the boat out and get into trouble.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.800
Donald: Where is that babysitter?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400
Where are you?!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.360
Babysitter: I don't know.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.400
Donald: Crazy old bird.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.200
NC: Did he just call her a crazy old broad?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.700
Donald: Crazy old bird.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.900
NC: Someone's been talking to the cop from Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.300
Cop: Better get looking for the old broad.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.300
Dewey: Alright, boys, we'll get to Cape Suzette and back before anyone realizes we're gone!

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.600
NC: I'll just put the In-Joke Counter over there and pray there's a TaleSpin reboot.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.100
Ooh, maybe a live-action one!

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.000
Donald realizes he can't leave them alone and decides to take them to Uncle Scrooge's house.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Dewey: You were supposed to get him out by 10 o'clock, Hubert!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.900
Huey: You were supposed to signal before you started the boat, Dewford!

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600
Louie: We never get to do anything!

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.400
NC: Loubert.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.120
Executive: With business expanding in the 
Spoonerville and St. Canard markets--

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.400
NC: You know what? I'm just gonna get rid of that. Trust me, there's a lot of them.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.780
Scrooge finds the color has literally gone out of his life, as he doesn't really go on adventures anymore,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.300
he just mostly sits around and talks with his business executives, a group of vultures.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.720
You know, I'm only 3 minutes into this show, and already it's more insanely clever than it needs to be.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.400
Scrooge: Fantastic.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.800
NC: Scrooge is voiced by David Tennant, which is very fitting, seeing how he's so cranky, you can see him instructing someone to throw coffee in their own face.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.900
Kilgrave: Throw it in your face.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.500
NC: Donald and Scrooge don't really get along, but Donald does manage to trick him into looking after the boys for just a few hours.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.560
And yes, by the way, those apples have diamonds in them.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.600
Really think about the number of questions that raises.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.000
Scrooge throws them in their room with a bag of marbles and orders his maid Mrs. Beakley to not let them interfere with anything.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.400
Mrs. Beakley: A gift from your great uncle.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.200
You will return them upon your departure.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.500
He's counted them.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.100
NC: Okay, to be fair, marbles were like the Batarang in the original.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
You can do a lot with them!

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.600
Louie: So we're totally ditching this room, right?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.700
Dewey: Yep, and I know just how to do it.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.500
NC: Ah, see, they're already getting some idea--

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.300
Dewey: Stupid doorknob, come off!

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.600
NC: You know, dammit, show, stop being so clever!

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.440
They escape, but are immediately captured by Beakley's granddaughter,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.980
Wabel.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.900
I mean, Webby.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.200
Webby: What are your blood types?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.360
What's Donald really like?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.280
Who's the evil triplet?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.800
Tell me everything!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.960
NC: QUACKLING HOOK!

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.600
Okay, so while she does seem eerily similar to Gravity Falls' most popular character, there certainly are some differences.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600
1: She has no friends, where Mabel was a social butterfly.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200
Webby: Are we friends now?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.800
Huey: If we say yes, will you let us live?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
Webby: Phht! Good one, new best friend!

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.400
NC: 2: While she's excitable, she's also socially awkward due to Beakley being overly protective.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Webby: Hi, Granny, I'm spending the night at a friend's house, so nothing is wrong!

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.700
NC: And 3: She has kind of a violent edge.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.800
Webby: Who sent you?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.700
Ma Beagle?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.740
Glomgold?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.300
Answer me!

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.900
NC: And to be fair, most people would rather have a variation of Mabel than a variation of the original Webby.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.700
And apparently, the writers thought the same thing as there's an arrow in a doll of her past design.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.000
Too soon.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.920
Can you get rid of her while you're at it?

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.200
Scrooge feels down about the kids calling him a has-been, though, so he plans to go on an expedition to find Atlantis.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.600
Scrooge: I'm no has-been. I am an am-now.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.300
A shift in currents may present a pathway to...

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.500
Atlantis!

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.920
NC: Eh, Joss Whedon already searched once with Disney. It got mixed results.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.960
Webby takes them to the Wing of Secrets--

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.300
Yeah, I told you we're done with that!

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.700
Where they start to wonder if Scrooge as well as Donald actually went on all the adventures they claim to go on.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.640
Webby: Donald Duck is one of the most daring adventurers of all time!

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.480
[quacking]

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.200
NC: Eh, it's good to know that Roxanne is still getting job interviews after breaking up with Max.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.600
He did not trade up, by the way. He's dating some model.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.300
A butt-ugly CGI model.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.440
They accidentally open a chest, releasing the ghost of Captain Peghook

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.700
and his steed, the Headless Manhorse.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.200
[neighing]

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.900
[gong]

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.000
NC: I'm... just gonna pretend I'm gonna sleep well tonight.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.500
He says he won't leave until he gets the head of Scrooge, so Scrooge obliges by giving him the head from one of his statues.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.960
Peghook: I should've been more specific!

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.000
NC: Okay, as funny as that is, we never see that horse again.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.400
And if there's ANY character I wanna know what happened to...

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.300
But they release another ancient evil, a giant Chinese dragon.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.600
And much like the live-action reboot of Mulan, it's only there to consume riches, so it chases after Scrooge's gold.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.100
They get Scrooge's limo driver, Launchpad, to pilot the plane to stop him.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.900
They use the Medusa Gauntlet to turn him into stone, and...

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.600
presumably murder him.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.800
Eh, to be fair, they do show not having a head isn't the roadblock it used to be.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.800
Scrooge is impressed with their adventure-making shenanigans, and he wants them to join him in his search for Atlantis.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:25.600
But in a hilarious twist, the job Donald was applying for belongs to Scrooge's mortal enemy, Glomgold, the second-richest duck in the world.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.720
Glomgold: Welcome, new employees, to Glomgold Industries!

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.560
NC: Well, now we know what the CEO of Tilted Kilt looks like.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.760
NC: So Glomgold wants to go after Atlantis to become the richest duck in the world and he's hired a team of assassins to get it before Scrooge.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.100
Donald: Little Dewey's first steps.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.500
And that's Huey in the playoffs.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.100
He was the waterboy.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.500
NC: It's weird enough seeing Donald with modern day technology, but do his feathers have fingerprints to swipe?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.600
This show is asking so many questions I never thought I would ask.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.160
So Scrooge and the gang make it to Atlantis and find it's all upside-down.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:29.500
Scrooge: The Atlanteans were so eager to build an epic city of wonders and death traps, they didn't stop to figure out a proper support structure, and the whole thing fell into the sea!

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.960
NC: So they made that sign after the city sank?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.880
Brother Maynard: He must've died while carving it.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.500
NC: Dewey wants to experience as much adventure as possible, but he finds being upside-down sucks a lot of the action out of it.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.800
But Donald tries to save Dewey from himself.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.500
Dewey: Give me a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.700
NC: Oh, c'mon, nobody lumps you all together...

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.220
Blue one.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.700
That actually is another cool element of the show.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.600
They try to have Huey, Dewey, and Louie have a little bit more identities, so you can tell them a little bit more apart.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.620
I can't even think of the last time I saw an episode of anything where one gets individual focus as opposed to all of them sharing the same amount of time--

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.200
That's fond remembering!

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.100
But Glomgold gets the jewel first and finds out Donald is related to them, and leaves them to drown.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.600
Dewey: We gotta stop the water!

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.080
Donald: WAAAAGH!

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.740
NC: They're ducks.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.100
They can float.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.120
Donald: I knew I couldn't trust you with the boys!

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.700
Dewey: Stop!

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.020
Scrooge was trying to keep me out of trouble.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.000
But I was so caught up in--

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.500
Why is there a lamp on the floor?

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.700
NC: Hey, c'mon, you interrupted the Disney lesson! We had like 20 more seconds of synth music!

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.140
Scrooge and Dewey: That's the real jewel of Atlantis!

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.300
Scrooge: That thing lit up when the trap was sprung. I bet my bottom dollar it's the power source that runs the city!

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.800
NC: And they said they'd never use those scripts from the TV show that never happened.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.000
Meanwhile, Glomgold's henchmen seem to really suck at what they do as Glomgold tries to blow Atlantis up with everybody inside.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.420
Gabby McStabberson: Mr. Duck!

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.140
Could we... um... maybe bum a ride with you?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.700
NC: We're just gonna be confused for Ninja Turtle villains if we don't get more screen time.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.120
They of course help them out and show up Glomgold with the real treasure.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
Featherly: Mr. McDuck, how do you respond to claims--

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.800
NC: Wow, Roxanne got another job pretty quick!

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.360
Applying for henchwoman and ending up as a TV reporter?

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.560
Life's funny that way.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.680
So through lame excuses not really needed to justify kids going on adventures...

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.700
Donald: These boys will get into trouble.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.960
So maybe you could teach them how
to get out of trouble.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.840
NC: Can't some caregivers just be bad people?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.380
It's agreed that the boys can stay with Scrooge, especially after their houseboat blows up.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.920
Dewey: I may have left the engine running in the houseboat.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.500
NC: The circle is now complete.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.720
Featherly: Reclusive adventure capitalist Scrooge McDuck is back,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.640
solving mysteries and rewriting history.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.660
NC: Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip and Dale's Rescue Ran--

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.700
OH, I HAD IT!

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.400
So Dewey is happy to know that his family is so adventurous and that he truly belongs.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.480
I'll just celebrate this incredibly serviceable ending

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.420
by drinking out of my favorite and most expensive champagne glass

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.180
with my favorite and most expensive champagne inside.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.400
As I will do now.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.400
Dewey: Mom?

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.040
NC: Do you know how close I was to dropping that?

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:22.900
"Mom?"

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.280
As in parents?

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.360
Huey, Dewey, and Louie have parents?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.980
Has that ever been addressed in a cartoon ever?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.780
I just assumed they were clones

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.700
spawned in a laboratory of comedic sidekicks.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.520
We're actually gonna do this?

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.780
It's finally gonna be explained who Huey, Dewey, and Louie's parents are?!

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.380
DUCKTALES! WOO-HOO!

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.800
This reboot is everything you would want it to be.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.640
It's funny,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.620
it's creative,

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.540
it's modern,

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.300
it's retro,

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.200
it's classic,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.980
it's new,

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.600
it has great animation with charming characters.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.460
It's clearly combining old-school Disney adventures,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.380
like their comics and the Disney Afternoon with newer Disney adventures,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.000
like Star vs the Forces of Evil and Gravity Falls.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And they mix perfectly.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.600
I know it's only a first episode, but it's made me an immediate fan,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.800
going from slightly curious to incredibly intrigued.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.420
I can't wait to see where this goes.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.800
How they represent old characters and how they introduce new characters.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.220
If you want to see how to do a reboot right,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.800
go over to Disney XD's YouTube right now and watch DuckTales.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.400
Woo-friggin'-hoo.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.120
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.220

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.560
Doug, Hey guys, Doug Walker here, doing the Charity Shout-Out, and this week, we have a very special Charity Shout-Out.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.880
One of our producers, Tyger, who does MUD2MMO,

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:34.060
uh, he's doing this super-long bike ride to raise awareness of Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.060
Uh, this is a charity that he very much stands behind,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.580
he lost both his parents to pancreatic cancer,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.100
and he's doing this super-long bike ride to raise awareness of it.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.720
And, you can hear me talk about it, but why when he can tell you himself?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.580
Here's a video explaining what he's doing, why he's doing it, and why you should definitely donate.

Tyger: In the last video, I said that me and the tank were going places, and we are.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.280
I've been doing quite-- quite a few overnighters like this one, which you're watching right now,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.820
to prepare for what's gonna be... quite the epic journey.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.780
I'm gonna be taking an Amtrak out of Seattle, Washington,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.280
and I'll be embarking on a bike ride on August 24th, 2017.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.440
I'm gonna follow a route that's been blazed by the Adventure Cycling Association.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.220
And this is the current plan map I'll be taking.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.040
Um, it's several other routes linked together.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.820
And I'm gonna be visiting Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota,

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.480
before finally getting back to my home near Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.180
And at this point, you might be wondering, well, why?

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.200
I'm doing this as an awareness and fundraising effort for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.120
I've lost both of my parents to pancreatic cancer.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.360
My mom in 2002, my dad in 2016, and in both cases, the doctors and medical staff did everything that they could.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.240
But the truth is, there really isn't much
they currently CAN do.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.440
The last time I saw my dad, he-- he was really sick, and he had asked me what I'd planned on doing the bike riding stuff,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.260
'cuz he knew I was really getting into it.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.900
And I showed him pictures from my October overnighter, and I showed him this map,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.520
and I had this crazy idea riding cross-country, and he wished me luck.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.540
He wished me well, and he hoped that I could make it.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.920
And two days later, he was gone.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.740
And that's when the trip became more than just a romp across America.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.800
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive kinds.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.100
It's the only cancer that has a five-year relative survival rate in the single digits: 9%.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.720
There's currently no early detection method for pancreatic cancer,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.820
and most people only find out they have it in the late stages when it's already spread through the body.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.700
Chemotherapy and other traditional methods of treatment are just not working,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.620
so what we need are research and clinical trials.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.860
And I'm not a doctor, I'm not a researcher, but I want to do something to help fight this.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:48.500
So what I CAN do... is I can help raise money to fund much-needed research, and it might... find a cure someday.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.680
Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, they fund research, and other programs in the hope that someday,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.400
pancreatic cancer is just a bad memory and nothing more.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.440
So, do you want to support the ride?

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.940
You can do several things.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.480
Under this video, you're gonna see a fundraising page for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.780
and if you click on that, you can donate directly there.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.920
My goal is $5,000, but I would love to double that.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.600
Second, please share that link and encourage other people to donate as well.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.440
And third, I'm inviting you along for the ride.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.580
Even if it's just virtually speaking.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.260
I might be on the road solo, I can't do this one alone.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.060
I'm gonna have a satellite tracking it on my bike, so you'll be able to follow my progress on the webpage,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.740

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.420
You'll also be able to find a banner there that'll link to the PanCan fundraising site and that'll be up in late July.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.900
I'm also planning on having live video streams either on Periscope or Facebook as reception permits.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.500
I'm fully anticipating being out of cell range on several places,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.260
so I don't have a set schedule for these other than I'm going to try to broadcast between...

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.760
eh, 4 and 7 PM local time whenever I can.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.600
And if you live along the route--

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.840
And if you ever--

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.400
I'll give you a great way to contact me, and you want to join me for a couple miles on a day, that's fantastic!

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.020
It'll be great to meet some people, raise awareness, and maybe even raise some money for pancreatic cancer research.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.560
Together... I think we can start to make a difference,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.500
and I think we can all wage hope on pancreatic cancer.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.260
 

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.360
What are you still doing here? Don't you want to donate?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.640
 

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.640
This ain't leaving anytime soon.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.280
 

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.440
You want to stop cancer? Right?
