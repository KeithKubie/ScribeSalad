00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answer is 0.0333 or a 1/3 and now we're going to

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
apply the entire arsenal of inference we just learned about.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The joint probability of cancer and positive is 0.1  0.9. That's the joint that's not normalized.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So let's normalize it and we normalize it by the sum of the joint

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for cancer and the joint for non-cancer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Joint for cancer we just computed but the joint for non-cancer assumes the opposite prior 1-0.1

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and it applies the positive result of a non-cancer case.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now because the specificity first is negative, we have to do the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
same trick as before and multiply it with 1-0.8.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When you worked this out, you find this to be 0 to 0.9 divided 0 to 0.9 + 0.9  0.2 that is 0.18

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So if you put these all of this together, you get exactly a third.
