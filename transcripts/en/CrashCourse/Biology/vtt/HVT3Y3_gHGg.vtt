00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.889
Hello there.

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.240
Here at Crash Course HQ we like to start out
each day with a nice healthy dose of water

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.160
in all it's three forms.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.639
It's the only substance on all of our planet
earth that occurs naturally in solid, liquid,

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:16.610
and gas forms.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.050
And to celebrate this magical bond between
two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.660
here, today, we are going to be celebrating
the wonderful

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.230
life sustaining properties of water.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.230
But we're going to do it slightly more clothed.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.780
Much better.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.219
When we left of here at the Biology Crash
Course, we were talking about life

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.960
and the rather important fact that all life
as we know it is dependent upon there being

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.289
water around.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.940
Scientists and astronomers are always looking
out into the universe trying to figure out

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.640
whether there is life elsewhere

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.260
because that is kind of the most important
question that we have right now.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.129
They're always getting really excited when
they find water someplace

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.860
particularly liquid water.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.470
And this is one reason why I am so many other
people geeked out so hard last December when

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.470
Mars' seven-year-old rover, Opportunity, found
a 20-inch long vein of gypsum that was almost

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.060
certainly deposited by long-term liquid water
on the surface of mars.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.210
And this was probably billions of years ago,
and so it's going to be hard to tell

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.450
whether or not the water that was there resulted
in some life.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.420
But maybe we CAN figure that out and that
would be REALLY exciting!

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.329
But why?! Wy do we think that water is necessary
for life?

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.380
Why does water on other planets get us so
freaking excited?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.409
So let's start out by investigating some
of the amazing properties of water.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.369
In order to do that we're going to have to
start out with THIS

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.009
The world's most popular molecule -- or
at least the world's most memorized molecule.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.770
We all know about it. Good old H2O.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.450
Two hydrogens, one oxygen. The hydrogens each
sharing an electron with oxygen in what we

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.500
call a covalent bond.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.829
So as you can see, I've drawn my water molecule
in a particular way

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.659
and this is actually the way that it appears.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.090
It is V-shaped. Because this big old oxygen
atom is a little bit more greedy for electrons

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.260
it has a slight negative charge whereas this
area here with the hydrogen atoms has a slight

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.560
positive charge.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.920
Thanks to this polarity, all water molecules
are attracted to one another -- so much so

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.920
they actually stick together, and these are
called hydrogen bonds. We talked about them

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.810
last time.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.390
Essentially what happens is that the positive
pole around those hydrogen atoms bonds to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.390
the negative pole around the oxygen atoms
of a DIFFERENT water molecule.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.879
And so it's a weak bond.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.129
But look, they're bonding!

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.500
Seriously though, I cannot overstate the importance
of this hydrogen bond.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.890
So when your teacher asks you, "What's important
about water?"

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.310
Start out with the hydrogen bonds and you
should put it in all caps and maybe some sparkles

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.849
around it.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.410
One of the cool properties that results from
these hydrogen bonds is a high cohesion for

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.110
water, which results in high surface tension.
Cohesion is the attraction between two like

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.780
things, like attraction between one molecule
of water and another molecule of water.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.200
Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic
liquid, and you can see this if you put some

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.659
water on some wax paper or some Teflon or
something where the water beads up.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.709
Some leaves of plants do it really well. It's
quite cool.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.920
Since water adheres weakly to the wax paper
or to the plant, but strongly to itself, the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.650
water molecules are holding those droplets
together in a configuration that creates the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.080
least amount of surface area.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.120
It's this high surface tension that allows
some bugs and I think one lizard and also

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.409
one Jesus to be able to walk on water.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.599
The cohesive force of water does have its
limits of course. There are other substances

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.610
that water quite likes to stick to. Take glass
for example.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.310
This is called adhesions and the water is
spreading out instead of beading up because

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.170
the adhesive forces between the water and
the glass are stronger than the cohesive forces

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.790
of the individual water molecules in the bead
of water.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.480
Adhesion is attraction between two different
substances. In this case the water molecules

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.650
and the glass molecules.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.140
These properties lead to one of my favorite
things about water: the fact that it can defy

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.819
gravity.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.470
That really cool thing that just happened
is called capillary action, and explaining

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.870
it can be easily done with what we now know
about cohesion and adhesion.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.959
Thanks to adhesion, the water molecules are
attracted to the molecules in the straw. But

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.439
as the water molecules adhere to the straw,
other molecules are drawn in by cohesion,

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.530
following those fellow water molecules. Thank
you, cohesion! The surface tension created

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.850
here causes the water to climb up the straw.
And it will continue to climb until eventually

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.169
gravity pulling down on the weight of the
water in the straw overpowers the surface tension.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.790
The fact that water is a polar molecule also
makes it really good at dissolving things,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.580
which makes it a good solvent.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.090
Scratch that. Water isn't a GOOD solvent,
it's an AMAZING solvent!

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.479
There are more substances that can be dissolved
in water than in any other liquid on Earth.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.400
Yes, that includes the strongest acid that
we have ever created. These substances that

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.410
dissolve in water -- sugar or salt being
ones that we're familiar with -- are called

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.710
hydrophilic, and they are hydrophilic because
they are polar, and their polarity is stronger

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.270
than the cohesive forces of the water.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.060
When you get one of these polar substances
in water, it's strong enough that it breaks

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.580
all the little cohesive forces, all those
little hydrogen bonds, and instead of hydrogen

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.150
bonding to each other the water will hydrogen
bond around these polar substances.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.940
Table salt is ionic, and right now it's
being separated into ions as the poles of

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.100
our water molecules interact with it.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.100
But what happens when there is a molecule
that cannot break the cohesive forces of water?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.789
It can't penetrate, and come into it. [Seriously...?]

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.259
Basically, what happens when that substance
can't overcome the strong cohesive forces

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.840
of water? Can't get inside of the water?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.310
That's when we get what we call a hydrophobic
substance, or something that is fearful of

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.720
water. These molecules lack charged poles,
they are non-polar and are not dissolving

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.979
in water because essentially they're being
pushed out of the water

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.840
by water's cohesive forces.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.440
Water: we may call it the universal solvent,
but that does not mean that it dissolves everything.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.440
There've been a lot of eccentric scientists
throughout history, but all this talk about

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.199
water got me thinking about perhaps the most
eccentric of the eccentrics -- a man named

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.639
Henry Cavendish.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.350
He communicated with his female servants only
via notes and added a staircase to the back

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.380
of his house to avoid contact with his housekeeper.
Some believe he may have suffered from a form

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.199
of autism, but just about everyone will admit
that he was a scientific genius.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.979
He's best remembered as the first person
to recognize hydrogen gas as a distinct substance

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.550
and to determine the composition of water.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.080
In the 1700s most people thought that water
itself was an element, but Cavendish observed

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.610
that hydrogen -- which he called inflammable
air, reacted with oxygen -- known then by

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.030
the awesome name "dephlogisticated aire"
-- to form water.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.190
Cavendish didn't totally understand what
he discovered, in part because he didn't

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.850
believe in chemical compounds and explained
his experiments with hydrogen in terms of

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.569
a fire-like element called "phlogiston."

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.569
Nevertheless, his experiments were groundbreaking,
like his work in determining the specific

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.580
gravity -- basically the comparative density
-- of hydrogen and other gases with reference

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.729
to common air. It's especially impressive
when you consider the crude instruments he

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:09.360
was working with. This, for example, is what
he made his hydrogen gas with.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.440
He went on to not only establish an accurate
composition of the atmosphere, but also discovered

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.960
the density of the earth. Not bad for a guy
who was so painfully shy that the only existing

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.259
portrait of him was sketched without his knowledge.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:23.990
But for all his decades of experiments, Cavendish
only published about 20 papers. In the years

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.210
after his death, researchers figured out that
Cavendish had actually pre-discovered Richter's

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.479
Law, Ohm's Law, Coulomb's Law, several
other laws...

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.460
that's a lot of freaking laws!

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.870
And if he had gotten credit for them all we
would have had to deal with

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.229
Cavendish's 8th Law and Cavendish's 4th Law.

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.199
So I, for one, am glad that he didn't actually
get credit.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.060
We're going to do some pretty amazing science
right now. You guys are not going to believe

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.669
this.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.500
Ok, you ready?

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.729
It floats!

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:58.900
Yeah, I know you're not surprised by this,
but you should be, because everything else,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.970
when it's solid, is much more dense than when
it's liquid, just like gases are much less

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.270
dense than liquids are.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.979
But that simple characteristic of water: that
it's solid form floats, is one of the reasons

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:14.099
why life on this planet, as we know it, is
possible.

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:18.669
Why is it that solid water is less dense than
liquid water while everything else is the

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:20.039
exact opposite of that?

00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:22.300
Well, you can thank your hydrogen bonds once
again.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.069
So at around 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 degrees
Celsius if you're a scientist or from a part

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:30.080
of the world where things make sense

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.760
water molecules start to solidify and the
hydrogen bonds in those water molecules form

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.830
crystalline structures that space molecules
apart more evenly, in turn making frozen water

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.130
less dense than the liquid form.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.000
So in almost every circumstance, floating
water ice is a really good thing. If ice were

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.690
denser than water it would freeze and then
sink, and then freeze and then sink, and then

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.380
freeze and then sink.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.630
So just trust me on this one, you don't
want to live on a world where ice sinks. Not

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.410
only would it totally wreak havoc on aquatic
ecosystems, which are basically how life formed

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:05.510
on the Earth in the first place, but also
all the ice at the North Pole would sink and

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.920
all of the water everywhere else would rise
and we wouldn't have any land.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.839
That would be annoying.

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:14.149
There's one more amazing property of water
that I'm forgetting...

00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:17.860
Why is it so hot in here?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.350
Ah!

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.440
Heat capacity!

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.370
Yes, water has a very high heat capacity,and
probably that means nothing to you, but basically

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.910
it means that water is really good at holding
on to heat.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.720
Which is why we like to put hot water bottles
in our bed and cuddle with them when we're

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.790
lonely.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.320
But aside from artificially warming your bed
it's also very important that it's hard to

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.459
heat up and cool down the oceans significantly.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:48.500
They become giant heat sinks that regulate
the temperature and the climate of our planet.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:54.100
Which is why, for example, it is so much nicer
in Los Angeles, where the ocean is constantly

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.310
keeping the temperatures the same, than it
is in Nebraska.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.440
On a smaller scale we can see water's high
heat capacity really easily and visually by

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:08.240
putting a pot with no water in it on a stove
and seeing how badly that goes.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.769
But then you put a little water in it and
it takes forever to boil.

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:16.430
Oh, and if you hadn't already noticed this,
when water evaporates from your skin

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.660
it cools you down.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.240
That's the principal behind sweating, which
is an extremely effective though somewhat

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.720
embarrassing part of life.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.810
But this is example of another incredibly
cool thing about water.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.120
When my body gets hot and it sweats, that
heat excites some of the water molecules on

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.230
my skin to the point that they break those
hydrogen bonds and they evaporate away.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.540
And when they escape, they take that heat
energy with them, leaving me cooler.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.410
Lovely.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.640
This wasn't exercise though. I don't know
why I'm sweating so much. It could be the

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.529
spray bottle that I keep spraying myself with
or maybe it's just because this is such a

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:51.670
high stress enterprise: trying to teach you
people things.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:57.060
I think I need some water, but while I'm drinking,
there's a review for all of the things we

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.050
talked about today. If there are a couple
things you're not quite sure about just go

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.050
back and watch them. It's not going to take
a lot of your time. And you're going to be

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:05.760
smarter, I promise.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.850
You're going to do SO well on that test you
either don't or do have coming up.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:10.600
Ok, bye.
