JEREMY HOFFMAN: So,
I'm Jeremy Hoffman.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.080
I'm a software engineer here.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.300
I've lived and worked in
Mountain View for six years.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.350
And for most of that time,
I didn't give much thought

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.550
to the factors shaping
the Bay Area, why housing

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.340
is where it is and
not in other places

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.715
and why jobs are where they
are, and not in other places,

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:24.720
and how people get from
those jobs to work.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.420
Why do people drive instead
of walking, or biking,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.100
or taking public transit?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.860
Until, luckily
for me this June I

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.590
attended a public forum here in
Mountain View where Egon here

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.035
spoke about all the factors
that shape housing and transit

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.560
and really opened my
eyes to all this stuff.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.570
And I thought his information
and his analysis and insights

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.530
were so great that I got
really excited about sharing it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.520
with more people.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.970
So thank you so much for coming.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.260
I think this is going
to be a great talk.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.790
Egon has a lot of great
information for us.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.040
I'll give you a little bit
of a background about Egon.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.290
He graduated Phi Beta Kappa
from Swarthmore College,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.610
earned a master's degree in
city and regional planning

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.400
from UC Berkeley's College
of Environmental Design.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.770
For five years he worked
with ICF International,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.330
where he advised
cities and regions

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.380
on economic development,
everywhere from California

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.780
to Louisiana, Ohio, Nigeria,
Canada, Argentina, Bosnia.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.365
And now Egon is regional
planning director up

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:31.270
in San Francisco at
the organization SPUR.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.780
He writes reports and
he's done policy studies

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.840
about regional planning,
economic development, land use

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.710
planning, transportation,
high speed rail in California.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.950
We're really lucky to
have him here today.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.200
So please join me in welcoming
to Google Egon Terplan.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:51.930
EGON TERPLAN: Thank
you very much.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.096
Thank you very much, Jeremy.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:55.587
Thank you very much
Google for having me here.

00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:57.670
Can everyone hear me fine
in the back of the room?

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.180
Great.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.420
It's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.670
I actually haven't been at
Google in a couple of years

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.990
since I took my students.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.860
I was teaching a
San Jose State up,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.870
and we met with Kevin
Mathy and his team.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.705
And it was, I think, a time
when a bunch of the new bikes

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:09.460
were coming in.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.710
So it's great to be back.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.520
I'm glad a lot of you came out.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.360
Just as a quick starting
point, how many people here

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940
in the room live
in Mountain View,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.584
live in the town
of Mountain View?

00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:23.580
How about, how many people
here live in Palo Alto?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.870
How about anywhere else
in Santa Clara county?

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.550
So a lot of you.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.329
And how many people live north,
live in San Mateo county?

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.620
So a smaller number, all right.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.740
That's tells us a
little bit of something.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.010
Not about you, but
San Mateo county

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.701
doesn't have a tremendous
amount of new housing.

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:40.700
How about San Francisco?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.686
How many people live
in San Francisco?

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:43.895
OK, a healthy amount as well.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:44.394
Well, good.

00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:45.610
So actually, anywhere else?

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.950
East Bay, beyond?

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.290
OK, so a smaller smattering.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.720
So you represent a spectrum
of different places

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.470
within the region.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.040
We're going to try to touch
on a number of those things

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.540
here now.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.520
So I'm Egon Terplan,
as Jeremy said,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.360
the regional planning
director at SPUR.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.943
I'm going to say a
word to about SPUR,

00:03:01.943 --> 00:03:03.570
but just as a starting
point, it's fun

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.975
to be here talking
about these issues now.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.920
And as I was
reflecting upon this,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.676
has anyone here heard
of AnnaLee Saxenian?

00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:13.770
Ooh, quiet in the room.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.850
So AnnaLee Saxenian's
one of the great writers

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.830
on the history of Silicon
Valley and wrote a classic book

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.030
comparing Silicon Valley
with Boston's Route 128,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.710
and tried to understand,
why did Silicon Valley grow

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.340
the way it did?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.220
And it's very
interesting, about a bunch

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.080
of factors in how
companies are structured.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.860
But she had written
her master's thesis

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.970
in the early '80s saying,
Silicon Valley's over.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.540
It is too expensive.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.374
It is too congested.

00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:37.873
No one's going to
come here anymore,

00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:39.510
and no one's going
to start companies.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.720
And that was right
before the Apple II Plus.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.830
She was wrong, clearly.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.520
The question, though, is
at what point do the issues

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.950
with housing affordability,
underinvestment

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.310
and transportation,
some of the challenges

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.480
with the local government
policy making on land use become

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.180
really profound,
competitive factors that

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.509
affect the regional economy?

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.300
And I don't think we
know quite the answer,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.010
but we're certainly
getting to some

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.890
of the moments that
could be choking points.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.160
So what I'm going to do
today is very quickly

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.075
say a word or two about SPUR,
who we are as an organization,

00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:13.700
and then go through
a number of pieces,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.360
a little bit on the growth
context of the Bay Area.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.279
When I say the region,
I mean the Bay Area.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.800
I don't mean the South
Bay or Silicon Valley.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.000
I mean the nine-county Bay Area.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.300
Then talk about the
sort of problems

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.809
that we're confronting.

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:28.850
Some of the answers about
why the problems exist,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.270
and then some solutions.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.170
All of that in about-- I don't
know, let's see, 27 minutes?--

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.970
so that we have some chance to
hear from some other folks here

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.770
that are engaged
on local issues,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.550
as well as take your questions
for the conversation.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.470
So quickly, who is SPUR?

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.170
So SPUR is an
organization that is

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.210
based in San Francisco
and San Jose.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.460
This is our urban center in
San Francisco, been around

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.890
for 100 years.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.210
We're an urban
civic group focused

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.850
on good planning
and good government.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.050
We write policy
papers on a wide range

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.580
of issues facing
cities and regions.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.560
How many people here have
heard of SPUR before?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.530
A healthy number.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.290
Well, those of you
that haven't, now you

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.498
know a little bit about SPUR.

00:05:08.498 --> 00:05:09.820
I encourage you to come.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.590
Come to the urban center in San
Francisco on Mission Street.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.970
We have a number of
activities there.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.680
I will show you a photograph
of our San Jose office

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.670
as well, where we also have
a number of lunchtime events

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.170
and forums.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.250
That's the room where
we have discussions

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.830
in the San Francisco
office as well.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.000
We engage people in a variety
of ways through research--

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.235
we write our papers--
through education, in going

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:37.110
out and talking to
people, and engaging them,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.170
and through advocacy
as well at times.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.070
Our work-- our offices, as we
will see in just a moment--

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.320
there's the San Francisco
Urban Center on Mission Street.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.750
We have a San Jose one
located on First Street,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.040
right on the Light rail line.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.780
So when you come to downtown
San Jose, stop by there as well.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.610
And we're now moving
in a direction

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.030
of considering opening
an office in Oakland.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.805
And part of the idea is, these
are the three central cities

00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:06.730
of the Bay Area-- San Francisco,
San Jose, and Oakland.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.477
What happens in those central
cities shapes the region.

00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:11.060
It doesn't shape all
of it-- and we're

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.435
going to talk some about the
other cities in the Bay Area

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:15.280
today-- but those
three central cities

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.510
have a very big
responsibility for what

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.130
happens within the region.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.650
So let me talk about that
regional context just

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.230
for a moment.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.770
And as I said, the region
is the nine-county Bay Area.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.790
We are right now in the midst
of considering a long range

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.720
plan that was
adopted a year ago.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.140
And the long range
plan is trying

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.640
to understand, how do we
accommodate the next two

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.250
million people in population?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.000
This is the expected growth.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.020
You can see the
projections out to 2040

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.810
across each of the counties.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.620
So that's the
growth in population

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.526
that we're expecting.

00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:51.150
But we're trying to
do so in a way that

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.890
reduces per capita
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.230
That means that the new
people have to drive less.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.080
They have to have a
different behavior on average

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.270
from the people that have
been here historically.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.510
And this is part
of a state mandate

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.130
to respond to climate
change through changing

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.920
how we live, changing where
our workplaces are, houses are,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.410
and how we travel around.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.890
And so you can
see, we're supposed

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.820
to reduce it by 15% in 2035.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.960
But part of that overall
vision is considering,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.440
how do we accommodate housing
for workers at all income

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.190
levels?

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.810
Meaning, building
housing for people

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.760
who can afford the
market rate homes

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.960
as well as people that
don't have as much money

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.420
and can't afford the price
of the market rate home.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.520
And anyone who's been in
the rental market, who's

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.280
been in the housing market,
understands how expensive

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.660
that specific market rate is.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.160
That is the regional context
of the broad based thing.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.230
And the vision is to try to put
that growth closer and closer

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.570
to the existing
transit infrastructure.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.670
So first of all,
the job goals are

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.080
to get 38% of the jobs in
the three central cities.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.200
And then you can see the list
of the top 15 jurisdictions

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.760
where the growth might go.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.270
So notice Palo Alto, which is
ranked number 6 in job growth,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.220
and Mountain View as 15.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.820
This is the job
growth projections.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.770
When we turn to housing,
interestingly Palo Alto

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.930
disappears from
the top 15 cities

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.930
of where housing
growth might go.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.110
Now Mountain View is
still there as 15th,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.305
but Palo Alto is
not there as well.

00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:25.430
And that starts to tell
you something, a little bit

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.990
about the relationship between
job growth and housing,

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.530
that the places
that are assuming

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.099
a tremendous amount of job
growth perhaps, I would argue,

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:36.640
have a little bit
of a responsibility

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.350
also to try to find some
housing for the workers that

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.610
are coming there.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.600
So this data exists for cities
all across the entire region.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.710
So let's understand and
drill down a little bit.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.920
We'll take questions at
the end, so mark them down.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.970
Let's drill down a little
bit into the problems

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.860
that are associated with this.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.970
Housing costs too much.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.150
It's very expensive.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.420
OK, that's not a
particular surprise.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.620
But what you start
see here is, this

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.330
is just the San Francisco
median-priced home.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.830
You can see how we're getting
further and further away

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.770
from California and the
federal figure in terms

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.220
of housing prices.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.270
And actually, just comparing
to a city like Portland,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.580
Portland's certainly much
cheaper than the Bay Area

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.080
and much cheaper
than San Francisco.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.600
But you can see that it was much
closer back in the mid '90s.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.990
Again, the difference is
getting greater between some

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.650
of the Bay Area cities
and other places.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.539
Right now we're at
a particular moment

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.580
where properties, when
they're put on the market,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.790
are sold extremely quickly.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.570
So Oakland, San Francisco,
and San Jose right there--

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.600
and this is earlier
this year, it's

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.400
gotten even more accelerated in
the past couple of months-- not

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.320
only are the home prices growing
faster than almost anywhere

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.350
else, but they're
practically staying

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.380
on the market for
hardly any time.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.290
So the difference between
this region and other parts

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.350
of the United States
is getting greater

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.072
on this particular account.

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:07.530
Let's think a little bit about
some of the economic factors

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.000
though that are also under play.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.670
And we're doing a
lot of work right now

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.000
on this question of access
to middle wage opportunities

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.070
in the region.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.380
And what we have,
like many regions

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.340
we have growth in jobs
at the high end, growth

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.970
in jobs at the low end,
but a much smaller middle.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.360
And so one of the profound
challenges-- and we

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.780
say this because people are
surprised often that over 36%

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.930
of all workers today
earn less than $18

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.680
an hour in the Bay Area.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.320
And that figure is in
fact likely to grow,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.450
because the opportunities
to move those people

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.350
to jobs that pay $25
an hour, $28 an hour

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.059
is getting harder because
there's fewer of those jobs.

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:46.850
Were working on it.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.200
We're trying to consider it.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.290
And one of the great
ways, actually,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.350
to create some of
those middle wage jobs

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.720
has to do with infrastructure
investment, housing

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.710
construction, other
development related to that.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.690
But right now, that's
a specific problem,

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.570
and it's an economic problem.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.330
There's also an
environment broadly,

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.900
nationally where
there's an increase

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.370
in the number of renters.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.440
And that's a trend that's
happened since the housing

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.350
bubble burst.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.360
A lot of people are choosing
to rent instead of to own.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.530
On some national data,
there are renters

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.550
that are facing income declines.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.670
So that's been a concern.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.300
It's not a concern across
the board with all renters,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.800
but that's something
that people are

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.280
starting to see in some places.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.870
But the issue is, all workers
across the income spectrum

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.170
are feeling this crunch,
are paying more for housing.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.800
And that's a big,
big consideration

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.130
across lots of households.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.640
And I'm sure everybody here
who's confronted the housing

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.930
market recently has
seen that as well.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.070
The last piece of
the problem puzzle

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.460
is just the fact that
primarily most people

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.500
get to and from work by driving.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.920
And so what that means is
that the roads are congested.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.307
And congestion's a good
thing to the extent

00:11:57.307 --> 00:11:59.890
that it shows a lot of activity
and people want to get around.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.530
A place that has
no congestion might

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.300
mean there's not
a strong economy

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.830
and during the
recession there was

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.530
less congestion in this region.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.850
But when most people are
getting around driving,

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.300
that certainly has an
impact on overall mobility.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.490
And for people that don't
have access to an automobile,

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.250
that's a challenge.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.380
So let's get to
some of the answers.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.570
Why is it that
housing's so expensive?

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:29.230
First most obvious one is we're
not building enough housing.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.400
You would think it's simple.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.400
But going back to
the 1950s to 1980s,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.680
that was the big
growth of the Bay Area.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.510
That was the postwar boom.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.340
That was when this region really
became an industrial powerhouse

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.900
first during World War II, the
early rise of Silicon Valley,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.960
the postwar boom in
the East Bay with a lot

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.110
of the manufacturing, and the
conversion of San Francisco

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.440
into a corporate
headquarters and environment.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.220
Silicon Valley then, of course,
became a corporate headquarters

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.270
environment as well,
and we responded

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.350
by building lots of housing.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.850
We then also had a
lot of job growth.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.390
That all turned
around about 1980.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.770
And yes, there's been
job growth since then.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.630
The percent growth
slowed down dramatically.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.120
But one of the
factors is actually

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.810
that we didn't continue
to produce as much housing

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.046
after 1980.

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:16.420
And this little
thing called prop

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.780
13-- everyone heard
of prop 13 before?

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.230
Some of you haven't,
which is fine.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.170
It was passed in the late
'70s to essentially freeze

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.730
property taxes at
the point of sale.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.490
What it effectively did was,
for many local governments,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.150
they lost a tremendous
amount of revenue.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.750
And it changed how they thought
about new development going

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.550
forward.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.080
And a lot of them
didn't think housing

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.870
would pay as much
in taxes as jobs.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.730
And so it led a
lot of communities

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.780
to not favor housing as
much and why a lot of them

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.370
really like shopping centers.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.560
Because shopping centers
bring sales taxes.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.310
Office buildings add
property taxes to the roles,

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.736
but it's really shopping
centers, auto malls,

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:59.110
those are the things that fund
a lot of local government.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.290
So that changed in
California in the late '70s.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.480
And since then we've
really entered this period

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.180
of not producing
as much housing.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.230
And that's the world
that we're in today.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.490
So you can see it particularly
pronounced in San Francisco.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.970
And we've estimated
that 5,000 units a year

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.580
is about what San Francisco
could do, or ought to be doing.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.850
And you can see that San
Francisco has effectively

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.070
never reached that.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.540
It was sort of a
blip for the moment,

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.650
but those were authorized,
not actually constructed.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.480
It's growing again
now, but this is

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.440
something where, over
time, your housing problems

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.530
don't happen in one year.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:38.670
They're chronic when over
decades you're underproducing.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.730
This is probably one of
the most important points

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.354
though to make.

00:14:41.354 --> 00:14:43.540
I said we don't build
enough, but supply matters.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.480
And it really matters
when you compare us

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.860
to the rest of the country.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.120
There are essentially two kinds
of inexpensive housing markets

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.290
in the United States,
places with not very strong

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.780
economies-- let's say
politely-- and places

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.430
that build a lot of housing.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.789
There's no place with
a strong economy that

00:15:02.789 --> 00:15:04.080
doesn't build a lot of housing.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.954
Look at where we are.

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:08.140
San Francisco, San Jose,
Oakland, and then near us

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.080
are Honolulu and Orange County.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.920
These are outliers on
a national context.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.020
So it really is a key
factor in where we go.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.820
And what you're seeing
is how much was built.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.970
Over to the left, we
haven't built a lot.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.510
And up here is the meeting
asking price per square foot

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.680
on a comparative basis.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.580
Looking just at one
year as a snapshot,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.430
I said that's not a
best way to do it,

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.654
but just to
understand last year.

00:15:32.654 --> 00:15:34.070
The biggest place
building housing

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.790
is San Jose, then San Francisco
and interestingly enough,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.847
Dublin, Dublin in the East Bay.

00:15:39.847 --> 00:15:41.930
If you go out there, there's
a Bart Station there.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.890
You see a whole number
of five story apartment

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.550
buildings going up.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.020
Now, they can't on their own
solve the regional housing

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.990
challenge because they're
in a housing market

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.790
where people are
picking and choosing.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.200
But when one city
does it and you

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.544
don't see other cities
of that scale doing it,

00:15:57.544 --> 00:15:59.460
that's what adds up to
the regional challenge.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.370
And you can see
Mountain View produced

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.810
37 housing units in 2013
and Palo Alto less than 100.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.820
Very small numbers.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.170
Now, some of this is a blip
because a particular project

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.750
might come forward when
the calendar year changes.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.910
But the idea is that the bulk
of the housing production's

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.770
not happening in
cities that have

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.600
had a significant
amount of job growth.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.060
There's also a challenge when we
look at the low income housing,

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.730
or the housing where people that
can't afford the market price.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.920
Very little of that
has been built.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.130
And those of you that might
follow the redevelopment

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.880
system, we eliminated
redevelopment in California.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.512
That was a major source of
funding for housing for people

00:16:37.512 --> 00:16:39.220
that couldn't afford
market rate housing.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.360
It's gone.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.895
So that side of it has
also been exacerbated

00:16:42.895 --> 00:16:45.960
in the last couple of years.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.660
So part two, why is
housing so expensive

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.280
when we make it
difficult to add housing?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.120
How do we make it
difficult to add housing?

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.410
Well, let's go
back in time again

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.430
a little bit to
that postwar era.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.980
We're coming out, and
there was this thing

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.050
called urban renewal that
happened in a number of cities

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.990
in a lot of neighborhoods
throughout San Francisco

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.280
and throughout Oakland.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.609
Parts of downtown San Jose
were torn out, were destroyed.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:16.140
So housing units were lost.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.950
It happened in whole
numbers of neighborhoods

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.520
throughout the city, but it also
happened in the downtown core.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.980
Anyone recognize this?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.540
It's now the Yerba Buena
Center by the Moscone Center

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.370
right there in downtown
on Mission Street.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.580
The church is there.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.400
So this was the building
of it, but this had been,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.790
formerly, housing.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.710
All gone.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.819
So there's a whole
history on urban renewal.

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:41.110
We don't need to get into that.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.880
I'm making a simple point that
a tremendous number of housing

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.920
units were lost during
that period of time.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.520
What that also led to,
in part was a backlash

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.110
to growth and development.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.370
And this was particularly
stark in San Francisco,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.860
where there were attempts to try
to cap the heights of buildings

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.520
in the city to four
or five stories.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.370
And in fact after
the early '70s,

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.100
residential heights
in San Francisco

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.890
were almost universally
capped at 40 feet, which

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.990
is four stories, with a few
exceptions-- one of them being

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.730
downtown-- and that had
to do with the building

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.190
at the foot of Van Ness
called the Fontana Towers.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.250
And if you ever see
it, these sort of two

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.500
partially curved modernist
towers facing right

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.180
by Ghirardelli Square,
right by the waterfront.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.200
So this backlash to growth
is still with us today,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.690
and it was a response
to a number of changes.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.620
But just from a
political perspective,

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.910
there was a ballot
measure in San Francisco

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.790
to protect the waterfront
was the name of it.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.970
It led to the fact
that now anything

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.710
that needs to be built
on the waterfront

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.470
has to go through
a ballot measure.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.470
So that's now a new law
in San Francisco that

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.010
is going to have a direct effect
on the number of housing units

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.570
that could be built on various
portions of the waterfront,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.760
around the Giants' stadium.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.130
But this isn't just a
San Francisco issue.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.010
This backlash to
growth is something

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.970
that happens in a
number of places.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.260
And Palo Alto voters
in 2013 passed

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.170
something called Measure
D where they rejected

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.190
a specific project, an
affordable senior housing

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.040
project in Palo Alto.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.770
So that one specific event
didn't transform the housing

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.180
market, but these
kinds of decisions

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.100
are happening all the time.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.880
Whether they're
at the ballot box,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.590
or they're at the
planning commission,

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.590
or they're at a City
Council hearing,

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.650
those decisions are the
ones in the aggregate that

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.740
make it very difficult
to add housing.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.760
And each community seems to have
a different reason for doing

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.844
it, but they all come somehow
in the direction of saying, no.

00:19:41.844 --> 00:19:44.010
Some places will say, well,
we like our neighborhood

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:44.370
character.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.453
That's going to change our
neighborhood character.

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:47.640
We don't want that.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.320
Other places say, well, we don't
want to see the traffic go up.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.680
It's going to make
the streets too full.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.500
They won't be safe.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.800
Others say, well, it's going
to impact city services.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.660
Where's the water
going to come from?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.080
We have to come up
with new sewer systems.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.920
And there's a point.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.470
It's not that-- these aren't
entirely without validity.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.050
It's just that the aggregate
of all of these terms--

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.420
concerns about
gentrification, concerns

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.020
about a definition of urban to
suburban, which was something

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.890
in Marin County
that had them think

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.510
they had to approve things
of a certain density.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.420
The aggregate of
all these changes

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.320
leads to saying no to growth.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.720
And then we get to the
regulatory process.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.760
There are a lot of smart people
in the room who can probably

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.250
do fantastic things.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.070
I would challenge you
to be able to build

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.850
a building through
the planning process,

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.590
because it's not
just actually-- if it

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.640
were this easy to
follow the little path

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.320
and go through it, that
would be one thing.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.710
But then mixed on top
of this, of course,

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.672
is the political process
and the series of issues

00:20:47.672 --> 00:20:48.880
that you have to get through.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.190
So it's complicated
and it's expensive.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.590
We did a little back of
the envelope calculation

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.810
of what it would cost
to build new units.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.680
And this was just
the starting point

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.890
for an 80-square foot
unit in San Francisco.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.810
You start with the
cost of land, $120,000,

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.822
construction cost $240,000.

00:21:07.822 --> 00:21:11.530
$300 a square foot's
probably conservative.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.770
There's a subsidy for the
below market rate units

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.330
if you're doing
a certain number.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.360
And then the other pieces,
the permits and fees,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.080
selling expenses.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.740
And that's not taking into
account risk, that's not

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.530
taking into account
the bank issues,

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.930
a whole variety of things.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.150
It's expensive to build housing.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.120
There's also then the
issue of part three

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.910
about jobs and housing.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.040
And this is one that's a
little bit complicated.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.800
Communities prefer
jobs to housing.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.050
But to the extent that
they're supportive of jobs--

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.050
many places are--
they're often not

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.770
as supportive of
jobs in the core

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.490
of their cities around transit.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.500
So if you look at just
some of the numbers here,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.010
jurisdictions like jobs,
housing not so much.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:58.214
Santa Clara county, 926,000
jobs, 631,000 housing units.

00:21:58.214 --> 00:22:00.380
And it's flipped in some
of the East Bay communities

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.300
that are more housing rich.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.270
If you look out to Contra Costa
county, it's different there.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.800
So part of this I mentioned
before, after Prop 13,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.890
the perception is that
jobs bring in more in taxes

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.746
and workers consume
less in city services.

00:22:15.746 --> 00:22:17.620
Those of you that don't
live in Mountain View

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.970
aren't consuming much in
Mountain View services--

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.220
fire, police, library
services, parks.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.160
You're here most of the
time during the day,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.870
and the same is true across job
centers throughout the region.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.340
The other issue is that tax
receipts are inequitably

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.200
distributed.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.190
Just look over here at
Palo Alto, San Jose,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.700
and Santa Clara.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.900
Palo Alto and Santa
Clara are job rich.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.080
They have high tax
receipts per capita.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.210
San Jose is housing
rich, and they

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.140
have low tax
receipts per capita.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.430
And this affects the
politics of those places,

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.030
because San Jose is really
trying to figure out

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.170
how to bring in jobs
so they can become

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.200
more in balance themselves.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.847
And this is ultimately the
point of all of these things

00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:02.930
I'm trying to raise is
that we're in this together

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:03.850
as a region.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.970
This is not Palo Alto's
issue or San Jose's issue.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.890
It's the Bay Area's issue.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.570
But individual
cities are the ones

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.140
that are making the
calls about what

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.470
happens at their communities.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.140
So this is the new
SurveyMonkey building

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.380
across the street from
the Palo Alto Caltrain

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.240
station in downtown.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.950
It's a lovely building.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.350
It's only four stories.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.050
Now, it's a nice building.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.030
I'm posing this
somewhat rhetorically.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.150
I have an opinion,
leave it to you.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.920
Is four stories
sufficient density

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.860
directly around transit?

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.290
And I heard from Adina
that they actually

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.230
were required to add
significantly more parking

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.030
then they wanted to.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.519
But only 30% of the people
arrive there by car.

00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:47.310
So they have all these
extra parking spaces

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.520
that they were forced
to build which drives up

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.990
the cost of the building.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.610
So you can get people,
when their jobs are

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.580
right next to transit a lot of
them are going to take transit.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.200
But the communities are limiting
the amount of job space.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.980
And this is the most
expensive real estate

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.730
market in the region
is downtown Palo Alto.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.880
But that limit on zoning is also
here in downtown Mountain View.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.920
And it's at almost every single
one of the Caltrain stops up

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.240
and down the peninsula and
throughout the South Bay.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.340
You can't come in and
plop a million square foot

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.410
office building right
in the downtown,

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.999
even though those
communities want jobs.

00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:24.540
And then this fall, Menlo Park's
going to have another ballot

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.300
measure about limiting
growth, almost exclusively

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.620
limiting office growth
in their downtown core.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.615
It's going to affect
retail as well.

00:24:31.615 --> 00:24:34.320
It doesn't directly
affect housing so much,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.320
but part of the issue
is these communities

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.180
are trying to put a
stop on lots of things

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.100
that they don't want to become--
which, for Menlo Park's case,

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.540
I guess is Sunnyvale.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.370
That's the thing.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.310
So part of this is that it's
not that much of a surprise

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.490
that a lot of the major firms,
like where we're sitting now,

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.170
aren't located directly
around transit.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.420
That the communities
that these companies

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.900
are in that provide jobs and
that have these contributions

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.010
to the region simply
wouldn't permit this amount

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.180
of commercial square footage
in their downtown core,

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.120
although there are
some regional benefits

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.300
of being directly
around transit.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.110
And that's a
fundamental challenge

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.436
that we face right there.

00:25:14.436 --> 00:25:15.810
The other side
though is when you

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.210
talk to people about
transit-oriented development.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.500
Who here has heart that term,
transit-oriented development?

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.260
Do you think of housing
with maybe a coffee shop

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.181
underneath when
you hear that term?

00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:28.180
That's sort of what
transit-oriented development

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:28.800
has become.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.410
That's great.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.640
That's a wonderful idea.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.560
We should have a lot more
of that in our region.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.060
But transit-oriented
development could also

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.720
be office space in a
core next to a rail stop.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.260
That's also an
equally valid idea

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.140
for transit-oriented
development.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.780
And when we look at
the data on this,

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.990
it shows that people are
more likely to take transit

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.180
if their job is right
next to that transit.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.170
Now, if their housing and
their job is next to transit,

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.390
they're even more likely.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.460
But job alone is more
important than just housing.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.970
And what this means is that what
happens right around rail stops

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.800
in particular is extremely
important from a job

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.645
perspective, from a
regional perspective.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.754
And this has not
changed over time.

00:26:14.754 --> 00:26:16.670
This has really been
that way for a long time.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.300
So throughout the
Bay Area, most jobs

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.790
are located near
freeway off-ramps

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.630
and only a quarter of jobs
are around regional rail.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.540
And so some of that are a
series of historical factors

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.040
with highways and other things.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.650
But some of those are those
local zoning decisions.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.180
And where it's light
or orange is in fact

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.860
where there's available
space to build.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.960
There's not a lot of density
around those particular rail

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.080
stops.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.970
We also know from
an income analysis

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.440
that people are traveling
more to get to better jobs.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.040
So better regional mobility is,
in fact, a way to going back

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.370
to the question of how
do we connect lower wage

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.809
workers to good jobs,
better regional mobility

00:26:55.809 --> 00:26:56.600
gets them that way.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.710
And this is a trend
across the whole region.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.090
But the problem is that we
have this transit system

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.230
throughout the Bay Area
that's not quite a system.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.650
It's 27 basically
independent operators.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.500
And this is probably a
nice way of how it looks.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.907
This looks like they all
reasonably connect together.

00:27:14.907 --> 00:27:16.740
We've been trying to
show this in a way that

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.090
really makes the problem worse.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.760
And it looks relatively even.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.500
But the problem
with that evenness

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.180
is that we don't live
just in one county.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.810
Think of San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.910
They bleed together.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.270
We're part of one
urbanized corridor.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.380
Now, people may not like
the word "urbanized."

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.120
Let's just call it
one corridor where

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.260
people are traveling
back and forth.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.210
But we don't have a
transit system that

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.240
allows people to support
that, so it becomes

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.180
a big regional challenge if
you're trying to get from, say,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:51.570
Walnut Creek to here, or lots
of trips within the Bay Area.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.550
So we know most people
drive alone to work.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.920
And in fact, you guys are on
here in this particular chart.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.560
The drive alone
rate to this campus

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.590
is almost comparable to
downtown San Francisco.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.540
So location is not
an entirely-- you

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.240
can, through a lot of the
programs Google has offered,

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.740
get to a drive alone rate
which is similar to the most

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.340
transit-oriented environments.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.010
It requires the shuttle programs
and the transportation demand

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.484
management that you guys have
done here, which are fabulous.

00:28:21.484 --> 00:28:22.900
But most of the
rest of the region

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.230
doesn't have that, doesn't
have those types of amenities.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.910
So on a regional scale, most
people are driving to work.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.367
And so we have this.

00:28:31.367 --> 00:28:32.950
We have people driving
long distances,

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.350
we have growing congestion,
lots of in-commuting.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.800
The other side that it's getting
worse with a capacity issue

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.270
is on transit.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.660
And Caltrain-- anyone here that
rides Caltrain has seen it,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.000
it's growing and growing.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.579
And that's fabulous, but we
need to invest in it in order

00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:50.370
to make sure it's going
to be around there.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.500
And investment is
a bunch of factors.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.041
And if you have questions,
Adina can answer those really

00:28:55.041 --> 00:28:55.540
at the end.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.210
But it's around
electrification, and new cars,

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.920
and train control systems
that make it work.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.630
And BART has the same issue.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.620
So the regional rail
systems in the Bay Area

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.472
are very competitive
with the automobile.

00:29:07.472 --> 00:29:10.720
I'll mention shuttles briefly,
just say what about shuttles.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.770
Shuttles are not the
problem, they're the symptom.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.515
It's really about
local land use,

00:29:15.515 --> 00:29:18.550
as I've been trying to say, that
the local land use decisions

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.040
that limit housing
near where people work,

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.580
limit jobs in the
dense cores of places,

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.790
the shuttles become a very
effective solution to that.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.250
Yes, it's about employee
recruitment and retention,

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.510
and it's great in that regard.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.060
But from a land use
perspective, that's

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.580
at least how I see
this particular issue.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.850
So that last mile problem
is what we have so much of.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.400
Those red splotches are office
buildings near rail transit

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.210
and the blue ones are those
that are more than a half mile.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.240
And that's the geography
of this region.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.470
And it's not going to
fundamentally change.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.690
What's going to change is the
density of those office spaces,

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.090
the extent to which housing is
allowed in those office spaces,

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.380
and the extent to
which those rail places

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.390
become more of job centers
and have more housing around.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.430
Those are the factors
that we can really

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.900
think about changing.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.760
So let's quickly get to
a couple of solutions

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.710
so we can be optimistic and
then take your questions.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.760
One of them is
around the provision

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.400
of affordable housing.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.360
This is not something where just
building housing of any kind

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.910
is going to entirely solve it.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.800
Lots of people will
not be able to afford

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.920
market price
housing at any rate.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.500
So we need to do
that, and there's

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.180
a challenge in this
region because, as I said,

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.380
redevelopment's gone and the
sources of that have gone away.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:37.420
And it's very expensive to
build affordable housing.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.772
So you can see the cost
of 1,000 homes, 10,000,

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:42.790
and 100,000 homes.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.940
So we have to come up with
new sources that broaden this

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.060
so it's not just new
development that's

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.900
paying for affordable housing.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.890
So that's one piece of
the particular puzzle.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.670
We're also thinking about
renters and existing tenants.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.240
And there are some places that
have good tenant protections

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.000
and others don't.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.960
And that's an important
piece of the puzzle as well.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.710
The next piece his
neighborhood planning.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.500
So thinking about where
growth can take place,

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.170
doing a neighborhood
planning process

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.080
so places are allowed to grow.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.160
And part of that relates to
reforming how we build housing

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.000
and how we permit
it, but the places

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.750
that have gone through
good planning processes

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.560
are able to grow.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.760
These are some of the big
areas in San Francisco.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.680
And that mark at Octavia, that
green one, those 6,000 units,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.820
a lot of those are
happening right now.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.830
This is the job growth.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.600
But I wanted to get to some
photographs of what we're

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.970
seeing the growth happen in San
Francisco along Market Street.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.220
That is the product of
neighborhood planning.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.440
So as each building
comes forward,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.690
people aren't protesting
it because the agreements

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.020
were made long before.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.160
It's difficult, it's
expensive, but ultimately it

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.310
leads to the creation of lots
of development and buildings

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.230
like this which
have zero parking.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.720
And this is actually an
affordable housing project

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.240
developed by David Baker.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.040
So beautiful things
that are contributing

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.030
to the overall community there.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.240
The third piece then relates
to allowing more growth

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.780
in some of the existing
communities that we have.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.370
This thing called
secondary units

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.290
so people can have
a backyard unit

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:12.990
that they add to their home.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.220
You could add a third to
the San Francisco housing

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.070
count by doing it.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.880
And this is the zoning map
for the City of Mountain View.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.140
And if you can see this
light yellowish color here,

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.230
that's single
family residential.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.230
That means nothing
but one single home.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.180
So you can't have
a secondary unit.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.020
So individual
communities-- if we

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.920
looked at the communities that
are around here or Palo Alto,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.310
you name it-- San
Francisco, too.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.050
Almost the entire western
half of San Francisco

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.280
has limitations like this.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.070
It means you can't add
apartment buildings,

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.420
you can't add secondary units.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.264
That is limiting the total
availability of housing.

00:32:53.264 --> 00:32:54.680
So I bet a lot of
you are actually

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.090
renting homes, single family
homes, in some of these places

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:59.670
and sharing them with roommates.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.440
That becomes a
solution when you don't

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.730
have that flexibility
in the zoning code.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.690
It goes back to the
powers that we've

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.420
given to cities to
police themselves.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.712
The next solution is to
upzone around transit.

00:33:12.712 --> 00:33:13.420
I mentioned this.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.200
We can allow people
to build more

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.440
on top of the existing
transit stations.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.920
There are places like North
Berkeley where nothing

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.800
has been built
since BART went in.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.750
BART comes in, it's
underground, and you've

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.240
got this lovely Bart station.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.900
Great regional accessibility and
zero new housing in 40 years.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.590
And this might be this
way for another 25 years,

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.170
because there's nothing to
compel Berkeley as a city

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:38.710
and the residents
of that community

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.430
to allow housing on
those parking lots.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.065
And think about how
many parking lots

00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:45.200
are around a lot of
transit stations.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.780
Think about all of
those as opportunities

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.730
where people could
have existing homes.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.180
Then there's the job question
around regional transit.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.926
In downtown San Francisco
in the trans Bay zoning

00:33:55.926 --> 00:33:57.800
is a place where there's
a significant amount

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.790
of dense employment
that's going in around

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.170
what hopes to be the northern
terminus of high speed

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.920
rail and Caltrain.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.810
Some of those towers
are residential as well,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:12.469
but those kinds of spots are
important for development.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.040
Then there's new
locations, places

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.150
where we haven't had
housing historically.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:17.960
We can add.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.060
Let me get to a
clearer version of that

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.949
which is Treasure Island.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:23.880
This is a place that's
planned for thousands

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.320
of units of housing.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.860
Yes, there is sea level rise.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.440
We're aware of that.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.850
This is going to be
planned hopefully

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.610
with enough of a
buffer around that.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.429
But that's a Bay
Area issue as well.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.250
Sea level rise is not
unique to Treasure Island.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.929
It's not going to be unique to
the Hunter's Point shipyards.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.850
But again, these
are places where

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.760
there's a significant
amount of growth that can,

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.207
and we're moving forward
with developing them.

00:34:49.207 --> 00:34:51.290
Then there's the question
of the corporate campus.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.560
So we're in certainly
a corporate campus.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.219
And there's been a lot of
thinking here about the vision.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.340
This is the proposed
Samsung campus

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.130
that's currently
under construction

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.730
on San Jose on
North First Street.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.180
But the traditional model
of the building surrounded

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.320
by parking lots, in some ways,
we've moved away from that.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.240
And so what we want to
see are environments

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.090
that could be transformative.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.651
I don't know if anyone
happened to catch these.

00:35:16.651 --> 00:35:18.150
Someone went through
and said, well,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.400
what if we added all
the housing that's

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.160
being demanded by the jobs
that are growing at some

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.530
of these campuses and put
them at the parking lots

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:26.450
around them?

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.990
That's what it would look like.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.550
So that's iTown.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.800
Think Cupertino
would go for that?

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.030
And then how about this one?

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.230
You think Googlers would go
for this one around Google?

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.770
Now those are
residential towers.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.130
This is a thought experiment.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.730
This is not proposed
zoning or planning ideas.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.380
It's simply saying that there's
a significant amount of demand

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:46.880
for housing.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.430
It's going to go somewhere.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.860
And that somewhere
doesn't have to be

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.620
five feet away,
though ideally it

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.310
could be for some number
of the population.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.890
But it should be in a
place that's accessible,

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:02.060
and it should be in a place
that people can get to easily.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.790
The suburban retrofit piece
is also a part of that.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.850
And that's a version of that.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:10.110
And there's other developments
that are being proposed.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.670
This is another one on North
First Street that's again

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.420
trying to remake the
traditional corporate campus,

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.100
to bring it closer
to the street,

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.190
to make it more
walkable, to make it

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.140
like it's part of
a neighborhood--

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.400
not just something you
drive to, you park your car,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.860
and you can't get around.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.350
I think this environment here
is much lovelier than most

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.039
of the office parks
throughout the valley.

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:31.580
There's bicycles,
you can get around.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.579
A lot of the other
environments don't have that.

00:36:33.579 --> 00:36:35.180
They're more of an isolated pod.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.460
And so this is just a vision
of a direction it could go.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.450
And there is not yet
a tenant for this.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.610
And they're searching for
one, but they at least

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.652
have a concept in place.

00:36:45.652 --> 00:36:47.610
So just a couple more
quick points, and then we

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.450
want to open it up.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.440
Regionalism is key.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.570
We don't do this alone.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.900
We are not in isolation
from each other.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.420
We've saved the open
space in the Bay Area

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.600
as a great product
of regionalism.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.650
Golden Gate National
Recreation Area,

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.340
these are things
that are actions

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.160
of regional responsibility.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.780
So too will sea level
rise be the kind of issue

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.110
that we're going to have
to work on as a region.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.320
It touches every community,
and these questions

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.460
of housing and transportation
as well are part of that.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.240
San Mateo county
is trying to work

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.450
across multiple
jurisdictions to figure out

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:23.950
how much housing to grow.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.500
It doesn't mean they're any
more supportive of housing,

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.130
but at least they
have a process where

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.970
those cities talk to each other.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.240
And Santa Clara county is going
to copy a version of that,

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.530
and we'll see the
direction that goes.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.160
Those are promising steps,
and one of the levers

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.380
we have as a region
is to say, we

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.050
won't invest as
much transportation

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:44.700
money in a place
that's not going

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.640
to grow in concert with
the regional goals.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.920
So lastly, the very
last point on this

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.940
then is about transportation.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.750
We don't have this integrated
regional transit system.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.440
That's something we certainly
should strive towards.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.830
That is what our
competitor regions have.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.840
The places at this region the
Bay Area is competing with

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.650
have that.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.240
They also have more housing.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.182
So those are some of
the factors that we

00:38:08.182 --> 00:38:09.390
want to make sure we work on.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.560
So just quickly in summary,
this has taken a long time

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.130
to create.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.290
You would say that this
is a chronic problem.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.140
This is not a temporary problem.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.460
It's not going to be immediate,
but there's a lot of-- it's

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.100
important to think
regionally in this,

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.290
but the solutions in many
of this take place locally.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.946
So with that I think we're
going to hear from some folks

00:38:28.946 --> 00:38:30.320
here on some of
the local issues.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.340
And then I look forward
to your questions.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.549
Thank you very much.

00:38:33.549 --> 00:38:36.543
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:43.088 --> 00:38:44.296
JEREMY HOFFMAN: Thanks, Egon.

00:38:44.296 --> 00:38:47.360
So I just want to
talk briefly about how

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.850
local issues play into this.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.740
These sorts of
decisions, these are

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.390
playing out right now
in your city councils,

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.990
in your city halls, in
your local elections.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.820
I've gotten involved this year.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.605
There was a group I got
involved with called Campaign

00:39:03.605 --> 00:39:06.900
for a Balanced Mountain View
that really has been drawing

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.120
light on the jobs housing
balance in Mountain View.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.000
And it's been really
heartening for me

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.080
to see how the City Council
members, they're our neighbors.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.300
They do care about the
opinions of the residents.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.170
And it's actually very
possible and plausible

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:25.724
to influence them and let them
know what our concerns are

00:39:25.724 --> 00:39:27.140
and what our
priorities should be.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.330
And also, I'd like to
introduce Eric Rosenblum.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.034
He's on the planning
commission in Palo Alto.

00:39:32.034 --> 00:39:33.450
Would you like to
say a few words?

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.116
ERIC ROSENBLUM: Yeah,
just very quickly.

00:39:35.116 --> 00:39:36.420
First, again thank you Egon.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.050
And great to see a good turnout.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.500
So I'm Eric Rosenblum.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.400
I was a Googler until
about two years ago.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.510
And I was always
interested in these issues,

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.605
but never knew how
to get involved

00:39:47.605 --> 00:39:49.480
and didn't even know if
I could get involved.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.940
It turns out, it's
not that hard.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.554
The people that
oppose all growth

00:39:54.554 --> 00:39:55.970
are not necessarily
that numerous,

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.512
but they're extremely
well-organized.

00:39:57.512 --> 00:39:59.803
And it turns out that if you
bring a slightly different

00:39:59.803 --> 00:40:02.190
mindset, I went from being
completely uninformed to being

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:05.280
a planning commissioner for
the city of Palo Alto, helped

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.110
to form a group called
paloaltoforward.com.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.430
So if you'd like
to educate yourself

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:14.120
more about some local issues
and how to get involved,

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.220
I encourage you to go
and read up a little bit.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.335
And feel free to contact me,
Jeremy can find me easily.

00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:21.710
JEREMY HOFFMAN:
And I'd also like

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.690
to thank Adina Levin who is
with the Friends of Caltrain

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.850
organization that helped
organize Egon's talk

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:30.330
that introduced me to him.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.150
Do you want to say a few words?

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.900
ADINA LEVIN: Sure.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.310
And there are some really
important regional decisions

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:39.320
being made about how to
modernize Caltrain and then how

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.540
to fund it.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.760
Greencaltrain.com
is the website,

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.470
and this is one of these
regional efforts where

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.920
citizen participation
will be helpful.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.180
And don't underestimate
at all the power

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.480
of citizen participation.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.760
The things that Jeremy and
Eric have been doing even

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.600
in the last few months
have been changing

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.320
what's going on in our cities.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.734
So you have more power
here than you know.

00:41:04.734 --> 00:41:06.400
JEREMY HOFFMAN: So I
encourage everyone,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400
read your local papers.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.441
These issues are covered.

00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:10.640
The debates, get
involved, learn more.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.195
And now, we'd like to
open up the floor for Q&amp;A.

00:41:13.195 --> 00:41:13.820
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.280
So I noticed you have the
projections going forward

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.680
something like 25 or 30
years for not just jobs

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.930
but also housing.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.369
How do you take
legislation into account

00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:24.160
when you project how
many housing units are

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.674
going to be built
in a given city?

00:41:25.674 --> 00:41:27.340
EGON TERPLAN: So the
housing projections

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.920
are-- there are two factors.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.450
One of them is looking
at how much California's

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.970
going to grow as
a state, and then

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.417
apportioning that to the region.

00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:37.500
And then within the region,
it's a little bit more

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.580
of a political process down
on the jurisdictional level.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.650
So in terms of legislation, it's
thinking about factors like,

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.580
where is there zone
capacity within cities?

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.760
What cities have done
planning for this?

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.890
But it is not thinking
about, is there

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.170
going to be some legislative
change in 15 years?

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.484
Is there a piece of legislation
you're thinking about?

00:41:57.484 --> 00:41:58.900
AUDIENCE: No, I
was just wondering

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.310
EGON TERPLAN: But so it's a
political process in part.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.190
And so you may hear about
RHNA, if you get involved,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.140
the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.430
But it becomes a question
of Palo Alto saying, well,

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.900
we don't want to add
1,000 units, 2,000,

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.120
whatever the number is
for their particular city,

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.760
because then they
have to find locations

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.750
where they would plan for it.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.230
And they can be
sued if they don't

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.922
identify locations for it.

00:42:20.922 --> 00:42:22.880
But they can't be sued
if they don't approve it

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.546
in the same way.

00:42:23.546 --> 00:42:25.880
So the teeth aren't
quite so strong.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.190
I think Adina has a
comment on this too.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.030
ADINA LEVIN: The type
of legislation in a city

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:34.250
is called a general plan
or a comprehensive plan.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.690
And the type of
planning for an area

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.100
is called a precise
plan or a specific plan.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.410
And that's where the city makes
the law for how much housing

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.942
and offices are
allowed to be built.

00:42:45.942 --> 00:42:46.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.980
I'm curious, do you think
that development that's

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.810
going to encourage people to
live closer to their employers

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.310
is an important part of
solving these problems,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.220
or if orienting
things towards transit

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.427
makes that less important?

00:42:58.427 --> 00:43:00.010
EGON TERPLAN: That's
a great question.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.140
So I think both are essential.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.371
But just for example,
let's say there

00:43:06.371 --> 00:43:07.870
was going to be a
significant amount

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.560
of residential development
in the North Bayshore Area

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.250
here in Mountain
View around Google.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:15.360
Well, some number of the people
living in those apartment units

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.660
would probably work here
or would work close by.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.430
They would make that choice,
so it's incredibly important.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.710
It is not the entirety
of the solution.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.320
We also have to invest
in regional transit,

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.440
because people are
moving around the region.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.610
This is a region that
has a lot of mobility,

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.630
and people change jobs.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.380
So both factors are important,
but you can very clearly

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.604
demonstrate that housing
close to people's jobs

00:43:38.604 --> 00:43:40.020
will reduce the
amount they drive.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:45.100
AUDIENCE: So it seems
like a lot of these issues

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.410
are coming that are
governmental in nature,

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:51.120
whether it's permits,
or measures, or zoning.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.560
Now that this is becoming
a more hot button issue,

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.620
have you seen changes happening
at the ballots what people are

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.290
voting for?

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.744
Or is it still sort of
too new, and this November

00:43:59.744 --> 00:44:01.160
is what we should
keep our eye on,

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.817
and what's happening at
the local government level?

00:44:03.817 --> 00:44:05.400
EGON TERPLAN: That's
a great question.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.140
Well, this has been
going on for a long time.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:13.030
So some of the votes to restrict
these things go back decades.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.590
San Francisco, for example,
a place that I was arguing

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:18.190
is a great place to add
jobs, it restricts the amount

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.870
of office space on an
annual basis going back

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:23.382
to the voters in the 1980s.

00:44:23.382 --> 00:44:25.840
You can't build more than a
couple office buildings a year.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.100
So I think that it is one where
there's growing interest in it.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.850
And some of the examples of
these folks getting involved

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:32.590
is a good sign.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.240
It looks like, Adina, do
you want to make a comment?

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.204
AUDIENCE: Are there
any relevant elections

00:44:36.204 --> 00:44:39.650
coming up in Mountain
View and Palo Alto?

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.010
JEREMY HOFFMAN: There are
relevant elections coming up.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.760
So the way Mountain
View City Council works

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.100
is there are seven seats elected
at large across Mountain View.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.760
In alternate every two years,
either four or three candidates

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.506
are elected for four year terms.

00:44:54.506 --> 00:44:55.880
So three new
candidates are going

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.090
to be elected this November.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:00.360
Google here-- there are
a lot of candidate forums

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.010
in Mountain View and before
November 4 election day.

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:07.094
And you should all register
to vote in your town.

00:45:07.094 --> 00:45:08.760
One of the candidate
forums will be here

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.270
at Google on October 15.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.310
It'll be over at
Charlie's at 4:00 PM.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.940
So if you want to hear the
nine candidates running

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.650
for three seats and their take
on the problems facing Mountain

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.358
View, you should
definitely come to that.

00:45:21.358 --> 00:45:22.551
Again, that's October 15.

00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:25.050
ERIC ROSENBLUM: Jeremy, I wanted
to add just quickly also, I

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.350
thought it was a great
question about what

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:28.600
has happened locally.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.280
I'll give two examples.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.450
One's very positive,
and one I would say

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.860
is negative in the
context of this talk.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.900
A small group started talking
to Palo Alto about what's

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.050
called TDM, so Transportation
Demand Management.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.510
So that's what you all
enjoy here at Google.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.968
The shuttles that
take you to work,

00:45:42.968 --> 00:45:45.900
the good work that Kevin
Mathy's team does for all of you

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.946
but most towns don't have.

00:45:47.946 --> 00:45:50.570
And actually, just a small group
of people coming into the City

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.020
Council got Palo Alto
to start adopting

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.750
this measure for
all of downtown.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.260
So they've just
begun that process.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.470
Hugely impactful, didn't
take that much work.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.350
On the flip side, this
election in Palo Alto

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:04.870
is likely to result in
a slate of candidates

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.000
that their platform
is no growth.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.287
There's been a major backlash.

00:46:10.287 --> 00:46:12.120
And so it's an important
election coming up.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.441
This is apparently
fairly unprecedented.

00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:16.940
But however you feel about the
issue, one side or the other,

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.330
there are some major
changes happening

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.472
on both sides of the issue.

00:46:19.472 --> 00:46:20.930
AUDIENCE: For the
housing problems,

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.000
one of the solutions
you mentioned

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.940
is more low income housing
and more rent control.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.750
I was under the
impression that one

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.520
of the causes of
the housing crisis

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:35.510
is the rent control laws
that make a tenant not

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:40.550
want to move even though their
job is not in San Francisco,

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:45.932
but they have a well below
market rate apartment.

00:46:45.932 --> 00:46:51.020
And the homeowners want to
get out of the rental market,

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.742
and fewer and fewer
properties are on the market.

00:46:53.742 --> 00:46:55.200
And some of them
are even converted

00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.060
to non-residential
space, because it's hard

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.520
being a homeowner of
a rental property.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.520
Can you comment on that?

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.353
EGON TERPLAN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:47:05.353 --> 00:47:08.760
So in part, this is an
incredibly complex situation.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.980
And there's people at
many different income

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:11.970
levels in our region.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:13.720
And I think what I'm
trying to acknowledge

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.370
is you can't just come up
with an answer that solves it

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:18.830
for the people who could afford
the market price housing.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.720
A lot of people cannot afford
the market price housing,

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.760
and there's a variety of
strategies within that.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.940
What you're getting
at is the question

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.440
of what's the impact
of rent control

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.200
specifically on some places.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.030
There's only been a few cities
in the region-- San Francisco,

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:35.310
Berkeley, Oakland to a lesser
extent, San Jose to a lesser

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.770
extent-- that have any
form of rent control.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:39.380
So within those
places, yeah, there's

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:40.960
been some of those impacts.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.130
But by and large, the question
of neighborhood stability

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.120
and housing stability
is an important one.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.770
But it's a much longer--
it's a good question to ask,

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:53.160
but I think the broad housing
solution needs to make sure

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.070
that we have housing for
people that can't afford

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:59.120
the current cost
of housing as well.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:47:59.910
Yeah?

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.020
AUDIENCE: Do you think
the stagnation exists

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.670
because homeowners
don't have incentives

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.950
to vote for this
growth, because there's

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:11.910
no economic incentive for them
to lose value on their house?

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:15.120
And how can we move
forward with that?

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.900
EGON TERPLAN: And local
homeowners don't actually

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.500
have an incentive on the
impact, the fiscal impact,

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.920
of the decisions.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.280
Their property
taxes stay frozen.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.260
And so the extent
that their community--

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:29.780
take San Jose as an example--
is looking for more revenue

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.460
to add to it's city services.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.250
The individual homeowner
actually who's been in a home

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:36.290
for a long period
of time doesn't

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:37.609
have to contribute to that.

00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:39.650
AUDIENCE: But what about
the price of their home?

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.858
EGON TERPLAN: I think there's
a lot of misperceptions

00:48:41.858 --> 00:48:45.002
about the price of their home
in terms of changes to things.

00:48:45.002 --> 00:48:46.960
And one thing I would
point out, that if people

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.584
are going to build
more densely, that's

00:48:48.584 --> 00:48:50.740
a sign of rising land values.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.570
So there's not a
direct relationship

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.480
between increasing
density in a community

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.000
and the impact on
housing prices.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.465
So a large part of
that is perception.

00:49:01.465 --> 00:49:06.774
But a lot of it's people just
don't like change of any kind.

00:49:06.774 --> 00:49:08.190
AUDIENCE: I have
a quick question.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:10.410
So we have seen
how you have shown

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.870
the projection of 15% growth.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:18.350
I was thinking, can we think of
50% more capacity in the sense

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:21.780
we come to a place for 9
hours and commute for 2 hours.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.170
So those 12 hours
we're outside home.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:28.920
So house occupancy right
now is 50% in that sense.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.960
And population
also, they are also

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.160
thinking in terms of 24 hour
banking, 24 hour hospital,

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.970
24 hour services.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:42.170
So in that sense, can we extend
one more shift in working

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.890
and distribute people
in that accordingly

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.080
so that our roads are
not that congested,

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.790
our houses are not
that congested?

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:49.620
EGON TERPLAN: So
you're suggesting

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.661
that people might take
the homes that they're not

00:49:51.661 --> 00:49:54.160
in during the day and
have people sleep in them?

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.030
AUDIENCE: The same
family can distribute

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:02.890
who works in the day, who
works in the night, who

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:06.390
is with the kids during the
day, who is with the kids

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:09.909
during the night rather than
just going to some daycare.

00:50:09.909 --> 00:50:12.450
EGON TERPLAN: That's the reality
of how low income people can

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:13.590
survive in the Bay Area.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.340
What you have just
described is what

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.820
happens every day in
communities over this region.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.660
Someone works as
a janitor, someone

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.330
stays home with the kids,
someone works at night,

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:23.630
someone works during the day.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:27.110
Is it by the force of policy
to try to impose that?

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:27.750
Unlikely.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.230
I think you can
encourage companies

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:33.456
to be more flexible in their
workforce and other phenomena.

00:50:33.456 --> 00:50:35.080
But I think that what
you're getting at

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.660
is probably more about a
kind of social and cultural

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:39.570
transformation that
would need to happen.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:42.780
But it's creative,
and it's important.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.280
AUDIENCE: The current
housing crisis

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.940
and the policies
that gave rise to it

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.340
are related to
the deurbanization

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.070
of American cities in the recent
past and the social tumult

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:56.630
and migrations that resulted--
white flight suburbanization,

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.280
deindustrialization, et cetera.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.490
Is the area sufficiently
past those social ills?

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:05.140
Or is some of the
resistance to growth

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:08.290
still drawing on
those old wounds?

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.820
EGON TERPLAN: Wow, very
complex, important question.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.810
Short answer is yes.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.930
We're a product of
our recent past.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:21.120
The deindustrialization affected
large parts of the East Bay.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.270
And this is why I was really
trying to make a point

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:24.990
and think about
the income factor.

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:27.290
Just think about the
Bay Area for a moment.

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.960
Historically, you had a
lot of suburban migration.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.230
Like lots of regions, we
had lower income populations

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:37.960
living in older communities in
parts of San Francisco, parts

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.620
of Oakland, parts
of the East Bay.

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.150
That has changed.

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.270
So some of the pressures you are
seeing, particularly in Oakland

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.860
right now, are very
different from the pattern

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.300
of deindustrialization,
and decentralization,

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.190
and moving out.

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.840
And you're going to have
political pressure as prices

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.590
go up and people perceive that
they're going to be pushed out,

00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:59.560
or in reality their
children won't necessarily

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.485
be able to afford the
rents as they go up.

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:02.860
So I think these
are ones that we

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.750
want to get in front
of as a region.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:07.970
And the answer is to think
about this more broadly

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:09.890
to make sure we
build enough housing,

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:13.940
but these are a lot of complex
issues in that question.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.790
ADINA LEVIN: Back in that
generation, suburbs were cool,

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.070
cities were uncool.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.320
If you had a choice, you
moved to the suburbs.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.500
So the earlier
conversation about what

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.900
do current homeowners
think, they're thinking what

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:32.100
makes my place great
is that it's suburban.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.530
Walking and biking and transit
are what uncool people do.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:39.420
And the current generation
of younger adults

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.780
think really differently.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.460
There's a cultural
shift going on.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.900
AUDIENCE: I've been reading
a lot about the shuttle pilot

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.025
program in San Francisco
and Facebook's doing a lot

00:52:46.025 --> 00:52:48.280
with housing development
around Menlo Park.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.872
Is there a point
at which you think

00:52:49.872 --> 00:52:51.830
these companies that are
growing really rapidly

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:53.240
have more of a
responsibility to step

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.890
into with public/private
partnerships?

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:58.779
Or is that happening already,
and is it-- to what extent?

00:52:58.779 --> 00:53:00.320
EGON TERPLAN: That's
a good question.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.484
I'd love for Kevin and
the transportation folks

00:53:03.484 --> 00:53:04.150
to address that.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:05.990
But I think the
reality is-- and I

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.990
think Google recognizes this--
Caltrain is fundamentally

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.500
important to the
region, and it's

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.930
fundamentally important to
making all of these pieces

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:14.050
go together.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:16.210
The shuttles that are
being run are great,

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:18.140
but they're a part
of a solution.

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.610
And so to the extent
that you all as people

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.510
working here get involved
with issues that are happening

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:27.560
with Caltrain and make sure
that Caltrain's successful,

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.480
as well as thinking--
when you're

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.100
saying public/private
partnerships,

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.660
there's the public investment
in the transit system.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.430
But there could be
some sort of scenario

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.510
where you have more
people riding Caltrain,

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.170
they get off in
Mountain View, and then

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:43.180
you're running more express
feeder buses-- public, private,

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.240
shuttles, whatever
kind-- from downtown

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.890
Mountain View to this area.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.540
And in fact, I think some of
the planning for Shoreline

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.114
Boulevard coming here
would facilitate that.

00:53:52.114 --> 00:53:53.530
So that's the kind
of direction we

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.630
need to go in a
number of these things

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:58.000
is to make sure some of
those regional trunk lines

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.150
have enough capacity,
so a lot of people

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.820
can move big distances.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.410
And then public/private
partnerships,

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:08.690
a variety of mechanisms to get
people the last couple of miles

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:10.710
ultimately to their destination.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.760
So I really hope all of
you can get involved.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.350
I didn't mention before, I also
want to recognize my colleague

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.266
Leah Toeniskoetter in
the back of the room who

00:54:18.266 --> 00:54:19.910
runs our San Jose office.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:22.320
So those of you who live
in Santa Clara county,

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.080
want to continue these kinds of
conversations in the South Bay,

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.540
talk to her, show up
at our San Jose office.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.640
Get involved with
Friends of Caltrain

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.360
or think about these are the
kinds of issues where these

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.140
are really being talked about.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.848
JEREMY HOFFMAN: Thank
you all for coming.

00:54:37.848 --> 00:54:38.830
And thank you, Egon.

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:40.246
EGON TERPLAN: Thank
you very much.

00:54:40.246 --> 00:54:43.080
[APPLAUSE]
