So how do we know sleep is important? Well, based on experiments and case

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.650
studies in which people are sleep deprived, sleep deprivation can cause serious

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.315
consequences. Not only will you feel tired the next day, but your cognition can

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.685
also be affected. Lack of sleep can also interfere with school, work driving

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:21.604
ability, and social interactions. Sleep deficiency, an inadequate amount of

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:26.227
sleep, is linked to physical problems such as heart disease, stroke, high blood

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:32.064
pressure, diabetes. You know, this is really important, because the Center for

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:36.225
Disease Control found that between 7 to 19% of US adults report not getting an

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:39.599
adequate amount of sleep.
