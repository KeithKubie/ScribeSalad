longer than two years so actually it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020
longer than two years so actually it
 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.359
longer than two years so actually it
sort of impossible to be doing the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369
sort of impossible to be doing the

the other hand of course you both have
 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.120
the other hand of course you both have
very long histories and a lot of

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130
very long histories and a lot of
 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.440
very long histories and a lot of
experience and so actually you are

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450
experience and so actually you are
 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.240
experience and so actually you are
yourselves responsible for many

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250

younger than the other young practices

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
younger than the other young practices
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.660
younger than the other young practices
like you're the really young ones and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670
like you're the really young ones and
 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.979
like you're the really young ones and
there's a bit of a risk here because

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989
there's a bit of a risk here because
 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.509
there's a bit of a risk here because
it's sort of suggests that maybe young

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519
it's sort of suggests that maybe young
 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.970

practices have ideas and all practices

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
practices have ideas and all practices
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.640
practices have ideas and all practices
have a reality right and so if you could

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650
have a reality right and so if you could
 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.320
have a reality right and so if you could
become real you stop talking about ideas

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
become real you stop talking about ideas
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.339
become real you stop talking about ideas
and i think it's certainly interesting

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349
and i think it's certainly interesting
 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.110
and i think it's certainly interesting
that some of the architects that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120
that some of the architects that
 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.330
that some of the architects that
interest us a lot who continue to be

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340
interest us a lot who continue to be
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.160

successful continue to be ideas people

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
successful continue to be ideas people
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.360
successful continue to be ideas people
even though officially they could give

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370
even though officially they could give
 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.320
even though officially they could give
up with ideas

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110
talking about contract so my little
 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.200
talking about contract so my little
point here is that it's not so simple

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210
point here is that it's not so simple
 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.760
point here is that it's not so simple
really if officially if you look at the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770
really if officially if you look at the
 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.140
really if officially if you look at the
kind of projects you're doing they

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
kind of projects you're doing they
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.390

zone so characteristic not only of young

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610
zone so characteristic not only of young
 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.250
zone so characteristic not only of young
architects but i would say of the youth

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260
architects but i would say of the youth
 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.170

exhibition actually would have no value

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980
exhibition actually would have no value
 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.190
exhibition actually would have no value
so it's not only the place in which we

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200
so it's not only the place in which we
 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.110
so it's not only the place in which we
incubate ideas that can't be built but

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120
incubate ideas that can't be built but
 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.640
incubate ideas that can't be built but
even if we do build they have to come

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650
even if we do build they have to come
 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.590
even if we do build they have to come
back into that zone so i think actually

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600
back into that zone so i think actually
 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.300
back into that zone so i think actually
the so-called young architects become

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
the so-called young architects become
 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.890
the so-called young architects become
very interesting because they are the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900
very interesting because they are the
 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.680
very interesting because they are the
caretakers of a of a zone of the

knowledge to answer to and so our

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:23.990
knowledge to answer to and so our
 

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.999
knowledge to answer to and so our
thinking was also maybe if we can find a

bring people's attention back to the
 

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.610
bring people's attention back to the
physical environment but by providing a

before was this is you can make drawings

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:23.589
before was this is you can make drawings
 

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:26.720
before was this is you can make drawings
with these poles as well so these are

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:26.730
with these poles as well so these are
 

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.650
with these poles as well so these are
sounds generated drawings that come from

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:31.660
sounds generated drawings that come from
 

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.379
sounds generated drawings that come from
these poles with these accelerometers in

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:34.389
these poles with these accelerometers in
 

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:37.019
these poles with these accelerometers in
them so there's drawing Pope tests that

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:37.029
them so there's drawing Pope tests that

the city you have to live with one
 

00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:22.879
the city you have to live with one
another and by this mark this small sort

00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:22.889
another and by this mark this small sort
 

00:23:22.889 --> 00:23:27.499
another and by this mark this small sort
of simple shift you also create equality

00:23:27.499 --> 00:23:27.509
of simple shift you also create equality
 

00:23:27.509 --> 00:23:30.440
of simple shift you also create equality
for all the units that happened in there

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:30.450
for all the units that happened in there
 

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.239
for all the units that happened in there
so it's a very democratic move which

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:32.249
so it's a very democratic move which
 

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:33.919
so it's a very democratic move which
seems quite appropriate for the location

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:33.929
seems quite appropriate for the location
 

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:38.719
seems quite appropriate for the location
of the competition the the what it also

00:23:38.719 --> 00:23:38.729
of the competition the the what it also
 

00:23:38.729 --> 00:23:41.680
of the competition the the what it also
does is it really opens up the street

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:41.690
does is it really opens up the street
 

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.450
does is it really opens up the street
into the yard so it opens it sort of

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460
into the yard so it opens it sort of
 

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.070
into the yard so it opens it sort of
opens up the block and brings that

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080
opens up the block and brings that
 

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.209
opens up the block and brings that
public in and it allows basically this

00:23:50.209 --> 00:23:50.219
public in and it allows basically this
 

00:23:50.219 --> 00:23:52.629
public in and it allows basically this
is all to become the buffer between the

00:23:52.629 --> 00:23:52.639
is all to become the buffer between the
 

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:56.180
is all to become the buffer between the
units and the end the street itself it

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.190
units and the end the street itself it
 

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.450
units and the end the street itself it
does give you obviously very narrow and

00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460
does give you obviously very narrow and
 

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.969
does give you obviously very narrow and

00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:01.979
slim section of a building four and a
 

00:24:01.979 --> 00:24:04.159

half meter of building a four-and-a-half
litre of yard and so we designed it very

00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419
litre of yard and so we designed it very
 

00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:12.019
litre of yard and so we designed it very
very precise almost like a like a

Japanese capsule hotel and we did want

00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:15.779
Japanese capsule hotel and we did want
 

00:24:15.779 --> 00:24:17.539
Japanese capsule hotel and we did want
to give all the students their private

to give all the students their private
 

00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:20.469
to give all the students their private

dorm style living everybody have their
 

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:25.549
dorm style living everybody have their
own unit that we we organized it sort of

00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559
own unit that we we organized it sort of
 

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:31.430
own unit that we we organized it sort of
in zones from super personal and closed

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440
in zones from super personal and closed
 

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.369
in zones from super personal and closed
gradually to more open and more public

00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:34.379
gradually to more open and more public
 

00:24:34.379 --> 00:24:38.680
gradually to more open and more public
and I think this the age for which this

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:38.690
and I think this the age for which this
 

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.349
and I think this the age for which this
typology and building is is exactly

probably you guys but it's where you

00:24:43.969 --> 00:24:43.979
probably you guys but it's where you
 

00:24:43.979 --> 00:24:45.909
probably you guys but it's where you
jump from sort of very intimate and

00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919
jump from sort of very intimate and
 

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:48.649
jump from sort of very intimate and
concentrated modes to very open and

00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659
concentrated modes to very open and
 

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:51.379
concentrated modes to very open and
exuberant and so this we try to pack

00:24:51.379 --> 00:24:51.389
exuberant and so this we try to pack
 

00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:54.009
exuberant and so this we try to pack
these different modes into a very small

00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:54.019
these different modes into a very small
 

00:24:54.019 --> 00:24:57.229
these different modes into a very small
confined section so here you see almost

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:57.239
confined section so here you see almost
 

00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:59.619
confined section so here you see almost

this view out to this yard this yard is
 

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.589
this view out to this yard this yard is
actually a vertical yard so you see all

elevation we varied the section to
 

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.249
elevation we varied the section to
generate some variety also in the spaces

00:25:26.249 --> 00:25:26.259
generate some variety also in the spaces
 

00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:30.159
generate some variety also in the spaces
ultimately and 16 or well there was a

00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:30.169
ultimately and 16 or well there was a
 

00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:32.049
ultimately and 16 or well there was a

exchange as well in this yard that can

00:25:53.499 --> 00:25:53.509
exchange as well in this yard that can
 

00:25:53.509 --> 00:25:58.840
exchange as well in this yard that can
be occupied by students and the in a way

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:58.850
be occupied by students and the in a way
 

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.490

very clean and simple abstract facade as
within this chaotic neighborhood and

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:06.490
within this chaotic neighborhood and
 

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:11.230
within this chaotic neighborhood and
part of the competition was not only to

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240
part of the competition was not only to
 

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.440
part of the competition was not only to
come up with an answer or one type but

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:14.450
come up with an answer or one type but
 

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.610
come up with an answer or one type but
actually look at the neighborhood as a

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:15.620
actually look at the neighborhood as a
 

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.409
actually look at the neighborhood as a
whole and think of this as a sort of a

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:17.419
whole and think of this as a sort of a
 

00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:19.990
whole and think of this as a sort of a
viral typology that could start taking

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000
viral typology that could start taking
 

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.259
viral typology that could start taking
over the entire neighborhood and so we

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:23.269
over the entire neighborhood and so we
 

00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:25.749
over the entire neighborhood and so we
were actually one of the finalists we

00:26:25.749 --> 00:26:25.759
were actually one of the finalists we
 

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:26.889
were actually one of the finalists we
didn't win the competition that we were

00:26:26.889 --> 00:26:26.899
didn't win the competition that we were
 

00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:29.680
didn't win the competition that we were
with the last five and we could further

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:29.690
with the last five and we could further
 

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.519
with the last five and we could further
develop the scheme and especially our

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:32.529
develop the scheme and especially our
 

00:26:32.529 --> 00:26:36.490
develop the scheme and especially our
this strategy of opening up the block

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:36.500
this strategy of opening up the block
 

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.580
this strategy of opening up the block
and gradually through this intervention

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:39.590
and gradually through this intervention
 

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.799
and gradually through this intervention
if you would do this on all sites the

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:41.809
if you would do this on all sites the
 

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:43.299
if you would do this on all sites the
whole urban fabric would actually start

00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:43.309
whole urban fabric would actually start
 

00:26:43.309 --> 00:26:45.639
whole urban fabric would actually start
to change and rather than having as hard

00:26:45.639 --> 00:26:45.649
to change and rather than having as hard
 

00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:49.779
to change and rather than having as hard
a division between streets and inner

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:49.789
a division between streets and inner
 

00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:54.990
a division between streets and inner
court you get much more porous and

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000
 
 

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.660
 
diffused urban fabric so this was our

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:00.670
diffused urban fabric so this was our
 

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.790
diffused urban fabric so this was our
argument also for as a strategy to take

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:03.800
argument also for as a strategy to take
 

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.550
argument also for as a strategy to take
over this entire loan what was

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:06.560
over this entire loan what was
 

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.940
over this entire loan what was
interesting so that we indeed did not we

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:09.950
interesting so that we indeed did not we
 

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.800
interesting so that we indeed did not we
were selected for the final project the

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:11.810
were selected for the final project the
 

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.010
were selected for the final project the
next day indeed this young developer

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:15.020
next day indeed this young developer
 

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.840
next day indeed this young developer
called us and said we like that strategy

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:16.850
called us and said we like that strategy
 

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.060
called us and said we like that strategy
and this strategy works very well on

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.070
and this strategy works very well on
 

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.180
and this strategy works very well on
other lots that we have so the next day

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:22.190
other lots that we have so the next day
 

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.660
other lots that we have so the next day
we started to work on a much larger more

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:25.670
we started to work on a much larger more
 

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.480
we started to work on a much larger more
from the other side of the street right

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:27.490
from the other side of the street right
 

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.000
from the other side of the street right
here and that is something that is in

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.010
here and that is something that is in
 

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.080
here and that is something that is in
development now obviously also apart

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.090
development now obviously also apart
 

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.630
development now obviously also apart
from the US Greece is also suffering

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640
from the US Greece is also suffering
 

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.260
from the US Greece is also suffering
somewhat from financial constraints so

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:41.270
somewhat from financial constraints so
 

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.510
somewhat from financial constraints so
at this moment we are and i will show

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:43.520
at this moment we are and i will show
 

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.950
at this moment we are and i will show
you where we where we are what was

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960
you where we where we are what was
 

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.990
you where we where we are what was
interesting here so this is the other

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000
interesting here so this is the other
 

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.040
interesting here so this is the other
side of the street this is literally

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.050
side of the street this is literally
 

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.710
side of the street this is literally
sort of facing the site where we did the

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720
sort of facing the site where we did the
 

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.000
sort of facing the site where we did the
competition is it this site is much

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.010
competition is it this site is much
 

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.610
competition is it this site is much
deeper actually and it also allowed us

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:54.620
deeper actually and it also allowed us
 

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.180
deeper actually and it also allowed us
to think of more variety and typology

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:58.190
to think of more variety and typology
 

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:01.140
to think of more variety and typology
there was a shift towards young families

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.150

so the idea actually that these

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:06.170
so the idea actually that these
 

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.320
so the idea actually that these
different buildings as it takes over the

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:08.330
different buildings as it takes over the
 

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.820

that can be shared between all the units

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:12.830
that can be shared between all the units
 

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.280

the complication here is also we had to

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:15.290
the complication here is also we had to
 

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.410
the complication here is also we had to
include three stories of parking so this

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:17.420
include three stories of parking so this
 

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.480
include three stories of parking so this
became actually very intricate puzzle

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:19.490
became actually very intricate puzzle
 

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.950
became actually very intricate puzzle
and with open Utley how many units like

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960

project I think we ended up with about

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:32.470
project I think we ended up with about
 

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:39.220
project I think we ended up with about
around 50 units and this project at this

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:39.230
around 50 units and this project at this
 

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.500
around 50 units and this project at this
moment is developed up to schematic

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:41.510
moment is developed up to schematic
 

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.870
moment is developed up to schematic
design but we actually continue to sort

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880
design but we actually continue to sort
 

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.580

so this is an exhibition we had in the
at studio x there where we actually

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:57.380
at studio x there where we actually
 

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.630
at studio x there where we actually
assumed that we had taken over the

00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640

game and this is maybe more our sort of

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340
game and this is maybe more our sort of
 

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.620
game and this is maybe more our sort of
internal idea and research or the

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:09.630
internal idea and research or the
 

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.299
internal idea and research or the
discussion that we had with in the

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:11.309
discussion that we had with in the
 

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:14.539
discussion that we had with in the
office but as Mark said we are here to

00:30:14.539 --> 00:30:14.549
office but as Mark said we are here to
 

00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:16.570
office but as Mark said we are here to
speak about ideas as well not justify

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:16.580

solutions and at some point A student

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:20.070
solutions and at some point A student
 

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.520
solutions and at some point A student
presented her work and she said well you

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:22.530

whatever and I initially thought it was

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:27.990
whatever and I initially thought it was
 

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.930
whatever and I initially thought it was
quite lame sort of description of the

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940
quite lame sort of description of the
 

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.390
quite lame sort of description of the
project but then realized that maybe

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:32.400
project but then realized that maybe
 

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.490
project but then realized that maybe
everything these days can be sort of

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500
everything these days can be sort of
 

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.500
everything these days can be sort of
kind of whatever because in the past

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:36.510
kind of whatever because in the past
 

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.440
kind of whatever because in the past
maybe we made buildings to do something

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.450
maybe we made buildings to do something
 

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.970
maybe we made buildings to do something
but this one google of these stuff

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:40.980
but this one google of these stuff
 

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.649
but this one google of these stuff
online or

00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:42.659
online or
 

00:30:42.659 --> 00:30:44.989
online or
virtual realm so almost everything we

00:30:44.989 --> 00:30:44.999
virtual realm so almost everything we
 

00:30:44.999 --> 00:30:47.180
virtual realm so almost everything we
make can maybe be sort of kind of

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:47.190
make can maybe be sort of kind of
 

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.609
make can maybe be sort of kind of
whatever and so we started to think how

00:30:49.609 --> 00:30:49.619
whatever and so we started to think how
 

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:51.200
whatever and so we started to think how
what does that look like if you actually

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.210
what does that look like if you actually
 

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:55.060
what does that look like if you actually
have to design that or and so we got

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:55.070
have to design that or and so we got
 

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.619
have to design that or and so we got
interested in thinking about sort of

00:30:57.619 --> 00:30:57.629
interested in thinking about sort of
 

00:30:57.629 --> 00:31:02.839
interested in thinking about sort of
deliberate ambivalence and this idea of

00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:02.849
deliberate ambivalence and this idea of
 

00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:05.089
deliberate ambivalence and this idea of
something that is ambivalence or

00:31:05.089 --> 00:31:05.099
something that is ambivalence or
 

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:06.769
something that is ambivalence or
something you can't grasp actually

00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779
something you can't grasp actually
 

00:31:06.779 --> 00:31:08.810
something you can't grasp actually
becomes maybe more desirable rather than

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820
becomes maybe more desirable rather than
 

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.799
becomes maybe more desirable rather than
something that is very explicit and very

easy to understand so somewhere the
 

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:15.460
easy to understand so somewhere the
mystique of something that you can't

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:15.470
mystique of something that you can't
 

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.159

there is a lecture hall downstairs and
 

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.180
there is a lecture hall downstairs and
where they will have presentations for

with the storage and parking so that was

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399
with the storage and parking so that was
 

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:26.490

they hear the simple white

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200
they hear the simple white

daylight is important and then we have

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800
daylight is important and then we have
 

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.530
daylight is important and then we have
to think how do we how do we bring this

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540
to think how do we how do we bring this
 

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.490
to think how do we how do we bring this
white box into the entities urban fabric

white box into the entities urban fabric
 

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.629
white box into the entities urban fabric
and so this idea say deliberate

00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639
and so this idea say deliberate
 

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.399
and so this idea say deliberate
ambiguity and the idea of making

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:49.409
ambiguity and the idea of making
 

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.819
ambiguity and the idea of making
something that is that maybe because of

00:34:52.819 --> 00:34:52.829
something that is that maybe because of
 

00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:55.639
something that is that maybe because of
the fact the fact that it is not a hard

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:55.649
the fact the fact that it is not a hard
 

00:34:55.649 --> 00:34:58.220
the fact the fact that it is not a hard
edge but actually a sort of a softer and

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.230
edge but actually a sort of a softer and
 

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:02.240
edge but actually a sort of a softer and
a diffuser object then maybe that could

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:02.250
a diffuser object then maybe that could
 

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.510
a diffuser object then maybe that could
be so the negotiator between this

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520
be so the negotiator between this
 

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.690
be so the negotiator between this

it's true and this is the site and there

it's true and this is the site and there
is actually a river and that is where

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:23.310
is actually a river and that is where
 

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.890
is actually a river and that is where
the where the building is now and we're

the where the building is now and we're
 

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.720
the where the building is now and we're
actually feeling it while building our

actually feeling it while building our
 

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.310

diffused pneus of fogginess and actually

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:39.450
diffused pneus of fogginess and actually
 

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.390
diffused pneus of fogginess and actually
then we found one contemporary

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400
then we found one contemporary
 

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.550
then we found one contemporary
photographer that they represented also

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560

as the same sort of say a cloud like a

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000
as the same sort of say a cloud like a

quality to their and to their work and

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700
quality to their and to their work and
 

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.910
quality to their and to their work and
we thought what if we have we take this

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920
we thought what if we have we take this
 

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.559
we thought what if we have we take this
diagram and we actually sort of shrink

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:54.569
diagram and we actually sort of shrink
 

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:58.700
diagram and we actually sort of shrink
wrap it in in a layer of diffusion in a

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:58.710
wrap it in in a layer of diffusion in a
 

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.130
wrap it in in a layer of diffusion in a
way and it sounded all great and we made

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.140
way and it sounded all great and we made
 

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.950
way and it sounded all great and we made
a model and and it's we indeed literally

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960
a model and and it's we indeed literally
 

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.640
a model and and it's we indeed literally
a shrink-wrapped and this diagram into

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:07.650
a shrink-wrapped and this diagram into
 

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:13.280
a shrink-wrapped and this diagram into
this reflective sort of armor and we

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:13.290
this reflective sort of armor and we
 

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.040
this reflective sort of armor and we
presented it and Leslie said that's

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:16.050
presented it and Leslie said that's
 

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.010
presented it and Leslie said that's
great make it we first have to get some

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020
great make it we first have to get some
 

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.740
great make it we first have to get some
approval from the historic committee so

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:21.750
approval from the historic committee so
 

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.910
approval from the historic committee so
we and this is the file we had

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920
we and this is the file we had
 

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.040
we and this is the file we had
especially this diagram i think is quite

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.050
especially this diagram i think is quite
 

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.050
especially this diagram i think is quite
and strong in showing how well it fits

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:32.060
and strong in showing how well it fits
 

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.819
and strong in showing how well it fits
within the neighborhood and so we got an

00:36:34.819 --> 00:36:34.829
within the neighborhood and so we got an
 

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:37.059
within the neighborhood and so we got an
approval then the question is of course

00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:37.069
approval then the question is of course
 

00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:40.460
approval then the question is of course
great but what is it and we had to think

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:40.470
great but what is it and we had to think
 

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.290
great but what is it and we had to think
especially because this is a double

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300
especially because this is a double
 

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.650
especially because this is a double
curvature it's called

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:43.660
curvature it's called
 

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.089
curvature it's called
but at the same time it needs to be

00:36:45.089 --> 00:36:45.099
but at the same time it needs to be
 

00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:47.579
but at the same time it needs to be
exterior what so it needs to be strong

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:47.589
exterior what so it needs to be strong
 

00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:50.910
exterior what so it needs to be strong
so what is a strong which you know what

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920
so what is a strong which you know what
 

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.940
so what is a strong which you know what
is durable outside and can take on a

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:53.950
is durable outside and can take on a
 

00:36:53.950 --> 00:37:00.289
is durable outside and can take on a

diameter is 13 millimeters so it's a

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:25.750
diameter is 13 millimeters so it's a
 

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.299

obviously for building so we started the

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:37.180
obviously for building so we started the
 

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.029
obviously for building so we started the
test first by just laser cutting and

00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:39.039
test first by just laser cutting and
 

00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:42.029

different dimensions in our office to
 

00:37:42.039 --> 00:37:43.829
different dimensions in our office to
see what is the right size and at the

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839
see what is the right size and at the
 

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.450
see what is the right size and at the
same time we started to see that this

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:45.460
same time we started to see that this
 

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.339
same time we started to see that this
material actually has so what gives it

00:37:47.339 --> 00:37:47.349
material actually has so what gives it
 

00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:50.039
material actually has so what gives it
these elastic qualities we started to

00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:50.049
these elastic qualities we started to
 

00:37:50.049 --> 00:37:52.740
these elastic qualities we started to
play with how it works geometrically we

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:52.750
play with how it works geometrically we
 

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.289
play with how it works geometrically we
got a sample and we started to see how

00:37:55.289 --> 00:37:55.299
got a sample and we started to see how
 

00:37:55.299 --> 00:37:57.420
got a sample and we started to see how
sort of it behaves and we they're sort

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:57.430
sort of it behaves and we they're sort
 

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:58.769
sort of it behaves and we they're sort
of the directionality and we found out

00:37:58.769 --> 00:37:58.779
of the directionality and we found out
 

00:37:58.779 --> 00:38:00.900
of the directionality and we found out
that there is a way in which indeed

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:00.910
that there is a way in which indeed
 

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.579
that there is a way in which indeed
listening and stretches which allows for

00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:02.589
listening and stretches which allows for
 

00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:05.400
listening and stretches which allows for
it to take on the double curvature so

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:05.410
it to take on the double curvature so
 

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:10.890
it to take on the double curvature so
we've mapped the entire perimeter of the

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:10.900
we've mapped the entire perimeter of the
 

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.120
we've mapped the entire perimeter of the
building and so we're sort of its

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.130
building and so we're sort of its
 

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.609
building and so we're sort of its
maximum expansion that it's it's it's

00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:14.619
maximum expansion that it's it's it's
 

00:38:14.619 --> 00:38:16.260
maximum expansion that it's it's it's
title is obviously the roof would be one

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:16.270
title is obviously the roof would be one
 

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:17.819
title is obviously the roof would be one
hundred percent and then you can stretch

00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:17.829
hundred percent and then you can stretch
 

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:21.299
hundred percent and then you can stretch
it along the rest circle area of the

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:21.309
it along the rest circle area of the
 

00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:23.430
it along the rest circle area of the
building and by then we realize okay if

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440
building and by then we realize okay if
 

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.470
building and by then we realize okay if
we're really going to do this we have to

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480
we're really going to do this we have to
 

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.480
we're really going to do this we have to
get an engineer on board and we actually

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:27.490
get an engineer on board and we actually
 

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:28.890
get an engineer on board and we actually
we have to figure this out because we

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:28.900
we have to figure this out because we
 

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.360
we have to figure this out because we
have to

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:29.370
have to
 

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.340
have to
obviously this thing doesn't exist and

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:31.350
obviously this thing doesn't exist and
 

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.520
obviously this thing doesn't exist and
how do you come up with well it needed

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.530
how do you come up with well it needed
 

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.970
how do you come up with well it needed
to get approvals and be survive

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980
to get approvals and be survive

earthquakes and etc so we teamed up with

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:40.650
earthquakes and etc so we teamed up with
 

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.310
earthquakes and etc so we teamed up with
front the facade engineers we asked them

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320
front the facade engineers we asked them
 

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.350
front the facade engineers we asked them
if they want to help us with this and

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:45.360
if they want to help us with this and
 

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.260
if they want to help us with this and
they said yes we're going to do a we're

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.270
they said yes we're going to do a we're
 

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.250
they said yes we're going to do a we're
going to work together on if we're going

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260
going to work together on if we're going
 

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.340
going to work together on if we're going
to do a digital trajectory and just the

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:52.350
to do a digital trajectory and just the
 

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:56.480
to do a digital trajectory and just the
physical trajectory so we started to do

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:56.490
physical trajectory so we started to do
 

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.790
physical trajectory so we started to do
some really super simple and fearful

00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800
some really super simple and fearful
 

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.650

testing by the seeing how the forces

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660
testing by the seeing how the forces
 

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.610
testing by the seeing how the forces
behave because there's actually very

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:01.620
behave because there's actually very
 

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.570
behave because there's actually very
little knowledge about this material

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:04.580
little knowledge about this material
 

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.700
little knowledge about this material
available and we started to see sort of

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:07.710
available and we started to see sort of
 

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.580
available and we started to see sort of
initial patterns of stress and how they

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:10.590
initial patterns of stress and how they
 

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.340
initial patterns of stress and how they
behave this model became more complex to

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:13.350
behave this model became more complex to
 

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.850
behave this model became more complex to
a level where we almost have every ring

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:15.860
a level where we almost have every ring
 

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.240
a level where we almost have every ring
model and we build a large model model

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:20.250
model and we build a large model model
 

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.700
model and we build a large model model
in our offices one to ten scale model

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:22.710
in our offices one to ten scale model
 

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.130
in our offices one to ten scale model
and I with the reins to actually see how

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140
and I with the reins to actually see how
 

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.620
and I with the reins to actually see how
it would behave in its physical

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:27.630
it would behave in its physical
 

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.630
it would behave in its physical
proportion so it's really both i think

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640
proportion so it's really both i think
 

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.580
proportion so it's really both i think
that are important both the physical and

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:31.590
that are important both the physical and
 

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.310
that are important both the physical and
the digital and the need to work but

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320
the digital and the need to work but
 

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.150
the digital and the need to work but
together and starts to and well any way

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160
together and starts to and well any way
 

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.160
together and starts to and well any way
through that these things can work to

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:40.170
through that these things can work to
 

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.970
through that these things can work to
mix them by then we knew quite a bit

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980
mix them by then we knew quite a bit
 

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.530
mix them by then we knew quite a bit
about this material and we actually also

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540
about this material and we actually also
 

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.880
about this material and we actually also
have to think of how to install it and

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:46.890
have to think of how to install it and
 

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.720
have to think of how to install it and
then and we together with drug decided

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:50.730
then and we together with drug decided
 

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.520
then and we together with drug decided
why don't we just actually just

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:52.530
why don't we just actually just
 

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.900
why don't we just actually just
fabricate the thing ourselves and

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:53.910
fabricate the thing ourselves and
 

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.000
fabricate the thing ourselves and
deliver it and probably you know we're

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.010
deliver it and probably you know we're
 

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.580
deliver it and probably you know we're
going to be installing it as well

00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:58.590
going to be installing it as well
 

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.980
going to be installing it as well
because you know there's it's in these

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:30.510
Eric Chen and they approached us two
 

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.970
Eric Chen and they approached us two
months before the opening of the

months before the opening of the
 

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.560
months before the opening of the
festival and asked us maybe

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:38.570

the screening and lecturing programs to
 

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.900
the screening and lecturing programs to
take place during the festival and we

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:47.910
take place during the festival and we
 

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.120
take place during the festival and we
said no because we never say no was that

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.130
said no because we never say no was that
 

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.860
said no because we never say no was that
yes this time too so two days later we

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:54.870
yes this time too so two days later we
 

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.560
yes this time too so two days later we
got a project schedule which indicated

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:57.570
got a project schedule which indicated
 

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.820
got a project schedule which indicated
that we need to deliver their

00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:58.830
that we need to deliver their
 

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.770
that we need to deliver their
construction documents in the following

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:00.780
construction documents in the following
 

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.750
construction documents in the following
week so but we remained optimistic and

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760
week so but we remained optimistic and
 

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.930
week so but we remained optimistic and
proposed something very quick to them

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:08.940
proposed something very quick to them
 

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.230
proposed something very quick to them
along the same similar thoughts that we

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240
along the same similar thoughts that we
 

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.410
along the same similar thoughts that we
had as a stable structure that we

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420
had as a stable structure that we
 

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.890
had as a stable structure that we
experimented in ps1 at that moment so

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900
experimented in ps1 at that moment so
 

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.700
experimented in ps1 at that moment so
our proposal was this vertical

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:22.710
our proposal was this vertical
 

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.680
our proposal was this vertical
structures that's connected only on one

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:24.690
structures that's connected only on one
 

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.140
structures that's connected only on one
and rigidly and on the other and

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:27.150
and rigidly and on the other and
 

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.300
and rigidly and on the other and
gathered with pension ring and the

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:29.310
gathered with pension ring and the
 

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.070
gathered with pension ring and the
spring would be held down by I

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:33.080
spring would be held down by I
 

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.890
spring would be held down by I
adjustable weights and so by

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:36.900
adjustable weights and so by
 

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.930
adjustable weights and so by
manipulating way so you would get a

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940
manipulating way so you would get a
 

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.480
manipulating way so you would get a
different curvature of that vertical

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:41.490
different curvature of that vertical
 

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:45.490
different curvature of that vertical
member therefore the shifting

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:45.500
member therefore the shifting
 

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.920
member therefore the shifting
transforming form of the pavilion

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:48.930
transforming form of the pavilion
 

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.170
transforming form of the pavilion
constructor itself and it should keep

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.180
constructor itself and it should keep
 

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.550
constructor itself and it should keep
the ring and Psalm out we would

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:53.560
the ring and Psalm out we would

00:52:19.759 --> 00:52:19.769
there but it mostly so the video is same
 

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:33.699
there but it mostly so the video is same
the most information story maybe I can

00:52:33.699 --> 00:52:33.709
the most information story maybe I can
 

00:52:33.709 --> 00:52:39.769
the most information story maybe I can
clarify why we're going to show now a

00:52:39.769 --> 00:52:39.779
clarify why we're going to show now a
 

00:52:39.779 --> 00:52:43.190
clarify why we're going to show now a
tumor project one is a competition entry

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200
tumor project one is a competition entry
 

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.579
tumor project one is a competition entry
we just did and we're showing this I

00:52:46.579 --> 00:52:46.589
we just did and we're showing this I
 

00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:53.299
we just did and we're showing this I
think more because of the way we did the

00:52:53.299 --> 00:52:53.309
think more because of the way we did the
 

00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:54.829
think more because of the way we did the
projects are sorted from a process

00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839
projects are sorted from a process
 

00:52:54.839 --> 00:52:58.819
projects are sorted from a process
standpoint and we worked together with

00:52:58.819 --> 00:52:58.829
standpoint and we worked together with
 

00:52:58.829 --> 00:53:01.400
standpoint and we worked together with
Arab acoustical engineers with whom we

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:01.410
Arab acoustical engineers with whom we
 

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:03.769
Arab acoustical engineers with whom we
had developed a relationship through ps1

00:53:03.769 --> 00:53:03.779
had developed a relationship through ps1
 

00:53:03.779 --> 00:53:07.870
had developed a relationship through ps1
and so this is a competition in poland

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880
and so this is a competition in poland
 

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.170
and so this is a competition in poland
in Warshaw for a symphony hall 1500

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:12.180
in Warshaw for a symphony hall 1500
 

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.599
in Warshaw for a symphony hall 1500
people symphony hall and what is

00:53:14.599 --> 00:53:14.609
people symphony hall and what is
 

00:53:14.609 --> 00:53:16.999
people symphony hall and what is
interesting in the competition brief is

00:53:16.999 --> 00:53:17.009
interesting in the competition brief is
 

00:53:17.009 --> 00:53:18.229
interesting in the competition brief is
that the architectural brief was like

00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:18.239
that the architectural brief was like
 

00:53:18.239 --> 00:53:19.640
that the architectural brief was like
three pages in the acoustical briefs

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:19.650
three pages in the acoustical briefs
 

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:23.569
three pages in the acoustical briefs
pretty much 50 pages and so the jury was

00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579
pretty much 50 pages and so the jury was
 

00:53:23.579 --> 00:53:26.979
pretty much 50 pages and so the jury was
also mostly acousticians and it gave us

00:53:26.979 --> 00:53:26.989
also mostly acousticians and it gave us
 

00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:29.359
also mostly acousticians and it gave us
well it was very interesting is that it

00:53:29.359 --> 00:53:29.369
well it was very interesting is that it
 

00:53:29.369 --> 00:53:31.459
well it was very interesting is that it
immediate first of all it means that as

00:53:31.459 --> 00:53:31.469
immediate first of all it means that as
 

00:53:31.469 --> 00:53:34.430
immediate first of all it means that as
a young and small office it actually

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440
a young and small office it actually
 

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.890
a young and small office it actually
allows you to participate in these

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:36.900
allows you to participate in these
 

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.739
allows you to participate in these
things because it sort of the weight

00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:39.749
things because it sort of the weight
 

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:45.079
things because it sort of the weight
within such a project can be shared the

00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:45.089
within such a project can be shared the
 

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:47.900
within such a project can be shared the
the sort of the load the workload and

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:47.910
the sort of the load the workload and
 

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.749
the sort of the load the workload and
also the would say the the ideas load

00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:50.759
also the would say the the ideas load
 

00:53:50.759 --> 00:53:55.069
also the would say the the ideas load
that needs to be put into it and it's

00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079
that needs to be put into it and it's
 

00:53:55.079 --> 00:53:56.239
that needs to be put into it and it's
also really interesting to see how

00:53:56.239 --> 00:53:56.249
also really interesting to see how
 

00:53:56.249 --> 00:53:58.459
also really interesting to see how
indeed maybe the architectural practices

00:53:58.459 --> 00:53:58.469
indeed maybe the architectural practices
 

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:00.099
indeed maybe the architectural practices
is changing and much more collaborative

00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:00.109
is changing and much more collaborative
 

00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:04.249
is changing and much more collaborative
spirit and so that's one reason to to

00:54:04.249 --> 00:54:04.259
spirit and so that's one reason to to
 

00:54:04.259 --> 00:54:07.489
spirit and so that's one reason to to
show it at the same time I think what is

00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:07.499
show it at the same time I think what is
 

00:54:07.499 --> 00:54:09.079
show it at the same time I think what is
interesting is the way we're trying to

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:09.089
interesting is the way we're trying to
 

00:54:09.089 --> 00:54:12.510
interesting is the way we're trying to
develop a design method it gives options

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520
develop a design method it gives options
 

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.790
develop a design method it gives options

access at the same time the ambition to
 

00:55:55.650 --> 00:56:00.000
access at the same time the ambition to
come up with a form that opens up the

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.010
come up with a form that opens up the
 

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:02.630
come up with a form that opens up the
sites to a larger audience and actually

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640
sites to a larger audience and actually
 

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.930
sites to a larger audience and actually
reaches out to an audience beyond the

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:06.940
reaches out to an audience beyond the
 

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.010
reaches out to an audience beyond the
site itself so we kept the axis we kept

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:11.020
site itself so we kept the axis we kept
 

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.330

the project on access but actually
 

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.700
the project on access but actually
through its form we try to generate a

through its form we try to generate a
 

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:17.009
through its form we try to generate a
space that exists beyond

00:56:17.009 --> 00:56:17.019
space that exists beyond

space that exists beyond
site and we were able to get all the set

00:56:21.179 --> 00:56:21.189
site and we were able to get all the set
 

00:56:21.189 --> 00:56:24.149
site and we were able to get all the set
every program and facilities into the

00:56:24.149 --> 00:56:24.159
every program and facilities into the
 

00:56:24.159 --> 00:56:26.999
every program and facilities into the
old buildings and could make the concert

00:56:26.999 --> 00:56:27.009
old buildings and could make the concert
 

00:56:27.009 --> 00:56:29.399
old buildings and could make the concert
hall itself a sort of an individual room

00:56:29.399 --> 00:56:29.409
hall itself a sort of an individual room
 

00:56:29.409 --> 00:56:32.039
hall itself a sort of an individual room
in the back of the site which you see

00:56:32.039 --> 00:56:32.049
in the back of the site which you see
 

00:56:32.049 --> 00:56:36.449
in the back of the site which you see
over here the form and in a way opens up

00:56:36.449 --> 00:56:36.459
over here the form and in a way opens up
 

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:40.499
over here the form and in a way opens up
towards the two words the city allows

00:56:40.499 --> 00:56:40.509
towards the two words the city allows
 

00:56:40.509 --> 00:56:42.749
towards the two words the city allows
daylight into the space also into the

00:56:42.749 --> 00:56:42.759
daylight into the space also into the
 

00:56:42.759 --> 00:56:44.729
daylight into the space also into the
concert hall itself which is actually a

00:56:44.729 --> 00:56:44.739
concert hall itself which is actually a
 

00:56:44.739 --> 00:56:46.620
concert hall itself which is actually a
quite exciting thing and also anyway

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:46.630
quite exciting thing and also anyway
 

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:49.739
quite exciting thing and also anyway
tries to respect the space of the the

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:49.749
tries to respect the space of the the
 

00:56:49.749 --> 00:56:53.249
tries to respect the space of the the
old buildings around it and so here you

00:56:53.249 --> 00:56:53.259
old buildings around it and so here you
 

00:56:53.259 --> 00:56:55.829
old buildings around it and so here you
see and it was also it was a way a

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839
see and it was also it was a way a
 

00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:58.469
see and it was also it was a way a
struggle to see how big such space or

00:56:58.469 --> 00:56:58.479
struggle to see how big such space or
 

00:56:58.479 --> 00:57:01.339
struggle to see how big such space or
such hole needs to lead student and be

00:57:01.339 --> 00:57:01.349
such hole needs to lead student and be
 

00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:05.789
such hole needs to lead student and be
so this is the overall organization what

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799
so this is the overall organization what
 

00:57:05.799 --> 00:57:09.239
so this is the overall organization what

of the way we opened it up by making the

00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:14.679
of the way we opened it up by making the
 

00:57:14.679 --> 00:57:19.709
of the way we opened it up by making the
entire perimeter permeable and then the

00:57:19.709 --> 00:57:19.719
entire perimeter permeable and then the
 

00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:21.769
entire perimeter permeable and then the
the hole itself is actually quite

00:57:21.769 --> 00:57:21.779
the hole itself is actually quite
 

00:57:21.779 --> 00:57:23.729
the hole itself is actually quite
straightforward in a sense that you have

00:57:23.729 --> 00:57:23.739
straightforward in a sense that you have
 

00:57:23.739 --> 00:57:25.439
straightforward in a sense that you have
the Conn circle which needs to be

00:57:25.439 --> 00:57:25.449
the Conn circle which needs to be
 

00:57:25.449 --> 00:57:28.979
the Conn circle which needs to be
enclosed acoustically sealed space and

00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:28.989
enclosed acoustically sealed space and
 

00:57:28.989 --> 00:57:30.809
enclosed acoustically sealed space and
then you have the lobbies to fly A's and

00:57:30.809 --> 00:57:30.819
then you have the lobbies to fly A's and
 

00:57:30.819 --> 00:57:33.299
then you have the lobbies to fly A's and
that can happen between this interior

00:57:33.299 --> 00:57:33.309
that can happen between this interior
 

00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:37.319
that can happen between this interior
skin and as exterior skin and then

00:57:37.319 --> 00:57:37.329
skin and as exterior skin and then
 

00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:41.279
skin and as exterior skin and then
there's a much rehearsal post orchestra

00:57:41.279 --> 00:57:41.289
there's a much rehearsal post orchestra
 

00:57:41.289 --> 00:57:44.549
there's a much rehearsal post orchestra
rehearsal hall underneath which can be

00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559
rehearsal hall underneath which can be
 

00:57:44.559 --> 00:57:48.689
rehearsal hall underneath which can be
visible from the from the lobby and then

00:57:48.689 --> 00:57:48.699
visible from the from the lobby and then
 

00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:50.489
visible from the from the lobby and then
there's a second movie where people with

there's a second movie where people with
 

00:57:50.499 --> 00:57:51.989
there's a second movie where people with
tickets go and then they sort of move up

00:57:51.989 --> 00:57:51.999
tickets go and then they sort of move up
 

00:57:51.999 --> 00:57:54.719

two staircases in between this shell

00:57:54.719 --> 00:57:54.729
two staircases in between this shell
 

00:57:54.729 --> 00:57:56.639
two staircases in between this shell
actually between the inner wall of the

up and then for the hole itself it was

00:58:12.779 --> 00:58:12.789
up and then for the hole itself it was
 

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:14.160

sort of a shift from listening to seeing
people like more dramatic holes where

00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:46.089
people like more dramatic holes where
 

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:48.089
people like more dramatic holes where
the sound is actually less great than

than this vineyard type setting and we

00:59:00.599 --> 00:59:00.609
than this vineyard type setting and we
 

00:59:00.609 --> 00:59:02.789
than this vineyard type setting and we
and it means that there's a news of

00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799
and it means that there's a news of

00:59:04.289 --> 00:59:04.299
architectural project within the design
 

00:59:04.299 --> 00:59:06.450
architectural project within the design
of that of the way people are organized

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:06.460
of that of the way people are organized
 

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:10.079
of that of the way people are organized
within that space and so the vineyard is

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:10.089
within that space and so the vineyard is
 

00:59:10.089 --> 00:59:17.489
within that space and so the vineyard is
a very dramatic visual the rich type and

00:59:17.489 --> 00:59:17.499
a very dramatic visual the rich type and
 

00:59:17.499 --> 00:59:19.890
a very dramatic visual the rich type and
so we were we went in search for an

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:19.900
so we were we went in search for an
 

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.950
so we were we went in search for an
image that could that we could use in a

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960
image that could that we could use in a
 

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.900
image that could that we could use in a
way to work two words or basically as a

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:24.910
way to work two words or basically as a
 

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:27.660
way to work two words or basically as a
sort of inspiration this is a Cheshire

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:27.670
sort of inspiration this is a Cheshire
 

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:29.789
sort of inspiration this is a Cheshire
drawing obviously the mathematician who

00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799
drawing obviously the mathematician who
 

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:34.859
drawing obviously the mathematician who
made complicated and geometric drawings

00:59:34.859 --> 00:59:34.869
made complicated and geometric drawings
 

00:59:34.869 --> 00:59:37.710
made complicated and geometric drawings
and this became sort of a thing to chase

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720
and this became sort of a thing to chase
 

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.660
and this became sort of a thing to chase
with in this design and what was nice is

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:39.670
with in this design and what was nice is
 

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:41.549
with in this design and what was nice is
that so here really the dialogue between

00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559
that so here really the dialogue between
 

00:59:41.559 --> 00:59:44.910
that so here really the dialogue between
Arab and us was very it was a very

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920
Arab and us was very it was a very
 

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.069
Arab and us was very it was a very
collaborative and actually back and

00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079
collaborative and actually back and
 

00:59:47.079 --> 00:59:48.870
collaborative and actually back and
forth type of method so we had to come

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880
forth type of method so we had to come
 

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.339
forth type of method so we had to come
up with it with a way of working in

00:59:50.339 --> 00:59:50.349
up with it with a way of working in
 

00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:52.410
up with it with a way of working in
which we could refine at the acoustics

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:52.420
which we could refine at the acoustics
 

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.910
which we could refine at the acoustics
at the same time get this architectural

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920
at the same time get this architectural
 

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.720
at the same time get this architectural
idea in there and the idea of this say

00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:57.730
idea in there and the idea of this say
 

00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:01.380
idea in there and the idea of this say
asurion comb straight was post the idea

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:01.390
asurion comb straight was post the idea
 

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.269
asurion comb straight was post the idea
of making to the scaffold like a network

01:00:03.269 --> 01:00:03.279
of making to the scaffold like a network
 

01:00:03.279 --> 01:00:06.150
of making to the scaffold like a network
that would sit loose as a as an

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160
that would sit loose as a as an
 

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.799
that would sit loose as a as an
individual structure within this

01:00:07.799 --> 01:00:07.809
individual structure within this
 

01:00:07.809 --> 01:00:10.859
individual structure within this
acoustical the shell so you have an

01:00:10.859 --> 01:00:10.869
acoustical the shell so you have an
 

01:00:10.869 --> 01:00:12.359
acoustical the shell so you have an
acoustic shell and then within that this

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:12.369
acoustic shell and then within that this
 

01:00:12.369 --> 01:00:15.170
acoustic shell and then within that this
stuff is really open

01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180
stuff is really open
 

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.260
stuff is really open
and lace like more like mesh likes of

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:20.270
and lace like more like mesh likes of
 

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:23.750
and lace like more like mesh likes of
independent structure where people would

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760
independent structure where people would
 

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.280
independent structure where people would
sit and it would allow for daylight even

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:25.290
sit and it would allow for daylight even
 

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:29.120
sit and it would allow for daylight even
to come in behind the seats and people

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.130
to come in behind the seats and people
 

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:30.829
to come in behind the seats and people
to circulate behind the seat so we

01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839
to circulate behind the seat so we
 

01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:33.980
to circulate behind the seat so we
developed this concept which is the

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:33.990
developed this concept which is the
 

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:37.069
developed this concept which is the
variable volume where the acoustics of

01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079
variable volume where the acoustics of
 

01:00:37.079 --> 01:00:39.440
variable volume where the acoustics of
the hall can actually dramatically

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:39.450
the hall can actually dramatically
 

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.260
the hall can actually dramatically
change depending on the volume that is

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:42.270
change depending on the volume that is
 

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:44.569
change depending on the volume that is
made available so this inner seating

01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579
made available so this inner seating
 

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:46.880
made available so this inner seating
structure could be closed off and such

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:46.890
structure could be closed off and such
 

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:48.760
structure could be closed off and such
that the volume of the hall could be

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:48.770
that the volume of the hall could be
 

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.079
that the volume of the hall could be
closed which gives you a different

01:00:51.079 --> 01:00:51.089
closed which gives you a different
 

01:00:51.089 --> 01:00:52.849
closed which gives you a different
reverberation time and then the entire

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859
reverberation time and then the entire
 

01:00:52.859 --> 01:00:56.660
reverberation time and then the entire
space can open up for larger orchestras

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:56.670
space can open up for larger orchestras
 

01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:59.329
space can open up for larger orchestras
and so at the other part list of the

01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339
and so at the other part list of the
 

01:00:59.339 --> 01:01:03.589
and so at the other part list of the
acoustical Paul where the the sights of

01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599
acoustical Paul where the the sights of
 

01:01:03.599 --> 01:01:07.700
acoustical Paul where the the sights of
the walls behind the seeding reflect the

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:07.710
the walls behind the seeding reflect the
 

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.190
the walls behind the seeding reflect the
sound back so these were given by arup

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200
sound back so these were given by arup
 

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.270
sound back so these were given by arup
and we worked with them very very near

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280
and we worked with them very very near
 

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.910
and we worked with them very very near
we also didn't copy the movie this is

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920
we also didn't copy the movie this is
 

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.240
we also didn't copy the movie this is
also a movie which shows basically a

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:19.250
also a movie which shows basically a
 

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:22.190
also a movie which shows basically a
parametric model that we came up with

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200
parametric model that we came up with
 

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.750
parametric model that we came up with
which allows which allowed us to

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760
which allows which allowed us to
 

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.180
which allows which allowed us to
continuously refine the shape of the

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:26.190
continuously refine the shape of the
 

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:28.099
continuously refine the shape of the
room and change it while sticking to the

01:01:28.099 --> 01:01:28.109
room and change it while sticking to the
 

01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:30.770
room and change it while sticking to the
parameters that were Kevin and by arup

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780
parameters that were Kevin and by arup
 

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.180
parameters that were Kevin and by arup
and so actually we only have to fix the

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:32.190
and so actually we only have to fix the
 

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.660
and so actually we only have to fix the
room and so the last minute but at the

that of that lattice structure that will
 

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.770
that of that lattice structure that will
be inserted in the acoustical shell and

be inserted in the acoustical shell and
 

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:53.450
be inserted in the acoustical shell and
hear some imagery that will look

between adjacent to the library and
 

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:42.050
between adjacent to the library and
that's in the glass volume sort of the

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:42.060
that's in the glass volume sort of the
 

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.100
that's in the glass volume sort of the
void that that I mentioned earlier this

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:46.110
void that that I mentioned earlier this
 

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:48.200

that's also a void which is a glass
volume so this can only be done if you

01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480
volume so this can only be done if you
 

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.850
volume so this can only be done if you
have a lot of force around you and so

01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:01.860
have a lot of force around you and so
 

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.009
have a lot of force around you and so
this is a
