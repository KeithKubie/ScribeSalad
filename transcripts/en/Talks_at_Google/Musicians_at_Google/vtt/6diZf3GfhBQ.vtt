00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.390
KATE MACEVICZ: All right.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.640
Hey, guys.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.586
I'm Kate with Google.

00:00:04.586 --> 00:00:06.005
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.990
I'm very pleased to announce
that we have a special guest,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.155
Stephen Pearcy.

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:13.890
Let's give it up for him right
here because Stephen's here to

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.560
promote his book, "Sex, Drugs,
Ratt &amp; Roll: My Life in Rock."

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.190
It's a great book.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.900
Stephen's the lead singer and
front man in the band Ratt.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.140
Ratt has 10 gold and platinum
records, I think sold over 20

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.700
million records worldwide, and
he's played in thousands of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.535
shows all over the globe.

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:34.720
STEPHEN PEARCY: Too many.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.220
KATE MACEVICZ: Too many
says Stephen Pearcy.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.110
Let's do another round here.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.235
All right.

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:44.576
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, I'm
glad I wore these.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:46.470
KATE MACEVICZ: Looking good.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.980
So "Sex, Drugs, Ratt &amp; Roll,"
how come you decided

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.230
to write the book?

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.300
STEPHEN PEARCY: I actually
wanted to start it

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.530
five, six years ago.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.900
And there wasn't closure in a
lot of things having to do

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.400
with business and stuff.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.240
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.740
STEPHEN PEARCY: And then my
wonderful drummer, he came out

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.720
with something, and I actually
wanted to title this book

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.260
"Ratt Tails," and then he
ripped off my title.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.521
So I think it's time
to write my book.

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.360
KATE MACEVICZ: Sweet.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.720
Your definitely fits it.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.060
So what was it like
writing the book?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.970
Did you revisit a lot of your
old friends and whatnot?

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.622
Any surprises come
up during it?

00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:33.350
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.400
Because I didn't remember like
a good three years of that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.690
'80s period.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.030
KATE MACEVICZ: Did you remember
any surprises--

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.200
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.015
I didn't, actually.

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:44.020
Yeah, I did remember
some surprises.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.020
I had to go back to some of my
concierge and security guys

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.640
who are still my really close
friends and kept me somewhat

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.182
grounded back then.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:55.966
KATE MACEVICZ: Cool.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.470
STEPHEN PEARCY: Like I had to
go back to them and say, do

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.820
you remember some of this?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.470
Because I don't.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.930
And they told me, yeah.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.390
KATE MACEVICZ: That's
about right.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.756
STEPHEN PEARCY: They refreshed
my memory.

00:02:06.756 --> 00:02:08.229
KATE MACEVICZ: So in the book,
you talked about your

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.775
childhood in San Diego.

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:13.330
How did you evolve from just
being a normal kid to being

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.835
totally into music and in
a band and whatnot?

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.300
STEPHEN PEARCY: I don't think
I was ever a normal kid.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.190
KATE MACEVICZ: OK.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.460
And how did you get
into music?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.230
STEPHEN PEARCY: We moved
to San Diego.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:34.300
My mom actually got remarried
and moved to San Diego in 1971

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.710
or something.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.200
And I was off touring with
a race car team.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.680
I was a pit guy wanting to be
like a drag race driver.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.030
And she goes, well, when you
come back from Indianapolis,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.710
which was where I was, we're
going to be living here.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.900
And I went, OK.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.740
And I was just plopped
in San Diego.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.480
I just went, oh.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.410
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah, I can
think the worst places.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.290
STEPHEN PEARCY: It was
worse or for a while.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.070
And what was the following
question?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.780
How did I get into music?

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.910
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.603
STEPHEN PEARCY: All right.

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:09.890
Well, I'm living in San Diego
hanging around with all these

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.180
hippy, pothead kids, which was
no different from the LA

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.760
pothead kids except we were
probably tougher.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.830
But I got in an accident, and
I got run over, and broke my

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.390
legs and stuff.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.160
And then I was told that you're
barely going to walk

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.310
let alone race cars.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.250
And so I was in the hospital for
like a good six months in

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.340
traction and stuff.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.140
And later on in the stay,
somebody gave

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.040
me an acoustic guitar.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.150
And I go, OK.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.670
Acoustic guitar, what
do I do with this?

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.920
So I pretty much just
kind of taught

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.860
myself how to play guitar.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.505
KATE MACEVICZ: Wow, while
you were laid up--

00:03:56.505 --> 00:03:56.633
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:57.195
KATE MACEVICZ: --in
the hospital?

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:57.500
Wow.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.980
STEPHEN PEARCY: And then when I
got out, I just kept playing

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.340
and playing and kind of adapted
to it and actually

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.600
started doing the band thing.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.530
And that started this snowball
effect of like,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.890
this is kind of cool.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.089
I can party, get laid,
and whatever--

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.740
KATE MACEVICZ: Everyone
favorite thing.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.660
STEPHEN PEARCY: --play music,
and it was all cool.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.450
KATE MACEVICZ: Awesome.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.155
So let's talk about
Sunset Strip.

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:27.320
So do you have any crazy stories
from back in the day?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.160
What was it like?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.920
STEPHEN PEARCY: Oh, god.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.890
Well, first of all, I got to
say this book is kind of

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.680
trippy In a way that there's a
bit of embellishment in a good

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.820
way and then in a bad way
because all I wanted to do was

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.440
tell stories.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.130
But as far as the Strip, it
would take 10 books to even

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.610
get close to what I would
actually would like to say to

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.380
anybody who wanted to know
anything because I'm really a

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.350
private person.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.960
So for me to do this was kind of
like, you know, I was like

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.190
actually eating a lot of
marijuana pops doing it.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.900
But it was interesting, but
it would take 10 books.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.620
But anyway, the Strip, yeah,
it was interesting because

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.850
when I moved here, I told my
band Mickey Ratt, that I'm

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.730
moving to LA in January
1, 1980.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.750
Because that's where Van Halen
made it, and they had become

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.270
my friends actually before they
got signed in like 1977

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.890
or something.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.300
I'd go back and forth from San
Diego to LA, and I met them.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.060
A friend of mine said, you
have to meet them,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.100
or go see this band.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.550
They play Zeppelin
really good.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.330
And I'm like, OK.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.970
So I missed them at Gazzarri's
and then they said, they're

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.970
playing at the Whisky.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.080
And one day I just went up by
myself, and I go, well, bands

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.560
go to gigs early, so I'm
going to go up there

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.270
early, and I did.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.660
And I saw David Lee Roth walking
up the steps at the

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.700
Whisky, and I say, hey, you
want to smoke a joint?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.060
And he said, yeah.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.905
I went like, OK.

00:06:08.905 --> 00:06:09.280
I'm in.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280
KATE MACEVICZ: Sweet.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.820
STEPHEN PEARCY: I didn't
want to meet him.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.340
I wanted to meet Ed Van Halen,
because I was a guitar player.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.980
And I did.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.400
KATE MACEVICZ: And you developed
a nice friendship

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.160
with him, if I recall.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.580
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.750
It lasted for quite a while.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.190
KATE MACEVICZ: Oh, nice.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.480
STEPHEN PEARCY: But
that was it.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.560
I moved up there, and that was
the place to be, and I used to

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.330
watch them on stage at
the Whisky and just

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.180
went, oh, my god.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.295
This is crazy.

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:37.260
These guys are really good.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.810
This is our competition, our
real competition if you want

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.430
to be in a band.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.340
And nobody was getting
signed in San Diego.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.930
I mean, we were playing huge
gigs, and then we moved to LA.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.290
We had to start all over
to where we were

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.680
paid $100 to not play.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.670
It was like, here's your $100.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.640
Go home.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.570
I'm like, OK.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.640
KATE MACEVICZ: Well, you
certainly turned that around.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.676
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:01.380
Seriously.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.355
KATE MACEVICZ: So do you go
to the Strip these days?

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:04.280
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.330
I take my daughter there
to see some bands, so

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.790
how ironic is that?

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.700
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.152
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:13.150
KATE MACEVICZ: What were your
favorite spots back in the day

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.050
then on the Strip besides
the Whisky?

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.210
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, we played
pretty much everywhere.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.660
But in the early days, you'd
have to go to the Rainbow

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.110
because that's where everybody
kind of met, and you would

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.140
say, I'm in a band, you know?

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.152
Here I am at the Rainbow.

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:34.830
KATE MACEVICZ: It hasn't
changed at all.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.510
STEPHEN PEARCY: I had
no special place.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.270
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah?

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.980
STEPHEN PEARCY: The Rainbow
hasn't changed, but I haven't

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.180
been there in quite a while.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.645
I think the last time I was
there someone got into a fight

00:07:41.645 --> 00:07:43.110
or something.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.570
So I would stay away
from there.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.450
KATE MACEVICZ: So you mentioned
that Van Halen

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.430
inspired you.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.426
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:50.570
KATE MACEVICZ: So do
you keep in touch

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.930
with Eddie these days?

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.000
I read something about
he used to hide booze

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.435
at your house and--

00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:56.200
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah, well--

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.930
KATE MACEVICZ: --kind
of collect it.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.640
STEPHEN PEARCY: --he lived
up the street from me.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.730
And he was, I guess you know,
couldn't get away with some

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.560
things at his house.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.620
So he'd just come to my house,
which is down the street

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.460
little a little bit, quarter
of a mile and hang out and

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.130
stash his booze there, or
he'd come over and it

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.510
would all be there.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.990
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.590
STEPHEN PEARCY: It
was all good.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.480
KATE MACEVICZ: Good to know.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.800
STEPHEN PEARCY: I mean,
everybody used to come by

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.036
there from, I don't
know, everybody

00:08:26.036 --> 00:08:27.590
used to stopped there.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.786
It was no big deal.

00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:31.100
KATE MACEVICZ: Just checking.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.739
So looks like we need to loosen
this up a little bit.

00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:34.950
STEPHEN PEARCY: I'm loose.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.500
KATE MACEVICZ: You're loose?

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.725
OK. just making sure.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:37.559
STEPHEN PEARCY: I'm
loosely tight.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.840
KATE MACEVICZ: This is
so structured here.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.650
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.580
I'm ready to go.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.540
I got up at 5:30.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.140
I get up at 5:30 every day.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.470
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah?

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:43.886
STEPHEN PEARCY: Believe
it or not.

00:08:43.886 --> 00:08:45.400
KATE MACEVICZ: Do you like
exercise and stuff?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.170
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.900
I just do dad chores
and what dads do.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.750
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.990
Right on.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.700
So you went to the Strip, and
you guys started playing more

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.370
and more big.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.750
And the momentum was built up,
so at what moment did you like

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.550
sit back, and you knew
that you made it?

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.620
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, pretty
much when our EP, we had a

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.320
six-song EP back in the day.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.520
was being played on KEMT
and KOS simultaneously.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.500
And then our biggest gig, like I
told you out there was Santa

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.670
Monica Civic right down the
street or a bit or something.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.220
And we knew we were doing
something good.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.210
You know you start selling out
clubs, and they try to screw

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.340
you out of money,
and whatever.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.424
But you knew you were doing
something right.

00:09:37.424 --> 00:09:39.160
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.600
And so tell us about the Ratt
house in Culver City.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.870
I'm a Culver City
resident myself.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.280
STEPHEN PEARCY: The
Ratt Mansion West.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.520
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.470
What was that like?

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.360
STEPHEN PEARCY: Sounds like
a mansion but it wasn't.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.360
It was a one-bedroom apartment
that I had.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.830
KATE MACEVICZ: So is mine.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:52.950
I hope I'm not a--

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.580
STEPHEN PEARCY: Robin and I and
Warren lived there with

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.770
our two crew guys, and
we had a one bedroom.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:04.390
And there were three beds set up
in one room, two cots and a

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.100
single bed.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.720
I don't know if we were
ever there at one

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.600
time together, but--

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.060
and our gear.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.490
And we'd have these great
parties after shows.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.270
It's like Motley would have
their place near the Whisky,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.870
and it was the same
kind of thing.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.710
You play a gig, and you just
tell everybody, come to the

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.510
house after to the party, or
wherever, to the apartment,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.950
and you'd have about 150
people at your place.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.540
And it was kind of cool
because I had this

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.240
refrigerator, this really old,
small refrigerator at Ratt

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.570
Mansion West.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.530
And everybody who came into the
place signed it inside and

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:48.730
out of it, like you would
have Roth, or

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.430
Blackie, or Dio, or whoever.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.680
But it was signed, and to this
day, I wish I had that

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.180
refrigerator.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.620
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah, a piece
of history right there.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.580
STEPHEN PEARCY: Oh, yes.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.190
It would be in the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.382
KATE MACEVICZ: Did women
sign it too, or was

00:10:59.382 --> 00:10:59.790
it just rock stars?

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.045
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:01.070
Everybody signed it.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.796
No, everybody.

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:03.410
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.670
You can all start fresh
with your fridge now.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.902
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:11:06.902 --> 00:11:08.290
KATE MACEVICZ: No?

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.555
STEPHEN PEARCY: It's one of
those goofy big things.

00:11:10.555 --> 00:11:12.850
KATE MACEVICZ: So you talk a lot
about excess in the book.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.500
So amazing stories of women,
wild nights, debauchery, all

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.510
the fun stuff.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.300
So Ratt is on tour right now.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.536
So is it still as crazy?

00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:23.816
STEPHEN PEARCY: If you
want it to be.

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.260
KATE MACEVICZ: So that kind of
means a yes right there, I

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.328
think, huh?

00:11:28.328 --> 00:11:29.100
STEPHEN PEARCY: Sure.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.330
If you want it to
be, it's there.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.055
Nothing's changed.

00:11:31.055 --> 00:11:33.150
KATE MACEVICZ: What are the
fans like these days?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.580
STEPHEN PEARCY: The same.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.860
KATE MACEVICZ: Really?

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.110
Like same women, or--

00:11:39.805 --> 00:11:40.680
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.750
Believe it or not, yeah.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.300
Some of the women are
still the same if

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.010
you call them women.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.320
Me?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.080
I tend to take myself
out of that system.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.620
KATE MACEVICZ: OK.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.950
STEPHEN PEARCY: I'll hang out,
but I don't go there.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.990
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:03.480
So speaking of touring, do you
have any favorites spots,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.860
cities that you always have a
lot more fun in and whatnot?

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.060
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.430
Anywhere there's people having
a good time, I'd be happy to

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.300
be there and yell at you.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.620
KATE MACEVICZ: OK.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.150
And speaking of women just
back in the day,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.050
you say it was all--

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.571
any favorite cities in
the women sense?

00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:22.580
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.180
Because you could be in
the middle of bum

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.670
fuck and be very surprised.

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:31.730
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.740
STEPHEN PEARCY: You have your
standards, Florida, New York,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.353
LA, whatever.

00:12:35.353 --> 00:12:36.040
I don't know.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.310
It's all the same.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.090
Look, you know--

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.010
KATE MACEVICZ: You fancy
the more down hill.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.634
STEPHEN PEARCY: --it's
like feeding a bird.

00:12:42.634 --> 00:12:44.610
KATE MACEVICZ: All right.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.570
So what are the band member
dynamics like right now?

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.320
You guys have been through
so much together.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.480
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.930
Well, we kind of still
love/hate each other.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.970
But we're grown ups,
and we get along.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.350
We're doing good business or
I wouldn't be involved.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.750
And as we get along, we've
been rehearsing the last

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.500
couple days because we have
a show coming up tomorrow.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.090
And our biggest problem
is picking songs.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.645
That's about it.

00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:15.460
KATE MACEVICZ: OK.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.440
So fashion.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.900
So you're known for
your style.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.716
I believe your name was
the cement pirate.

00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:22.765
Can you just describe--

00:13:22.765 --> 00:13:23.650
STEPHEN PEARCY: That's
not my name.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.420
That's what we just
called ourselves.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.985
KATE MACEVICZ: Can you describe
your style back then

00:13:27.985 --> 00:13:30.530
and then how it's evolved?

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:36.060
It's called, I can't afford
it, so where do

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.880
we go to get it?

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.140
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.140
I would actually have some girls
who were friends, and

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.720
they would work at some high-end
stores on Melrose and

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.310
stuff and lend me clothes until
we figured out this

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:56.610
image that became the cement
pirate look that started it,

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.670
the '84, '87 kind of look.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.870
But it's kind of like it's
just a grab bag.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.360
I mean, put it this way, I mean,
I say it in the book,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.840
and I don't know if people would
get it, but I liked Adam

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.320
Ant and Duran Duran, so I kind
of took them both and went--

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.360
KATE MACEVICZ: Made a baby?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.266
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:14:18.266 --> 00:14:19.740
And that was us.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.880
KATE MACEVICZ: Cool.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.540
And where do you shop
these days?

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.800
STEPHEN PEARCY: Salvation
Army.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.495
KATE MACEVICZ: OK.

00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:25.325
All right.

00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:26.192
STEPHEN PEARCY: Where
I got this great

00:14:26.192 --> 00:14:27.900
jacket and pants, actually.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.920
No.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.210
Anywhere.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.020
KATE MACEVICZ: Anywhere.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.220
Sweet.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.380
So fatherhood.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.480
So your book actually opens
with the birth of your

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.730
daughter, and it sounded
like you were a

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.960
bit high at the time.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.900
But the event was
life changing.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.300
So how has fatherhood
shaped you?

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.930
STEPHEN PEARCY: It's perfect.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.020
She's 17.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.150
Just got a new car.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.030
And she wants to go to
college, and I'm

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.940
bringing her up right.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.500
It's cool.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.060
KATE MACEVICZ: Oh,
that's fantastic.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.720
STEPHEN PEARCY: She's a
good girl except she

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.705
likes the band guys.

00:14:55.705 --> 00:14:57.020
KATE MACEVICZ: She likes
the bad guys?

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.397
STEPHEN PEARCY: The band guys,

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.170
KATE MACEVICZ: Oh,
the band guys.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.510
So she's up there.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.565
STEPHEN PEARCY: So payback's
a bitch.

00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:03.190
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.460
STEPHEN PEARCY: She's good.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.340
KATE MACEVICZ: So she's a rocker
then a little bit?

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:06.400
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.885
KATE MACEVICZ: No.

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:08.940
STEPHEN PEARCY: She
just likes music.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.640
KATE MACEVICZ: OK.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.990
All right.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.060
Fair enough.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.098
And what can we look forward
to in the future with you?

00:15:17.098 --> 00:15:19.580
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well,
we're doing shows.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.830
I actually want to cut back on
doing live performances and

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.960
concentrate on other business
ventures and my race car stuff

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.410
and other things I've done
and created some shows.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.300
But we'll be playing.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.460
I mean, I actually do a
bunch of solo shows.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.310
But I just go out when
I want to go out

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.070
and have a good time.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.370
I don't have to go
out to go out.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.960
And we don't have to go play
250 shows a year anymore.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.660
KATE MACEVICZ: Yeah.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.370
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.300
KATE MACEVICZ: So what's up
with the racing that you

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.837
talked about?

00:15:53.837 --> 00:15:54.240
What are you doing with that?

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.580
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, I
sponsor raise cars.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:02.550
Been doing it since early '80s,
and I sponsor top fuel

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.090
dragsters and funny cars.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.460
And I'm still in the business.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:11.656
I write songs for ESPN2
and HRA drag racing.

00:16:11.656 --> 00:16:13.180
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.010
STEPHEN PEARCY: I'm
in there one way.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.300
I'll be on the track.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:17.995
Go to a race.

00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:18.490
I'll be there.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.495
KATE MACEVICZ: All right.

00:16:19.495 --> 00:16:20.250
Do you hear that, ladies?

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.455
STEPHEN PEARCY: On the
starting line.

00:16:22.455 --> 00:16:24.120
KATE MACEVICZ: Awesome.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.850
And I hear you're also working
on a new record for Ratt, and

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.620
its back with Atlantic.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.090
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yes.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.230
KATE MACEVICZ: So kind
of full circle there.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.600
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah,
we are back.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.910
It's Roadrunner is back
with Atlantic.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.390
It's good.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.640
We're getting there.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.700
Getting us in there
is one thing.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.672
Hopefully, it won't take 10
years like the other one.

00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:48.490
But there's some good songs,
really good songs.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.420
You know, Warren and I are
writing, and he played me

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.690
something not too long ago.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.470
And I actually told him, if we
can just releases this one

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.790
song, we're done.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.630
It was that good.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.976
So I'm very happy.

00:17:02.976 --> 00:17:03.620
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.530
STEPHEN PEARCY: You
know soon enough.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.079
We want it released by April,
May of next year.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.170
KATE MACEVICZ: OK.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.109
Great.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.910
Well, at this time, I'd like
to turn it over to the

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.260
audience to ask some
questions.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.099
Do you want to step up to
the mic, my friend?

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:25.210
That way we can get a good
shot of you up and close.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.160
AUDIENCE: So as you were growing
up, who were some of

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.910
your most powerful inspirational
musical

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.020
influences?

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.910
Growing up meaning after you've
got the guitar and

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.735
started to see--

00:17:37.735 --> 00:17:38.990
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:45.930
I really liked Blue Oyster
Cult, Black Sabbath,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.040
definitely, I was heavily
influenced by Led Zeppelin and

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.740
actually got to see them three
times, and it was like the

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.160
most mind-expanding
experience.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.010
The acid that I ate couldn't
even match when I

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.260
was watching them.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.790
And then Van Halen when I
saw them in '77, '78.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:18.140
But Led Zeppelin, Blue Oyster
Cult, those kind of bands

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.340
influenced me a lot.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:19.805
Hello.

00:18:19.805 --> 00:18:23.140
AUDIENCE: How do you even have
the memory to write a book?

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.570
I can't remember anything
from my college days.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.230
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, I
remember quite a bit.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.860
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.540
STEPHEN PEARCY: But like I said,
there were a few years

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.540
that I couldn't remember
because we literally

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.980
were just so busy.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.140
I mean, the one thing that kind
of put the first nail in

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.690
the coffin was we did
this for so long.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:49.990
We just did tour, record, tour,
record, tour, record,

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:51.330
but we were doing arenas.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:57.550
And it was like you didn't
know what day it was.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:58.270
Where are we?

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.300
Well, you're still in Texas
two weeks later.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.020
Where are we?

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.520
Florida.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.510
How long have we been here?

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.460
Two weeks.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.350
But those days are over.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.190
AUDIENCE: But to even like bring
that all up and have

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.464
enough information
to write a book--

00:19:11.464 --> 00:19:13.515
I mean, to try and remember
stuff from

00:19:13.515 --> 00:19:13.900
college and I don't.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.190
STEPHEN PEARCY: I had to
call some friends.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:18.412 --> 00:19:19.700
STEPHEN PEARCY: What
did we do?

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.200
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.580
KATE MACEVICZ: So we have a
stairwell in the office that's

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.395
devoted to Ratt--

00:19:25.395 --> 00:19:25.730
STEPHEN PEARCY: Nice.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.715
KATE MACEVICZ: --that I want
to take you and show you.

00:19:28.715 --> 00:19:32.100
You guys are famous.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.740
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about how did you get Milton

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.560
Berle to be in your video?

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.980
STEPHEN PEARCY: Good one.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.930
Our manager was his nephew,
Marshall Berle.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.950
And Milty did the first video,
"Round and Round," and nobody

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.850
quite got it then.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.390
They kind of get it now.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.800
But he was such a clever,
smart guy.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.810
When he did that video with us,
he kind of just went in

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.670
there and took over.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:02.230
Do you know, Don Letts
was the director.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.100
He used to be in Big Audio
Dynamite, if anybody remembers

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.510
that name, long, dreaded guy.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.610
And he kind of just threw his
hands up and went, OK.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.240
And Milty just took over.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.400
And he always told
us, keep things--

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.810
don't be so serious.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.780
Keep things tongue in cheek,
and make it fun.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.710
And we always tried
to do that.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.936
Yeah, he was a good
guy, Milty.

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:31.290
AUDIENCE: If you could do it
all over again, what, if

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.342
anything, would you change?

00:20:33.342 --> 00:20:35.430
STEPHEN PEARCY: Business.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.820
Some business stuff,
that's about it.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.490
But I would do the
same thing again.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.740
I have no--

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.512
it is what it was.

00:20:46.512 --> 00:20:49.310
You couldn't do that now.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.950
I feel sorry for the new bands
because they'd be lucky to

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:59.660
hang around a year let alone
be able to accomplish or do

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.640
what we did like the
Motleys, and the

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.590
Ratts, and the whatever.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:08.880
That was such a crazy period,
and it was all new.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.170
Nobody knew what was going on.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.316
We just created this
thing, you know?

00:21:13.316 --> 00:21:17.440
And just went with it because
of the excess.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.126
Threw a little success
in there.

00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:21.100
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.300
AUDIENCE: Do you mind if
I add to that question?

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:24.710
KATE MACEVICZ: Go for it.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.114
AUDIENCE: When you talk about
the business part and certain

00:21:28.114 --> 00:21:31.370
things you would differently
if you were in a band.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.180
I guess there are a lot of
different voices about how

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.740
that handled some of the
business stuff or was it just

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.046
the management telling y'all
what to do and how to do it?

00:21:41.046 --> 00:21:41.970
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.210
We were cool for a while,
but I would have done it

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.490
differently.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.930
Because I did so much of
a lot of things by

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.490
myself for the band.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.210
But I was one of those guys,
all for one, one for all.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.480
It wouldn't happen these days.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.082
No way in hell, but we're OK.

00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:09.150
AUDIENCE: So the second word
in the title is drugs.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.150
How important or helpful do
you think drugs are in the

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.655
creative process of writing
songs and recording?

00:22:16.655 --> 00:22:18.030
STEPHEN PEARCY: Drugs.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.290
Well--

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.020
AUDIENCE: Were they helpful
or damaging?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.040
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, I can't
say they were helpful because

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.990
we lost Robin to drugs.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.070
And we all did a lot
of everything

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.520
just because we could.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.696
Maybe it was the time.

00:22:35.696 --> 00:22:39.400
But I did a lot of drugs before
I was even in a band,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.960
so to me, it was just like, OK,
now we get it for free and

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.030
a lot of it.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.330
So you just go, OK.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:54.250
And whatever your
metabolism is--

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.700
So I don't suggest that
people do drugs to

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.760
write music or do anything.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.971
It would probably hurt you.

00:23:02.971 --> 00:23:04.980
AUDIENCE: I mean, I'm more
specific about--

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.410
I mean, I understand that drugs
can help you have a good

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.580
time, and if you're on road
and playing gigs.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.650
But what about when you actually
have to write, and be

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.880
creative, and sit down with the
guitar, come up with a new

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.460
song, get inspiration, and get
in the mood for writing.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.430
Do you think drugs
are helpful or--

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.680
STEPHEN PEARCY: They
could be helpful.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.470
They could be helpful.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.020
It depends on what kind
of dope you're taking.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.170
If it makes you pass out, it's
not going to be useful.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:37.522
AUDIENCE: Did you get loaded
for 650 shows in a year?

00:23:37.522 --> 00:23:39.440
Did you guys get loaded
for every show?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.320
STEPHEN PEARCY: Every day.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:40.720
AUDIENCE: Every day.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.810
KATE MACEVICZ: Wow.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.455
STEPHEN PEARCY: Before,
during, and after.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.570
Yep.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.095
KATE MACEVICZ: Not a bad life.

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:49.710
STEPHEN PEARCY: It
made a bad one.

00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:54.690
AUDIENCE: Do you have a favorite
song that you've

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.295
written or a song that
you're most proud of?

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:05.880
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, it would
be wrong for me to say that

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.830
"Round and Round" didn't
accomplish a lot because it

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.650
did, and it's such
a huge tune.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.670
It's like we sell that thing to
every few weeks to a movie

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.250
or something.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:22.160
But just the way we wrote that
song was crazy because we used

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.620
to write on two tape decks,
cassette decks.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.540
And we'd bounce one track one
to another until we had

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.035
everything on one cassette.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:41.330
But for me, I mean, I have an
extended catalog of solo stuff

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:48.700
that I find more exciting than
what I have to do every day

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.930
when I do Ratt.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:56.990
But I still love playing like
"Lay it Down," "Body Talk."

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.660
There's so many Ratt songs
that are so good.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.990
It's one thing we could do is
play, and we'd put ourselves

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.900
up against anybody just
because we know

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.300
we'd kick their ass.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.730
We still could.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.600
We still can in a good way.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.080
We love what we do.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.090
That's the only thing that
keeps this band together.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:24.736
Ratt is our music, otherwise
we'd hate each other.

00:25:24.736 --> 00:25:26.915
It's respect for our music.

00:25:26.915 --> 00:25:28.610
AUDIENCE: So you're
writing a book.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.920
You have your entire life
in front of you.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.610
How did you decide what you're
going to put in the book,

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.740
where to start, just
your process

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.780
of putting it together?

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:44.920
STEPHEN PEARCY: You know, I had
a good co-writer, and I

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:50.200
was reading Keith Richard's book
"Life," and I had read

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.510
Tyler's book.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.780
And I was like, if there's
something I can just put those

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.600
two together, then I think I
can actually write a book.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.380
But I wanted to be honest.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.460
I didn't want to bullshit
anybody.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:09.710
I mean, some names you know,
the end result is the main

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.200
editor, publisher, whatever you
want to call it kind of

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:18.400
made it into like this script,
dialogue, and he doesn't know

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.240
what we were saying.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.910
I don't remember, but it's kind
of cool how he did it in

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:23.750
retrospect.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:30.750
But I just wanted to tell some
stories and maybe the good,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.250
bad, or the ugly would influence
somebody, or they'd

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.990
get a kick out of it.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.030
And then some of the stuff I
don't remember, like the

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.190
Michael Jackson thing.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.860
I didn't remember that.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.355
But I just kind of
told stories.

00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:51.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.630
Were you approached by the
musical "Rock of Ages" to

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.130
include any of your
songs in that?

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.730
I don't remember any of
them being in it.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:00.420
STEPHEN PEARCY: No.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.390
But somebody told me
recently that they

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.455
played one of our songs.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:03.870
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.350
STEPHEN PEARCY: And we actually
have well, I'll let

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.910
them know now.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.060
There's a lawyer coming
after your ass.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.210
You don't play our song without
saying, you're not

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:21.840
playing it, especially that
one song, a good one.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.440
AUDIENCE: With the decline of
like CD sales and the amount

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.020
of money that musicians and
labels are making from CDs and

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.700
now downloads and the audience
shifting over to music

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.640
streaming, which is less,
definitely less lucrative CDs,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.730
what do you think is the future
of keeping the business

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.455
within music and sustaining
people's creative endeavors?

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.810
STEPHEN PEARCY: For established
bands who have an

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.990
extensive catalog like us or
something, it would be live

00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:00.660
performance or just making
sure your music's in the

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.540
marketplace.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.440
For new bands, I really
feel sorry for, but

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.250
then again I don't.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.730
Because some of these bands
that have made it recently

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.650
have made it from the
new format of music.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.760
You don't need a record deal.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.270
You just go on the internet,
and YouTube, something or

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.080
whatever, and next thing you
know you have a hit.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.580
That's cool too.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.140
I work with young bands
because I have

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.390
an independent label.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.230
So there are benefits, but for
us guys who have the catalog

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.700
and stuff, we just have to
watch what's happening.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.762
Make sure the thievery doesn't
happen like what's her name.

00:28:43.762 --> 00:28:47.420
AUDIENCE: It was Mick Jagger I
believe who famously said when

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.270
he was in his 20s that he'd
rather be dead than stand on

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:55.260
stage at age 40 and sing
"Satisfaction." And what are

00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:00.350
the biggest changes in like
view of the world of life

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.016
whatever can you talk about
from the old days to now?

00:29:04.016 --> 00:29:10.260
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, we could
party or can party like we

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.640
used to, but we don't.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.430
And we don't suggest it for
anybody who wants to have

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.835
longevity because it does
beat you up eventually.

00:29:23.354 --> 00:29:27.840
But I mean, I could play music
for as long as I feel like it

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.930
except nowadays I'm
preparing myself.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.220
I don't need to I just like
to do it sometimes.

00:29:38.446 --> 00:29:42.520
Me, I never said I was
a singer, and I'll

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.860
say it to this day.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.700
When I tell my kid I'm going a
show, I say, I've got to go

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.950
yell at some people.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.830
She knows exactly
what I'm saying.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.520
Do you want to go?

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.180
I'm going to go yell
at some people.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.010
Now there's 30,000 people there
or there's 1,500 people

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.450
there, or there's House of Blues
right down the street.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:10.690
I mean she's jaded,
but it depends.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.461
To each his own, you know?

00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:18.201
Everybody's different.

00:30:18.201 --> 00:30:19.370
I like doing it.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.830
I still like doing what I do.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.970
I still like meeting people, and
you see the smiling faces.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.310
And now there's so many
younger people

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.480
going to our shows.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.016
It's crazy.

00:30:30.016 --> 00:30:34.320
And if they're into it and I see
they're into it, it just

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.690
makes me want to hang around.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.945
AUDIENCE: What interesting
people have you met?

00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:41.520
STEPHEN PEARCY: Interesting?

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.760
Oh, god.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.990
Anybody from Charlton
Heston to Henry

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.900
Kissinger to Whoopi Goldberg.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.155
I mean, it's crazy.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.360
And I'll go right up to somebody
and just fuck with

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.210
them just to say hello.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.930
You know?

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:03.530
Hey, Chuck.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.350
You're not supposed to
be calling me Chuck.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.600
Charlton Heston.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.550
Or Henry Kissinger, I'm
surprised I didn't get shot

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.960
when I ran into him.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.900
I just ran right up to him with
a drink in my hand and

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.655
said, hey, what's
going on, Henry?

00:31:24.386 --> 00:31:26.560
KATE MACEVICZ: And you had some
fun with Ozzy, it sounded

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.685
like in the book as well.

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:28.870
STEPHEN PEARCY: Yeah, Ozzy.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.410
Uncle Ozzy.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:31.660
Yeah.

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:37.250
Ratt did an extensive tour
with Ozzy, Canada,

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.840
Europe, and the US.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.700
It was a time when oh, god,
they were just on his ass.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.310
And it was interesting.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.356
He's a good guy.

00:31:49.356 --> 00:31:51.910
KATE MACEVICZ: I heard you did
something to his shoes.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.750
STEPHEN PEARCY: He shit
in some shoes.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.840
KATE MACEVICZ: He did?

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.130
Oh, I thought that was you.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.480
STEPHEN PEARCY: Me and Bobby
hung out with him

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.750
really late one night.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:04.120
And he was staying at hotels
because his kids were like

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.310
babies then.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.070
And they lived out of the
bus or something.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.360
Matter of fact, it was Hollywood
somewhere, really

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.690
nice hotel.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.820
And you put your shoes out there
to get shined, you know.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.310
And he just thought it
would be a kick.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.130
I'm going to shit
in these shoes.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.620
And Bobby had a camera,
and he took pictures.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.270
And he was so eager to wake
Sharon up and go, I shit in

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:28.830
these shoes.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.520
I shit in these shoes.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.760
And we were just
like, oh, god.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.940
I left.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.596
Goes to show how crazy
that night was.

00:32:35.596 --> 00:32:37.370
I left right about 3:00
in the morning.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.860
Him and Bobby were still up
partying or something.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.185
But we got the photo.

00:32:42.185 --> 00:32:43.913
KATE MACEVICZ: Nice.

00:32:43.913 --> 00:32:47.342
STEPHEN PEARCY: Shit
in the shoes.

00:32:47.342 --> 00:32:50.120
AUDIENCE: Can you tell us a
little bit about maintaining

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.810
your voice over the years.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.670
It's your instrument.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.890
I know that you said that you go
and scream at people, which

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.580
is a great line.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:01.240
But it's got to evolve over
when you started.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.222
And I don't know, do you think
it sounds the same?

00:33:04.222 --> 00:33:07.730
I think it sounds good, but
is there a process?

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.615
STEPHEN PEARCY: Well, some
people say it sucks.

00:33:08.615 --> 00:33:12.200
And that's OK too, because
they buy a lot of things.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.790
But I've taken it seriously
and stuff.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:23.930
But I'm from old school
listening to like I say the

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.460
Stones or mostly Zeppelin.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.660
And I like their ad libbing, and
I like versatile of just

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.300
doing different things
every night.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.740
So the problem that's done when
you make a record is you

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.720
try so hard to create this one
sound or thing, and you can't

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.140
do it live.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.750
And we've made that mistake.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.500
That's why I don't do songs like
"Dance, Dance, Dance,"

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.230
even though we did.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.370
But it's very difficult.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.340
And I'll admit it.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.433
I'll cop to it.

00:33:54.433 --> 00:33:55.250
I could give a shit.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.960
You know?

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.730
I've never bitten into a
towel or did vocal warm

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.680
ups before I sing.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.480
I just have a drink and a
cigarette, and try to laugh as

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.020
much as I can, and talk,
and I'm ready to go.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.179
I maybe do some exercises,
but that's it.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:18.290
I take it seriously, but it's
like I'm not some weird freak

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.389
about it, because I don't
come from that school of

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:22.730
singing, you know?

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:31.199
And I don't claim to come from
that, or say I'm some kind

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:35.060
of-- like I met Paul Rodgers
one time, right?

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.780
We did this award thing,
and we're presenting.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.489
And the first thing I said to
him when we went out there,

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:45.650
they go, yeah, Stephen
and Paul Rodgers.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.130
And I go, this is like
the real singer guy.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.210
And he is.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.360
He's like, that's like
a real singer.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.900
I mean, I could sing,
and I do what I do.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.050
I'd rather be guitar player,
but I ended up singing, and

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.840
that was through default.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.240
I went into an audition for a
band ages ago, and they said,

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.600
well, we already have
a guitar player.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.490
Can you sing?

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.496
And me, I go, I guess.

00:35:09.496 --> 00:35:12.080
And then I got the job.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.513
So I'm just going with it.

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:18.196
It's a blessing.

00:35:18.196 --> 00:35:21.370
AUDIENCE: Something that always
struck me about like

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:26.670
'80s metal scene especially in
LA is the combination of very

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:31.540
masculine behavior almost macho
behavior combining it

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.270
with, I wouldn't even call
it androgynous, more like

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:38.365
outright female clothes
and dress sense.

00:35:38.365 --> 00:35:41.288
STEPHEN PEARCY: I got a
pussy and some nuts.

00:35:41.288 --> 00:35:45.430
AUDIENCE: So my question is,
what made you put on red

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:47.475
lipstick, and did you ever
run into problems?

00:35:47.475 --> 00:35:48.750
STEPHEN PEARCY: I never
put on red lipstick.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.420
AUDIENCE: Did people didn't get
it, didn't understand it?

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.870
STEPHEN PEARCY: That was
that other band Poison.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.400
The furthest we got was like
maybe rat up our hair, but we

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.460
were Ratts, you know.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.180
And that was probably
about it, may be

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.650
some eyeliner or whatever.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:05.220
But no, we never went
out of our way.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.288
AUDIENCE: What stopped you from
putting on red lipstick?

00:36:09.288 --> 00:36:11.290
STEPHEN PEARCY: I wasn't
attracted to dudes.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:12.684
I don't know.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:15.830
No.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:19.040
You know, the '80s were
an interesting thing.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.180
You've got to understand
it was all new.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:25.260
So it wasn't us, like when
people tell me, oh, what

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.750
killed the '80s, whatever.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.030
It's like, it wasn't us.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:33.520
And maybe it was those bands
that came after as that were

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.800
cookie-cutter bands.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.180
You had all these goofy-ass
bands that came out of

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.610
nowhere, and they'd just poof
them all up and find out who

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.540
may our clothes.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.680
But we're still standing.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.310
If you've been standing for
over 20 years, you've got

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.490
something going for you.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.660
We'll be 30 years next year.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.630
KATE MACEVICZ: Congrats.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.460
Yeah.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.765
STEPHEN PEARCY: It's
interesting.

00:37:04.765 --> 00:37:06.490
KATE MACEVICZ: We probably
have time for one last

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.100
question if anyone has one.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.370
Yeah?

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:12.540
AUDIENCE: Have you been
approached about doing any

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.860
reality TV shows?

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.530
STEPHEN PEARCY: I actually
have a production company

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.220
that's been writing and work
and stuff for years.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.950
It's just I'm not in
a real big rush to

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.560
like fall on my face.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.780
And it's not going
to be about me.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.800
I've been writing for
other things.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.600
A couple of them are mine,
but it's something.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.770
And even that is so overblown.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.933
I wouldn't want to be trapped
in that kind of a scene.

00:37:41.933 --> 00:37:47.470
I've been offered stuff, but I
wouldn't do it because you're

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:51.930
labeled some goof after that.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.724
It's got to have
some substance.

00:37:54.724 --> 00:37:58.426
Or I'll have somebody
else play the goof.

00:37:58.426 --> 00:37:59.240
KATE MACEVICZ: All right.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.030
So Stephen's book is "Sex,
Drugs, Ratt &amp; Roll: My Life in

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.640
Rock," available online
in bookstores,

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.030
and its a great read.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.830
I highly recommend it.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.455
Thank you, Stephen for
coming in today.

00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:10.790
STEPHEN PEARCY: Thank you.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.880
KATE MACEVICZ: And let's give
him a round of applause, guys.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.130
Great.
