- Hello.
I'm Allan McLeod,

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.037 line:0%
and today we're gonna
tell the story

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.441 line:0%
of the curse of Giles Corey.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.843 align:start size:19% position:81%
- Ooh.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.579
- Boo.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.981
<i> Our story begins
 in Salem, Massachusetts.</i>

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:18.317
<i> The Puritans had just
 settled the colony,</i>

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:21.820
and they were very much
into biblical law.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:25.558
<i> So, a bunch of girls started
 acting erratically.</i>

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.695
<i> And a doctor checked them out
 and he said,</i>

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.497
<i> These girls are bewi--
 bewitched!</i>

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.034
<i> And thus began
 the Salem witch trials.</i>

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.068
[hiccup]

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.070
Ooh.

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.471
- [laughs]

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.873
<i> - So,
 these witch trials start.</i>

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.811
<i> And Martha and Giles Corey are
 just, like, eating popcorn,</i>

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.913
and enjoying themselves,
and they're goi--

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.882
and they're--and they're
excited about it,

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.917
and they're like,
oh, I love you, honey,

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.621
<i> and we're at the witch trials,
 and isn't it fun</i>

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.557
<i> that there might be witches
 among us?</i>

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:00.360
So, the Puritans were
not very scientific.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.695
<i> You would have to, like,
 pee into a cup,</i>

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.265
<i> and then they would, like,
 pour the pee into,</i>

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:08.401
<i> like, a cake, and then a dog
 would have to eat the cake</i>

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:12.739
and then, if [bleep] the person
who peed into the cake

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.774
felt pain when
the dog ate the cake,

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.309
<i> then that person was a witch.</i>

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.144
<i> And Martha's like,
 that doesn't make any sense</i>

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.447
<i> as far as, like, judging
 whether you're a witch or not.</i>

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:23.950
<i> And so, Ann Putnam was like,</i>

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.987
<i> you're a witch because
 you're criticizing us.</i>

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.824
<i> And so, Sheriff George Corwin
 came in and was like,</i>

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.759
<i> if you're accused
 of being a witch,</i>

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.128
<i> you're gonna get hung
 and that's it.</i>

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:39.598
<i> The trial is--is arbitrary.
 It's not really...</i>

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:40.733
<i> [inhales]</i>

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.601
Ooh, excuse me.
- Was that...

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:43.936
What was that?

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.972
- Phew, it's a little
something coming up.

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:47.440 align:start size:31% position:69%
- [laughs]

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.676
- It's all good.
- Okay good.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.811
<i> Martha Corey goes to trial,</i>

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:55.247
and Giles Corey was just
swept up in the hysteria

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:56.949
of the whole thing
and he's like,

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:01.320
<i> well, our cat died and that
 could be a sign of a witch.</i>

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:05.624
<i> And also, my ox has been
 having some issues.</i>

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.193
<i> - [laughs]
 - So...</i>

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.328
<i> she could be a witch.
 I mean, I don't know!</i>

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.030
<i> But she could be a witch.</i>

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:15.068
<i> Well, then, Martha goes to
 jail, and--[hiccup] and, uh...</i>

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:19.105
<i> Giles was like, I've been
 caught up in the whole mania</i>

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:23.242
<i> of the Salem witch trials,
 and I need to relax</i>

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:25.711
<i> and come to my senses,
 and now that I've come</i>

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.682
<i> to my senses I realize
 my wife is not a witch.</i>

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.718
<i> And I--I was--telling tales
 out of school.</i>

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.420
<i> And everybody's like,
 so wait a second.</i>

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.690
<i> You're doubting us, and
 you're questioning us, like...</i>

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.225
<i> That means you're a witch!</i>

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.360
<i> And then Giles was like--
 [hiccup]</i>

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:43.462
Ugh.
- [laughs]

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.765
- These [bleep] hiccups, dude.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.399
- Don't worry about them.
- All right. We're good.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.801
<i> [hiccup]
 - [laughs]</i>

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:50.470
<i> - And so, Sheriff Corwin
 comes in, he says,</i>

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:54.073
<i> all right, well, it's time for
 me to torture you, baby.</i>

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.811
<i> And my choice of torture is
 pien de forte...</i>

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:02.715
<i> Oh, [bleep].
 Pien...Will Forte.</i>

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:03.950
<i> God damn it.</i>

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.952
Pier de tortogotortutu...
[laughs]

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:07.920
- [laughs]

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.790
- So, Giles Corey was
given the sentence of

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.894 line:0%
<i> peine forte et dure,
 and that basically meant</i>

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.563
<i> we're gonna put
 this board on you</i>

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.131
<i> and then we're gonna put a
 bunch of rocks on top of you</i>

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:24.036
<i> and crush you until you plead
 guilty or not guilty.</i>

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:26.338
<i> So, they start
 putting rocks on him</i>

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:27.941
<i> and start pressing on him.</i>

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.043
[laughs] Wait. We'll
crush you the right way.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.278 align:end position:100%
- Oh. No.
- [laughs]

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.079 align:end position:100%
- That's an ironing board.
- Come on!

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.082
- [laughing]
That's not what they had.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:38.685
That is not what
they had, Allan.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.819
Don't--
oh, [bleep] me!

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.755
- It hurts?
- I'm--yes, it hurts!

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.889
- [sighs]

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:45.457 align:start position:0%
- You're a body
on top of a body.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:46.859
<i> - Okay.
 Anyway.</i>

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:49.862
<i> The sheriff is like,
 I'm crushing you!</i>

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.230
<i> You're a witch!</i>

00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:52.431
<i> - I'm not a witch.</i>

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.566
[smooch]

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.868
Are you kissing me?
- [laughs]

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.337
- [laughing]
Allan.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.539
<i> - Anyway, all that Giles
 says to them...</i>

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:03.376
<i> More weight.
 I can take it.</i>

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:04.943
<i> More weight!</i>

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.313
<i> Oh, is that the biggest,
 heaviest rock you got?</i>

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.316
<i> More weight!
 Ahh!</i>

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:14.219
<i> So, for two days, Giles Corey
 is being crushed there.</i>

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:17.790
<i> And it got so bad that
 Giles Corey's eyes were</i>

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:21.293
<i> bulging out of his head,
 and his tongue was just</i>

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.162
<i> outside of his mouth.</i>

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.465
Sheriff Corwin has to come over
there and put them back in

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:29.101
<i> with the tip of his cane.
 And he's like,</i>

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:33.239
<i> Hey, why don't you confess
 to being a witch?</i>

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.806
<i> And then Giles is like,</i>

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:38.211
<i> you can kill me now,
 but I promise I'd curse you.</i>

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:42.448
<i> I--[hiccup] I curse you,
 Sherin Curfwin.</i>

00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:45.184
<i> I curse you, Sheriff Corwin.
 [hiccup]</i>

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.121
<i> I curse you...
 Salem!</i>

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.490
<i> And I have the hiccups,
 but I curse you</i>

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.059
<i> 'cause I'm being crushed.
 [hiccup]</i>

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.260
<i> And you'll understand
 this later.</i>

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:58.264
<i> Sorry.
 Bye.</i>

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.500
<i> Giles Corey's death
 was so gruesome,</i>

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:05.638
<i> that it led to the end
 of the Salem witch trials.</i>

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:09.742
<i> And then four years later,
 Sheriff Corwin died</i>

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:11.977
<i> of a heart attack.</i>

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:15.114
Obviously they can't
trace it back to

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.083
you know,
the curse, but...

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.185
We all know it was
the [bleep] curse.

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.219 align:start size:31% position:69%
- [laughs]

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.087 line:0%
<i> - So, in 1978,</i>

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:25.191 line:0%
<i> Sheriff Robert Cahill
 had a heart attack</i>

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:27.426
<i> and was like, uh, I should
 do some research</i>

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:31.731
<i> on this curse that was
 put on us by Giles.</i>

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:35.568
<i> And he found that
 every sheriff in Salem had</i>

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:37.203
<i> a heart attack or a stroke.</i>

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.937
<i> And he's like,
 oh, shit!</i>

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:40.807
<i> That [hiccup]
 curse was real!</i>

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:43.175
<i> And I was like,
 that was a real-ass curse.</i>

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:45.478
<i> So they move the Sheriff's
 Department out of...</i>

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:46.812
<i> [hiccup] Salem.
 [laughing]</i>

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.647 align:start position:0%
[laughing] This is one of
the untold stories

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:51.550 align:start position:0%
of the [hiccup] you know,
Salem witch trials.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.619
- Can I press you real quick?

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.354 align:start size:44% position:56%
- I could die.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.958
[screams]
- [laughs]

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.393
- [wailing]

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:02.295
- How's that feel?
- [coughing]

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.962 align:end position:100%
Ugh. I'm paral--
[hiccup] I'm paralyzed.
