[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.900
NOAH FALSTEIN:
I'm Noah Falstein,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.010
I'm Chief Game Designer at
Google, and happy to be your MC

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.940
for the day.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.590
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.580
This is the Google
Developer Day at GDC 2017.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.830
Boy, it's just amazing.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.830
GDC has grown
literally 1,000 fold

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.560
since the first one that was
held 30 years ago in Chris

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.130
Crawford's house.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.280
And I wasn't at that one, I've
been at every one ever since.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.840
And the first one I went
to, the entire conference

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.940
was about a third the
size of this room.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.290
So it's just great to
see what's happening.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.460
So we're really happy to be
kicking it off this year.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.320
This industry-- thank you--

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.810
and our involvement
in it has grown

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.080
because of the contributions
of developers like you.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.160
And you may not think of
Google as a gaming company,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.840
but the fact is our platforms,
our tools, the store support,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.960
it's just an amazing variety
of game development efforts

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.120
that we have behind you.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.730
And we're going to give you an
idea of just how all that stuff

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.600
works at today's event.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.780
And I should hit the
right button here.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.580
Sorry.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.650
So we're going to
start off today

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.725
with our keynote speeches.

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:19.730
That'll include speakers
from Google Play.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.230
And from there we're
going to launch

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.300
into a series of five
minute lightning talks

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.690
from a range of teams, so
a lot of really fun stuff

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.430
I'm looking forward
to sharing with you.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.340
We're going to have some Q&amp;A
with our speakers after that,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.690
and then we have
a break for lunch.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.800
After lunch, it's time for three
really interesting and relevant

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.939
panels that feature some
of our gaming partners.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.480
And we're going to
start with a panel

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.520
about launching
on the Play Store.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.250
Follow that with one about
building communities.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.990
And finally a
discussion on lessons

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.450
learned by indie developers.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.640
But before we jump
into all of that,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.280
let me recap a bit about
what a memorable year

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.620
2016 has been for us.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.810
There were some great hits
like the phenomenon that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.440
was "Pokemon Go," and then
there were the popular games

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.310
like "Star Wars, Galaxy of
Heroes" and "Clash Royale,"

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.110
both of which were
built with novel ways

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.050
to keep users engaged
and coming back for more.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.720
We've also had a lot
of our own launches

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.930
as well, with Google
entering the hardware space.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.780
While Google Home makes for a
great living room assistant,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.490
the Pixel phone
shows our commitment

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.460
to building a high quality,
beautifully designed device

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.720
inside and out.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.260
We are really gratified to
hear CNET say just last month,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.890
"The Google Pixel remains our
favorite phone, bar none."

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.440
Combined with Android
N's game-friendly sustain

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.920
performance mode and the
integration of the Vulcan API,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.920
it makes for a really
formidable and useful platform

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.960
for your games.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.230
The Pixel phone was also the
first Daydream-ready device.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.810
And with the addition of our
very affordable Daydream View

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.790
and its controller,
players can now

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.440
immerse themselves in fun and
innovative VR experiences.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.350
We've also released the
first Tango AR phone.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.720
And when GDC's floor
opens on Wednesday,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.720
you're going to be able
to try out both Daydream

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.707
and Tango at our booth there.

00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:10.040
We're excited with the games
that we've released so far,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.140
but we're really looking
forward and eager to play

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.806
the other great titles
that a lot of you

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:16.085
are working on right now.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:17.960
You're also going to
hear more about the ways

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.870
that Google's teams are
supporting your games

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.580
throughout the full lifecycle.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.590
Our Firebase tools and
infrastructures, for example,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.970
give you access to real time
analytics, push notifications,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.810
storage and ads across
a variety of languages.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.620
And today we're really excited
to announce that Firebase is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.310
completely available on
mobile for its C++ and Unity

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.440
developers at this point.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.600
Google Cloud Platform
also makes building

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.229
multiplayer games very easy.

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.520
And when you need to scale
with a rocket ride of a game

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.160
like "Pokemon Go,"
that's very important.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.450
By the way, the Cloud platform
has their own expo floor space

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.346
as well.

00:03:58.346 --> 00:03:59.720
Once your game
has been launched,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.930
our AdWords service grows
your audience directly,

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.540
using machine learning to
target players directly

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.930
in their searches.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.990
And then the power
of YouTube kicks in,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.414
supercharging the
growth of mobile gaming.

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:12.830
So all of these
and more are going

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.200
to be covered in
our lightning talks.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.850
But none of this
would have happened

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.950
without developers like you.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.079
We spend a lot of time
over the last year

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.720
reaching out to our developers
and the whole community,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.200
listening to your feedback and
bringing that back in-house

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.300
to improve our
platform and tools.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.970
So let me urge you
to continue that

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.520
by taking this opportunity
today and talking with some

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.220
of the many Googlers who
are here in the audience,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.010
and who have been involved in
supporting game developers.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.650
Googlers, can you raise
your hands and wave?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.360
So we've got quite
a few up here.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.430
People will be around
most of the day.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.860
And please have a
chance to talk to them.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.150
Thanks very much.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.250
But now on to Paul, who's
our product lead for the Play

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.310
Store, to share a
bit more with you

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.410
from how we're helping
people find better games

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.390
and more engaged users.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.198
Thank you.

00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:05.456
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:06.930
PAUL BANKHEAD: Thanks Noah.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.220
Hi everyone.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.260
As Noah mentioned, I look
after the Google Play Store.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.990
And I'm here to share
an update into how

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.990
we think about games, as well
as a sneak peek in some features

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.790
that we're developing.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.150
I started playing games
as a kid on an 8088 PC.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.490
But I had to be careful not
to get caught by my parents,

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.980
because they thought computers
were only for WordPerfect,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.530
Quicken, Lotus 1-2-3.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.110
As a teenager, I used to
sneak into my dad's office

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.230
with my friends to play
"Warcraft" and "StarCraft."

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.480
Now I know gaming's come
a long way since then

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.034
with the mobile revolution.

00:05:41.034 --> 00:05:42.450
And I feel really
lucky to be part

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.991
of the team at Google
Play that helps

00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.640
users discover great games.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.310
Now don't worry, because my
kids, I've got four of them,

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.920
play a lot of "Minecraft" and a
lot of "Kingdom Rush" with me.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.690
So you can rest assured
the next generation is

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.620
being raised properly.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.990
Android has been the world's
largest mobile gaming platform

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.690
for a long time, and it's
still growing, especially

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.130
in emerging markets.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.460
Last year, we added
over 300 million users

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.120
in countries like Brazil,
India, and Indonesia.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.730
In addition to
helping you reach over

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.860
the billion-plus users
that are on Android,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.550
we also want to help
you build your business.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.300
So we've been adding
more forms of payment

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.460
for more users in
more countries,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.550
and simplifying
the payment flow.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.070
Last year, over
100 million users

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.950
gained access to a new form
of payment on Google Play.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.830
And users in 136
countries can buy

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.320
your virtual goods and your
games on the Play platform.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.320
I mentioned the user
growth in emerging markets,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.180
but we're also
seeing great growth

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.939
in consumer spending in those
markets, at over 70% last year.

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.480
So there's a lot of momentum
and a lot of future growth ahead

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.180
for the ecosystem.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.940
Now Android isn't just about
being the largest mobile gaming

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.810
platform.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.540
We also want to deliver
the highest quality user

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.010
experience.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.070
When we built the Pixel phone
and the Daydream VR set,

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.309
we designed the full hardware
and software stack ourselves.

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:07.350
And this allowed us to
focus on important details

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.540
like battery life, camera
quality, and UI consistency.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.310
The response has been
fantastic, and we're

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.685
really proud of
the quality built

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.190
into each of the products.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.560
And we don't just keep the
improvements for ourselves.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.260
Android N is open source and
it's the best mobile operating

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.960
system we've ever
built. This year,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.820
Google is still
investing heavily

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.124
in performance and
polish for Android.

00:07:29.124 --> 00:07:31.290
And we look forward to
sharing more details with you

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.070
later this year when
we announce Android O.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.170
The Play Store team
has been laser-focused

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.510
on improving the quality
of the user experience,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.690
both within the store and
within the apps and games that

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.430
are downloaded from Play.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.980
About a billion users
come to the Play Store

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.570
every month to learn
about apps and games.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.240
And so we run hundreds
of experiments

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.490
to optimize their experience.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.540
Optimize the store for us
has meant growing downloads

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.130
by putting the
right game in front

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.800
of the right user in
the right context.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.930
And this is still
true, but we're

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.362
rethinking what right game
and right context means.

00:08:08.362 --> 00:08:09.820
We don't really
think a user should

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.150
have to download 20
games before finding one

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.760
that she really likes.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.350
And so this year, we've
begun tuning our algorithms

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:22.570
to optimize for user
engagement, not just downloads.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.480
So for example, a title that
gets a whole bunch of downloads

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.270
because it has a catchy icon,
but is then quickly uninstalled

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.630
will receive less
prominence than a title

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.716
that drives true user
engagement and retention.

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.299
We're also working
on several features

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:42.059
to improve the prominence and
conversion for premium games.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.710
A lot of these are
really high quality,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.720
but they have to overcome
this extra hurdle

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.075
of upfront payment.

00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:49.200
The first of these features
we're announcing today,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.810
and we're calling it
strikethrough pricing,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.490
you can use
strikethrough pricing

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.040
to run a price promotion
on a premium app or game

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.260
in the Google Play Store.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.740
Promotions drive awareness,
conversion, and a sense

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.570
of value for our users.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.040
Here's how it works.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.210
Any of you can log into
the Developer Console

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.080
today and set up a
promotion on your game.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.480
You just tell us what
discount you want to apply,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.750
when you want to apply
it, and we do the rest.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.840
Users will see the original and
discounted price on the home

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.310
page, in the search results,
and in the app listing page.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.380
In our early pilot
phase, developers

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.820
saw a lift in installs
ranging from 3x to 20x

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.730
when running a
promotion on their game.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.770
Many of the developers
saw a sustained uplift

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.000
in performance, even after
the discount had ended.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.680
So we're really excited
about the progress so far.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.020
Now obviously, there
is a correlation

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.160
between the size of the discount
and the level of marketing

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.450
spend that you do, and
the size of the uplift.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.908
But across the board, results
have been really encouraging,

00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:57.340
and we'd like to see more of
you using this feature soon.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.450
And throughout the year,
you'll see additional features

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.480
meant to drive more prominence
conversion for premium games

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.480
as we work to create a healthy
ecosystem of developers,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.560
players, and pairs.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.360
Another way we'll be
highlighting quality games

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.760
on Android is through
our new editorial pages

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.070
which are launching in Q2.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.710
These pages allow Play
editors to showcase

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.160
magical, high-performing
Android games.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.080
You can think of them
as a handcrafted page

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.840
built around a theme.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.810
In this example, we've made
a page for roleplaying games.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.220
Up top, we show an introduction
to the genre, followed

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.761
by a short list of titles
that have earned our love,

00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:36.510
along with the reasons
why we picked them.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.430
Now I'm going to
give you a sneak peek

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.800
into some features that
are a little bit earlier

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.630
in the development cycle.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.180
I mentioned our shift to
reward deep engagement

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.490
over discarded downloads.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.370
One way to do this is to
drive more qualified traffic

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.910
to our developers.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.450
Today I might have to
download a 50 or 100 megabyte

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.520
game before really
figuring out what it does

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.750
and whether I'd like it.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.090
And we'd like to help users
learn more about the game

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.340
before the download.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.620
One way we're doing
this is exposing users

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.500
to more of your gameplay
earlier in the funnel

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.240
through inline videos.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.450
These videos will show up on the
game's home page of the store.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.850
And in addition to
the usual icons,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.670
users will be able to browse
a set of videos for games

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.860
that we think they
will really like.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.260
We're doing a similar test
for screenshots inline,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.397
which will show up in the search
results and in the home page.

00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:29.480
These features are designed
to simplify the search

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.520
and discovery experience
by giving users

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.220
a preview of what they're going
to experience without requiring

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.140
them to visit a
whole separate page.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.515
And we think this will be
really helpful for the hundreds

00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:40.100
of millions of
users who are coming

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.670
online with slower connections.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.440
Now finally, we want
to help developers

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.120
like you drive repeat engagement
with your Android games.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.210
Many of you have spent a lot
of money acquiring users.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.690
And sometimes these users need
a little nudge to come back.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.600
So we're going to be
testing LiveOps cards

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.590
in the store, which
give developers

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.460
a channel to drive awareness of
in-game activities and events.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.070
These cards will show up on
the home pages in the store,

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.470
and also in the My Apps
section of the store,

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.992
where users are already coming
in to manage app updates.

00:12:12.992 --> 00:12:15.394
That's a super early phase
of the project right now,

00:12:15.394 --> 00:12:17.060
but we're sharing it
with you because we

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.340
think it's an important
part of driving engagement

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.980
and stickiness
with Android games.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.490
So that's about it for me today.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.310
I hope each of you
are a little bit more

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.220
convinced that Google is
serious about supporting

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.290
the quality of the
Android gaming experience

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.630
from our hardware to
the operating system,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.780
from our Developer
Tools to the Play Store.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.140
And we know that in order
to keep our users happy,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.450
we depend on developers
like you to keep creating

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.500
incredible gaming experiences.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.820
So I'd like to introduce Jamil
Moledina, our Games Strategic

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.220
Lead, who will announce a
set of exciting titles coming

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.768
to the platform.

00:12:50.768 --> 00:12:55.124
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:01.416 --> 00:13:03.410
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Thank you, Paul.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.280
Hi, everyone.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.510
It's a thrill to be
back on the GDC stage.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.350
Between working on GDC
and coming to Google,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.070
I converted my love of games
into actually making games,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.730
and learned just how
hard this really is.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.760
Yet this is a truly
extraordinary time

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.780
for mobile games.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.770
And it's why I'm
excited to be here.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.520
Supercell's "Clash Royale"
showed that you can finally

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.790
bring a synchronous
multiplayer game to mobile

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.900
and have it become a hit.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.510
"Lineage 2" from
Netmarble and NCsoft

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.160
stormed our charts in Korea
as a full-fledged mobile MMO.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.830
Plus, the biggest fan
communities in the world

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.180
are finding games made
for them on mobile too.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.720
"Star Wars, Galaxy of
Heroes" from EA and Lucasfilm

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.090
let us collect
virtual action figures

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.250
and battle them like we
did with the plastic ones

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.350
when we were kids.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.190
And mobile players were
rewarded that effort.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.240
Nintendo came to mobile with
"Super Mario Run" and "Fire

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.300
Emblem Heroes," setting
records for preregistration

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.760
on Google Play.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.730
And handcrafted
art and innovation

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.130
are also thriving and
finding an audience

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.820
on mobile, where
you can card-swipe

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.240
managing your kingdom
in "Reigns" from Nerial

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.990
and Devolver, or make
life-changing decisions

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.630
through the chaos of a
real world regime change,

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:40.130
as in "Revolution
1979" from iNK Studios.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.570
All of this depth, community,
and diversity of play

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:49.650
was what we saw and supported
just in the past year.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.390
What we're seeing coming up
doubles down on those trends.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.970
And we're excited to bring
some of our game dev partners

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.300
onstage today to share
what they've got going on.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.270
We'll highlight an
existing hits evolution,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.770
share some big new games, and
close with some breakthrough

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.300
titles on new technology.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.370
So let's get started.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.420
Today, February 27, is a
very important birthday

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.650
in games in that
Pokemon is 21 years old.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.731
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:21.731 --> 00:15:22.230
Exactly.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.320
"Pokemon Go," the hit augmented
reality game from Niantic,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.690
driven by Google Maps
and Google Cloud,

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.930
got people across the
globe off the couch

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.630
and out catching Pokemon.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.430
Fans were screaming for more.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.560
And here to give us a
little of what we want

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.390
is Phil Keslin from Niantic.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.400
PHIL KESLIN: Thanks
Jamil, and good morning.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.187
I'm Phil Keslin, I'm
the CTO for Niantic.

00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.770
Most people don't
know, or-- everybody

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.870
knows that we're the
"Pokemon Go" people.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.660
But what most people don't
know is that we actually

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.360
started inside Google
about six years ago

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.500
as an independent organization
with a mission of creating

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.010
adventures on foot with others.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.470
That mission was
set out to foster

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.490
exploration and discovery
in the real world.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.270
The first app we launched
is called Field Trip.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.430
It's a serendipitous
location-based discovery

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.630
application.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.280
The idea was to
give you information

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.070
about the location that
you're currently standing in,

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.200
such as in the
financial district,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.530
most people don't know that
buried beneath the buildings

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:47.070
are hundreds of ships that
were dragged into the landfill.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:53.060
That title was launched in
2012, and we followed closely

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:58.330
with "Ingress," which is
our true location-based MMO.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.496
It's a territory capture
game and in the four years

00:17:02.496 --> 00:17:04.079
since its launch,
it's been downloaded

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.700
about 20 million times.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.650
And it's still
going strong today.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.785
Its user base is quite sticky.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.780
Most of you may remember
in an April Fool's joke

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:23.130
at Google in 2014, the Google
Maps was littered with Pokemon.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.250
And the success of
that April Fool's joke

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.109
sort of spawned an idea.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:31.260
And that idea was,
build a real world

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.410
location-based MMO
based on Pokemon.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.740
We approached the Pokemon
Company with that idea.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.570
They in turn, played
"Ingress" a little bit

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.130
and discovered
that this actually

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.530
has a great deal of legs to it.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.720
So together with
the Pokemon company,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.040
we built and launched
the "Pokemon Go" game.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.889
We started with a small
team of engineers.

00:17:51.889 --> 00:17:53.430
There were nine
engineers on the team

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.519
that built that product, five
designers and two producers.

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:00.810
And as many of you are aware,
we were just a little bit

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.540
overwhelmed with the response.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.100
It was about 50 times what
we originally anticipated.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.420
And yeah, that summer
was quite a wild ride.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.070
Actually, the 30 days,
with absolutely no pressure

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.490
at all except for
maybe the 9,000 people

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.910
in San Francisco who proposed
marching on our offices

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.340
if we couldn't get the servers
back up before the Market

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.390
Street crawl the Friday after we
launched in the United States.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.199
Since we've launched, we've
stabilized everything.

00:18:30.199 --> 00:18:31.740
We've added some
incremental changes.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.727
But last week, we launched
the biggest update thus far.

00:18:34.727 --> 00:18:35.810
And let's watch the video.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.307
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:37.307 --> 00:18:40.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.075
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:17.075 --> 00:19:18.450
PHIL KESLIN: So
with this update,

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.090
we've added the second
generation of Pokemon,

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.330
those Pokemon from the "Gold"
and "Silver" series games.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.610
Additionally, we changed
the counter-mechanics,

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.220
making capturing Pokemon
a bit more challenging.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.160
And we've added avatar
customization to the title

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.360
as well.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.820
Since we've launched,
we've had a little

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.600
over 650 million installs
of the application.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.880
And our players are active too.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.700
They've walked about
8.7 billion kilometers,

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.390
which is just shy of Pluto.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.020
"Ingress" and "Pokemon
Go," as you might imagine,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.990
they have some pretty
distinct technical challenges.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.080
This is a single world MMO.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.505
We're building a
planet-scale game

00:19:59.505 --> 00:20:02.340
with demanding latency and
consistency requirements.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.970
And it's capable of supporting
millions of simultaneous users,

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.920
and that is no easy task.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.850
Luckily, we've had the support
of both the Google Cloud

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.190
and Google Play Store teams.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.160
And having those 40 or so
faces during the launch

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.100
on the other side of the Hangout
was very, very reassuring

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.780
to the four engineers that were
trying to bring that server up.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.180
When we started
Nianic, we wanted

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.510
to get people outside, off the
couch, playing games with one

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.527
another.

00:20:31.527 --> 00:20:33.360
With "Ingress," and
especially "Pokemon Go,"

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.050
we saw this happen.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.954
Of all that we achieved last
year, it was the smiles.

00:20:38.954 --> 00:20:40.870
And the thing that put
the smiles on our faces

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.630
were the people getting outside,
seeing the teenagers running

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.380
around the neighborhood,
playing games with one another.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.700
And that is what motivated us
to push through the tough times

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.290
and get a pretty fun
game into people's hands.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.470
Both "Ingress" and "Pokemon
Go," they're not static titles.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.946
We're going to continue
to evolve those over time.

00:21:04.946 --> 00:21:06.820
And at launch, our game
play for "Pokemon Go"

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.300
was focused on the adventures
on foot part of our mission.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.240
This year, we're going to
add more and more of the

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.450
with others portion of that by
adding social and collaborative

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.464
gameplay to the title as well.

00:21:18.464 --> 00:21:20.380
And we at Niantic look
forward to sharing that

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.800
with you, along with maybe
one or two other surprises.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.588
Thank you.

00:21:24.588 --> 00:21:28.492
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.505
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Thank you, Phil.

00:21:35.505 --> 00:21:37.980
"Pokemon Go" is
having a great ride.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.810
And we're excited to
see the game continue

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.930
to evolve with these great
new characters and upcoming

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.430
features.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.270
Now we'd like to share with
you a trio of brand new games

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.630
about to launch on Google Play.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.780
Kabam is an established
partner on our store,

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.650
making hit games well-tuned
the mobile marketplace.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.740
Recently, they've been showing
some of their console DNA

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.500
and love for all
genres of games.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.290
Their latest game combines 3D
fighter, RPG, and base building

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.410
in a console quality game,
around a brand whose community

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.450
is ready to roll out.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.760
Please join me in welcoming
Jeff Howell and Mike

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.880
McCartney from Kabam.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.808
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:28.209 --> 00:22:29.820
MIKE MCCARTNEY: Thanks Jamil.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.910
We're really excited
to be here and show off

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.600
Kabam's next free-to-play AAA
quality game, "TRANSFORMERS,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.250
Forged to Fight."

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.840
"Forged to Fight"
is the first game

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.920
to feature the entire history
of the Transformers franchise.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.590
So whether you're a fan
of the classic generations

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.290
characters, characters from
the Transformers movies,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.560
or even the Maximals and
Predacons from the Beast Wars

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.900
series, our game
has you covered,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.830
featuring intense one-versus-one
combat, deep strategic RPG

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.250
systems, and engaging
social gameplay.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.740
As commander, you'll
partner with Optimus Prime

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.290
to establish a
base and defend it

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.730
with a collection of your
favorite Transformers.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.157
So let's dig into that
part of the game right now.

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:13.528
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:13.528 --> 00:23:14.499
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:14.499 --> 00:23:16.540
MIKE MCCARTNEY: So last
night while I was asleep,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.110
my friend overseas
raided my base.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:22.260
And I found out when I woke up,
and I was really aggravated,

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.470
and all I could think about
was exacting some revenge.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.450
So why don't we go
and finish off the job

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.160
and take out his
boss and his beast?

00:23:34.236 --> 00:23:35.610
JEFF HOWELL: So
for Transformers,

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.280
it was really important for
us that we push the limits

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.050
on visuals and really
change people's

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.230
expectations of what is
possible on a mobile platform.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.350
To accomplish this feat, we had
to build a brand new rendering

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.880
engine from the ground
up we'd call Ember.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.780
Ember combines
physically-based rendering

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.630
and a deferred lighting model
to do a full dynamically lit

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.090
environment, and really
brings our robots to life.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.920
Devices like the Google
Pixel, like Mike is playing on

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.150
right now, have an incredible
amount of rendering horsepower.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.690
And Ember can extract
all that power

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.260
to bring this console quality
level of graphics to mobile.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.870
On top of just rendering,
we developed a brand new

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.450
GPU-based physics engine.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.040
By using multiple
rendered targets

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.500
and keeping the physics
state in texture format,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.680
we can calculate and simulate
collisions for over 50,000

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.940
particles, all in real time,
all rendered in beautiful HDR.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.330
And we even can draw them
all in a single draw call.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.120
Mike, for fun, let's show
the power of the Google Pixel

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.170
and turn on Ludicrous
Mode for our sparks.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.572
MIKE MCCARTNEY: All
right, if you're sure.

00:24:41.572 --> 00:24:42.554
Here we go.

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:50.170
JEFF HOWELL: All
right, it's time

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.999
to show what real
transformation is about.

00:24:52.999 --> 00:24:54.290
Let's finish off Optimus Prime.

00:25:06.002 --> 00:25:08.442
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:08.442 --> 00:25:13.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.790
MIKE MCCARTNEY: Without the
power of the Google Pixel,

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.165
these high fidelity graphics
and silky smooth performance

00:25:18.165 --> 00:25:19.570
would not be possible.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.799
Thanks to Google, my
revenge is complete.

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:24.340
"TRANSFORMERS, Forged to Fight"
is beta in select territories

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.376
right now.

00:25:25.376 --> 00:25:27.250
And today we're announcing
for the first time

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.240
that the game will be available
globally on April 5, 2017.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.860
Go pre-register on
Google Play now.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.927
Thank you everyone.

00:25:33.927 --> 00:25:38.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:47.747 --> 00:25:49.080
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Thank you, guys.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.000
You know, that is really
fun to play as well.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.040
They've definitely cracked
input for high fidelity games.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.530
Now, finding that balance
between classic game design

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.630
and mobile play can
be very complex.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.040
The next game is from one of
the leaders in the AAA console

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.940
space.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.450
And they've truly taken
this concept to heart.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.120
What you're going to
see is a game made first

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.500
for mobile in
accessibility and design,

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.350
but for the gamer in all of
us, especially for those of us

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.020
who grew up in the '80s.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.120
I'm very pleased to
introduce to this stage

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.413
Donald Mustard from Epic Games.

00:26:26.413 --> 00:26:31.343
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:32.329 --> 00:26:33.910
DONALD MUSTARD: Thanks, Jamil.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.064
Hey everyone.

00:26:35.064 --> 00:26:36.730
Thanks so much for
having us here today.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.970
We could not be more excited
to be with you at GDC

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.200
to announce a brand
new game from Epic.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.600
Powered, of course,
by Unreal Engine 4.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.300
Now we all know Unreal Engine
is synonymous with making

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.170
AAA high fidelity experience
for all gaming platforms.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.810
Its versatility combined
with the power devices

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.230
like the Google Pixel are what
allowed us to design and create

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.300
the game we're
about to show you.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.785
I am so thrilled to
present "Battle Breakers."

00:27:04.785 --> 00:27:06.956
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:06.956 --> 00:27:09.475
- "Battle Breakers!"

00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:11.600
DONALD MUSTARD: All right,
so "Battle Breakers" was

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.800
born from us saying, what if
we took our love for zany '80s

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.140
Saturday morning cartoons
and combined that

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.460
with our obsession with
tactical turn-based RPGs?

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.650
And so, in my best
announcer voice,

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.500
your world was at peace
when monsters from space

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.650
attacked, trapping your
world and its heroes

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.720
in techno magic crystal.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.280
So that's the setup, right?

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:34.820
All right.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.130
So this game is all about
your heroes and your team.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.270
So this is my team right now.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.432
And there's over 250 heroes
in the game at launch.

00:27:43.432 --> 00:27:45.890
So for this demo, I'm going to
augment my team a little bit

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.500
and I'm going to check out
Stormbringer She's awesome

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.000
because she has
this hurricane blade

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.920
attack that will be perfect
for what I'm about to show you.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.470
So I'm going to
add her to my team,

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.890
and enter one of the
games over 600 levels.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.010
I'm also going to add one of my
real world friends to the team,

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.250
because they have this
awesome character named Razor,

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.440
and she's amazing and
I want her on my team.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.822
So all my characters are now
getting added into the level.

00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:11.530
Let me tell you about
how the game works.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:16.790
So the game is based on these
very poppable crystal tiles

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.910
that you pop and break
to find different things.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.240
You can find everything
from gold and treasure

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.266
to crafting materials,
and all sorts

00:28:25.266 --> 00:28:26.390
of different kinds of loot.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.356
You'll also find enemies.

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:30.230
And you need to use your
heroes and your team

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.880
to take these guys out.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.090
We use a pretty dynamic
rock-paper-scissors system,

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.590
right?

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.750
So red is best at green,
green is best at blue,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.360
and so on and so forth.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.200
Each hero also has a really
unique, special ability

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.850
like this one that
clears the board

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.600
and lets me move
to the next stage.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.730
All right, so that's
a big-looking crystal

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.010
which probably means
boss fight, right?

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.290
So the Unholy
Summoner is a big bad

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.640
that my team needs to take out.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.874
But my guys look awesome,
we can handle this.

00:29:00.874 --> 00:29:02.540
I'm going to do my
favorite feature now,

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.220
which I'm going to
accelerate the game's speed

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.303
and put it into auto mode.

00:29:05.303 --> 00:29:08.360
So now I can just sit back and
watch the beautiful graphics

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.370
as my team takes this guy out.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.790
Now this game is
actually completely 3D.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:17.360
So we're using Unreal to
layer on all this cool 2D

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.610
art over a 3D
world, which allows

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.349
us to get these very unique
effects and transitions

00:29:23.349 --> 00:29:24.140
that you're seeing.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.690
All right, the boss is
dead, let's collect our loot

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.710
and get out of here.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.100
So I'm now able to unlock
a permanent upgrade stat

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.950
and open up all my loot.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.177
Awesomely, I was able
to get a hero crystal.

00:29:35.177 --> 00:29:37.010
So now let's open that
and see what we find.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.375
So all the heroes are
trapped in these crystals.

00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:41.780
And I'm going to pop it
open and see what we get,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.174
which is Kaldin.

00:29:44.174 --> 00:29:46.340
This is awesome, this is
one of the most rare heroes

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.210
in the game.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.980
And he's awesome
because he can transform

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.531
into an awesome dragon warrior.

00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:53.962
- "Battle Breakers!"

00:29:53.962 --> 00:29:54.794
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:54.794 --> 00:29:56.960
DONALD MUSTARD: All right,
that's "Battle Breakers."

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.300
So at Epic, we
love playing games,

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.220
and we love the technology
that makes games.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.710
But most of all, we
love making games.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.680
And we love making them for
players all over this world.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.370
And I cannot wait for you to
get this game in your hands.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.640
"Battle Breakers" is available
worldwide very, very soon.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.920
But you can actually
pre-register for the game

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.560
starting right now.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.330
And all those who
pre-register will

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.600
receive exclusive and
special dark beast man

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.625
when the game launches.

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:29.500
So go check it all out
at battlebreakers.com.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.920
Thanks so much.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:35.285
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.890
JAMIL MOLEDINA: That was
awesome Donald, thank you.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.870
Thank you for
sharing that with us.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:50.030
Now serious question, who's
planning to play hooky from GDC

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.760
and go see "Lego
Batman" instead?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.750
Show of hands.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.186
Come on, don't be shy.

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.810
You've had enough of
this show already.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.390
I have to admit doing something
similar at Casual Connect

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.300
when "The Dark Knight
Rises" came out.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.960
I bring this up to point out
how comic book heroes are really

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.720
front and center in the
public consciousness.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:17.190
In film, television, and of
course games, players on the go

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.750
want to be Batman as much as
the console player in the living

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.670
room.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:27.020
To help bring that wish to life
our friends at DC and Warner

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.100
Brothers.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.310
Let's welcome Erin Piepergerdes
from Warner Brothers

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.788
NetherRealm Studios.

00:31:32.788 --> 00:31:38.266
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:40.162
ERIN PIEPERGERDES:
Thank you Jamil.

00:31:40.162 --> 00:31:42.370
You guys, I couldn't be more
excited to be here today

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.889
to give you a quick
look at "Injustice 2."

00:31:44.889 --> 00:31:46.930
Let's dive right into the
action here so you guys

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.430
can see what I'm talking about.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.420
This is of course the sequel
to "Injustice, Gods Among Us."

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.290
And one of the
things you guys are

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.956
going to see when we
get into the action

00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:57.280
here is the hyper-realistic
level of detail

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.930
that we've been able to achieve.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.696
Well, let's take a look.

00:32:00.696 --> 00:32:07.784
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:07.784 --> 00:32:10.200
ERIN PIEPERGERDES: Now as we
start the fight here-- again,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.500
notice the level of
detail that I mentioned.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.360
This is perfectly suited to
these iconic DC characters

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.220
like Batman and Harley Quinn.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.860
So how did we achieve such
a visually stunning game?

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.360
I know there's a lot of
developers in the audience

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.651
today, so we wanted to give
you a little bit of insight

00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:24.570
into our process.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.150
Unreal Engine 4 natively
provides [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.210
profiles, which we can use
to adjust graphic settings

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:34.380
like shadow, resolution, and
bloom on a per-device basis.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.780
Now we've actually hosted
this on online backend,

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.120
so we can make real
time adjustments.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.250
All of this is very
useful when you

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.650
have a tendency to design
some pretty over-the-top moves

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:44.310
like this.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.480
Superman is not messing around.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.070
Now "Injustice 2" is going to
be a very full-featured game

00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.850
when it comes out.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.410
There's a lot of
variety of modes

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.750
that the players can
experience and a lot of things

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.874
they can do in this game.

00:33:04.874 --> 00:33:07.290
One of the things that we want
to actually highlight today

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.070
is what we're calling
our gear system.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.040
So we'll take a look
at this in action.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.820
So gear, you guys can think of
as customizable costume pieces

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.740
that you collect as
you play the game

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.240
and equip to your characters.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.850
Here we're looking at the
base level version of Batman.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.010
Notice below him he's
got his pieces of gear.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.740
As you collect these and
equip them to your character,

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.170
not only does it change
the visual appearance,

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.030
but it also changes how
the character plays.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.640
It changes his base
stats and abilities.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.920
So here we've added all
five pieces, and notice

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.060
again a very different version
of the evolved predator Batman

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:38.560
now.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.200
So you see the
visual difference.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.180
But there are also gameplay
implications here as well.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.270
So let's take a look at
a couple other examples.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.500
This time we'll take a
look at Wonder Woman.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.330
So here, the base
version of Wonder Woman.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.010
And again, as you play the game
you collect the gear pieces.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.770
You've got the headpiece
the chestpiece,

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.890
the arms, legs, and her
shield, her accessory.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.650
Once you've got them all,
you can achieve set bonuses,

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.780
different stats, really
upgrading and making

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.020
this character much,
much more powerful.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.780
And finally making his
debut here at GDC of course

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.010
is Scarecrow.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.550
The idea here is the same.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.699
You're going to collect
all your gear and equip it,

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.619
and this time you have a very
different-looking Scarecrow.

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:20.400
Our artists had a lot of fun
making up different looks

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.862
for these iconic characters.

00:34:22.862 --> 00:34:24.070
Now let's see this in action.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.026
We're going to take a quick look
at a second fight, this time

00:34:27.026 --> 00:34:28.900
with the evolved versions
of these characters

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.400
you'll see they're much more
powerful than what we just saw.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.139
Now

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.555
the visuals are
not the only thing

00:34:36.555 --> 00:34:38.250
that got an upgrade
in "Injustice 2."

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.010
Combat is also much
deeper this time around.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.830
You'll see you can do things
like low attacks, high attacks.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.800
You can actually dash back
away from your opponent

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.240
and throw projectiles.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.627
And with time and
practice, players

00:34:52.627 --> 00:34:54.710
can actually string these
different moves together

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.350
to form some pretty cool combos.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.350
Now of course, in addition
to the basic attacks,

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.710
all the characters
also have special moves

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.190
that they can utilize
with really cool custom

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.560
animations, effects.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.564
And again as they
fight back and forth,

00:35:14.564 --> 00:35:16.480
notice that detail we've
been able to achieve,

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.626
as I mentioned.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:26.332
Now you guys want to see one
more supermove before we go?

00:35:26.332 --> 00:35:29.530
All right, making its debut
here at GDC for the first time,

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.195
this is Scarecrow's supermove.

00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.045
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:46.045 --> 00:35:47.266
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:47.266 --> 00:35:49.390
ERIN PIEPERGERDES: "Injustice
2" is the culmination

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.610
of a lot of very talented
people's efforts back

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.780
in Chicago.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.990
We couldn't be more excited to
be bringing this game to you.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.540
Look for it to launch
worldwide in May

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.497
and you can pre-register
starting today.

00:36:00.497 --> 00:36:01.330
Thank you very much.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:05.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:12.975
JAMIL MOLEDINA: That's
just incredible.

00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:14.600
And it's the same
game that's launching

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.080
on console at the same time.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.880
Congratulations.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.530
At Google Play, we're
proud of these games that

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.630

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.370
that love these brands.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.860
Visit the Play Store
right now as we're

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.740
doing a special
update for GDC where

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.380
you can pre-register the
three titles you've just seen.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.440
Another important
part of Android is VR.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.840
Just a few months ago,
we launched Daydream,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.060
with a portfolio that
delivers low friction

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:50.960
VR with appealing, accessible,
and engaging experiences.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.440
To continue growing
the Daydream platform,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.820
we recently announced
partnerships with Huawei, Asus,

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.630
and ZTE for new Daydream-ready
phones and headsets,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.970
with many more
partners coming soon.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:09.390
Today we'd like to announce
two new Daydream games

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.220
that help show that momentum.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.160
First up is a great
partner of ours

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.150
and supporter of innovation
on multiple platforms.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.820
From Ubisoft Montpellier,
please welcome

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.100
Loic Gounon and Fred Mizac.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.052
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:30.016 --> 00:37:33.230
LOIC GOUNON: Thanks Jamil.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.680
Hello everyone.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.520
Ubisoft, as you know, has
always been among the first

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.290
when it comes to
innovative platforms.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.960
And we are proud
today to showcase

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.240
what Daydream is capable of by
bringing the kind of emotions

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.100
to our players.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.850
We at Ubisoft Montpellier
are excited to present to you

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.090
a funny and immersive experience
from the original creators

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.730
of the "Raving Rabbids."

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:59.800
This new game is called
"Virtual Rabbids, The Big Plan."

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.116
And now let's take
a look at the game.

00:38:02.116 --> 00:38:03.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:07.096 --> 00:38:09.420
LOIC GOUNON: In this experience
you see on the screen,

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.670
you will use the
remote as a chameleon

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.199
and use its tongue
to catch objects.

00:38:14.199 --> 00:38:15.990
But the rabbit is going
to get in your way.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.920
And during an
operation, you'll have

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.240
to tell the rabbits
by shaking your head

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.780
if you want the object
back in your body or not.

00:38:32.034 --> 00:38:33.700
So you probably want
to keep your heart.

00:38:44.032 --> 00:38:47.910
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.250
LOIC GOUNON: That's
a nice image.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.690
So for the very
first time player,

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.970
we'll be interacting
directly with the rabbits.

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.220
You can get up closer
to them than ever before

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.590
and your action will
have an impact on what's

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.519
going on around you, creating
hilarious situations.

00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:08.020
FRED MIZAC: Working with
Google on the Daydream platform

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.560
is great because it allows us
to deliver high quality games

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.140
in a mobile VR environment.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.450
Daydream also brings a
great way to interact

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.590
with the virtual world
thanks to the controller.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.520
It is light, it
is simple to use,

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.390
and brings lots of
new gameplay ideas.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.230
We are eager to have you try
out our game at Google Daydream

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.100
booth starting Wednesday.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.037
Thank you.

00:39:31.037 --> 00:39:35.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:43.959 --> 00:39:45.410
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Thank you guys.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:48.320
That was a great example of
interacting with characters

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.160
made much more real in VR.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.640
Now a lot of you know that
indies are very near and dear

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.570
to our hearts.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:01.350
They risk everything for
innovation and expression,

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.480
and bring a richer
diversity of delight

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.750
to everyone on their
platform of choice.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.060
We work hard to make
sure that indies have

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.330
a home on Google Play, too.

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:16.260
Last year on this stage, we
announced the Indie Corner.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.830
This dedicated page
on the Play Store

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.920
highlights fresh new launches,
as well as proven indie

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.570
masterpieces.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.490
We're excited to see
the program continue

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.600
to grow after featuring
over 250 games

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.770
and driving millions of
installs in its first year.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.990
And we were just getting
started with that.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.000
Since then, we've
tested new ways

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.440
to discover and support indies
by hosting our first indie game

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:49.110
festivals and contests for
developers across the world--

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:53.040
in Seoul, San Francisco,
and two weeks ago in London.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.870
Keep your eyes open
for more efforts

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.780
like these throughout the year.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.510
Now we're committed
to helping indies grow

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.490
on Android and Google Play.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:08.770
The dedication and passion
you have is incredible.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:12.600
And we thank you
for your commitment.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.450
Given this instinct to
innovate, indies are frequently

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.360
the first to experiment
and find new ways to bring

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.390
new ideas to new platforms.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:25.450
And they're willing to open
perspectives through empathy.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.250
It's then with a
special pleasure

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:31.120
to share and reveal a game that
hits all of our hot buttons,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.310
including social
and persistence.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.770
From our friends at
Spry Fox, please join me

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.610
in welcoming Daniel Cook.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:43.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.260
DANIEL COOK: Hello everyone.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.460
So Spry Fox has been making
little tiny games for years.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.980
"Triple Town," "Alphabear,"
"Realm of the Mad God,"

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.300
"Bushido Bear."

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:02.900
Last June we started thinking
about our very first VR game.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.830
We had a couple of goals.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:09.290
First, we wanted to build a
home for the Spry Fox bears.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.260
Millions of people have
played these characters,

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.742
and they absolutely adore them.

00:42:13.742 --> 00:42:15.200
But we've never
really had a chance

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.010
to build out the world
in which they live.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.630
Second, and probably
more importantly,

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.470
to be quite honest,
is we wanted to build

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.890
something that was positive,
something that we could maybe

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:31.460
counteract a lot of the really
horrendous negativity that's

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.700
been swirling around
the world lately.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.960
So we started dreaming.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:44.530
What if we could build
a nice gaming community?

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.290
What if we could
make a game where

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:52.120
everyone is encouraged to
be helpful, friendly and

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.580
inclusive?

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.290
So we've been working on
a big, beautiful game that

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.030
does just that.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.188
We call it "Beartopia."

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.330
"Beartopia" is an
honest-to-goodness game.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.710
Many VR experiences end up
being these sort of short demos.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:18.170
In "Beartopia," you play in
this rich, persistent world, one

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.410
that you can come back
to every single day.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.260
"Beartopia" is multiplayer.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.050
Everyone lives together
in this amazing village.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:33.330
And you'll meet other players
and you'll build friendships.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:39.930
And finally, "Beartopia"
is completely co-operative.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:44.370
It is our firm belief
that every single game

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:48.960
player is an immigrant
into the worlds we build.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.440
And we have a duty
as creators to ensure

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.126
that our virtual communities
bring out the best in people.

00:43:57.126 --> 00:43:59.530
In "Beartopia,"
all the players are

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.320
immigrants to this
lovely seaside village,

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.590
coming there for the first time.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.060
And in this little
utopia, we've set it

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.100
up so that everyone
can work together.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.420
Because we know that when we
mix different people from all

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:21.580
walks of life, we build strong,
exciting, vibrant communities.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:25.140
So "Beartopia" is
something really special,

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.580
and we really can't wait
to share it with you.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.950
Here is a very brief teaser.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:31.768
Thank you.

00:44:31.768 --> 00:44:36.232

00:45:22.856 --> 00:45:25.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.410
JAMIL MOLEDINA: Thank you Dank.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:34.710
As an immigrant myself,
I love that you've

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.360
made this game
that can put anyone

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.570
in the shoes of an outsider
coming to your country.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.050
Thank you for making this game.

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.000
And that's just a
glimpse into what's

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.260
coming to Daydream
and Google Play.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.070
Games are important to Google.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.890
That's why we're here at the
Game Developers Conference.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.430
We understand that engagement,
discovery, and high fidelity

00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.000
performance are important,
which inspires the advancements

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.260
Paul shared earlier.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.390
We're thrilled to see
game developers integrate

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:07.740
these trends into
their games on Android.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:11.340
And Android through Google Play
is already the world's largest

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.300
platform for games.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.130
We're working to
make sure it's also

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.380
the best platform for games.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.580
Thank you.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.680
