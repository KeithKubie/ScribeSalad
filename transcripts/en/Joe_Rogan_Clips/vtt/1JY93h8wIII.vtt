1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.110
Yeah.
But Will Smith and the rock need to make a movie together?
They never have.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.180
No.

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.550
That's to be the biggest movie in the history of knowing your history and they

4
00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:13.470
blow outs.
Tom Cruise,
get them all together.
Tom Cruise will Smith and the,

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.070
you ever interview Tom Cruise?
Uh,
no,
but only with my brain.

6
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.340
When I'm in my sensory deprivation tank,
he reaches out to me.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.970
Does he really make some MindMeld?
Yeah,
he puts on his,
uh,

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.860
Scientology earbuds.
Any,
uh,
astral traveling.
Say it's amazing.

9
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.930
Interview Time Cruise.
What's amazing about it?

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.630
It's because you hear so many different stories.

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.960
Do you wake up with your pants off?
No,
I didn't.
No,
not,
not,
not at that time.

12
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.640
Who am I?
Separateis base.
But he doesn't break eye contact with you.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.690
[inaudible] that's what I like.
No,
he just like,
Hey,
what's up?
Yeah.
Yeah.

14
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.440
And what he'll do is I get nervous.
No,
I'm not.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

15
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.110
But that's what he's doing.
He's basically nervous.
Well,

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.900
or he's just wants you to know he's,
he's locked in,
right?

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.800
Like he will not break eye contact.
Like,
if you look over,
he'd be like,

18
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.110
probably makes it harder for you ass fucked up questions to know what he does.

19
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.280
And I tell all my
what he does,

20
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.440
I tell all my friends when you interviewed Tom Cruise,
he will take,

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.790
ask him a question.
He'll try and make it three minutes long so he doesn't have,

22
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.250
you can't ask them that.
Maybe.
So you gotta learn,

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.730
you gotta build a relationship with them so then you can ask them a bunch.
See,

24
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.640
I've interviewed him so many times,
I'll walk it.

25
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.540
I remember one time I walked in the room and say,
Hey Tom,

26
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.660
I've got five minutes so we're going to have to answer these questions.

27
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.140
So I got to that point.
But he,
he's a great,
nice guy.

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.800
Did you ever get the Scientology?
No.
Never.
Is that part of the deal?

29
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.090
You can't ask him about that?
Well,

30
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.100
I heard a part of Scientology is for you to walk out the room saying how great

31
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.820
they are and I just did since I just did it.
Right.
Yeah.

32
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.370
So maybe yes it did.
It's just,

33
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.570
that's just a philosophy on like how to influence people.

34
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.640
Positively influence people.

35
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.400
You want those people really thinking the best of you.
Good strategy.
Well,

36
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.720
everybody was like,
oh,
he's crazy as this is that every time I interviewed,

37
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:02.100
he's great.
I love,
I mean,
I love Tom Cruise.
Some of my favorite people are crazy.

38
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.690
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tell me someone's crazy.
That doesn't shake me.
I'm not like,
okay,

39
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:11.370
well talk to them.
They're crazy.
My favorite people are all crazy.
Yeah.

40
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.370
Like literally crazy.
My favorite people.

41
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.940
So for someone tells me that someone's crazy.
I'm like,
okay,
what else?

42
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:22.740
You got crazy not scary to me.
Like will Smith is awesome.
He's got to be crazy.

43
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.790
Will Smith.
Sure.
No.
Oh No.
We're going on two nights,

44
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.250
two nights too smart.
No mercy.
No scientologist.

45
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.360
I have no idea.
