00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:02.026
- [Voiceover] Let's give ourselves an overview,

00:00:02.026 --> 00:00:04.649
or synthesis, of all that we've learned about plant

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.854
and animal cells, and what I have over here on the left,

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:12.057
this is supposed to be indicative of an animal cell.

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:13.786
Animal cell.

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.155
And what I have on the right, this should be indicative

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.117
of a plant cell.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.708
Plant cell.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:21.356
So let's start with the,

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:22.819
what's outside of the cell.

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.489
So we see in both of them, we see the extracellular matrix.

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.415
You see on this animal or outside of this animal cell,

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:31.515
you see all these collagen fibers and everything else,

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:33.883
all these fibers that are holding these cells into place

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:35.857
and allow these cells to relate to each other,

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:38.086
and actually, depending on what's inside of it,

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:40.455
can even help signal different things to the cells,

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:43.856
so this is an extracellular matrix.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:45.818
Now when we think about the extracellular matrix for

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.850
a plant cell, we also think about,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.184
there's some other components that are involved in the

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.960
actual cell wall,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.027
and so the cell wall is a key difference between

00:00:54.027 --> 00:00:55.791
plant and animal cells.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.853
So, the cell wall is going to be in a plant cell.

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:03.860
Animal cells don't have cell walls.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.517
Now, if we go one layer deeper, we get to the plasma

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.027
membrane, the cellular membrane,

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.815
and we see that that is common to both.

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:14.356
The animal cell is going to have a plasma membrane

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:19.220
and the plant cell is going to have a plasma membrane

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.925
and they actually can both have tunnels

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:23.911
from neighboring cells,

00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.523
or tunnels between neighboring cells.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.251
We studied that in the cell wall video for plant cells.

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:33.419
We saw these things right over here, called plasmodesmata,

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:35.753
And we can actually see a complete one over here,

00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:38.319
because I start to draw a little bit of an adjacent cell.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.611
Plasmodesmata.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.524
And in animal cells, the analog are gap junctions,

00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:51.624
which are still tunnels between adjacent cells.

00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:54.758
So, gap junctions.

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:57.440
Now, plasmodesmata are much more common to a much

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.995
wider category of plant cells than gap junctions

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:02.758
but gap junctions can be very relevant in certain types

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:04.395
of animal cells, in particular,

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:07.286
things like heart cells, where because of gap junctions

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.551
between adjacent cells,

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:11.488
electrical signals can move through the tissue

00:02:11.488 --> 00:02:14.472
and let adjacent cells know, hey, it's time to contract

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:16.887
in the right way, so this is still very crucial

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.859
for certain types of animal cells.

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.123
So now let's go a layer even deeper,

00:02:22.123 --> 00:02:24.689
and actually, before I do that, I want to reemphasize this,

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.419
and I do this in almost every video.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.857
All of these membranes that we draw,

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.587
either the outercellular membrane

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.317
or the membranes of these organelles,

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:36.218
these are all lipid bilayers, or phospholipid bilayers,

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:39.178
so if I were to zoom in, right over there,

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:41.489
on this yellow place right over there,

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.718
it looks just like a line, but it really is,

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:46.562
it really is a,

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:49.128
they really are these phospholipid,

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:51.090
these phospholipid bilayers

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.724
that have these hydrophilic heads that point outwards

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:58.288
and these hydrophobic tails that point inwards,

00:02:58.288 --> 00:03:00.192
and it keeps going, I want to make that very clear.

00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:02.526
These lipid bilayers, all of these membranes that I draw,

00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:04.755
are lipid bilayers.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:06.717
But let's keep on going.

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:08.656
So as we go now into the cell,

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:12.139
we see that both of these cells have cytoskeletons.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.274
We have cytoskeletons, so, you have your

00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:17.294
microfilaments right over here,

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:19.418
microfilaments right over here,

00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:21.450
and I'm not giving full justice to the complexity,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.087
just 'cause we want to be able to have a fairly

00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:24.747
simple-looking diagram.

00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:27.023
You have your microtubules,

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:28.625
microtubules.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.121
You might have intermediate filaments,

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.256
and we talk about all of those things in other videos,

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:37.356
but now, let's dig a little bit deeper,

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:40.827
so in the animal cells, I have these centrosomes, and they

00:03:40.827 --> 00:03:44.426
are key for organizing the microtubules,

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:47.027
and we're gonna see them a lot when we talk about mitosis.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.652
We don't see them in plant cells.

00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:51.590
They actually figure out other ways to organize

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.225
their microtubules, especially, well, in general,

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:56.756
and especially when we're thinking about something like

00:03:56.756 --> 00:04:00.018
mitosis, but let's see what other differences are here.

00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:02.213
Well one big thing that you might notice

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:07.391
is this big blue, balloon, egg-looking thing,

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.086
and this doesn't contain these green things,

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:11.350
it's really just behind these green things,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.159
and this is, these tend to be associated with plant

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.506
and fungal cells.

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:17.759
This is a central vacuole.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.951
Central vacuole.

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.552
And a central vacuole can store fluid,

00:04:23.552 --> 00:04:27.360
it can store enzymes, it can be viewed as a place for waste,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.158
and actually, it turns out that even though they're common

00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.817
to plants, that depending on which plants, which cells,

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:34.117
they can have very different roles,

00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:35.754
and I want to emphasize this to you,

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:37.495
and I do this in other videos.

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:39.446
We keep seeing all these organelles,

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.722
and we can draw pictures, we can draw diagrams of them,

00:04:41.722 --> 00:04:44.055
and we think we know what most of their functions are,

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:47.689
but almost all of these organelles and all of actually,

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.951
the cell, is an area of active research.

00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.680
In the decades to come, we're gonna find more

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.154
and more things that these different organelles do,

00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:57.325
and ways that they signal to each other and interact

00:04:57.325 --> 00:04:59.891
with each other and behave in different circumstances,

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:03.084
so we're starting to understand what's there

00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:04.721
and have an idea of what they do,

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.695
but in the decades to come, we're gonna learn much, much,

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:09.957
much more about the different structures and functions

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:11.188
of a cell, but as I mention,

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.720
this is a central vacuole.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.588
It's large, it can help provide structural support

00:05:15.588 --> 00:05:17.817
for the cell, it can help store things,

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.849
and the best analogue on the animal cells,

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.519
some animal cells actually can have a vacuole,

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:27.349
not all of them, but the best analogue is the lysosome,

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.089
so this right over, just in the orange color,

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.759
this right over here is a lysosome.

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.559
Lysosome,

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:35.661
lysosome,

00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:38.761
and a lysosome could be viewed as the waste-disoposal

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:41.826
of an animal cell, where it's going to have a bunch of

00:05:41.826 --> 00:05:45.820
enzymes in it, so that things can kind of go in there

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.993
and get broken up.

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:50.220
It has a low, a relatively low pH,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.657
a more acidic pH so that things can be broken up

00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:57.059
in different ways and then their individual pieces can be

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.857
recycled, and since we're in this category of places where

00:05:59.857 --> 00:06:03.224
things go to get, maybe, broken down or catabolized

00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:04.988
or metabolized in certain ways,

00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:08.605
it's also worth talking about the peroxisomes.

00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:11.533
Peroxisomes.

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:15.484
So the peroxisomes we actually see in both of them,

00:06:15.484 --> 00:06:17.713
and they're named that way because when they were first

00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:19.361
studied, they said, "hey there's something going on here

00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:22.217
"where there's some oxidation reactions going on here."

00:06:22.217 --> 00:06:25.352
"Well it seems like the final byproduct seems to be hydrogen

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:28.557
"peroxide," and so that's why they were named peroxisomes

00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:30.658
and we're still understanding exactly all of the things

00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:34.919
that they do, but we know that they're important for

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.927
cutting up long-chain fatty acids,

00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:40.956
so they can be more usable by other parts of the cells,

00:06:40.956 --> 00:06:42.918
but they also have other roles and all of their

00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:47.817
mechanisms are still not fully understood.

00:06:47.817 --> 00:06:50.290
Now going back to differences between the plant cell

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.518
and the animal cells, a key difference is going to be

00:06:53.518 --> 00:06:55.387
these characters right over here.

00:06:55.387 --> 00:06:56.595
These are chloroplasts.

00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:58.220
These are where photosynthesis takes place,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.554
and clearly we're gonna show it in the plant cell.

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:02.156
This is how they take, they're able to create,

00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:06.161
they're able to create, essentially, food or,

00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:08.878
I guess you could say, fixed carbon, based on light energy,

00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:11.119
so let me see, chloroplast.

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:14.219
Chloroplast, right over there.

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:16.726
We do not see that in the animal cell.

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.294
Now, when we're talking about energy,

00:07:18.294 --> 00:07:20.418
we talk about the ATP factories of cells,

00:07:20.418 --> 00:07:21.983
and we find this in both of these cells,

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.493
and that, of course, are the mitochondria,

00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:27.791
and we see the mitochondria in both of the cells,

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:29.323
and then the other things we also see a lot of

00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:29.985
common things.

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:31.726
We see golgi,

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:34.025
we see the golgi apparatus in that cell,

00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:35.720
we see golgi apparatus in that cell,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.122
and that's where we package proteins for use

00:07:39.122 --> 00:07:41.653
either within the cell or outside of the cell.

00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:44.114
We have the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:45.728
We have the rough endoplasmic reticulum

00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:48.155
that has ribosomes bound to the membrane,

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:50.418
and we have the smooth, where you don't have the ribosomes,

00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:52.857
an this is where a lot of proteins get manufactured,

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:54.192
but including and all,

00:07:54.192 --> 00:07:56.560
but even lipids also can get manufactured.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.453
Then you have, of course, the nuclear membrane.

00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:00.357
Actually, this is the inner nuclear membrane

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:01.251
right over here.

00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.259
The outer membrane is contiguous

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:04.989
with the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:06.986
but you see that in both of these cells,

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.623
and inside, of course, you have the DNA.

00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:11.583
It's in chromatin form, and then you have this, kind of,

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:14.416
extra-dense area that shows up in microscopes

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:17.156
which we call the nucleolus, which is associated,

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:19.258
which is as associated with ribosomal,

00:08:19.258 --> 00:08:22.555
with ribosome formations and ribosomal RNA,

00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:25.121
and of course, you also have free ribosomes.

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:28.395
Free, you also have free ribosomes.

00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:32.818
So this is a very high level overview of cells,

00:08:32.818 --> 00:08:34.594
eukaryotic cells, I should say,

00:08:34.594 --> 00:08:36.824
but hopefully it also starts to show you some of the

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:40.673
key distinctions between animal and plant cells.
