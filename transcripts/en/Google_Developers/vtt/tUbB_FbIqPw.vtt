[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.120
WALTER BRILL: So
thank you for coming.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.480
We got the coolest
people at I/O right here.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.610
[APPLAUSE] s

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.780
Give yourselves a hand.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.150
Excellent.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.650
Excellent.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.860
So thank you for joining me.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.350
We're going to dig into
the world of persona.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.130
First, I want to
see a show of hands.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.685
How many people brought a
persona with them today?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.494
Great.

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:30.410
It's a trick question.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.440
You all did.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.200
Oh, I better get the clicker.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.510
So we're going to talk
about how persona can

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.400
make your actions stand out.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.520
They can extend the brand, and
they can increase usability.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.740
First, I'm Wally Brill.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.310
I'm the head of conversation
design advocacy and education

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.980
here at Google, and I've
been teaching robots

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.380
to talk for about 20 years.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.970
Actually, I've been teaching
them to talk longer than that.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.850
But when I was a kid,
they didn't talk back,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.519
which was kind of depressing.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.220
So this is a previous
persona of mine.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.086
I even had hair.

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:10.980
I just want to tell you folks--

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.860
there is no distinct correlation
between hair loss and designing

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.460
personas.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.446
It's OK.

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:19.160
All right.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.000
So years ago, when I had
hair, I was a record producer.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.520
I was working mostly in the UK.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.157
And I had this idea--

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:28.865
whether it was good
or not, I'm not sure.

00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:33.470
But I wanted to create an
opera that was interactive.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.920
I wanted you to be able to talk
to the characters and change

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.030
plots, like one of those "Choose
Your Own Adventure" stories.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.580
So what did I do?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.090
I decided I would
find a technology that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.170
would work to do this.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.670
And in those days,
we were thinking

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.350
about things like CD-ROMs.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.320
I don't know if any of
you remember CD-ROMs.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.820
Yeah.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.000
Oh, I see a nod.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.050
I see a couple of nods.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.560
OK, good.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.916
Phew.

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:01.860
So I went to the company that
invented speech recognition,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.081
and I said to them, can you
tell me about this stuff.

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:06.830
And they said, well,
you know about sound.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.150
Come in here.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.640
And they made me
take a job there.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.970
And what happened was
they sent me to see

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.750
a man called James Giangola.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.690
I don't know if any
of you know of him.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.900
He was one of the pioneers
of conversational design

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.940
for interactive speech.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.580
And he gave a talk at Stanford,
which completely blew my mind,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.590
because it was about how you
can speak naturally to a robot,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.220
and it will speak
naturally back to you.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.040
He wrote a book called
"Voice User Interface

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.960
Design," which I
recommend to anybody

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.096
who's interested in this stuff.

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:44.630
So moving along, this is our
fabulous conversation design

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.660
team that I recently
joined at Google.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.505
Lots of happy faces there.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.460
Now let's get down to it.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.270
What's a persona?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.680
How do we go about designing the
perfect digital employee that's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.810
going to work for us
and make us stand out?

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.050
So what is a persona?

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.720
It's the aspect of
someone's character

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.640
that's presented or
perceived by others.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.010
It's your face that
you show to the world.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.050
It's the who of who you are
that you let people see.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.890
Now, in acting, people
use personas all the time.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.350
In the 1930s, Leslie
Howard and Norma Shearer

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.970
did a version of
"Romeo and Juliet"

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.180
that was very successful.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.040
It was very widely
liked, and it did well.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.490
Now spin on to the 1990s.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.950
And here's Leonardo
DiCaprio and Claire Danes

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.980
performing exactly
the same content

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.710
but with very
different personas.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.950
And it came across very
much more contemporary.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.280
And it was a big
success at the time

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.240
but very, very different
from that original film.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.170
Now, everybody's got
a unique persona.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.580
You get it when you're born.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.910
It changes with you as you
develop and as you grow.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.440
And like I say it's
the who of who you are.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.990
It differentiates
us one from another

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.550
and makes us individuals.

00:04:14.412 --> 00:04:16.180
But now we live in the future.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.279
There are 500 million
devices that have

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.660
the Google Assistant on them.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.430
500 million.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.680
Can I get an OK?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.650
[AUDIENCE CHEERS]

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.150
Right.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.530
That's a lot of people.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.690
It's a lot of devices too.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.630
So people have high
expectations of what

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.690
an intelligent assistant
can do and how and where we

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.880
can interact with it.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.410
And it's not just this
thing that you talk to.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.270
Now we're talking about surfaces
that the AI moves across

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.860
effortlessly from your
Google Home to your TV

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.390
to your smartphone to
your car to your watch.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.360
All these surfaces we have to
take into consideration when

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.770
we're designing persona.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.270
See?

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.680
It's not just voice.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.400
It's also audio content,
like sound design.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.910
It's visual content now.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.330
It's interaction design.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.000
The interaction design
actually has a lot

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.480
to do with how your
persona comes across.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.962
And it's even typography.

00:05:22.962 --> 00:05:25.366
Here's a quick example.

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:26.880
This is a joke.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.710
I'm not holding up any hope
for it being a great joke,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.710
but you can see that the punch
line is really punched up

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.320
because of typography.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.900
So we got to think about
visual surfaces as well

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.825
as audio situations.

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:45.690
So let's pivot for a
second and now talk

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.350
about a voice-first
world and understand why

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.540
persona design is so important.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.980
So we're going to talk
about a series of documents

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.820
that you will make when
you're designing a persona,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.050
and what they'll do is
they'll help you keep

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.850
the writing, the things
that this system says,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.240
consistent and clear
because, otherwise, it

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.590
can appear fractured.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.690
And if the persona's
fractured, people

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.560
lose trust in the actual action.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.380
So in "Wired for Speech"--

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.370
oh, sorry.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.890
There is no such thing as
no persona, by the way.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.528
That was my trick
question I stuck in there.

00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:27.290
There we go.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.990
In "Wired for Speech,"
Cliff Nass and Scott Brave

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.990
said when people
hear any voice, they

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.640
automatically and unconsciously
assign a personality to it.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.100
This is a really
important thing.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.420
Within a second, second and
a half of hearing a voice,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.760
you create an
image in your mind.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.545
You have an idea of who
you're listening to.

00:06:49.545 --> 00:06:50.420
You know what I mean?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.450
So whenever you hear--
somebody calls you up

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.880
that you don't know.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.480
You've got an idea
of who they are.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.840
You have a sense of them
because you know what?

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.820
We can infer age.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.040
We can infer gender.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.930
We understand their
educational level

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.470
by the kind of things they say.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.950
We get register.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.770
Now, register is
the social context.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.130
It's where this persona
is in relation to me.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.840
Is it my boss?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.040
Is it my employee?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.300
Is it my peer?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.460
Who is this that
I'm speaking with?

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.210
We also get a sense of locale
if they have an accent that's

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.230
different from ours.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.990
We just don't recognize accents
if we have the same one.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.460
So the other inferred
traits we get

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.700
are intelligence,
trustworthiness,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.530
and likability.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.290
All these things come through
in that first second, second

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.020
and a half of hearing a voice,
so it's really important

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.070
that we get this right.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.460
We have to set ourselves
up for success because now,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.240
more than ever, the
experience of the action

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.715
is the brand to the consumer.

00:07:55.715 --> 00:07:59.720
What happens is every
touchpoint matters.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:05.750
So billboard advertising,
the web, radio, TV,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.770
social media-- absolutely
every touchpoint

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.520
carries the brand essence.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.910
And so it's vital
that we get it right

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.564
because if we
leave it to chance,

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:19.230
you never know what
you're going to get.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.020
So you don't just use anything.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.270
You've got to
design your persona

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.850
because, otherwise, the
results will be unpredictable.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.030
So how do we do it?

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.900
How do we actually design one?

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.380
This is where some of
the fun stuff starts.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.442
We need to make that
digital employee.

00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:40.669
And what I've done
is I've suggested

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.030
we take two airlines
to map this out

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.920
and to talk about how we do it.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.775
These are two airlines that,
obviously, don't exist.

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:50.570
One is Important Airlines.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.405
It's a national carrier.

00:08:52.405 --> 00:08:54.260
It's important.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.550
You can see their strapline.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.640
"We're important, and
we will get you there."

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.630
Kind of traditional.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.440
Kind of straight.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.710
On the other hand, there's
Millennial Airlines.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.310
And their strapline is "It's
an awesome day to fly!"

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.910
Do you want to say that with me?

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.270
It's an awesome day to fly!

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.010
Once more with feeling.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.181
It's an awesome day to fly!

00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:15.680
Great.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.179
Thank you.

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:18.018
Phew.

00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:20.380
(LAUGHS)

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.450
So the first step in
designing a persona

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.925
is we need to
understand the brand.

00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:29.280
We need to interview
the stakeholders.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.410
We need to talk
to people in brand

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:36.330
and marketing, in customer
experience, customer service.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.830
We want to look to see
if there's a style guide.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.970
Now, the marketing people
and the brand people

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.190
will have already done this.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.450
They'll have distilled
their brand down.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.330
But you want to go over it and
understand it and really get

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.600
it.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.660
So you're going to
experience the product too.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.010
You're going to get on the plane
and go take a trip somewhere.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.340
You may visit the Contact Center
because those Contact Center

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.540
agents are actually carrying
the brand essence with them when

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.360
they speak to customers
over the phone.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.050
You're going to check
out social media.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.630
And if there's a
retail component,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.541
you'll go into a store.

00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:14.370
So let's talk about
Important for a second.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.470
Let's talk about my
water for a second.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.150
Here it is.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.220
So Important Airlines'
brand is solid.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.750
They're confident.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.782
They're experts.

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:25.990
They know what they're doing.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.710
They're reliable.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.520
They're utterly straightforward.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.460
There's no frills or anything.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.450
And they're safe.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.160
They've got a great
safety record.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.380
But you're not going
to get wildly excited

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.050
flying on Important.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.310
No surprises.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.680
Now, Millennial, on
the other hand, where

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.660
it's an awesome day to fly--

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.880
thank you for
helping me with that.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.400
The Millennial
Airlines' brand is bold.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.210
It's hip.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.960
It's fun.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.040
It's friendly.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.410
It's even exciting
and delightful.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.255
It's a whole different
kind of world.

00:10:57.255 --> 00:11:00.650
It's there to bring excitement
of travel into your life.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.520
So those are two sets
of brand essences.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.220
Now let's understand
the customer.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.040
We need to know who's going
to use this interaction.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.400
So we want to understand their
context and their customer

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.630
journey.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.780
We want to know who they are
through their demographics.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.830
Where do they live?

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.700
What are they like?

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.040
How old are they?

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.714
We want to understand the
frequency of engagement

00:11:26.714 --> 00:11:28.130
because that's
going to have a lot

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.160
to do with how verbose
your prompts are.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.320
If they're frequent,
frequent users,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.510
you can keep things
really short.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.370
If they're infrequent
users, you might

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.010
want to give them a
little more information.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.430
And we want to understand
their expectations and needs.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.090
Now, one thing you should
know is that people generally

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.460
like to be mirrored.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.830
They like the idea
of interacting

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.700
with someone who at least
relates to them in some ways.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.840
It's a preference.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.640
So the Important
Airlines' customer--

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.230
mid-30s and up.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.910
These are business travelers.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.560
They're frequent,
frequent flyers.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.300
They're road warriors.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.450
They're high value because those
business class and first class

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:13.960
seats are expensive.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.390
Whereas, on the other hand,
our Millennial customer

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.450
is late teens to mid-30s.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.610
They're Millennials.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.150
They're holidaymakers.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.630
They're backpackers.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.750
They're young families
going to Orlando, maybe.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.990
They're budget conscious, and
they don't use the airline

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.560
very much.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.610
They use it for holidays
once or twice a year.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.080
So we know the brand.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.870
We know the customer.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.000
Now, what task are
we going to do here?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.680
So what I've chosen is
flyfo, flight information--

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.540
that's what's the
status of my flight--

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.730
is it going to take off
on time, is it late,

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.610
has it been canceled,
when is it expected--

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.970
all that kind of good stuff--

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.665
which leads us to choosing
the medium for the audio.

00:13:04.665 --> 00:13:07.060
Now, there's two
ways to do this.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.140
You can use text
to speech, TTS--

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.740
I'm sure you all
know what that is--

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.550
versus custom
recording, which is

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.730
when you have an actor in
front of a microphone recording

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.170
prompts.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.290
Text to speech is the
computer-generated voice.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.350
Custom recording
is the human actor.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.640
So text to speech is
infinitely scalable.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.722
It's really easy to use.

00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:32.430
It's really cheap
because what it's doing

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.130
is it's reading written content.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.500
It handles dynamic
content really well.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.510
So in our case,
we've got an airline

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.660
with a lot of changes going on--

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.855
Duluth to Minneapolis,
blah blah blah--

00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:49.680
all these things that are going
and stuff changing on the fly,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.880
so we'll probably use
text to speech there.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:54.900
Oh.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.681
Can you go back one please?

00:13:57.681 --> 00:13:59.130
There we go.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:04.810
The cons are limited
voice availability.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.550
And occasionally, you'll hear--

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.080
I think Sundar mentioned
this in the keynote--

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.560
you hear prosody.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.110
And the prosody is
the melody of speech.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.690
And occasionally--
certainly in the old days--

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.140
text to speech
prosody wasn't great.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.780
I think you'll agree from what
we heard this week that it's

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.940
now phenomenally good.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.520
It's almost indistinguishable
from human speech.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.830
So "Time Out" magazine
in London decided

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.990
they would use text to speech.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.100
They do listings of events,
whatever is hip and happening.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.110
As you can see,
Sanjay Vikal said,

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.540
"From secret tango
lessons to breakfast

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.110
raves, using the Assistant
to connect Time Out visitors

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.060
to the coolest stuff to do."

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.406
And they do.

00:14:53.406 --> 00:14:56.980
They created Tio,
who is a Millennial.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.810
She's hip and happening.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.976
She knows what's going on
in London at any given time.

00:15:01.976 --> 00:15:04.100
Let me give you an example
of what she sounds like.

00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:08.640
OK, Google.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.862
Talk to Time Out.

00:15:09.862 --> 00:15:10.362
[APP CHIMES]

00:15:10.362 --> 00:15:11.990
TIO: Hey, you again.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.700
Got a quiet week ahead.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.660
Not anymore.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.670
When do you want
to go out-- today,

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.476
this week, or this weekend?

00:15:18.476 --> 00:15:20.586
WALTER BRILL: Who are you?

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:21.860
TIO: I'm Tio.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.140
No one knows the city
like me because I've

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.960
been discovering the brilliant
and searching out the secrets

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.600
and extraordinary
for a long time.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.410
If you want to know about food,
arts, culture, and nightlife,

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.900
then I am your social companion.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.680
Try me.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.050
What do you want to do and
when do you want to do it?

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.760
WALTER BRILL:
Where are you from?

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.670
TIO: In West Kensington,
born and raised.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.550
On the estate was where
I spent most of my days,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.460
chilling out, maxing,
relax and all hipster,

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.430
skating so much that
I would get a blister.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.380
With a couple of
mates, I'd go out

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.670
on the town, started seeing
my bank balance go down.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.760
I got into debt, and my
mom started to shout.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.546
She said, "You need to get a
job at a place called Time Out."

00:16:05.546 --> 00:16:07.880
What else do you want to do?

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.115
WALTER BRILL: Quit.

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:09.885
[APP CHIMES]

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:11.550
It's pretty cool, right?

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.620
It's pretty interesting.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.030
That's a pretty solid
persona, and you get

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.070
a sense of who she really is.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:23.040
Now, on the custom
recording side,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.030
Headspace, which does
meditation guidance,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:32.430
needed to use an actual real
voice, Andy Puddicombe, who is

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.050
the guy who started Headspace.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.480
And he does guided meditations.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.950
And I won't play one now because
they chill me out so much,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.110
I couldn't carry
on with this talk.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.060
But they're really, really good.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.180
And the thing about custom
recording is it's natural.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.320
It's expressive.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.610
It's comprehensible.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.550
And any voice in the
world can be used.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.820
You can go and hire anybody
to be the voice actor.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.170
Now, luckily for Headspace,
they've got Andy.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.480
He's there all the time
because sometimes it

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.120
can be expensive to
record and maintain,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.280
and it relies on the
availability of that artist.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.700
Andy goes there every
day, so he's OK.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.440
So let me play you an example
of Headspace, just a short one

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.270
to hear what the
voice sounds like.

00:17:21.144 --> 00:17:21.644
[APP CHIMES]

00:17:21.644 --> 00:17:22.730
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Hi.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.569
My name's Andy, and
welcome to Headspace.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.859
Using proven meditation
and mindfulness techniques,

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.860
I'll show you how to train your
mind for a healthier, happier,

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.585
more enjoyable life.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:35.090
To get started, try one
of our short sessions.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.665
They're each under
two minutes long.

00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:38.540
They can help bring a
little more mindfulness

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.580
into your life.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.660
There are three options
to choose from--

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.990
Wake Up, Take a
Moment, or Unwind.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.960
Which one would you like to try?

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.550
WALTER BRILL: OK.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.240
Now, because we're doing flight
information, we've chosen TTS.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.010
So the fun part.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.460
How do we design this persona?

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.010
How do we create that
perfect representative,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.282
our digital employee?

00:18:04.282 --> 00:18:05.740
What are the steps
we have to take?

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.990
This is where we get creative.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.791
Dig into that creative
brain, and let's get going.

00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.750
So we go back to the airlines.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.920
We understand the brand,
the customer, the task,

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.460
and the medium.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.580
Now we're going to go
and invent some people.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.550
We're going to write biographies
for imaginary characters who

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:28.410
might be a good fit for the
job that we have for them.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.630
So who's that perfect
representative?

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.910
Who can it be?

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.510
They got to make the
action useful and usable.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.730
They've got to be
comprehensible.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.230
They've got to be somebody that
you'd really want to work with.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.670
The first step is register.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.360
We need to know what
that social context is.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.250
We talked about this
a little bit before.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.540
What's the relationship
between me and that persona?

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.940
Is it my peer, a really
close friend of mine?

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.860
Is it an employee,
somebody that works for me

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.190
and just does whatever I
ask whenever I need it?

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.610
Or is it an advisor, somebody
who maybe knows more stuff

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.910
than me, is at somewhat
of a higher level,

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.916
and that I'm taking
information from?

00:19:16.916 --> 00:19:21.260
Now, when we do this
for real, you'll

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.370
probably want to create
three different personas.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.140
And you may make them of three
different registers-- ones

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:34.130
appear, maybe two are employees.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.580
You'll play around
with it a little bit,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.100
and you'll make the
register different for them.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.570
Now have a look at this chart.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.640
This, again, comes
from Clifford Nass.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.580
And you'll see that there's
a vertical axis, which

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.210
is dominance and submissiveness
versus friendliness

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.800
and distance.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.840
This is kind of
handy because when

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.780
you are deciding what
kind of persona you want

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.280
and how it's going to
relate to your customer,

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.830
you can use this quite
effectively to position them.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.490
Now, for Important
Airlines, we decided

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.510
we wanted a butler,
somebody like a butler,

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.090
who would relate to that
demographic that we had.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.360
Remember, they're 35 and
up, so we wanted somebody

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.160
with some gravitas.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.740
I'll give it no hints, but
it's a British airline.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.900
And so we wanted a sort
of concierge character

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.225
that you could trust.

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:37.960
So we have Terrence Butler.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.670
He's 56.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.980
His occupation is butler.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.610
He comes from Bromley in Kent,
which is a lovely suburb.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.280
Now, why do I care about
his height and weight?

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.970
Because it affects voice.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.540
It affects the
largeness of the voice

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.790
versus the smallness
of the voice,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.475
so there's a lot in
there in terms of size.

00:20:57.475 --> 00:21:00.580
He's solidly built. He's
got thinning silver hair.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.140
That's just a
shout-out to people

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.300
who are losing their hair.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.490
He lives where he works.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.100
He's single.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.010
And he went to the Ivor
Spencer International School

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.390
for Butler Administrators,
which is a real place.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.530
Can you believe it?

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.535
Phenomenal.

00:21:19.535 --> 00:21:22.390
Carrying on, he's a
collector of rare wines.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.530
Why do we care?

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.990
Because he's detail oriented.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.470
His parents-- Jack was
a retired hotel manager,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:34.360
so he understands the
hospitality industry.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.640
His mother was a retired nurse--
again, a caretaking profession.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.140
So he doesn't have any siblings.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.030
The reason we're
interested in siblings

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.910
is if you're the
oldest of four kids,

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.650
you may be a little
better at being

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.720
a caretaker than the youngest.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.850
And my family actually
works that way.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.080
I'm the youngest, and
I'm a little crazy.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.781
But my eldest brother
is very straight ahead.

00:21:57.781 --> 00:21:59.170
What does he like to watch?

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.140
He likes to watch "Upstairs,
Downstairs," "Downton Abbey."

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.050
He reads "The Daily Telegraph"
and historical fiction

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.550
by Hilary Mantel.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:11.120
He's also been 30 years in this
job, so he really knows it.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.350
Now we flash back to the
brand attributes of Important

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.005
and see how they match up.

00:22:16.005 --> 00:22:17.930
So Important is solid.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:18.880
It's confident.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.630
It's expert.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.600
It's reliable.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.060
It's straightforward.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.185
It's safe.

00:22:24.185 --> 00:22:26.290
So how does Terrence
relate to that?

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.570
Well, he's a butler.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.100
He's been a butler
for a long time.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.940
He's confident.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.720
He's expert.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.030
And he's reliable.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.320
He's very straightforward.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.760
And he's worked for that
family for over 30 years,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.970
so he's somebody you can trust.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.150
And the fact that he's an
avid collector of rare wines

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.700
tells you that he is detail
oriented, and he is an expert.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.120
Now, the next step is
we're going to create--

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.660
beyond this bio, we're going
to create two more documents.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.360
We're going to create
a monologue, which

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.270
gives us a sense of
who this character is.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.240
It's a paragraph, like a
conversation that they're

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.734
having with a friend
in a bar or somewhere,

00:23:06.734 --> 00:23:08.650
where they're just telling
them something that

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.015
happened that day or that week.

00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:15.730
And it's really just to
get us into the character

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.110
a little more deeply.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.100
And if you're using custom
recording with voice actors,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.460
it's a great way for them to
dive back into the character

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.220
if they've recorded
that monologue once,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.890
because on Monday, they
may be in the studio

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:35.080
recording for a sausage
company, and on Tuesday, they

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.090
may be doing a car commercial.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.900
But on Thursday, they're
coming in to do your action,

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.660
and you want them to
be in your persona.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.820
So that's why these
materials really help.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.220
The monologue really helps.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.240
So let me give you
an example of one.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.470
TERRENCE BUTLER: I quite
enjoy this occupation.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.590
It's extremely gratifying to
know that one is indispensable.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.510
If Sir is stepping
out of an evening,

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.340
I shall have prepared Sir's
dinner jacket and accessories.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.390
And I shall, of course, assist
him in tying his bow tie.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.375
The work of a gentleman's
gentleman is never done.

00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:14.090
WALTER BRILL: So
he's pretty formal.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.392
His language is pretty formal.

00:24:17.392 --> 00:24:19.120
And the next thing
we're going to do

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.060
is we're going to create
a sample dialogue.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.260
Now, I know that all
of you-- whenever

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.920
you decide to make an
action or create an action,

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.750
you start with conversation.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.480
You start with sample dialogues.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.780
You write the conversation
out like a two-part play.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.980
Here's the user.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.160
Here's the system.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.020
Here's the user.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.520
Here's the system.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.710
And that really
helps to tell you

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.455
whether this conversation
is natural sounding.

00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:48.820
So here's Terrence in
an actual interaction

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.660
the way he would be if he
were working in the action.

00:24:54.312 --> 00:24:56.110
OK, Google.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.585
Talk to Important Airlines.

00:24:57.585 --> 00:24:59.460
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Getting
Important Airlines.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.590
TERRENCE BUTLER: Good morning.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.205
You're through to
Important Airlines.

00:25:02.205 --> 00:25:03.746
Am I speaking with Wally?

00:25:03.746 --> 00:25:04.870
WALTER BRILL: That's right.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.994
TERRENCE BUTLER: Thank you.

00:25:05.994 --> 00:25:09.400
And do you require information
regarding your flight to London

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.195
today?

00:25:10.195 --> 00:25:12.740
WALTER BRILL: Yes.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.870
And do you require information
regarding your flight to London

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.590
today-- very formal language,
very much in persona,

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.270
very much locked
into what we would

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.608
expect for this character.

00:25:25.608 --> 00:25:29.200
Now let's move along
and go to Millennial,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.520
which is, as we know, a very
different airline indeed.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.190
So the Millennial
Airlines' persona

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.887
is a young woman we
call Helen Highwater.

00:25:41.887 --> 00:25:42.720
I'll say that again.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.370
Helen Highwater.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.890
She's 26 years old.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.350
She's a gate agent at San
Francisco International.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.220
She comes from Mill
Valley, California,

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.710
another nice suburb.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.740
She's 5' 5", 115 pounds.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.840
The general physical
description shows

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.130
that she's kind of a hipster.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.430
She's got this wild
asymmetrical haircut.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.142
She lives in a three-bedroom
apartment in the Mission with

00:26:06.142 --> 00:26:07.350
a couple of friends of hers--

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.420
Jack, who's a
software developer,

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.230
interestingly enough, and
Natalie, who's in med school.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.650
She's going out with Gary,
who's a drummer in a band called

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:17.940
The Ironic Three.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.590
Now, the reason
they're ironic is

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.460
because there are five members.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.550
She studied drama and English,
which gives her a lot of help

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:32.110
towards what she really wants to
be, which is a stand-up comic.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.190
That's her dream.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.030
She spends every free
minute working on her act.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.110
So her parents--

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.050
Ron manages the Mill Valley
branch of the Bank of Marin,

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:44.200
so she has a certain
sense of responsibility.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.500
Lucy teaches English lit at Mill
Valley Middle school, so again,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.450
a love of language.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.190
These all kind of factor in.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.610
And you may think some of these
things are not that necessary,

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.944
but I promise you, if you get
into a studio with a voice

00:26:56.944 --> 00:26:59.234
artist, they're going to go
thank you, thank you, thank

00:26:59.234 --> 00:27:00.370
you, thank you, thank you.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.369
This gives me some depth
that gives me something

00:27:02.369 --> 00:27:03.310
to work with.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.500
She doesn't have any siblings.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.580
Her work history was that she
was a bartender at Cobbs Comedy

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.780
Club.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.800
She likes "Game of
Thrones," "Stranger Things,"

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.880
"Broad City," Dua Lipa,
Amy Schumer, Amy Sedaris--

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.870
all the good stuff.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:25.020
Now go back to the brand.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.870
This brand is bold,
hip, fun, happening.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.602
They're friendly.

00:27:28.602 --> 00:27:29.310
They're exciting.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.060
And they're delightful.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.300
I think she could be a
really good match for this.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.810
So let's see how
she ties up for it.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.160
26-year-old hipster.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.690
She's hip.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.960
She works as a gate agent in
San Francisco International.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.930
She's done it for three
years without missing a day.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:46.990
She's reliable.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.630
We can count on her.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.590
She's a people person.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.560
She gets along with
everybody, even drummers.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.675
That makes her friendly and fun.

00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:57.384
And her dream is to make
a living as a stand-up.

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:59.800
Now, if you're going to be a
stand-up, you better be bold.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.960
You better be friendly.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.130
You better be fun.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.700
And please be delightful.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.700
So she's got a monologue.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.782
Let's have a listen.

00:28:09.782 --> 00:28:12.050
HELEN HIGHWATER:
I use everything.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.450
And believe me, when you
deal with the passengers,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.280
there's endless
amounts of material,

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.050
like the woman who
was going to Boston,

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.210
but her luggage was
on its way to Austin,

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.830
or the parents
off on holiday who

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.770
each expected the other one to
bring the kids to the airport.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.020
Then there's the guy who
thinks he deserves an upgrade

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.934
because he was in some obscure
rock band from 20 years ago

00:28:29.934 --> 00:28:30.475
or something.

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:33.290
Let me tell you, it's great
training for a stand-up,

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.930
and I get paid for it.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.860
And if I can deal
with them, there

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.932
isn't a heckler in the
world who can bother me.

00:28:39.932 --> 00:28:42.560
WALTER BRILL: So
pretty consistent.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.670
She is who she is.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.370
We get a sense of her
through the monologue.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.160
Now let's see what she would
be like in a sample dialogue

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.945
actually doing the job.

00:28:52.945 --> 00:28:54.490
OK, Google.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:55.924
Talk to Millennial Airlines.

00:28:55.924 --> 00:28:57.840
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Getting
Millennial Airlines.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.940
[APP CHIMES, PLAYS MUSIC]

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.860
HELEN HIGHWATER:
Millennial Airlines.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.660
It's an awesome day to fly.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.550
Is this Wally?

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.462
WALTER BRILL: Yep.

00:29:05.462 --> 00:29:06.420
HELEN HIGHWATER: Great.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.970
Do you want info about your
flight to London today?

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.130
WALTER BRILL: That's right.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:16.140
So completely different kind
of language-- do you want info,

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.700
it's an awesome day to fly--

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.600
very different than our
last persona, Terrence,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.270
because these brands
are so different.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:28.860
And we need to be
consistent to the brand.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.890
So as you can see, it
makes a difference.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.735
So in terms of
positioning these guys,

00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:42.116
where do we think they
would fit on this chart?

00:29:42.116 --> 00:29:44.430
Well, let's start with Terrence.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.600
He's kind of submissive.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.340
He's introverted.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.870
He just does what he's told.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.920
He does the job.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.190
He does it very, very
well, but he does the job.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.440
He's not overly friendly.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.790
He's not distant.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.330
He's just kind of in that
middle place somewhere.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.460
And what about Helen?

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.590
She's super friendly.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:08.580
She's an extrovert
to the extreme,

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.950
and she's a lot of fun.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.585
So she belongs right
there over on the right.

00:30:15.585 --> 00:30:17.180
The next step, which
we're not going

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.520
to dive into too
deeply right now,

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.160
is what we call user testing.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.105
Sometimes you do what's
called Wizard of Oz testing.

00:30:25.105 --> 00:30:27.500
And you can do this
effectively with dialogue

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.560
flow by actually
mocking up, quickly,

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.720
the main pass of
your interactions

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.880
and then playing
them for people,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.010
have people work
through them and get

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:42.710
a sense of how usable it is and
how much that persona matches

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.360
their ingoing expectations.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.000
So we got a few
takeaways for you.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.560
First, review the actions
you've already made.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.870
And they're wonderful, I know.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.970
But is the persona
clearly defined?

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.910
Do you feel confident
that that persona is

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.130
well imagined and well created?

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:12.870
Is it representative of the
brand, the user, and the task?

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.230
Does it work right?

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.940
Number two-- define
that persona.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.480
You're going to follow the
process, learn about the brand,

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.990
know the user, know
the task, and define

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.420
appropriate characters, which
is, for me, the fun part.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.465
And then bring it to life.

00:31:33.465 --> 00:31:35.010
Write these monologues.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.840
Write these sample dialogues.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.080
And make recordings of
them because you can only

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.380
tell about conversational
voice user interface

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.760
by listening to it.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.770
If you read it on
the page, it won't

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.810
have the same effect at all.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.640
And if you've got
stakeholders that you're

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.190
trying to talk to
about what you're doing

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.880
and to explain this is the right
thing, they've got to hear it.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.370
You don't want to give them
anything with writing on it.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.000
Just say close your eyes.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.010
Listen to this.

00:32:05.738 --> 00:32:07.260
And then test.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.480
Test your action
with real customers--

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.020
low-fidelity prototypes,
dialogue flow, however.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.120
But you want to derive
some data and some proof

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.210
points for your stakeholders
to say customers,

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.900
users really felt this
was right for our brand.

00:32:24.588 --> 00:32:28.280
And that gives you
success, I hope.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.800
I'm sure.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.390
And it will be wonderful.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.550
And you'll make
beautiful personas.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:37.900
And so with that,
I'm going to ask

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.670
you to give us some feedback.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.580
You all know the drill.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.340
And finally, here are a couple
of resources that are really

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.745
quite wonderful--
developers.google.com,

00:32:48.745 --> 00:32:52.000
google.com/io.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.520
Cathy Pearl, who just
recently joined our team,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.950
wrote a wonderful book
called "Designing Voice User

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.640
Interfaces," which
I recommend highly.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.980
Clifford Nass's book,
"Wired for Speech,"

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.480
I also recommend highly.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.870
He talks about persona
at great, great length.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:11.430
And James Giangola's "Voice
User Interface Design"

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:16.360
is a really, really
important baseline book.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.230
This kicked off a whole
generation of UI designers.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.200
So with that, thank you
very, very much for coming,

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.831
and have a wonderful
rest of I/O.

00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:25.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:30.837
[MUSIC PLAYING]
