think it's maybe like the Internet in

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740
think it's maybe like the Internet in
 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.980

1998 where you could see that it was

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990
1998 where you could see that it was
 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.609
1998 where you could see that it was
coming but it's pretty hacked together

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619
coming but it's pretty hacked together

prototype phase you know literally

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630

taking GoPros and sticking them together

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660
taking GoPros and sticking them together

aligning images so they stitch correctly

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740

and popping phones into plastic holders

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070
and popping phones into plastic holders
 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.790
and popping phones into plastic holders
I mean all of that is going away and is

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800
I mean all of that is going away and is
 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.750
I mean all of that is going away and is
being replaced with the real tools we're

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760
being replaced with the real tools we're
 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.120
being replaced with the real tools we're
getting real VR cameras we've built an

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130
getting real VR cameras we've built an
 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.040
getting real VR cameras we've built an
automated stitching pipeline and we're

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050
automated stitching pipeline and we're
 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.230
automated stitching pipeline and we're
gonna have headsets that are affordable

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240
gonna have headsets that are affordable
 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.900
gonna have headsets that are affordable
and easily accessible and so I think

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910
and easily accessible and so I think
 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.260
and easily accessible and so I think
we're really learning from just the the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270
we're really learning from just the the
 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.480
we're really learning from just the the
difficulty of that the technical

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490
difficulty of that the technical
 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.689
difficulty of that the technical
challenges of creating VR and and some

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699
challenges of creating VR and and some
 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.440
challenges of creating VR and and some
of those challenges are melting away the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450
of those challenges are melting away the
 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.540
of those challenges are melting away the
language of it is actually much harder

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550
language of it is actually much harder
 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.420
language of it is actually much harder
how do we use this effectively we're

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430
how do we use this effectively we're
 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.310
how do we use this effectively we're
finding things that do work we're

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320
finding things that do work we're
 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.570
finding things that do work we're
finding a lot of things that don't work

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580
finding a lot of things that don't work
 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.080
finding a lot of things that don't work
but we know that these experiences need

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
but we know that these experiences need
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.600
but we know that these experiences need
to be longer there have been pretty

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610
to be longer there have been pretty
 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.510
to be longer there have been pretty
short you know under 10 minutes we're

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520
short you know under 10 minutes we're
 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.340
short you know under 10 minutes we're
we're finding that the longer you spend

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350
we're finding that the longer you spend
 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.220
we're finding that the longer you spend
in VR and it has to be comfortable the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230
in VR and it has to be comfortable the
 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.219
in VR and it has to be comfortable the
more immersion and feeling that you are

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
more immersion and feeling that you are
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.890
more immersion and feeling that you are
in that world the more your mind starts

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900
in that world the more your mind starts
 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.430
in that world the more your mind starts
to accept it and so we're creating

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440
to accept it and so we're creating
 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.399
to accept it and so we're creating
potentially 40 minutes of content up to

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409
potentially 40 minutes of content up to
 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.800
potentially 40 minutes of content up to
60 minutes where you can go in have

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810
60 minutes where you can go in have
 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.440
60 minutes where you can go in have
these long durations and come out and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
these long durations and come out and
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.719
these long durations and come out and
have these you know profound experiences

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729
have these you know profound experiences
 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.390
have these you know profound experiences
within that time frame we know that the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400
within that time frame we know that the
 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.390
within that time frame we know that the
visual fidelity needs to get much better

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400
visual fidelity needs to get much better
 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.039
visual fidelity needs to get much better
right now we're at four K by 2 K and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049
right now we're at four K by 2 K and
 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.830
right now we're at four K by 2 K and
when stretched out at 360 degrees it

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840
when stretched out at 360 degrees it
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.740
when stretched out at 360 degrees it
looks low res you know we need

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750
looks low res you know we need
 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.030
looks low res you know we need
resolutions of 8k by 4k frame rates 60

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040
resolutions of 8k by 4k frame rates 60
 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.119
resolutions of 8k by 4k frame rates 60
frames per second we need perfect

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129
frames per second we need perfect
 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.890
frames per second we need perfect
synchronization between all of these

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900
synchronization between all of these
 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.800
synchronization between all of these
cameras and ambisonics audio where an

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810
cameras and ambisonics audio where an
 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.059
cameras and ambisonics audio where an
audio source sounds

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069
audio source sounds
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.339
audio source sounds
like it's actually coming from this

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349
like it's actually coming from this
 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.069
like it's actually coming from this
position when all of these factors start

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079
position when all of these factors start
 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.459
position when all of these factors start
combining we're gonna have these high

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469
combining we're gonna have these high
 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.489
combining we're gonna have these high
fidelity experiences where the fluidity

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:27.499
fidelity experiences where the fluidity
 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.610
fidelity experiences where the fluidity
of a motion that can transfer in these

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620
of a motion that can transfer in these
 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.580
of a motion that can transfer in these
worlds is going to be unparalleled and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590
worlds is going to be unparalleled and
 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.800
worlds is going to be unparalleled and
so I think we're just beginning on this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810
so I think we're just beginning on this
 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.789
so I think we're just beginning on this
curve of VR where the technology the

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799
curve of VR where the technology the
 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.559
curve of VR where the technology the
storytelling they're starting to come

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569
storytelling they're starting to come
 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.360
storytelling they're starting to come
together where we're passing the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370
together where we're passing the
 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.819
together where we're passing the
prototype phase and we can actually use

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829
prototype phase and we can actually use
 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.550
prototype phase and we can actually use
it to create these profound experiences

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560
it to create these profound experiences
 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.039
it to create these profound experiences
where people come out after you know

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049
where people come out after you know
 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.319
where people come out after you know
even ten minutes come out of a headset

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329
even ten minutes come out of a headset
 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.569
even ten minutes come out of a headset
and there they will say they're you know

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579
and there they will say they're you know
 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.659
and there they will say they're you know
I I was so moved by that and a year

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669
I I was so moved by that and a year
 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.369
I I was so moved by that and a year
later we'll come back and say that

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379
later we'll come back and say that
 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.099
later we'll come back and say that
experience changed my life and I and I

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109
experience changed my life and I and I
 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.610
experience changed my life and I and I
haven't heard that before in films and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
haven't heard that before in films and
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.220
haven't heard that before in films and
images that a short experience can have

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230
images that a short experience can have
 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.890
images that a short experience can have
such a profound and lasting impact and

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
such a profound and lasting impact and
 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.020
such a profound and lasting impact and
so I think there is this real potential

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030
so I think there is this real potential
 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.509
so I think there is this real potential
that we're just starting to crack but

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519
that we're just starting to crack but
 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.860
that we're just starting to crack but
right now it's a little bit of radio on

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870
right now it's a little bit of radio on
 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.780
right now it's a little bit of radio on
the television it's an entirely new

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790
the television it's an entirely new
 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.240
the television it's an entirely new
medium so a lot of the cinematic

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250
medium so a lot of the cinematic
 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.999
medium so a lot of the cinematic
language from traditional documentary

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:25.009
language from traditional documentary
 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:29.860
language from traditional documentary
and cinema it has to be rethought in

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870
and cinema it has to be rethought in
 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.629
and cinema it has to be rethought in
this new medium of VR from the basics of

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639
this new medium of VR from the basics of
 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.999
this new medium of VR from the basics of

working a 360 degree environment cuts
 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.909
working a 360 degree environment cuts
are can be very abrupt and kind of take

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919
are can be very abrupt and kind of take
 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.679
are can be very abrupt and kind of take
time for the viewer to reorient

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689
time for the viewer to reorient
 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.170
time for the viewer to reorient
themselves in a new scene so even some

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180
themselves in a new scene so even some
 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.499
themselves in a new scene so even some
of these real basics change so we're

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:53.509
of these real basics change so we're
 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.390
of these real basics change so we're
still learning what this language looks

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400
still learning what this language looks
 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.330
still learning what this language looks
like but we know it's very spacial you

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340
like but we know it's very spacial you
 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.879
like but we know it's very spacial you
are feeling like you're actually there

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889

strong you are starting to interpret

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709
strong you are starting to interpret
 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.619
strong you are starting to interpret
your brain is interpreting these scenes

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629
your brain is interpreting these scenes
 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.170
your brain is interpreting these scenes
as real and your body is reacting to

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
as real and your body is reacting to
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.589
as real and your body is reacting to
them as they're real as well so you can

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599
them as they're real as well so you can
 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.349
them as they're real as well so you can
have these very intense or meditative

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359
have these very intense or meditative
 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.479
have these very intense or meditative
experiences in VR depending on how you

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489
experiences in VR depending on how you
 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.289
experiences in VR depending on how you
use it

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299
use it
 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.810
use it
we first thought that the whole crew had

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820
we first thought that the whole crew had
 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.640
we first thought that the whole crew had
to disappear from a shot

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650
to disappear from a shot
 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.469
to disappear from a shot
and so we would set it up on a tripod

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479
and so we would set it up on a tripod
 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.559
and so we would set it up on a tripod
and everybody would leave and

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569
and everybody would leave and
 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.689
and everybody would leave and
get what we'd get but then you know that

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699
get what we'd get but then you know that
 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.429
get what we'd get but then you know that
was very limiting to shoot everything on

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:32.439
was very limiting to shoot everything on
 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.709
was very limiting to shoot everything on
tripod we really wanted to move with the

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719
tripod we really wanted to move with the
 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.469
tripod we really wanted to move with the
camera and move with our subjects so we

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479
camera and move with our subjects so we
 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.749
camera and move with our subjects so we
decided to leave our camera operator in

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759
decided to leave our camera operator in
 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.379
decided to leave our camera operator in
the shot

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389
the shot
 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.719
the shot
carrying the VR camera which we really

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729
carrying the VR camera which we really
 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.429
carrying the VR camera which we really
streamlined in wait so that we could put

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439
streamlined in wait so that we could put
 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.739
streamlined in wait so that we could put
it on stabilized gimbal this allowed us

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:46.749
it on stabilized gimbal this allowed us
 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.689
it on stabilized gimbal this allowed us
to move the camera through space which

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699
to move the camera through space which
 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.230
to move the camera through space which
hadn't really been done before in VR but

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240
hadn't really been done before in VR but
 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.179
hadn't really been done before in VR but
in a really comfortable way if it's

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189
in a really comfortable way if it's
 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.909
in a really comfortable way if it's
moving in a straight forward in a level

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919

manner it's comfortable for the viewer
 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.079
manner it's comfortable for the viewer
in the headset but it also really

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:01.089
in the headset but it also really
 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.149
in the headset but it also really
heightens this sense of space when

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159
heightens this sense of space when
 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.029
heightens this sense of space when
you've got this much more information

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039
you've got this much more information
 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.730
you've got this much more information
passing by you you really start to feel

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740
passing by you you really start to feel
 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.399

the camera operator was in the shot if

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569
the camera operator was in the shot if
 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:14.639
the camera operator was in the shot if
you look behind you

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:14.649
you look behind you

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:17.439
there he is holding the camera and you
 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.219
there he is holding the camera and you
know that broke the standard rule of no

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229
know that broke the standard rule of no

you can't hide everybody and he was just

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:30.369
you can't hide everybody and he was just
 

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:32.369
you can't hide everybody and he was just
part of the scene and some people really

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379
part of the scene and some people really
 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.049
part of the scene and some people really
enjoyed it they wanted to know sort of

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:34.059
enjoyed it they wanted to know sort of
 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.269

what he was feeling in response to some

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279
what he was feeling in response to some
 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.429
what he was feeling in response to some
of the things that he was filming and

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:38.439
of the things that he was filming and
 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.589
of the things that he was filming and
there he was taking them through so

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599
there he was taking them through so
 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.509
there he was taking them through so
here's that's just one example of where

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:42.519
here's that's just one example of where
 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:44.009
here's that's just one example of where
we sort of discarded a rule that had

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:44.019
we sort of discarded a rule that had
 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:46.439
we sort of discarded a rule that had
been established made a new one and I'm

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449
been established made a new one and I'm
 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.499
been established made a new one and I'm
sure new ones will replace that so we're

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509
sure new ones will replace that so we're
 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.649

and what's effective filming anything

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199
and what's effective filming anything
 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.529
and what's effective filming anything
that has the potential to be very

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539
that has the potential to be very
 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.799
that has the potential to be very
emotional that will transfer very well

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:04.809
emotional that will transfer very well
 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.980
emotional that will transfer very well
in VR filming things that are hard to

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990
in VR filming things that are hard to
 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.639
in VR filming things that are hard to
