00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So if we're going to generate random keys,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we need some understanding of what randomness is.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a very deep, philosophical question,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I'm not much of a philosopher,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so let's try a quiz instead.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the question is which of these sequences is the most random?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So here are the sequences.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I won't try to read them,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but see if you can figure out which one of these is the most random.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I should warn you in advance

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this is a bit of a trick question,

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
if you haven't already decided that.
