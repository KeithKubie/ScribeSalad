If you're like me,
when you hear the words

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.204
"Alaskan divorce court"
you probably have some

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:06.173
picture in your head of, like,
a 70-year-old bounty hunter

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.774
arm-wrestling
a one-legged prostitute

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:10.477
over who gets the fishing rights
up at Dead Guy Lake.

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:13.614
It's always the bear, by
the way. It's always the bear.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.015
But last week,
in a progressive move,

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:18.318
Alaskan courts became the first
in the nation to reclassify pets

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.355
in divorce proceedings
to allow for joint custody.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.156
It's a very revolutionary...

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.925
Are you guys thinking
about getting divorced?

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.894
-Is this why you're very
excited? "Oh, you can do that."

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.296
It's a very revolutionary move
in divorce proceedings

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.698
because everywhere else, dogs
are treated basically the same

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.400
as a car,
which was causing problems

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.969
in some parts of Alaska
where their dog

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.071
-is technically their car.
-(laughter)

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.974
Uh... so...

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.545
-(applause)
-This made me realize...

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.247
Made me realize I don't think
most of us have any idea

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.349
what goes on
in an Alaskan divorce court.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:50.651
So comedians, what is another

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.287
rule you'd hear
in an Alaskan divorce court?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.723
-Jenny. -That you are entitled
to a no-fault divorce

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:59.560
if your spouse (bleep) a Yeti
or Sarah Palin.

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:00.827
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:02.429
-Points.
-Oh, yeah.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.598
-HARDWICK: Andrew.
-Oh.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.667
Two-drink minimum,
don't touch the dancers.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.469
-Next up-- Areola Borealis!
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:11.905
HARDWICK: Points.
Oh, what a great stripper name!

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.607
(applause)

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.643
-Oh, that's the best stripper
name ever. -Thank you, dude.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.078
-Erik.
-Okay, uh,

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.581
you can walk away scot-free

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.516
if you didn't get a good look
at them

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.484
because it's dark for six months
out of the year.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:24.585
-HARDWICK: Yeah. Points.
-(laughter)
