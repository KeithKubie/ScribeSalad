00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.089
I got a big bottle of corn syrup, a couple boxes of blue jello, and this silicone chicken mold we cast from a real chicken

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.080
because in this video

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.710
we're gonna see if we can make it gummy.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.200
So you've seen my videos of making Lego gummies and this recipes pretty much gonna be the same.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.459
I'm just gonna make it about eight times bigger, and I don't exactly know how much gummies syrup.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.040
I'm going to need but I'm just going to make too much and whatever's left over

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.559
I can always remelt it use it for another project anyway.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.380
Dang.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.200
Surprisingly that sucked up almost all of the gummy syrup. There's only a cup or so left in there.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.040
I thought we were going to have like half of this leftover,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.329
but no that chicken mold just like sucked up the entire batch that's crazy now

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.930
all we have to do is give this thing 12 to 24 hours to set up and get firm

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.780
and then we can crack this open tomorrow morning and see how it turned out.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.270
Now this might be a good time to talk about the type of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.999
silicone we were using the cast this chicken. In my last video,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.609
I saw a few comments wondering if the silicone was poisonous,

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.079
and if you were using something like contractor silicone that you use for building houses then the answer would be yes.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.868
This has an acid in it that will irritate your skin and your eyes. You don't want to use general purpose silicone like this.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.060
I was using a food grade silicone,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.880
which is specifically made for handling food. This is called casting silicone and it's the stuff that comes in a two-part mix.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.610
So you can mix it together,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.970
and I'll put a link in the description to where you can find a kit very similar to the stuff that I was using.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.819
So here we are guys, it's been about 18 hours.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.139
I let this thing set for about an hour and a half until it got firm and then I put it in the fridge

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.500
overnight and now you can see it's actually quite gummy.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.840
This thing's hardened up to the point where I think we can start peeling the mold off.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.380
Looks like somebody else has been touching it with their fingers.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.040
Haha! I wonder if my kids have been down here. I got my drill.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.160
We're going to unscrew all the bolts, and we're gonna slowly peel this mold apart and see what our chicken looks like inside.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
There we go. Yes!

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.580
So there's our silicone block.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.939
Now all we have to do is just gently peel away at the edges here

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.190
until the gummy releases. Now when we're taking this out of the mold we want to be very gentle with it.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.410
We want to just gently pry at the edges and as we do that

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.380
you can see the gummy kind of pulls away and releases.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.600
This is a really intricate mold and I don't want to rip the gummy so it's important

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.100
we go really slow and just be very careful what we pull out. Here, come take a look at this.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140
There we go, I can feel it coming.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.080
Alright, so there's one half of our mold and you can see

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.520
it's actually,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.839
genuinely starting to look a bit like a chicken. It looks like it might actually work.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.590
We got like half of our chicken exposed there. Peel this up on there.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.419
Just gonna do a little episiotomy here. There we go.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.479
There's our little wingtip. Perfect. Chicken wing is free. The leg is free. Oh, it came out!

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.450
Yes, it came out, and it's perfect. It's just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.400
unbelievable, this is so realistic. [making chicken noises]

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.919
I mean if you look at this chicken, it looks identical to the chicken

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.500
I got before.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.839
Check out the wing here. If I pull the wing apart, you can see it looks just like a real chicken wing and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.940
the chicken legs - we could probably cut that off and have a nice gummy drumstick.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.020
The chickens even got a tail. If you lift the legs up, you can see - you can even go inside the chicken.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.540
I mean, this is kind of gross, but check this out.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.500
This is where all the chicken innards would have been. How realistic is this guys!

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.000
It's unbelievable.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.000
[Grant speaking] So what do you think? [Wife speaking] That looks so gross.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
[Grant speaking] Oh, it looks gross?

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.709
[Wife speaking] Yea, it looks just like a chicken,

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.719
but it's blue, and like all the texture on the chicken is so weird. [Grant speaking] I know but the skin is the best part.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.430
[Wife speaking] Yeah, it looks awesomely gross.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.940
[Grant speaking] Yeah, isn't that cool though, and we got a mold so we can do it again and again and again.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.469
This is like surprisingly true to life. It's almost too good to eat.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.299
We need to grab a knife and carve this thing open and feed it to the family. Gummy chickens served. [Kids cheering]

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760
Who wants the first gummy drumstick?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760
[Kids speaking ] Me, me, me, me, me, me!

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.220
[Girl speaking] I asked first.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220
[Grant speaking] Look at that.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.220
[Wife speaking] That looks like a luscious piece.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.290
[Grant speaking] Now I had a little bit of leftover gummy,

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.910
so I just poured it into these molds that I made for my silver play button, and they're, uh,  really fun.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.789
They're really stretchy, really rubbery, but they taste amazing.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.360
So there you have a guy's. A real genuine gummy chicken made from a chicken. And because it's a mold, we can reuse it over

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.950
and over and over again, and we could probably even make chocolate chickens. That is so freakin' cool!

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.950
I can't believe this worked out so well.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.179
Thanks so much for joining me for this experiment. I'll be looking for in the next video. Talk to you then.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.869
Mmm, gummy. I think I burned it a little.

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:49.000
