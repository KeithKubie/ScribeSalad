00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This one may not be obvious.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The best way to reduce the percent error is actually to use a giant rod.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And what's the reason for that?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The way we calculate percent error is by comparing the absolute error

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to some true value.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Since we have a fixed absolute error here of 1cm,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that error doesn't grow even if the shadow gets longer and longer and longer.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is just the fuzziness associated with measuring a shadow.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have a fixed 1cm up here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
To make this percent error as small as possible,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we want to divide that 1cm by as large a value as we can.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And the true value of the shadow's length, we can make that larger and larger and larger

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
by just using a bigger and bigger and bigger rod.
