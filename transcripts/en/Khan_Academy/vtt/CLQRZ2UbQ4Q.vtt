00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.610
Let's do a few
more examples where

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.120
we're evaluating expressions
with unknown variables.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.110
So this first one we're told 3x
plus 3y plus 3z is equal to 1,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.810
and then we're asked what's
12x plus 12y plus 12z equal to?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.060
And I'll give you a few
moments to think about that.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.560
Well let's rewrite
this second expression

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.760
by factoring out the 12, so we
get 12 times x plus y plus z.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.260
That's this second
expression here,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.240
and you can verify that
by distributing the 12.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.820
You'll get exactly
this right up here.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.490
Now, what is 12 times
x plus y plus z?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.420
Well, we don't know yet
exactly what x plus y plus z

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.400
is equal to, but this first
equation might help us.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.820
This first equation, we can
rewrite this left-hand side

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.180
by factoring out the 3, so we
could rewrite this as 3 times

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.640
x plus y plus z is equal to 1.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.070
All I did is I factored the
3 out on the left-hand side.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310
And then if I want to
solve for x plus y plus z,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.300
I just divide both sides
of this equation by 3,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.520
and I'm left with x plus
y plus z is equal to 1/3,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.720
and so here, instead of x plus
y plus z, I can write 1/3.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.856
So this whole thing
simplified to 12 times 1/3.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:28.580
12 times 1/3 is the same
thing as 12 divided by 3,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.720
which is equal to 4.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.680
Let's try one more.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.800
So here we are told that
3a plus 5b is equal to 2,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.910
and then we're asked what's 15a
plus 15b going to be equal to?

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.250
So we might-- let's see.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.792
I'll give you a few moments to
try to tackle this on your own.

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's see how we might do it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.080
We could approach
it the way we've

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.746
approached the last
few problems, trying

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:56.210
to rewrite the
second expression.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.491
We could rewrite it as 15
times a plus b, and so we just

00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:01.990
have to figure out
what a plus b is,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.200
and we'll be able to
evaluate this expression.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.410
And so, it's tempting
to look up here,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.960
and say maybe we can solve
for a plus b somehow,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.840
but we really can't.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.370
If we divide-- if we
try to factor out a 3,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.050
we'll get 3 times a plus
5/3b, so this doesn't really

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.810
simplify things in
terms of a plus b.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.450
If we try to factor out a 5,
we'd get 5 times 3/5a plus b

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.720
is equal to 2, but
neither of these

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.370
gets us in a form where we
can then solve for a plus b.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.120
So in this situation,
we actually

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.760
do not have enough information
to solve this problem.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.360
So it's a little bit of a trick.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.280
Not enough info to solve.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.210
Anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.
