00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:01.144
- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video

00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:03.814
is get some practice building an important skill,

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:07.656
being able to look at some algebra that has happened

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:09.224
and see whether it is correct.

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:10.014
And this is valuable.

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:11.448
You might look at other people's' work,

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.380
you might look at your own work and be able to tell,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.290
"Well, hey, did I do that right?"

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.131
The logic maybe broke down.

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:19.502
Or why am I not getting the answer

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:21.126
that I think I should get?

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.309
So let's get some practice here.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.284
So I have an equation,

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.326
nine times, and then in parentheses,

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:30.702
two x plus 1/3 is equal to 39.

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:32.188
And then someone has worked it out.

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.997
This is step one, step two, then step three.

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:37.459
They get to this solution, x equals two.

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:39.525
What I want you to do is pause this video

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.752
and figure out, is this solution correct?

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.260
Did all of the steps they do, do they make logical sense,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.048
do they make algebraic sense?

00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:49.254
Or did they make a mistake in one of these steps,

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:52.052
and if so, which of these steps did they make a mistake in?

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:55.523
All right, so let's just work through this problem

00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.961
and see if all of these steps are reasonable.

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.326
So in this first step, let's see, they got an 18x here,

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.161
so it looks like they distributed the nine.

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:07.636
So nine times two x would be 18x, and then of course,

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:10.190
you would also have to do nine times 1/3.

00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:13.326
Nine times 1/3 would be 9/3, or three,

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:14.394
so that seems reasonable.

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:16.855
And you still have a 39 here on the right-hand side.

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.595
So step one checks out.

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:21.368
Now, let's see, what did they do over here?

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:24.904
After step one, or at this stage,

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:26.738
you had 18x plus three,

00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:28.851
and then over here you only have 18x.

00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:30.964
So they must've subtracted three

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:33.681
from the left-hand side to get rid of this three.

00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.079
So they subtracted three from the left-hand side.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.559
Well, if they subtract three from the left-hand side,

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:40.019
they also need to subtract three from the right-hand side,

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.948
and it looks like they did.

00:01:40.948 --> 00:01:45.244
39 minus three is 36. So that step checks out.

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:48.123
And so you have 18x is equal to 36.

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:49.210
And so to solve for x,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.022
you would just wanna divide both sides by 18.

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:56.853
So you would get x is equal to 36 over 18, or 2.

00:01:56.853 --> 00:01:58.966
So all of these steps check out,

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:02.333
and so there's no problem here, no mistake.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:06.952
And you can verify that x does indeed equal two.

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:11.435
Let's do some more questions,

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:15.266
or see if we can identify more errors or maybe no errors.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:20.165
All right, we have 8/3 is equal to three times c plus 5/3,

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:21.767
and we wanna solve for c.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:25.956
Pause the video and see if any of these mistakes are,

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:28.216
or if any of these steps, are incorrect

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.716
or maybe there's no mistake at all.

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.402
All right, let's go step by step.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:35.467
So in step one, kept the left-hand side the same.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:36.953
The right-hand side, let's see,

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:38.973
you go from three times this to three c,

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:41.155
so it looks like they're distributing the three.

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:44.243
So three times c is indeed three c,

00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:47.540
and then you wanna distribute three times 5/3,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.817
well, that's gonna be five.

00:02:48.817 --> 00:02:50.141
That's not gonna be 5/3.

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.508
This thing right over here, this thing needs to be five,

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:56.549
not 5/3, so that is not correct.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.079
So step one is where we have the problem.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.981
Let's keep going. Let's do one more of these.

00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.077
I find this strangely entertaining.

00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:06.325
All right, this is a little bit simpler.

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:09.273
1/4 r plus two is equal to 10.

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:11.880
And then they immediately go from that to just 1/4 r,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.318
so they got rid of this two on the left-hand side.

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:17.011
Well, to do that you could subtract two from the left,

00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:18.312
but, of course, you would also have to do that

00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:20.564
from the right-hand side.

00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:22.746
And so you get 1/4 r plus two minus two,

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:24.093
that would be just 1/4 r.

00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:26.021
So the left-hand side makes sense.

00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.551
10 minus two is not 12.

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.081
10 minus two is eight.

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.404
This right over here should be eight.

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:34.937
They added two on the right-hand side.

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:36.957
They subtracted two on the left-hand side,

00:03:36.957 --> 00:03:39.023
and they added two on the right-hand side.

00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:41.020
Then the equality wouldn't hold anymore.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.692
So you definitely have an error.

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:45.269
Step one is not correct.
