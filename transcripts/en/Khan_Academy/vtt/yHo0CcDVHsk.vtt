00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.610
Write the equation of the
function f of x graphed below.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.614
And so we have this
clearly periodic function.

00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:08.280
So immediately you
might say, well, this

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.050
is either going to be a sine
function or a cosine function.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.240
But its midline
and its amplitude

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.300
are not just the plain vanilla
sine or cosine function.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.800
And we can see that
right over here.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.250
The midline is halfway
between the maximum point

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.420
and the minimum point.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.070
The maximum point right over
here, it hits a value of y

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.100
equals 1.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.070
At the minimum points,
it's a value of y

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.170
is equal to negative 5.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.800
So halfway between
those, the average of 1

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.010
and negative 5, 1 plus
negative 5 is negative 4.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.370
Divided by 2 is negative 2.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.500
So this right over
here is the midline.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.330
So this is y is
equal to negative 2.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.895
So it's clearly shifted down.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.910
Actually, I'll talk
in a second about what

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.830
type of an expression
it might be.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.400
But now, also, let's
think about its amplitude.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.970
Its amplitude--
that's how far it

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.580
might get away from the
midline-- we see here.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.120
It went 3 above the midline.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.470
Going from negative 2 to 1,
it went 3 above the midline

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.680
at the maximum point.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.430
And it can also go 3 below the
midline at the minimum point.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.195
So this thing clearly
has an amplitude of 3.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.040
So immediately, we
can say, well, look.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.240
This is going to have
a form something like f

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.260
of x is equal to
the amplitude 3.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.110
We haven't figured
out yet whether this

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.310
is going to be a cosine
function or a sine function.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.060
So I'll write "cosine" first.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.107
Cosine maybe some coefficient
times x plus the midline.

00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:46.690
The midline-- we
already figured out--

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.880
was minus 2 or negative 2.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.940
So it could take
that form or it could

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.800
take f of x is equal to 3
times-- it could be sine

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.440
of x or sine of some
coefficient times x.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.320
Sine of kx minus 2 plus
the midline-- so minus 2.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.274
So how do we figure
out which of these are?

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:11.690
Well, let's just think about
the behavior of this function

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.880
when x is equal to 0.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.610
When x is equal to
0, if this is kx,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.580
then the input into the
cosine is going to be 0.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.311
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:24.810
Whether you're talking about
degrees or radians, cosine of 0

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.570
is 1.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.690
While sine of 0-- so
if x is 0, k times

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.240
0 is going to be
0-- sine of 0 is 0.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.010
So what's this thing doing
when x is equal to 0?

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.860
Well, when x is equal to
0, we are at the midline.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.480
If we're at the midline, that
means that all of this stuff

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.890
right over here evaluated to 0.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.100
So since, when x equals 0, all
of this stuff evaluated to 0,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.830
we can rule out the
cosine function.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.770
When x equals 0 here, this
stuff doesn't evaluate to 0.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.280
So we can rule out this
one right over there.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.070
And so we are left with this.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.030
And we just really
need to figure out--

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.250
what could this
constant actually be?

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.710
And to think about
that, let's look

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.620
at the period of this function.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.390
Let's see.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.480
If we went from
this point-- where

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.680
we intersect the midline--
and we have a positive slope,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.620
the next point that we do
that is right over here.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.195
So our period is 8.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.650
So what coefficient
could we have

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.710
here to make the period of
this thing be equal to 8?

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.880
Well, let us just
remind ourselves

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.260
what the period of sine of x is.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.510
So the period of
sine of x-- so I'll

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.660
write "period" right
over here-- is 2pi.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.030
You increase your angle by
2 pi radians or decrease it.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.720
you're back at the same
point on the unit circle.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.550
So what would be the
period of sine of kx?

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.170
Well, now, your x, your input
is increasing k times faster.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.890
So you're going to get to the
same point k times faster.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.300
So your period is going
to be 1/k'th as long.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.030
So now your period is
going to be 2 pi over k.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.500
Notice, as x increases, your
argument into the sine function

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.100
is increasing k times as fast.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.630
You're multiplying it by k.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.130
So your period is
going to be short.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.490
It's going to take you less
distance for the whole argument

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.200
to get to the same point
on the unit circle.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.920
So let's think
about it this way--

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:45.660
so if we wanted to say 2
pi over k is equal to 8,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.030
well, what is our k?

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.530
Well, we could take the
reciprocal of both sides.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.520
We get k over 2 pi
is equal to 1/8.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.560
Multiply both sides by 2pi.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.360
And we get k is
equal to-- let's see.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.920
This is 1.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.962
This is 4.

00:05:06.962 --> 00:05:09.800
k is equal to pi/4.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.610
And we are done.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.370
And you can verify that by
trying out some of these points

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.340
right over here.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.200
This function is equal to 3
sine of pi over 4x minus 2.
