nature of the site and it was the site

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600
nature of the site and it was the site
 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.270

includes a memorial for that as users of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590
includes a memorial for that as users of
 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.990
includes a memorial for that as users of
a place we experienced things in very

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000
a place we experienced things in very
 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.020
a place we experienced things in very
different ways based on our previous

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030
different ways based on our previous
 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.400
different ways based on our previous
notions and our our place in the world

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410
notions and our our place in the world
 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.059
notions and our our place in the world
and so my thought is that architecture

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069
and so my thought is that architecture
 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.270
and so my thought is that architecture
really allows you to explore the self

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280
really allows you to explore the self
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.729
really allows you to explore the self
through an experience and the thing is

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739
through an experience and the thing is
 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.050
through an experience and the thing is
with these three different groups of

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
with these three different groups of
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.980
with these three different groups of
people for the residents

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
people for the residents
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.710
people for the residents
their history dates back so far in time

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
their history dates back so far in time
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.080
their history dates back so far in time
that they remember this place as

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
that they remember this place as
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.060
that they remember this place as
something that has been very politically

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070
something that has been very politically
 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.680
something that has been very politically
charged and it has a very different

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
charged and it has a very different
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.450
charged and it has a very different
meaning for them than the people who are

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460
meaning for them than the people who are
 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.460
meaning for them than the people who are
coming to the site to get a view of the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470
coming to the site to get a view of the
 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.290
coming to the site to get a view of the
city to get that picture postcard photo

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300
city to get that picture postcard photo
 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.160
city to get that picture postcard photo
so I think that that interaction between

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
so I think that that interaction between
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.870
so I think that that interaction between
people is something that is really

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880
people is something that is really
 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.290
people is something that is really
powerful but that the architecture there

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
powerful but that the architecture there
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.420
powerful but that the architecture there
can really help mediate that meaning and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
can really help mediate that meaning and
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.110
can really help mediate that meaning and
that experience between the people and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
that experience between the people and
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.030
that experience between the people and
this summer I hope to prepare a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
this summer I hope to prepare a
 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.820
this summer I hope to prepare a
Fulbright scholarship application to

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
Fulbright scholarship application to
 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.160
Fulbright scholarship application to
continue my work on this thesis and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
continue my work on this thesis and
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.320
continue my work on this thesis and
hopefully actually realize this project
