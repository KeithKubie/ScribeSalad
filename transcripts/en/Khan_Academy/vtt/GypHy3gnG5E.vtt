00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.670
In this video, I
now want to cover

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.140
one of the other most
misunderstood ideas

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.850
when people think
about taxes, and that's

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.850
the idea of deductions.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.350
So, one of the most
common tax deductions

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.310
is the deduction you get on
interest on your mortgage.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.020
So let's say that this year
on my mortgage-- of the part

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.070
of my mortgage that is interest,
let's say it's $10,000.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:36.030
It is $10,000 on my
interest on my mortgage.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.640
And you'll either already
know or someone might tell you

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.200
that this is tax deductible.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.050
And the misconception that
I've seen many, many times

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.230
is that people think that
since this is a tax deduction,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.020
that this $10,000 should be
deducted from their taxes.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.790
So in the previous example,
we showed the scenario

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.730
where this person
making $100,000

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.042
would have to pay
$21,720 in taxes.

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:03.500
And so based on
that misconception,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.310
they would say, OK, I get
a $10,000 tax deduction,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.240
now I would pay $11,720.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.470
And that is wrong.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.810
The deduction doesn't happen
from the taxes you pay.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.060
The deduction happens
from your stated income.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.060
So if this person right here
had a $10,000 tax deduction,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.180
instead of saying that they
made $100,000 that year,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.520
they would say that
they made $90,000.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.620
So once again, the
deduction does not

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.280
come directly from the taxes.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.830
That would be a tax credit.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.370
The deduction comes from
the reported income.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.330
So what would be the
actual effect on the taxes?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.110
Well, we just have to
look at this $90,000.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.120
It still kind of shows
up in that top bracket.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.190
So the real difference
is just going

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.170
to be this $10,000 difference.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.460
Before, he was paying
28% on this $10,000.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.560
Now he won't have to pay 28%
on that incremental $10,000.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.830
Another way to think about it,
instead of this being 17,750

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.460
times 28%, it
would now be 7,750.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.830
Because the reported
income is now only $90,000.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.200
So the actual number-- we
can get our calculator out

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.685
and just calculate it.

00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:30.060
There's two ways
you could do it.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.850
You could just say, look, if
I'm going to have spent 10,000--

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.840
if my income is
deducted by 10,000,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.980
and I'm going to save
28% on that 10,000,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.680
you could just subtract
2,800 from this.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.360
But just to show you
how it'll all work,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.026
that it all works out
to the same thing,

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:46.110
let's just go through the
same calculation again.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:55.150
We have 7,750 times
0.28 plus 48,300 times

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:05.370
0.25 plus 25,600
times 0.15 plus $835.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.260
And it's $18,920.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.574
So now the taxes
will be $18,920.

00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:14.990
And as you can
see, the difference

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.900
between the old and
the new is exactly

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.510
$2,800 because that's
essentially what the amount

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.790
that we would be
taxed on that $10,000

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.730
if we had made that much money.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.830
Anyway, hopefully that
doesn't confuse you too much.
