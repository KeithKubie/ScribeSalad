FREDERICK: So hello, everybody.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.500
My name is Fredrick.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.940
And I have the
pleasure to welcome you

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.330
to an inspiring hour full
of imagination, creativity,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.830
and innovation.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.030
Where we can learn how to
get ideas out of our heads

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.480
and into the world.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.040
Please join me in welcoming
bestselling author

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.161
and professor at Stanford, my
great friend Dr. Tina Sellig.

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:26.466
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.090
Tina, great to have
you back at Google.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.100
TINA SEELIG: It's so fun.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.600
Thank you very much,
I've done this.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.117
This is my third time, and
I'm delighted to be back.

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:35.450
FREDERICK: So you're a best
selling author and professor

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.340
of practice at Stanford
University where

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.620
you teach a course.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.700
It's called MSE 277, on
innovation creativity.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.250
You are also the
executive director

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.770
of the STVP, Stanford's
Technology of Interest Program.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.820
And your books include "What
I Wish I Knew When I Was 20",

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.110
and "inGenius: A Crash
Course on Creativity."

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.100
Your latest book, which
I have here my hands,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.020
is called "Inside Out".

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.430
So Tina, tell me, before I dive
into the book, what motivated

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.510
you to write this book?

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.680
And where do you draw
your inspiration from?

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.050
TINA SEELIG: Great.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.490
You know, I think in books.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.710
It's funny, I started writing
my first book many years ago.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.590
My first two books were actually
on the chemistry of cooking.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.790
I realized what was
happening in my lab.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.986
I knew that in great depth,
but not in my kitchen.

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:21.860
And I made a list of
all the questions I had,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.193
and I couldn't find the answers.

00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:26.720
It was way back in 1991
when that book came out.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.510
And so I figured I better write
a book to find the answers.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.030
So I am very curious.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.740
And I, in teaching classes
on creativity and innovation

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.760
for the last 15 years,
realized there was a big hole.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.280
There was a big missing piece.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.830
And I know you teach
a very similar class,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.740
so I'm hoping that
my contributions also

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.470
help you as well.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.450
I realize that we use the terms
imagination and creativity

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.440
interchangeably.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.810
We often use the terms
creativity and innovation

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.720
interchangeably.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.779
And a lot of people use
the terms innovation

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:00.320
and entrepreneurship
interchangeably.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.420
And what happens is
this sloppiness results

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.296
in a lot of problems.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.045
One of the biggest
problems is that people

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:07.450
think you can't teach this.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.840
They don't know
what it exactly is.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.620
And they assume
it's just innate.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.647
And therefore, they
don't put any effort

00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:15.730
into thinking that they
could actually get better.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.480
And so I realized
I really wanted

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.960
to put a stake in the ground in
terms of what these things are

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.390
and actually how one could
move through the process

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.760
of generating the idea and
then bringing it to life.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.480
FREDERICK: And as you mentioned,
we teach both a course

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.330
on innovation and creativity.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.310
So I think we share the
belief that everybody

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.350
is a creative person and
a creative individual.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.980
And you help really
explore people,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.200
their identity as an
innovator and find confidence

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.800
and creativity as well.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.430
So what are some practical tips
you can give us to really bring

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.680
the best out of ourselves?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.471
TINA SEELIG: Great.

00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.620
So there are so many
things that you can

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.730
do to increase your creativity.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.940
And I do agree.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.290
I think we're all creative.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.060
But in the same
way that we all can

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.830
learn about math or
history or music or sports.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.484
We have very different
starting points.

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:05.650
There's some people who are
naturally very creative.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.050
Others really need
much more coaching.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.730
But there are definitely tools.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.890
There's a combination of
knowledge, skills, and mindset.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.260
And this is very important.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.400
It's not just what
you do, it's also

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.180
the way you approach problems.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.730
So what I do in my class,
and I know you do as well,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.800
is focus a lot on
helping students

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.470
push through the first
wave of solutions

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.340
to come up with
real innovations.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.150
And this is one of the
key goals is teaching them

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
how to look at the problems
they ask in the first place.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.610
Sort of reframing the problem.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.440
We so often go with
the first framing

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.100
of a problem we come up with.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.117
And that often might
not be the best way

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:46.200
to think of the solutions.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.860
I'll give you just
a simple example.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.150
Does anyone in this
room have a birthday

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.170
this week, or coming up?

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.794
Actually, today's my
father's birthday,

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:55.670
so we'll do it
with my father, OK?

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.660
He's 89 today.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.930
We could go out of our way
to brainstorm about the best

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.950
birthday party for my dad.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.870
And that might be a great idea.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.830
But if we change one word
in that prompt to let's

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.960
plan the best birthday
celebration-- what happened

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.360
to the set of solutions?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.034
It expanded dramatically.

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:17.450
OK, what if we said we wanted
to come up with the best way

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.430
to mark my father's birthday?

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.610
That would expand even larger.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.170
And the profound piece
of this-- and I really

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.860
think it's quite profound--
Is it the answer was actually

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.670
baked into the question.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.860
If you said let's
plan a birthday party,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.310
the assumption was
that it was a party.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.020
If you said let's
plan a celebration,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.080
the assumption is that
it's a celebration.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.870
And so if you don't question
the questions you ask,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.910
you really are missing
a huge opportunity.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.370
So that's one way that
you help people unpack

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.260
their own creativity
is just even thinking

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.930
about the questions
they're asking.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.138
FREDERICK: I think you quote
at some stage Larry Page

00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:54.590
about moonshots and
setting ambitious goals.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.760
So tell us a little bit
more about this concept

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.936
and what inspires
you around that?

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:00.310
TINA SEELIG: Yeah,
you know, it's

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.320
fascinating because
everybody figures out

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.580
what stage they want
to play out their life.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.620
They figure out the
impact they want to have.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.490
An example, a simple
example would be you

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.914
could design a brand new
cookie in your kitchen.

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:15.580
You can add some
interesting ingredients

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.910
and come up with something
that no one has done before.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.493
And you could just share it with
your friends and your family.

00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:25.120
Or you could say, hey, I'm going
to sell it at the local farmers

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.760
market.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.790
Or I'm going to open
up a cookie store.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.800
Or I'm going to start a
national cookie chain.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.130
Or I'm going to open up an
entire global baking business.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.810
That all starts with one cookie.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.120
And so if you have
the idea that you

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.680
want to do something
big and bold,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.805
you're going to give yourself
permission to come up

00:05:40.805 --> 00:05:42.260
with these big, bold ideas.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.330
You know, it takes-- we all
have the same 24 hours in a day,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.890
right?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.800
And so it takes
just as much time

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.770
to do something big and bold as
it does to do something small.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.980
So giving yourself permission
to think in really big,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.920
broad, bold strokes
is really powerful.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.580
And of course Google is such
an amazing example of that.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.670
I use lots of examples
from Google all the time,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.280
and I think we should all look
to Google as an inspiration

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.710
because not only the
impact the company's had

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.630
on our everyday lives, but
the culture of experimentation

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.310
and really taking on
very big challenges.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.630
FREDERICK: So I think setting
yourselves ambitious goals is

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.530
one thing, or having ideas.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.865
But how can we actually get
those ideas out of our head

00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:25.980
and into the real world?

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.620
Because I think that's
also your tagline here.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.930
So can you give us a
recipe how we can actually

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.640
make those ideas a reality.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.920
TINA SEELIG: Yeah,
it's interesting,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.336
I was mentioning
before we started

00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:36.540
that I did a Reddit
AMA last week, which

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.390
was totally amazing.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.600
And the thing that came up
after the thousands of people

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.250
who signed into the conversation
was their frustration

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.390
with the same problem.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.020
They said I have all
these great ideas,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.570
but I don't know
what to do next.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.200
I'm afraid that someone
is going to steal my idea.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.540
Or I'm afraid that if I
do it, it's going to fail.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.260
And it's such an
interesting thing

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.030
to see that people
actually haven't

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.280
been taught that process.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.050
So here's the model that I've
presented in the book, which

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.000
I call the invention cycle.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.740
And the idea-- you'll see
at theend why it's a cycle--

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.540
the idea is that you
start with imagination.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.380
Imagination takes two things.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.940
It requires one
mindset, and one action.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.830
The mindset is engaging.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.960
Engaging with the
world, and then

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.430
actively envisioning
what could be different.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.250
This is something a
lot of people don't do,

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.032
but the idea is that
every single day,

00:07:26.032 --> 00:07:27.240
you're going down the street.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.776
You're going to see
opportunities of problems that

00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:31.650
need to get solved, and
then you can envision

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.626
what you'd do differently.

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:36.210
In fact, before something is
your passion and something

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.100
that you dive into,
it's likely something

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.320
that you know nothing about.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.250
And there's so many
examples of that.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.750
I'm sure that all
the people who are

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.365
in this room or the
people who are watching

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.490
are doing things in their
lives that at some point,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.490
they didn't know anything about.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.240
But once they got
engaged with it,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.270
the opportunities start
opening up for them.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.269
So that's the imagination stage.

00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:57.560
But now that you've envisioned
what might be different,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.110
you move on to the
creativity stage.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.520
And that requires motivation
and experimentation.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.057
Now the wonderful
thing is, you can

00:08:04.057 --> 00:08:05.640
start with a little
bit of motivation.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.210
You don't need a lot.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.680
A little bit of motivation
leads to small experiments.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.596
I know you spend a lot
of time teaching people

00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:12.690
how to prototype.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.080
And that is such an
incredible skill, to say,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.820
I don't have to do everything.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.000
In fact, I can just with
a little bit of curiosity

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.890
and motivation, do
some quick prototypes

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.400
to see what might happen.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.170
And of course, the
results of that--

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.460
whether they work or they
don't-- will then fuel

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.195
your motivation.

00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:31.695
And so you end up getting this
wonderful cycle of motivation

00:08:31.695 --> 00:08:33.700
and experimentation
that leads you

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.360
ultimately to the next
step, which is innovation.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.804
So creative ideas are new to
you, but not new to the world.

00:08:40.804 --> 00:08:42.720
But when you then get
to the innovation stage,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.440
that's when you push through.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.770
That's with great focus, so
the mental state of focusing,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.287
leads to then reframing.

00:08:50.287 --> 00:08:51.870
And we talked about
that a minute ago,

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.510
the sort of the birthday party,
the birthday celebration.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.380
By reframing, that's
when you come up

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.250
with real innovations that
are not just new to you.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.760
They're also new to the world.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.520
And once you've mastered that--
and each one of these steps

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.210
gets harder than
the one before--

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.906
but once you've
mastered that, you then

00:09:07.906 --> 00:09:09.280
go to the
entrepreneurship stage,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.010
which requires great persistence
and inspiring others.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.160
You can not do
these things alone.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.720
I mean, look at
this amazing company

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.464
with all of these people.

00:09:18.464 --> 00:09:19.880
The things that
are happening here

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.020
would only happen
because other people have

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.690
been inspired to join the team.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.920
And that is the cycle aspect, is
you get to the entrepreneurship

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.120
stage, where you inspire others
imagination, which then started

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.962
their cycle all over again.

00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:35.670
FREDERICK: Great.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.850
Let me come back to the
entrepreneurship in a second.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.515
I want to stay a little bit
longer on the experimentation

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.260
and prototyping.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.840
Again, I find it
truly inspiring how

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.227
you talk about this as well.

00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:48.810
And you mention in
your book something

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.065
where we can learn a lot
from children actually

00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:53.225
and how they experiment
and try out new things.

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.975
Can you talk a little
bit more about that?

00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:56.370
TINA SEELIG: Yeah.
isn't it true?

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.600
I often ask people in
audiences were you creative

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.670
when you were a kid and ask, do
you have kids who are creative?

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.984
You've got kids,
are they creative?

00:10:04.984 --> 00:10:06.400
FREDERICK: Absolutely,
I think so.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.250
Like every other kid.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.740
TINA SEELIG: Like every
other kid, exactly.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.757
And then what happens?

00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:11.340
And you'd ask adults
are you creative?

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.590
And a huge number say no.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.586
And we say what happened?

00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:16.960
There are very
few other things I

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.360
can think of besides learning
new languages that we

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.200
get worse as we get older.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.230
I mean, isn't that
totally crazy that people

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.480
get worse at being
creative as they get older.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.660
And it certainly comes down
to our school systems--

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.830
people are very
responsive to the rules,

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.170
the rewards, the incentives
that are put in place.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.675
And our schools are set
up in so many places--

00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:37.370
I mean not everywhere,
but in so many

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.720
places-- where there's
one right answer,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.600
and you are not encouraged
to come up with really

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.314
creative solutions to problems.

00:10:44.314 --> 00:10:45.730
So the thing that
we have to do is

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.840
sort of unlearn that and to
give people the permission

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.920
to think the same way that
they did when they were kids.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.060
FREDERICK: So we
both sailed on a ship

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.490
called "The Entrepreneurship"
in March 2013.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.060
Just a fascinating experience.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.180
So we passed glaciers
in Patagonia in Chile,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.320
and experienced wild waters.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.390
I think we both got
seasick at some time.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:18.470
And we also went to Cape
Horn with about 90 students

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.850
from Chile and Stanford who
wanted to become entrepreneurs.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.630
So what did you take
away from this experience

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.630
around entrepreneurship?

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.080
And how do you describe
that in your book?

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.250
TINA SEELIG: And so this is
sort of an interesting story.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.190
I was down in Chile.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.090
I do a lot of work in Chile
with university down there.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.420
And we're partners.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.815
And I was trying to get
them to think really

00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:41.214
big, the sort of the moon shot.

00:11:41.214 --> 00:11:42.630
They were coming
up with all sorts

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.430
of ideas for their programs
that were very incremental.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.811
And I said you
need to think big.

00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:47.560
You need to think.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.476
what if we had a ship.

00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:50.290
What if we had an
entrepreneurship?

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.123
And of course once you
come up with the idea

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:54.330
for an entrepreneurship,
you have to do it, right?

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.230
So as I write about
in the book, this

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.120
was a true entrepreneurial
endeavor to make this happen.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.580
Once we came up
with the idea, it

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.670
was a very bold,
new innovative idea.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.160
But getting other people
involved was quite a challenge.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.550
It was expensive.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.257
It was politically challenging.

00:12:11.257 --> 00:12:12.840
We had to recruit
all sorts of people.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.870
And it took us two years to
make that idea come to life.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.820
But it was such a
wonderful experience.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.290
So we took, as you said,
about 90 students and probably

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.220
around 20 faculty members from
several different institutions

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:26.930
down there.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.630
And over the course of
this time together, they

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.030
were given local challenges.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.320
So we had people who brought
in problems from the region.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.590
You know, how do you
increase ecotourism?

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.764
How to help the school system
that was down in Chile?

00:12:41.764 --> 00:12:43.680
Taking one of the ports
there and figuring out

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.000
how to increase their
economic prosperity.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.589
And what was super
fabulous about it

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:53.130
was that these
students came together

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.870
from different cultures and
found really remarkable ways

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:57.970
to work together.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.700
I think they didn't
quite know how

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.116
that was going to
work-- from very

00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:02.944
different cultures,
different languages,

00:13:02.944 --> 00:13:03.860
different backgrounds.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.250
But by bringing them together
with very, very different

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.958
points of view, they
were able to come up

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.390
with some very exciting ideas.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.340
FREDERICK: Fantastic.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.490
So what's the one thing based
on what you write in your book

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.960
here, "Inside Out" or your
other books, what you would just

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.840
give to Googlers about moving
forward and finding confidence

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.437
in their creativity again?

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:25.020
TINA SEELIG: Yeah,
a tremendous amount

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.640
is sort of an inside game.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.680
It's about giving
yourself permission.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.560
Permission to
challenge assumptions,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.630
to break the rules,
to make your own luck.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.100
One of the things I
talk about in this book

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.750
is that when you
get a job, any job,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.680
you are not just
getting that job.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.890
You are getting the
keys to the building.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.940
Add that that's true in so
many places where you go.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.670
You go inside and
the opportunities

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.410
start making themselves
sort of visible,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.284
and then it's up to you to
really make things happen.

00:13:54.284 --> 00:13:56.200
And I'm sure that this
is an organization that

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.783
supports that.

00:13:56.783 --> 00:13:59.060
I know at Stanford
that's true is

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.590
there's so many opportunities.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.410
I was fortunate.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.340
I came in a very different
role than I'm in now.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.060
And over the 16 years
that I've been there,

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.930
have ended up founding
lots of different programs

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.950
and organizations.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.811
None of these things were in
my original job description,

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:16.060
but they were opportunities
that presented themselves.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.660
So I would say, really
seize opportunities

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.990
that are in front of you.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.680
You can make amazing things
happen that other people can't

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.680
do because they don't
have the same insights you

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.140
have based on your experiences.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.240
FREDERICK: Fantastic.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.740
So I'd love to see how
you scale your insights as

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.910
well, like offering an offline
course for only 40 students.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.100
Then taking that
online to inspire like,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.130
I think the last course
with about 30,000 students

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.330
participating.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.280
And now with the book even
going to the millions,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.140
so congratulations on that.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.395
So what's next for Tina?

00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:49.770
TINA SEELIG: Well,
you know what,

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.560
I'm always looking for ways
that I can have an impact.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.340
And a lot of it is drawn, as
I said, from my own curiosity.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.330
One of the reasons
I write books is not

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.040
to sell a million copies.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.620
It's that writing
a book is a way

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.490
to really focus your
thoughts and your attention.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.690
Teaching is great.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.370
You have to spend a lot of
time thinking things through.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.260
But you can still
do a lot of hand

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.520
waving when you're teaching.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.430
When you actually
write a book, you

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.310
need to be extraordinarily
careful about your ideas.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.980
You read them over
again and again.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.110
And oftentimes when
I'm writing a book,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.680
I question a lot of the
things that I actually believe

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.770
and come up with some very,
very different points of view.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.840
So I can even give
you examples of that,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.470
where I start out
thinking one thing

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.600
and once I finished the
book, I go wow, actually,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.020
that's not right at all.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.680
Or that was a superficial
interpretation.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.010
It's actually much
more nuanced than that.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.520
So I write books.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.150
I write to think.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.545
And it's been a really
wonderful process for me.

00:15:49.545 --> 00:15:50.420
FREDERICK: Excellent.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.210
So I want to also encourage
you to give yourself permission

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.622
to ask some questions.

00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:56.080
AUDIENCE: So I
wanted to see if you

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.510
had any tips for how we can
continue to foster this really

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.490
entrepreneurship
culture or really

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.162
creative culture
in a big company.

00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:05.620
TINA SEELIG: Yeah,
well you're very

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.450
fortunate to be in a company
that I believe really

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.160
encourages this.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.880
But I know that in a lot of big
companies, that's not the case.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.540
And in fact, this is
something that happens a lot.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.970
You can chime in if you
have heard this as well.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.690
The students come
out of our classes,

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.590
and they're so
really enthusiastic

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.257
about their new found creative
confidence and skills.

00:16:29.257 --> 00:16:31.590
And then they realize they're
going to go into a company

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.682
where that may or
may not be supported.

00:16:33.682 --> 00:16:35.140
So there are few
things you can do.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.570
One is to find
like minded people.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.560
They're always other
people in the organization

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.530
who are equally enthusiastic.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.680
Find them, find your
tribe in the organization.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.990
Also, do some experiments.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.360
Do some prototypes.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.160
One of my colleagues said,
so brilliantly in our class,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.330
and I quoted in the
book, it's Rich Cox.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.220
He said, asking for
permission just transfers

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.430
the risk to someone else.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.510
And this is super
important to keep in mind.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.500
If you ask your boss
or your colleague

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.500
or someone else on your team
for permission to do something,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.690
then they can easily say no.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.248
And then you've been shut down.

00:17:11.248 --> 00:17:12.622
But if you do a
little experiment

00:17:12.622 --> 00:17:15.480
and actually can show
some data that it works,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.612
you're much more
likely to get a yes.

00:17:17.612 --> 00:17:20.930
So do some little experiments
to try out your ideas,

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.475
and then go back to people
with actually some real data.

00:17:24.475 --> 00:17:26.599
AUDIENCE: I was curious,
you just mentioned briefly

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.359
the decline of creativity
as we get older.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.769
And that's in part
due to school systems.

00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:32.310
And I was wondering
as well, it seems

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.012
like in at least
Silicon Valley, there's

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.970
an increasing focus on
getting productivity out

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.940
of every moment of time.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.398
And I read a little
bit of research

00:17:38.398 --> 00:17:40.880
about the importance
of play for children

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.035
in fostering a
creative sense, And I

00:17:43.035 --> 00:17:44.743
was curious if you
see a conflict develop

00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:46.260
at all in the direction
that things are moving

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.509
in terms of more and more
productivity and screen time

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:49.480
for kids.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.650
And if so, if any of your
work focuses on that?

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.770
TINA SEELIG: Yet, it's
such an interesting thing.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.270
I was saying as I walk in here,
every time I come to Google,

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.760
it looks like a
summer camp, right?

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.290
I'm walking by, there's
the organic garden.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.360
There's the volleyball court.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.560
And the question is, how does
this affect your productivity?

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.560
And in our discussion
earlier, my understanding

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.700
is in a place like this,
there is an attempt

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.430
to get that balance
so that you end up

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.340
having both the focus on your
very specific project you're

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.530
working on, but there's
time to let loose and relax.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.690
And so I think giving
yourself permission

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.580
to do that is super important.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.800
And also thinking about
the types of spaces

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.710
that you need to do
different types of work.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.370
It's something I'm
very interested in

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.930
is how space affects
your creativity

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.349
and your productivity.

00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:35.140
I find that each of
the books I've written,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.550
I write in different places.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.870
Different spaces stimulate
different type of thinking,

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.160
and I find that I need very
different types of spaces

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.500
to think in different ways.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.041
For example, when I wrote "What
I Wish I Knew When I Was 20",

00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:50.320
it was very much a
very personal book.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.610
It was like an open letter to my
son who's going off to college.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.040
And I wrote in a room that
was all the curtains down.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.260
It was very quiet.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.630
And it was something that felt
very-- it was very insulated.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.090
When I got my book
"Ingenious", I

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.710
wrote with wide open
windows and high ceilings,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.700
and I needed a very
expansive environment

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.370
to really stretch my thinking.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.450
So I'm a huge fan of
thinking about the space

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.140
that you need to
actually extract

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.169
the most from your work.

00:19:17.169 --> 00:19:18.960
And they're going to
be places where you're

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.126
going to be more productive,
and places where you're

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:22.820
going to be more creative.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.570
AUDIENCE: So where did
you write this one?

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.660
TINA SEELIG: So this book--
you know, it's funny.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.850
Don't tell anyone.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.720
I wrote this book in bed.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.060
But I have a very nice bedroom
with windows and high ceilings.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.180
And I wrote this
book every morning,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.110
I would sit and write
for a couple of hours.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.420
Sitting in bed,
watching the sun rise.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.510
AUDIENCE: I guess I had
another question as well.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.440
You mentioned that your
thoughts on creativity

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.540
when you're writing the book
had changed in certain regards.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.890
And also, the course has been
out I guess over 10 years

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:52.550
now too, right?

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.351
So how has that evolved?

00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:55.100
TINA SEELIG: Yeah.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.460
The course I teach changes
really, at least 30%

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.340
every year.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.680
I get bored very, very easily.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.570
And so I want to be as delighted
and surprised by the projects

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.060
as the students are.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.970
And so I also never like to
give the same project twice

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.900
because I don't
want to be anchored

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.010
by the results of the project
the students did before.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.550
So let me tell you that what
we did this last quarter, which

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.020
was mind-bendingly amazing.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.310
In fact, it's so amazing that
I'm tempted to do it again.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.855
So I think maybe there's
a way I can do it

00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:29.510
by reframing the question.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.770
We worked with San Quentin
prison, state prison,

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.550
which is up in Marin.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.090
And the project
was on redesigning

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.990
the reentry process of going
from prison to freedom.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.530
And the students were incredibly
moved by this challenge,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.110
and the projects
were incredible.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.590
So what happened is we
brought in a bunch of folks

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.737
to the class the
students could interview

00:20:53.737 --> 00:20:55.820
and also made many other
people available for them

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.920
to interview who were former
prisoners, parole officers,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.140
folks who play different
roles in the prison system.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.820
And also the students got
to go up to San Quentin

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.750
and they taught
classes up there.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.380
So it's a program I work with
called The Last Mile that

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.890
is an amazing program that
teaches entrepreneurship

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.100
at San Quentin.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.200
And I've been teaching
in the program myself,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.630
and found it incredibly moving.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.740
It was incredible to
teach these men who

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.720
are hungry for the type
of lessons that we teach.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.650
They have had no
exposure to this,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.540
although they're very bright
and very entrepreneurial.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.670
So how do you get
them to channel

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.510
their natural
entrepreneurial spirit

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.760
into doing things that are
going to be really socially

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.880
responsible?

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.700
So the students got to teach
classes up there and came back,

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.100
and their job was to redesign
that reentry process.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.630
And the insights
they can came up with

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.780
were really very,
very interesting.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.740
And in fact, two of the- there
were eight teams-- and two

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.690
of the projects are
already being implemented

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.667
that they came up with.

00:21:58.667 --> 00:21:59.500
AUDIENCE: Very nice.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.970
Visitors to Google
Companies come

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.802
to Google almost daily,
or at least weekly.

00:22:03.802 --> 00:22:05.260
And they're always
looking for ways

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.190
to make their company
more innovative.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.930
And so there's rules, there's
guidelines in the book.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.810
But then they also ask
for quantitative backing

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.590
to back it up.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.040
So is creativity
something that needs

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.330
to be in a report and
spreadsheet format?

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.310
How would you do that?

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.280
Is it really the goal
that you should be asking,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.780
or these companies
should be asking.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.613
TINA SEELIG: It's such
an interesting thing.

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:30.740
One of the challenges
about teaching creativity

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.240
is that it's really
hard to measure,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.530
just like it's hard to measure
things like ethics or love.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.530
And there's a wonderful
quote from Einstein

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.196
that I'm probably
going to butcher here,

00:22:40.196 --> 00:22:43.950
but it's something that
says "all things that count,

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.030
can't be counted.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.250
And all things that
count, can be counted,

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.880
don't necessarily count."

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.710
And I think that this
is super important

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.330
when we think about creativity.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.570
It is something
that matters a lot,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.290
but it's really hard to measure.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.400
And especially when you
think about the fact

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.110
that we're planting
seeds that often

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:04.580
take a very long time
to actually sprout

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.341
and to form large trees.

00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:08.090
I mean, if you think
about-- listen Cliff,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.407
you're 10 years out of school.

00:23:09.407 --> 00:23:10.990
Think of the things
that have happened

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.850
in '10 years, or the
lessons you use today

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.580
that you might have
learned 10 years ago.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.680
And we see this.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.250
I run a lot of
programs at Stanford.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.450
One of them is the
Mayfield Fellows program,

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.310
which is a dozen students
who are with us for nine

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.090
months in intensive program.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.680
Most of those students have
very entrepreneurial tendencies

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.000
and interests.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.170
But most of them don't
end up starting companies

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.540
until four, five,
six, seven years

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.960
after they get out of school.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.460
They go and work
at other companies.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.450
They might come to Google.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.574
They might go to Microsoft.

00:23:39.574 --> 00:23:40.770
They might go to Amazon.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.620
And then they learn about
the opportunities, really

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.620
big opportunities,
once they're immersed.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.960
They realize that when
they're in school,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.209
they don't actually know the
problems that they really

00:23:50.209 --> 00:23:51.940
want to tackle and solve.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.930
And so once they get
out into industry,

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.367
that's when they start
seeing not only how

00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:58.700
these businesses work, but
they really become passionate

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.074
about something they really
want to dive into themselves.

00:24:01.074 --> 00:24:04.520
In fact, interestingly
enough, the Instagram guys

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.850
were in our program,
and that's how they met.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.680
But they went off
to other companies

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.270
and then came together several
years later to start that firm.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.655
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about generating ideas.

00:24:14.655 --> 00:24:16.750
And I don't want to
create a false dichotomy,

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.670
but I'm going to ask the
question anyway if that's OK.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.810
So my question is, do you think
that creative and new ideas are

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.500
thought of deliberately and
consciously through a process

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.820
like brainstorming.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.320
Or are they formed
more organically,

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.980
almost as if they're
stumbled upon

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.140
by doing experiments
out in the field,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.740
or by perhaps
subconscious processes?

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.290
TINA SEELIG: Can
the answer be both?

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:36.880
Right.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.460
So the fact is, it is a
very complicated process

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.890
to generate new ideas.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.030
And so what we do is
we give a lot of tools

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.947
to help you get there.

00:24:44.947 --> 00:24:47.071
Clearly, it's something
that happens in your brain.

00:24:47.071 --> 00:24:48.940
I'm actually a
neuroscientist by training.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.140
I did my PhD In neuroscience
at Stanford Med School

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.340
a few years ago.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.210
And people when
they ask me how does

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.990
creativity work in the brain,
I can answer confidently

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.980
that we do not know.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.960
But we certainly
know that our brain

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.380
is responsible for
helping us generate ideas.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.420
And so, we need to
do things that help

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.780
us stretch our imagination.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.470
One is by getting lots
of different experiences.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:17.135
The more experiences you have,
the more you have to work with.

00:25:17.135 --> 00:25:17.760
Think about it.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.301
If you're in your
kitchen, and you're

00:25:19.301 --> 00:25:20.820
trying to come up
with a new recipe,

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.040
the more ingredients you
have, the more options

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.690
you're going to have
to reconnect them.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.380
So one, you need experiences.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.800
But then you need some
tools to help you figure out

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.840
the tools you can use to
connect and combine them,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.700
to reframe them, to saute
them, to broil them,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.980
to whisk them up.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.630
And so that's what
we do in our classes

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.660
is we give people an opportunity
to learn the different tools

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.740
just like you would in
a kitchen, the tools

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.910
that you can use once you
have these ingredients.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.620
But the goal is also to get as
many ingredients as you can.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.240
So it's something you can do.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.200
Talk to someone who's
outside of your field.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.187
Read books that are
something you never pick up.

00:25:55.187 --> 00:25:57.020
Go travel somewhere you
haven't been before.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.650
Watch a movie that
stretches your mind.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.850
These things give you
more to work with.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.890
And so yes, it--
but you know what,

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.772
we are natural problem solvers.

00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:07.480
We would not be sitting
in this building,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.480
we would not be up doing the
type of scientific research

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.030
that we do if we weren't
naturally creative and curious.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.500
And so what we're
really doing is

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.470
we're tapping into
our natural skills

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.770
and helping to polish
them to make us better.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.290
Does that make sense?

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.190
So I'm curious, who
here feels like they

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.620
get to be creative in
everything they do every day?

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.000
I mean, is something that
you think of every day

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.210
as using creativity?

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.350
Yes?

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.904
Yeah?

00:26:38.904 --> 00:26:40.320
It's something
that's interesting.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.778
I think that one
of the problems is

00:26:41.778 --> 00:26:43.260
is that people
often don't define

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.890
what they're doing as being
creative when they really are.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.450
Because if you said, are
you a problem solver?

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.810
You would answer yes.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.000
But are you creative?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.500
You might not say yes.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.630
So I think being able to
just sort of understand

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.270
that when you're solving
problems, every single day,

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.980
from the mundane to
the big and grand,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.330
this is an opportunity
every single day

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.340
to be stretching your
imagination to learning

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.190
how to be more creative.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.880
AUDIENCE: So you also mentioned
in the education sphere,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.560
at least in American education,
it's traditionally not

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.280
very creative.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.810
It encourages a set
path of thinking.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.720
At the same time, there's
tens of thousands of schools

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.780
nationwide, hundreds of
thousands of more teachers.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.500
How can you start to change
that conversation at such

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.699
a wide scale for the kids?

00:27:29.699 --> 00:27:30.490
TINA SEELIG: Great.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.350
And I think this is
incredibly important.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.766
It doesn't mean
that we don't want

00:27:33.766 --> 00:27:36.260
to teach a lot of things
we already teach in school.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.600
But in parallel, we need to
give students an opportunity

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.860
to have open ended problems that
don't have one right answer.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.360
Also, we need to
give them an option

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.380
to follow their own interests.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.130
This is something that I find
so sad is when kids come out

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.490
of school, and they've
never had an opportunity

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.820
to do creative writing, or
to do their own artwork,

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.770
or to take a topic-- might
even be baseball-- and just

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.020
follow it as far as their
interest takes them.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.710
This is what propels us
forward later in life.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.600
And we need to give
people the skills

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.320
to do that starting earlier.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.200
This is why I'm hoping that
the framework that I've

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.800
crafted and presented
in this book

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.050
creates a model that can
be used by educators.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.390
I mean, that's really
one of my hopes

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.380
is that if you actually
have some definitions--

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.640
and let me just sort of
remind us what these are.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.690
That imagination is envisioning
things that don't yet exist.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:33.980
Creativity is applying your
imagination to solve a problem

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.860
or to address a challenge.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.650
Innovation is applying
your creativity

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.810
to come up with a
unique solution.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.270
And entrepreneurship is
applying your innovation

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.520
to bring it to the world.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.870
So what this is is a
hierarchy of skills

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.920
going from imagination
to creativity,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.520
innovation to entrepreneurship.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.900
As a result, you can then learn
the attitudes and actions that

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.730
have to happen along the way.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.900
And so just as you learned
how to read and write--

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.870
we start out as babies
where we're babbling.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.330
We learn how to
apply those sounds

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.570
to make words, the
words to make sentences,

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.540
and the sentences
to make stories.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.700
You can go through
the same process

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.990
in learning to be more
creative and entrepreneurial

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:15.460
by going from really learning
how to hone your imagination.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.790
How to then apply
that to be creative.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.920
Apply that to become
really innovative.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.980
And apply that to
become entrepreneurial.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.490
And I think that with having
that type of framework,

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.520
we can really
encourage educators

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.440
to think about how they
bake this into their classes

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.500
and give students an opportunity
to really master these skills.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.520
FREDERICK: So Tina,
thank you once more

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.930
for inspiring all of us
and taking the time out

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.870
of your busy schedule
to come over to Google.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.520
Highly recommend "Inside Out".

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.030
It's actually available
in the back for $10.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.740
And Tina kindly agreed to
stay a little bit longer

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.340
to sign your personal copies.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.430
So thank you very much.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.096
TINA SEELIG: Great,
thank you very much.

00:29:55.096 --> 00:29:55.670
My pleasure.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.020
[APPLAUSE]
