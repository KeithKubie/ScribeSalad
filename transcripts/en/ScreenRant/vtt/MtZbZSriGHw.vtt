00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.880
Every summer, fans of comic books, sci-fi,
fantasy, and every other geek property descend

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.799
on San Diego to spend hours in line for a
chance at seeing their favorite stars, new

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.210
announcements, and comic book superheroes
firsthand.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.210
But as frustrating as it can get to brave
the huge crowds, the studios and stars find

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.260
some incredible ways to make it worth the
trip.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.520
Here are the 10 Most Amazing Things to Ever
Happen at Comic-Con.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.530
Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;
Just the idea that Star Wars was finally returning

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.780
was enough to send fans over the moon, with
JJ Abrams offering a handful of images from

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.980
the movie's set.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.320
But few expected the platoon of stormtroopers
that filed in, leading everyone in attendance

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.309
out of the building at blaster point for a
surprise concert.

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.239
Kevin Smith was the most surprised, since
his panel was the one starting just a few

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.100
minutes later.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.479
Scott Pilgrim VS The World
When you make a movie aimed squarely at the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.909
geeky, video-game-loving crowd that made Comic-Con
what it is today, it only seems fair to let

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:01.909
them see it first.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.229
So that’s what Scott Pilgrim director Edgar
Wright did at the end of his panel.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.299
Badges handed out to attendees as they entered
the room got them a ticket to the premiere,

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.080
taking place directly after the panel, with
the movie’s stars on hand beside them.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.690
The New Spider-Man
When Andrew Garfield was announced as the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.860
brand new Spider-Man, most American audiences
had never heard of him.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.000
The English actor got ahead of the story,
showing up to the panel in a cheap Spidey

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.750
costume, and reading a heartfelt speech to
all in attendance, shedding tears as he promised

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.140
to do the hero justice.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.230
The films divided fans, but the credit Garfield
won saved him from most of the backlash.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.560
Avatar
No one could have guessed just how much of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.860
a blockbuster hit and technological breakthrough
Avatar would turn out to be… except for

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.280
those lucky enough to be in the panel when
director James Cameron debuted a full 25 minutes

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.810
of the movie, in fully completed 3D.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.660
These days, it’s hard to imagine any studio
doing the same… but let’s cross our fingers

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.540
for Avatar 2.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.520
The Joker Strikes
Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.090
isn’t usually viewed as a comic book movie
alongside more fan-focused franchises, but

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.690
it most definitely was.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.200
When Heath Ledger’s Joker was still a mystery,
Warner Bros. had hired Joker cosplayers filter

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.000
through the convention, scattering special
‘Joker’ dollar bills, and even hiring

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.420
a plane to spell out the Joker’s laugh in
the sky.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.700
Loki Appears
Marvel probably didn’t know just how popular

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.640
Tom Hiddleston’s villain would be when he
was first cast, but they learned quickly,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.760
making him the villain of the first team-up,
and returning in Thor: The Dark World.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.840
So instead of just rolling the footage from
the Asgardian sequel, Hiddleston showed up

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.140
in full costume, mocking the crowd before
him, and ordering that they kneel and pledge

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.140
allegiance.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.420
Unsurprisingly, most did, chanting the villain’s
name, and breaking the wall between fans and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.600
fiction like few others ever tried.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.530
Celebrities in Disguise
It’s hard to single out just one celebrity

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.700
who donned a costume, mask, or general disguise
in order to walk among their fans without

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.700
being mobbed.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.410
Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe dressing
up as Spider-Man is among the most famous

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.180
examples, but Bryan Cranston has to take the
cake, with the Breaking Bad star concealing

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.210
his identity with… a mask of his own face.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.210
TRON: Legacy
There are few movies that can claim as much

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.120
legitimate nerd cred as the original TRON,
which made Disney’s Hall H panel in 2008

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.730
one of the most shocking on record.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.640
As their show came to an end, they offered
“one last thing” – the first short film

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.780
used to pitch a TRON sequel to Disney.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.470
But at that point, the movie wasn’t even
announced, meaning the crowd saw a stunning

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.650
trailer for a sequel no one knew about, and
confirming Jeff Bridges would return.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.620
The film itself may have been a disappointment,
but the reveal is a moment that could never

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.880
happen again in today’s industry.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.620
The Iron Man Starts it All
When Jon Favreau arrived at Comic-Con to talk

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.790
to the fans about his new film, Iron Man,
nobody knew what to expect.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.870
A second-tier superhero, an actor with a checkered
past, and a rocky track record for Marvel

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.870
movies in general.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.250
The attendees expected to get a few shots
since the movie had only finished filming

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.080
weeks before, but Favreau rolled out a trailer
instead, winning waves of applause from the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.330
crowd, and convincing them that one day, a
quality Marvel Movie Universe could be possible.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.959
The Avengers Assemble
These days it's almost impossible to remember

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.370
a time before Marvel ruled the shared universe,
but back in 2010, fans could still be surprised.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.060
The crowd in Hall H knew most of the Avengers
stars from solo movies, but few expected to

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.940
see the entire cast of the Marvel Universe
assembled on stage - with Robert Downey Jr

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.320
the first to reveal Mark Ruffalo as the new
Incredible Hulk.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.850
It's the kind of moment that ca only happen
once, and for the lucky ones in the room,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.500
it's a moment they'll never forget.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.780
Those are the unforgettable or hilarious Comic-Con
moments we remember, but which ones did we

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.780
miss?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.760
