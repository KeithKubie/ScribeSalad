00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.192
- [Voiceover] So let's see if we can solve

00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:03.374
this quadratic equation right over here:

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:06.286
x squared minus two x minus eight

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.855
is equal to zero.

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:10.810
And actually, they're cutting
down some trees outside,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.327
so my apologies if you hear
some chopping of trees.

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:15.619
I'll try to ignore it myself.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.586
All right. So back to the problem at hand,

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.808
and there's actually several ways

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:22.130
that you could attack this problem.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.752
We could just try to
factor the left-hand side

00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:27.284
and go that way, but the
way we're going to tackle it

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:29.392
is by completing the square.

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:30.577
Now what does that mean?

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:32.799
Well that means that I wanna write,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.169
I wanna write the left-hand
side of this equation

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.588
into the form

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:42.148
x plus a squared plus b,

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:45.936
and we'll see if we can write
the left-hand in this form

00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:47.640
that we can actually solve it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.072
in a pretty straightforward way.

00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:50.744
So let's see if we could do that.

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:52.736
Well let's just remind ourselves

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:54.818
how we need to rearrange
the left-hand side

00:00:54.818 --> 00:00:56.419
in order to get to this form.

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:59.075
If I were to expand out x plus a squared,

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:00.717
let me do that in a different color.

00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:03.140
So if I were to expand
out x plus a squared,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.160
that is x squared plus two a x,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.722
I'll make that plus sign you can see,

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:10.183
plus two a x,

00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:11.845
plus a squared,

00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:16.069
and of course you still have
that plus b there, plus b.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.648
So let's see if we can
write this in that form.

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:20.493
So, what I'm going to do,

00:01:20.493 --> 00:01:21.551
this is what you typically do

00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:22.763
when you try to complete the square.

00:01:22.763 --> 00:01:25.155
All right. The x squared minus two x.

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:27.387
Now I'm gonna have a little bit of a gap

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.989
and I'm gonna have minus eight,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.601
and I have another a little bit of a gap

00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:33.416
and I'm gonna say equals zero.

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:34.958
So I just rewrote this equation,

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.629
but I gave myself some space

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.271
so I can add or subtract some things

00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:39.933
that might make it a little bit easier

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.468
to get into this form.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.616
So, if we just match our terms,

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:47.388
x squared, x squared,

00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:51.544
two a x, negative two x.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.180
So, if this is two a x,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.813
that means that two a is negative two,

00:01:56.813 --> 00:01:58.828
two a is equal to negative two

00:01:58.828 --> 00:02:01.648
or a is equal to negative one.

00:02:01.648 --> 00:02:02.559
Another way to think about it,

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:07.549
your a is going to be half of
your first degree coefficient

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.341
or the coefficient on the x term.

00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:11.013
So the coefficient of the
x term is a negative two,

00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:13.214
half of that is a negative one.

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:14.925
And then we wanna have,

00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:19.443
and then we want to have an a squared.

00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:22.425
So if a is negative one, a
squared would be plus one.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:24.758
So let's throw a plus one there.

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:25.990
But like we've done and said before,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.382
we can't just willy-nilly add something

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.817
on one side of equation
without adding it to the other

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.730
or without subtracting it
again on that same side.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.372
Otherwise, you're fundamentally changing

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:39.137
the truth of the equation.

00:02:39.137 --> 00:02:41.989
So if I add one on that side,
I even have to add one on the,

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.050
if I add one of the left side,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.652
I even have to add one on the right side

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:46.384
to make the equation still hold true

00:02:46.384 --> 00:02:50.518
or I could add one and subtract
one from the left-hand side,

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:53.429
so I'm not really changing the
value of the left-hand side.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.717
All I've done is added one

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:57.320
and subtracted one from
the left-hand side.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.412
Now why did I do this again?

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.467
Well now, I've been able,

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.379
I haven't changed its value.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.621
I just added and
subtracted the same thing,

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:07.113
but this part of the left-hand side

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:10.650
now matches this pattern right over here,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.329
x squared plus two a x,

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.471
where a is negative one,
so it's minus two x,

00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:19.165
plus a squared, plus negative one squared

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.413
and then this,

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:24.384
this part right over here is the plus b.

00:03:24.384 --> 00:03:28.471
So we already know that b
is equal to negative nine.

00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:31.758
Negative eight minus one is negative nine,

00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:35.148
and so that's going to be
our b right over there.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.937
And so we can rewrite this as,

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:39.632
what I squared off in green,

00:03:39.632 --> 00:03:42.842
that's gonna be x plus a squared.

00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:45.358
So we could write it as x plus

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:48.061
and I could write a is negative one.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.847
Actually, let me, I could
write it like that first.

00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:54.344
x plus a squared or x plus negative one.

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:56.886
Well, let's just x minus one,
so I'm just gonna write it

00:03:56.886 --> 00:04:01.808
as x minus negative one squared

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.644
and then we have minus nine,

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:08.625
minus nine is equal to zero,

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:11.398
is equal to zero.

00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:13.400
And then I can add nine to both side,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.745
so I just have this squared expression

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:18.658
on the left-hand side, so let's do that.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:22.215
Let me add nine to both sides.

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:27.215
And what I am going to be
left with, so let me just,

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.447
on the left-hand side, those cancel out.

00:04:30.447 --> 00:04:31.988
That's why added the nine.

00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:36.893
I'm just gonna be left with
the x minus one squared.

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:41.614
It's going to be equal to, on this side,

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.758
zero plus nine is nine.

00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:47.920
So if x minus one, let
me do that in blue color.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.323
So, it's gonna be nine.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.622
And so if x minus one squared is nine,

00:04:52.622 --> 00:04:54.344
if I have something
square is equal to nine,

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:56.843
that means that that something
is either going to be

00:04:56.843 --> 00:04:59.592
the positive or the negative
square root of nine.

00:04:59.592 --> 00:05:01.981
So it's either gonna be
positive or negative three.

00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:06.981
So we can say x minus one
is equal to positive three

00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:10.510
or x minus one is equal to negative three

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.501
and you could see that here.

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.013
If x minus one is three,
three squared is nine.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.875
If x minus one is negative three,

00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:18.341
negative three squared is nine.

00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:20.283
And so here, we can just add one

00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:22.405
to both sides of this equation,

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.835
add one to both sides of this equation,

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:30.063
and you get x is equal to four

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:34.467
or x is, if we add one to
both sides of this equation,

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.684
we get, my digital ink is
acting up, I don't know.

00:05:37.684 --> 00:05:42.684
All right. Then we get x is
equal to negative three plus one

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.144
is negative two.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.446
So, x could be equal to four

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.858
or x could be equal to
negative two, and we're done.

00:05:48.858 --> 00:05:49.830
Now, some of you might be saying,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.102
"Well, why did we go through the trouble

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:52.043
"of completing the square?

00:05:52.043 --> 00:05:54.135
"I might have been able
to just factor this

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:55.793
"and then solve it that way."

00:05:55.793 --> 00:05:58.125
And you could have, actually,
for this particular problem.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.497
Completing the square is very powerful

00:05:59.497 --> 00:06:02.249
because you could actually
always apply this,

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:04.161
and in the future, what you will learn

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.211
in the quadratic formula

00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.664
and the quadratic formula
actually comes directly

00:06:07.664 --> 00:06:09.892
out of completing the square.

00:06:09.892 --> 00:06:11.314
In fact, when you're applying
he quadratic formula,

00:06:11.314 --> 00:06:13.683
you're essentially applying the result

00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:15.675
of completing the square.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:18.091
So hopefully you found that fun.
