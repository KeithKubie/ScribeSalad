00:00:01.332 --> 00:00:03.499
(beeping)

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.097
(uptempo music)

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.040
- So, I like to start by
sharing a personal story.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.320
All scientists have I think a memory,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.200
a story that they can go back to

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.190
when they think about how they
became interested in science

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.720
and I wanted to share mine.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.030
This is mine here.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.570
These are baby leatherback turtles

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.640
that are hatching from a nest

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.960
not far away from where I was born

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.560
and raised in Puerto Rico.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.150
And when I was a child there

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.270
I always found fascinating
that these animals

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.220
are coming out of the nest

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.830
and they haven't been to turtle school

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.020
and they know exactly where to go.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.690
They're beelining it towards the ocean.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.960
There's something really
profound happening here also,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.640
very important for the turtle
but invisible to our eyes,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.500
which is that these turtles
are forming a memory.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.120
They're forming a memory of this beach.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.210
These are leatherback turtles,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.090
they grow up to be about
the size of a Volkswagen,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.500
about nine feet long,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.140
and they will travel the world's oceans

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.290
and decades later when they have to make

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.710
what is perhaps the most important

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.960
decision in a turtle's life

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.740
which is where it's gonna lay its eggs,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.480
it will remember this beach
because that's where it was born

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.140
and he'll come back to and
lays its eggs at that place.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.218
So with that I'd like to
coarse-grain behaviors

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:27.700
and essentially group them into innate

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.140
or hardwired behaviors like
these animals' capacity

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.500
to know to go towards the
ocean when they're born.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
An experiential memory is either capacity

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.320
to remember this specific
vision come back to it.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.280
Now, innate behaviors are facilitated

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.080
by the developmental program that leads

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.970
to the formation of the
neural circuit architectures,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.070
and experiential memories
are facilitated by

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.220
a pretty complex interplay between that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.010
architecture that develops

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.150
and the environment that
the animal is experiencing,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.370
what the animal is seeing.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.570
But I wanna emphasize that both of them

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.480
are ultimately facilitated

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.420
by the architecture of the nervous system.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.490
So what do I mean by the
architecture of the nervous system

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.060
and this is essentially what I mean.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.280
If you look at a mouse
hippocampus for example

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.920
you'll see this incredibly
and exquisite organization

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.810
of the neurons.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.160
This is actually image
here using a technique

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.860
called Brainbow by Jeff
Lichtman at Harvard.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.060
And this organization raises all sorts

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.080
of interesting questions one of them

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.340
which my lab is interested on

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.690
is how is it that this organization
is actually established?

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.350
And in thinking of how this
organization is established,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.240
if you take for example the
case of the human brain,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.240
you have about 80 billion neurons,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.600
that's more neurons in
a healthy human brain

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.010
than you have stars in the Milky Way,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.020
and about 100 trillion synapses.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.190
And during development you have

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.950
hundreds of millions of
neurons almost simultaneously

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.200
during development specifying fate,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.430
growing out axons,
connecting to each other,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.960
finding each other in a
very specific way to lay out

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.570
this amazing architecture.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.820
So, how does that happen?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.740
What are the organizing
principles that rules

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.850
this organization that ultimately
underpin human behaviors?

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.888
Now we look at this
question and we don't do so

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:07.860
in turtles or humans or mice actually,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.620
we do so in a worm.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.660
It's a tiny nematode called
C. elegans, it's over here.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.470
One of the characteristics
that that C. elegans has

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.790
that we really like is
that it's transparent.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.000
So it allows us to look

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.580
at the organization of the nervous system

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.140
which is very finely
organized as you can see here.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.100
Now I wanna acknowledge that C. elegans is

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.780
far simpler than a healthy human brain.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.780
So instead of a hundred billion neurons,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.140
C. elegans has exactly 302 neurons

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.630
and instead of 100 trillion synapses

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.660
C. elegans has approximately
7,000 synapses.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.850
So some of you might be wondering,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.680
how is it that we can extract
any useful information

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.860
out of such a simple system

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.760
that will tell us anything useful about

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.770
a complex organ like the human brain.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.480
And to address this I like
to use a quote by Diderot

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.820
that said, "A worm is only a worm.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.760
"But that only means that
the marvelous complexity

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.640
"of its organization is hidden from us

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.210
"by its extreme smallness."

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.990
Now, I'm not as eloquent as Diderot

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.760
so I'll say it in a wordier way,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.950
when nature finds a solution to a problem

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.680
it recycles that solution
over and over again.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.340
So the fundamental principles that allows

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.470
for the proper functioning
of the nervous system

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.950
in this tiny worm are not unlike
the fundamental principles

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.490
that facilitate the
functioning of our own brains.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.970
And to exemplify that I'll
just give a few examples.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.650
Studies done in this worn by other groups

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.600
ranging from the development of neurons

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.360
like cell fate specification
or axon guidance

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.350
to fundamental physiology, having to do

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.260
with biogenesis of neurotransmitters

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.290
or neurotransmitter release
or neuron stuck to each other

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.750
to even system's levels examination

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.990
of sensory perception and behavior,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.200
all done in this nematode
have actually shed light

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.560
on important and fundamental
aspects about how

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.260
our own brains and brains
in higher metazoans work.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.520
It's really true that evolution

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.410
kind of conserves these principles.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.070
So, using that as a foundation

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.990
we wanted to essentially
examine this question of

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.700
how this nervous system comes together

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.220
and both our studies and the
studies that I just mentioned

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.200
benefited from the fact that this is also

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.280
the only animal for which
we have a wiring diagram.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.890
Now we're hoping this is gonna change soon

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.370
and you're gonna hear other talks today

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.360
that are working very hard to make this.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.100
You know, I think of the
past now we're very happy

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.700
that that's the case

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.280
but today this is the only animal

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.850
for which we have that wiring diagram.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.740
So, what is the wiring diagram?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.400
It's the ability to know
where each neuron is,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.180
essentially the morphology of the neuronal

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.050
and what a neuron is connecting to.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.800
And we use this wiring diagram to examine

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.300
two fundamental questions.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.720
One of them is how is it

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.050
that the brain of this animal is organized

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.150
and the second one is how
does this organization

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.760
comes out during development?

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.010
Now we've had the wiring
diagram for about 30 years.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.430
The first wiring diagram was done in 1986

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.660
and we still have these two questions

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.300
that we need to address and
I'll explain what we know

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.520
and what we don't know in the next slide.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.720
The way that that wiring
diagram was originally done

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.030
was that somebody took,

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.270
a group of scientists led by
John White took this animal

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.340
and essentially fixed it

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.810
and sliced it like a salami.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.150
So imagine that you're slicing
all over the animal here

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.280
and then you get these cross sections

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.050
and then they did electron microscopy

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.460
on those cross sections.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.450
And by segmenting each of the neurons

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.400
which we are putting here
in different colors by hand,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.870
this is 1986 they segmented them by hand,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.520
they were able to recreate
the connectivity map

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.330
for every single cell.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.370
Now this was this was incredibly
powerful for the field

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.140
and it has benefited our studies

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.130
but I just wanna emphasize
that all of this was,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.450
it wasn't digitalized.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.450
It was all done by hand.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.440
So you could go narrow by narrow

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.040
and you can kind of tell the
shape and who it connected to

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.360
but we didn't have a
systems level understanding

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.500
about how this happened.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.050
Until recently where Scott Emmons

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.860
at Albert Einstein University
and his students Steve Cook

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.060
actually went in and did
the same segmentation

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.070
that John White did 30 years
ago but with computers.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.780
What that allows us to
do is to be able to know

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.700
who's neighboring who
in a quantitative way,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.890
in a way that we can actually analyze.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.160
And we can analyze using
tools not unlike the tools

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.760
that are being used by companies
like Twitter or Facebook

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.960
to understand interactions
between human beings.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.470
So our collaboration included
computational scientists

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.130
Smita and Alex and what they
did is that they took that data

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.820
and we worked together with them

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.030
in using clustering algorithms.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.250
Again similar to a cluster
in network algorithms

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.640
that are used to understand
personal interactions.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.150
And cluster neurons with
similar contact profiles,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.200
so essentially neurons that
are contacting each other

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.210
as they're traveling together

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.920
in the nervous system in fascicles.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.160
And indeed iterative
clustering to understand

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.530
how that structure of
the brain is organized.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.500
And you end up with essentially
a flow diagram like this

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.300
where in one corner you
have all the neurons

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.710
and this cluster in algorithms iteratively

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.543
bring them together.

00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:03.390
So, this different
clustering of the different

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.230
subgroups of neurons
that eventually cluster

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.930
into these larger families,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.170
what it represents, what underlies that

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.290
is real biology of how these neurons

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.480
are interacting with each other.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.080
Real biology that was inaccessible before

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.430
we were able to digitize these programs.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.120
And we're capable of
overlaying that on top

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.980
of the original EM micrographs.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.600
Each of these pseudo colors
here that we have placed

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.258
represent a community of neurons

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:33.110
that are interacting together
more than the other neurons.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.980
And I'm gonna just walk you
through the brain of the animal

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.770
and this is gonna be playing a movie

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.850
so that you can see how
the different communities

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.970
are actually snaking and how
they relate to each other

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.730
and how they come together.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.740
As this movie plays I'll explain that

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.370
what I'm showing you here is actually

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.930
reproducible across the animals

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.360
for which we have connectomes.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.280
So this has been a really fun project

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.600
because we were able to

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.060
work with the computational biologist

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.610
and inform the algorithms with the biology

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.000
and use the algorithms to
inform our own biology.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.930
We were able to find four main bundles

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.970
that account for 83% of
the whole connectome.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.280
Now we have a pretty good idea about how

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.710
these different brain
regions are organized

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.550
and these neighborhoods, I'll
just mention that they reveal

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.960
important biological insights.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.330
So there's a reason why
they're organized this way

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.630
that have to do with
development and function.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.120
I could give a one hour talk about this

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.770
so I'm gonna use one
example to present this

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.920
and I'll talk about
how these neighborhoods

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.850
led to insights about
how this organization

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.530
is actually established
during development.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.190
And this gets to a fundamental question

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.320
that is a blind spot in the field

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.880
which is how do you go from
a group of cells in an embryo

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.130
to this organized connectome in the worm?

00:09:46.247 --> 00:09:47.130
So this is essentially a question

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.520
that we wanted to understand,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.620
and the reason that this
has been a blind spot

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.453
is that for many organisms

00:09:51.453 --> 00:09:54.460
this part of the
development happens inside,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.590
like for example in mammals
it happens inside the uterus.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.210
So the organisms are
essentially inaccessible.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.320
In C. elegans they lay eggs
so the organism is accessible

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.750
but there were a number of challenges

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.370
that have prevented in the
past like four or five decades

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.160
to image embryonic neurodevelopment.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.810
So this is a pretty large blind spot,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.610
we have this information
but we didn't know

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.920
how this was happening.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.300
The reason that imaging neurodevelopment

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.070
in C. elegans was
challenging were multifold.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.400
One of them is that embryos,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.060
when they're inside the
egg they're very quick,

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.520
they're moving very quickly.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.690
So if you're looking for example

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.270
at the development of a single neuron

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.860
using even the fastest microscopy

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.020
that we had available at the time

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.560
which is spinning disk microscopy

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.340
for the aficionados in the audience.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.330
This is a single neuron
and you get a motion blur

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.090
where it looks like four neurons.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.210
Because the animal is moving

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.300
and you're taking different pictures

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.360
so it looked at you
taking four neurons there.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.520
The other problem that is
hard to capture in an image

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.980
is the animals just die.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.500
So when you're imaging for
prolonged periods of time

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.500
which is what you want to
do to be able to capture

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.180
these different neural
developmental events,

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.380
many of the embryos just die
so you end up taking snapshots

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.730
at different points in development

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.570
that you have to stitch together later.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.960
And neurons are actually pretty thin.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.390
They're near the
diffraction limit of light.

00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:07.064
They're traveling in ways

00:11:07.064 --> 00:11:08.610
that are not convenient for imaging.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.860
They're not traveling in planes,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.630
they don't care about our imaging needs.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.110
They're actually snaking in
through the whole nervous system

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.310
so we needed methods that allow us to have

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.740
good resolution not just in two dimensions

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.630
but in all three dimensions.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.000
So to address this we
establish a collaboration

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.290
with a fabulous microscopist Hari Shroff

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.310
and his team of scientists.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.560
And Hari essentially, we had
these discussions together

00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:35.470
and he came up with the
design of this microscope.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.940
I won't go into the nuts and bolts

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.600
about how these microscopes work.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.260
But what I will tell you is

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.870
the aspects of this
microscope that makes it

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.550
usable for our studies.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.540
This microscope is called
a light sheet microscope

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.250
which essentially means that instead of

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.480
imaging a single point of light

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.040
like many other microscopes do,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.680
it creates a whole sheet of light

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.490
so it's much faster
than regular microscopes

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.300
because it's like in Star
Trek when they scan you

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.110
versus scanning you point by point.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.350
So it's faster.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.230
Because it's faster it exposes
the animal to less light,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.730
so less photo toxicity,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.250
also the way that light is generated

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.030
to be able to image these animals

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.670
exposes the animals to less light.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.240
And the other aspect of this is that

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.060
for the microscopists in the audience,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.190
so people who have done
microscopy they will recognize

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.140
that when you take a
three-dimensional image

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.360
of an object in a microscope,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.380
the resolution in X, Y
is always really good

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.760
but when you turn it the
resolution you see it's always bad.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.140
And that has to do with
just the physics of light

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.640
which I'm not gonna go into

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.730
but I will say that X, Y and Z

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.590
is relative to how you're standing.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.560
So you guys right now are in my Z

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.970
but if I was standing this
way that will be my Z.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.310
So if I had two images where the Z varied

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.290
then I could combine them to essentially

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.440
have an isotropic image.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.440
So if I look at this object like this,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.650
this is my X, Y and then
I look at it this way

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.382
and this is my X, Y and I
combine those two images,

00:12:57.382 --> 00:13:00.600
it's the same resolution
in all three axis.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.710
And this is essentially what we're doing

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.310
with this microscope
because we have two cameras,

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.450
this one illuminates, this one image

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.760
and then they take turns.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.370
You end up with two images
that you can then fuse

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.440
and the Z of this axis is
different from this one.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.650
Again, I'm discussing this superficially

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.230
because I know Phil Keller will
discuss this in more detail.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.180
We have this microscope working in my lab

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.390
and this is a slide that I put here

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.490
just to acknowledge two institutions,

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.980
the Marine Biological Laboratories

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.810
and the University of Puerto Rico

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.560
which were meeting places
where technologists like,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.000
like microscopists like
people from Hari's group

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.090
and biologists from my group
were able to come together

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.923
and exchange ideas,

00:13:37.923 --> 00:13:39.020
and I think these places are gonna be

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.590
increasingly more important

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.060
for interdisciplinary collaborations

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.860
necessary to address these problems.

00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:48.170
What can we do with this?

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.080
So this is actually the brain

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.930
of the animal here in an embryo,

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.090
the tail, the head and that's the brain,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.460
that ring that you see in there.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.010
And I'm gonna play a movie
where we can actually see

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.490
the development of this
animal in real time.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.100
I mean this is, as a
biologist this is spectacular

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.950
that we can see this.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.800
You're gonna see the
animals, it starts to move,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.600
it starts to twitch as the
nervous system comes online.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.440
But even when it's twitching
you can get very crisp images.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.210
Now, if you look at subsets of neurons

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.010
which we're going to do here
using subcellular markers

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.020
or markers that are more restricted

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.810
you can still see the,
you can see neurites,

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.090
specific neurites growing
into the brain of the animal,

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.130
this is all taken again in live animals.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.390
And essentially you
can stop it at any time

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.320
and you can rotate it so

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.880
and with two-dimensional projections

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.713
because I'm using a screen

00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:35.410
but these are three-dimensional data

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.950
since you can see resolution is very good

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.700
in all angles that you look at it.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.010
And you can continue in movie.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.660
So this gives us unprecedented access

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.820
to the events that are leading

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.670
to the formation of this nerve ring.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.300
And then we had another collaboration

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.190
that was really enabling
which is that in C. Elegans

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.060
we know the lineage of every single cell,

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.420
we've known that since
the animal was developed

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.410
as a model organism,

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.050
that's how the original studies

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.020
of programmed cell death were done.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.770
And this person, this is Zhirong Bao,

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.610
he's a scientist of Sloan Kettering

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.150
who's a computational biologist

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.010
and a developmental biologist.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.560
And what I'm gonna be playing here

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.920
is an embryo that is in a four cell stage.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.030
Now this is like playing a movie

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.150
that you know what's gonna happen

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.220
because we know the lineage.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.730
We know for each one of these cells

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.680
we know who their progeny is gonna be

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.460
because those studies
have been done before.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.410
But what he did is that
he trained a computer

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.490
to be able to recognize this in real time.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.950
So as the animal is developing

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.450
the computer can keep track
of all of these nuclei

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.500
and it knows what each
cell is gonna become.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.890
So why is this important to us?

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.540
It's important for two reasons.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.650
One of them is because
when we're marking neurons

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.410
as we're gonna be doing here,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.980
we can tell their identity
because if we have nuclei

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.970
that we're labeling in
the background in red

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.870
then we can keep the
identity of every single

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.780
one of these neurons that are emerging.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.520
But the other aspect is that

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.010
we have an internal coordinate system.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.090
As the neurons are growing out

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.650
and crossing the different nuclei

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.350
we know where each neuron is.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.860
So if we take different embryos

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.890
and we're imaging different embryos

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.610
we can overlay them because we essentially

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.870
have a multi-point
internal coordinate system.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.370
Does that make sense?

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.960
Okay, so what can we do with that

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.580
and here I'm gonna summarize

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.070
the work of a postdoc
in my lab, Mark Moyle,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.370
this is five years of work
summarized in one slide.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.690
So, essentially what we can,

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.610
what Mark did is he was
interested in identifying

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.140
the pioneering neurons
that lead to the formation,

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.760
that trail-blazed the formation
of the brain of the animal.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.290
So he looked in embryos,
he labeled all membranes

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.080
and he found the first
membranes that are formed

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.120
that are part of the brain.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.600
He traced them back to these cells here,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.810
we're pseudo coloring
here so you can see them.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.780
Then if he looked at the
nuclei he can actually identify

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.530
by name and last name
those specific cells.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.450
Then he can image as I mentioned before

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.820
the development of the brain

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.890
so he can take these cells and kill them

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.840
and the hypothesis is if you kill them

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.090
because they're the first cells,

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.560
if the first cells are important

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.450
then you shouldn't be
able to develop a brain.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.030
And we get these brainless animals

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.350
in which we cannot see,

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.500
essentially the brain is greatly abrogated

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.420
so these neurons are
actually very important.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.030
And it turns out when we look back

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.330
in the maps that we have created

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.060
with the computational biologists

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.288
that this pioneer cells
are actually the cells

00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:14.360
that are here in purple.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.102
And they're like seamed cells,

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:18.180
they're cells that are holding together

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.880
the whole nerve ring.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.050
And with that I'd like to essentially

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.800
bring to your attention
how we can both look at

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.840
how the brain is organized

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.110
and how the organization is
established during development.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.200
And I'll finish by saying that

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.890
what we have been able to do
with this and our aspiration

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.170
is to create what would
be the first map of

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.350
metazoan neurodevelopment for any animal.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.800
So we're systematically tracking

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.700
all of the incisions of these neurons

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.290
and creating this virtual
embryo that allows examination

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.220
of all of these decisions in the context

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.390
on the developing embryo which we think

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.050
will be enabling for neuroscience.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.470
And with that I'll finish by

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.270
thanking the people that did the work.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.280
This motley crew and you
for listening to me today.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.210
Thank you.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.530
(audience applauding)

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.620
- So, I'm gonna be talking about

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.470
the complexity of the single cells

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.210
that make up the brain.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.580
We've heard a lot about
neuronal populations

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.890
and how they're organized
which is quite amazing.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.020
But if you go, if you zoom in

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.300
and look at any one of those cells

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.900
whether they're astrocytes or neurons

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.260
or microglia within the brain,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:29.260
inside those cells is a plethora
of subcellular organelles

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.960
that are playing a huge role
in how the brain is operating.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.610
I just want to draw your attention

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.960
to some of these organelles

00:18:41.753 --> 00:18:43.970
who if they don't function properly

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.380
can lead to many of the
neurodegenerative diseases

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.213
that we're aware of.

00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:50.780
So for instance mitochondria
that you can see here,

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.220
defects in mitochondria
lead to Parkinson's,

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.990
many of the Parkinson's disorders.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.170
Lysosomes, proteins that
comprise some of these lysosomes

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.210
are responsible for
frontal temporal disorders.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.260
And the endoplasmic
reticulum which you will hear

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.750
a lot about today is very much at play in

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.540
where mutations in proteins
that shape that organelle

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.540
underlies a variety of
spastic paraplegia disorders.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.240
In order for us to really get

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.210
I think at this neurodegenerative
aspect of the brain

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.730
and how it ages and deteriorates,

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.410
we need to understand how these organelles

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.190
that comprise the cellular components

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.480
which is the unit of the
whole system of the brain

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.730
are organized.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.630
So, this is a classic
transmission electron micrograph,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.600
a 90 nanometer slice through a cell

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.600
to really reinforce the
complexity of these organelles.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.780
What we wanna know is
more information about

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.630
the three-dimensional
organization of these organelles

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.150
and how proteins are
dynamically distributed.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.500
That's one thing we wanna know

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.480
and I'm gonna be talking
about other layers

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.170
of information that we're
now beginning to get

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.760
in terms of the
organization of this system

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.970
thanks to high end microscopy technology.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.060
So let's start with the
3D organelle shapes.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.770
This is as I mentioned is a transmission

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.470
electron micrograph
slice of 90 nanometers.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.620
What that means is within
that 90 nanometers slab

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.730
you have no Z information,

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.570
everything's flattened.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.670
But thanks to technologies

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.680
like the Focused Ion Beam
Scanning milling system

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.920
that in combination with
scanning electron microscopy

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.900
we can now slice through the
cell at very thin sections,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.470
four nanometer in this case.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.810
And we've used that on
collaboration with Harald's

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.040
beautiful FIB-SEM system at Janelia

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.520
to begin slicing through parts of the cell

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.880
to reconstruct particular organelles,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.130
in order to understand how these
organelles are shaped in 3D

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.240
and how they communicate
with other organelles.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.780
What you're looking at
here is just the fine

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.730
complex architecture of
the endoplasmic reticulum

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.400
in a small, the edge of the cell.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.300
In this panel right here
what you're looking at is

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.830
the confocal volume that we've sliced up

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.050
in what you would see

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.060
if you were using a confocal microscope.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.670
So you can see there's a huge difference

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.700
between the reality of this organelle

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.550
as revealed by imaging at this very fine

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.110
three-dimensional architecture

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.270
versus the typical
image that you would get

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.180
if you are using conventional
confocal microscopes.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.430
Now we've been working with Harald

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.520
to look in more detail
at these organelles.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.830
In this case, we're looking at
plasma membrane, mitochondria

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.880
ER, endosomes that we can segment out

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.060
as you mill through these slices.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.160
This is a two micron volume of the cell,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.390
four nanometer voxels

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.870
and you can color code each
of these different organelles

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.360
to see how they're arranged
relative to each other.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.810
Now the mitochondria that
you can see here in green

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.200
are intimately communicating with the ER

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.220
which is shown in red and
there's a lot of crosstalk

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.000
between these two organelles

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.610
that's absolutely critical for
calcium handling in the cell

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.690
for reactive oxygen exchange,

00:22:44.523 --> 00:22:47.900
as well as lipid and other
types of communication.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.930
Well, how do we localize
proteins on these organelles?

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.690
And the approach that we've been taking

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:58.060
really builds from really
the 20 years or more

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.400
of work that people have done

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.000
using fluorescent protein technology,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.600
which allows you to tag
proteins of interest

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.350
and then look at how they're distributed.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.920
Now in order for us to get high resolution

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.660
protein as well as lipid distribution

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.920
to understand the fine architecture

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.010
in a three-dimensional section of a cell,

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.590
we've applied Lattice
Light Sheet Microscopy

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.470
developed by Eric Betzig and colleagues,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.860
where essentially you take
ultra thin vessel beams

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.410
to create a thin 2D optical lattice

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.830
which is then used as
a sheet to pass through

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.400
your cell of interest.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.400
What this allows is ultra
thin slicing through a cell

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.810
which is at a much smaller scale

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.810
than big neuronal slices, sections.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.410
And because we have
such a thin light sheet

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.300
that's basically almost the same dimension

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.420
as the X, Y lateral resolution

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.130
that you get with the microscope,

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.220
you have isotropic resolution.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.870
And again it's low, it's
relatively low to photo toxicity

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.470
because it's a lattice sheet of light

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.720
rather than a full sheet.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.300
So we combined the lattice
light sheet microscope

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.850
with a point localization
or PALM-like imaging

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.930
where individual molecules,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.920
in this case we're
looking at lipid molecules

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.720
that bind and then
dissociate from membranes.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.720
And whenever they're
bound they create a spot

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.510
on the surface of that membrane

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.670
that we can fit with very high accuracy

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.660
by point PSF centroid fitting.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.520
And when we do that we can reconstruct

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.170
the entire sort of organelle distribution,

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.610
map it out in 3D through
lattice light sheet imaging

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.670
with a combination of plotting out

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.200
all the individual
distributions of these lipids

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.240
that have been using super
resolution imaging docked in

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.130
and put in place.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.540
Now, now that we have an
image of all these organelles

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.200
in this you can see mitochondria here

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.600
and this web-like structure represents

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.390
the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.740
we can now come in and dock in

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.960
particular proteins of interest.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.810
I'm just gonna zoom in on this area here

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.540
because what we're
particularly interested in

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.620
or we're interested in in this study

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.620
was how proteins that are part
of the endoplasmic reticulum

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.440
which is this large structure that expands

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.210
throughout the cytoplasm,
it's this tubular meshwork,

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.560
how its organized.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.900
And so what we can do
with this technology is

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.090
superimpose our distributions
of fluorescent proteins

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.250
that we've specifically
genetically engineered and tagged

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.620
onto our fluorescently acquired image

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.370
using this lattice light sheet system

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.890
to dock in where these
proteins are localized.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.000
And this is an example where we have

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.850
again, all of the membranes of the cell

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.290
that have been painted out if you will

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.000
using the lipid, our lipid probe

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.330
and single molecule
super resolution imaging.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.490
And we're now correlating it

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.290
with the diffraction
limited image of Sec61 beta

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.000
tagged with an mEmerald
of fluorescent probe.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.010
And you can see how they align.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.870
This is exciting to us because

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.520
it really sets the stage
for beginning to investigate

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.140
a whole slew of different
proteins and how they localize

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.280
within this cellular system.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.670
So we think that fits in and
Lattice Light Sheet-PAINT

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.120
or PALM-like correlative approaches

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.550
will allow us to really
gain deeper information

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.320
about how all of these
organelles are shaped

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.330
in three dimensions,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.680
and how different proteins
might distribute on them.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.680
But one of the challenges
that we still face

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.870
is how many organelles are arranged

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.870
relative to each other
in a living cell context.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.320
In particular that's
important for understanding

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.340
how different organelles
are contacting each other

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.500
and communicating with each other.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.480
We know for instance the
endoplasmic reticulum

00:27:32.374 --> 00:27:34.860
which is this sort of snake-like structure

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.820
that you can see in this EM image

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.450
is contacting virtually
every other organelle

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.690
within the cell

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.010
and communicating with those organelles

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.750
through lipid trafficking, ROS,

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.070
essentially exchange of
reactive oxygen species,

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.720
calcium signaling.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.420
Many other types of
communication is going on

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.940
between these organelles.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.050
And our problem with
trying to understand that

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.640
is that we haven't been
able to look simultaneously

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.470
at all of these organelles
in a living cell context.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.040
We can see them clearly
with electron microscopy

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.820
but if we do fluorescent
time lapse imaging

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.820
we're limited to imaging two or three

00:28:18.765 --> 00:28:21.790
of these organelles at one time

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:26.740
because of this problem of
overlap in emission spectrum

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.870
in among the different
fluorescent proteins

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.190
that are available.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:35.570
So here we have classic
fluorescent proteins

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.810
that have different emission spectrum,

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.420
CFP, GFP, YFP.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.140
These are the emission
spectrum for each of these

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.870
different fluorescent probes.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.660
And the problem is their
emission spectrum is overlapping.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.160
And what that means is that if you tagged

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.290
a particular organelle with
different fluorescent probes

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.820
like the ones that I just mentioned

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.920
which are the most widely
used fluorescent probes,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.450
and then you image essentially,

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.010
you go across the emission spectrum

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:13.130
to look at any particular
wavelength of light

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:18.130
which population of
organelle you've looked at,

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.760
you can see that you have overlap

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.280
at any particular wavelength.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.820
So that means if you were
imaging for instance at 438

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.310
you'd see three different,

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.780
you would not be able to
distinguish mitochondria,

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.500
ER and lysosomes from each other.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.840
It would just be one big blur.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.500
And hence you could not distinguish

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.870
how these different
organelles are behaving

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.790
relative to each other.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.480
So to overcome that challenge,

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.920
two postdocs in the lab
decided to employ a technology

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.330
called Multispectral
Imaging to try to unravel

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.820
this overlapping emission spectrum.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.820
And a strategy that they
used was essentially take,

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.930
if you know the the emission spectra

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.100
of each of these different fluorophores

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.340
you can then query an
observed pixel spectrum

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.130
that's a combination of one
or more of these fluorophores,

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.860
and then use linear unmixing

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.980
to decipher what combination of

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.250
and in what abundance any one

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.090
or two or more of these fluorophores

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.120
would give rise to this
particular spectrum.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.640
And using that we can at
each pixel of our image

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.610
unmix to determine which
fluorophore is giving rise

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:36.690
to the signal that we're
observing at that pixel.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.230
And so we combine that with
Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.300
to be able to image simultaneously

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.490
six different organelles
within the cell over time.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.840
In order to do that we've
essentially introduced

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.650
six different laser lines that
cover the visible spectrum

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.930
that allows us to excite the fluorophore

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:00.020
that we've tagged on each one
of these different organelles.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.670
And then we do our linear
unmixing algorithms to determine

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:09.670
each of the specific spectra
associated with each organelle.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.760
And this is what you can see in the case

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.210
of these six different
organelles that we've

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.110
introduced fluorescent tags for.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.810
Now this is in a single cell

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.880
so we can superimpose all of these signals

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.210
on top of each other to simultaneously

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.230
see in a three-dimensional space

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.360
because we're using
that lattice light sheet

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.090
to move through the
whole volume of the cell,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.200
how all of these
organelles are distributed.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.360
Now with this technique,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.260
we can begin to zone in on

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.913
really specific measurements in terms of

00:31:45.913 --> 00:31:48.960
organelle distribution, localization,

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.650
essentially connectivity.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:56.710
This is just a set of values for

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.750
the number of organelles
that each of these

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.300
different populations
of organelles represent.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.710
So for instance on average in
the cell that we're looking at

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.580
there's about 89
lysosomes, 186 peroxisomes,

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.700
157 lipid droplets.

00:32:14.684 --> 00:32:18.700
The ER occupies by far the
largest volume in this cell

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.360
among all of these different organelles.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.000
It's about 30 times the
size of the Golgi apparatus

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.530
which is involved in
the secretory pathway,

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.350
eight to nine times the
size of the mitochondria

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.200
which is involved in energy
production within the cell.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.200
Now we can also come in and segment

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.950
these individual organelles to look at how

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.570
they are connected to each other,

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.430
how they're contacting each other

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:50.300
in order to begin to
understand the communication,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.000
the cross communication
or crosstalk in activity

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.960
that we know is so important for how

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.350
cells are operating and communicating

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.580
with other cells in their environment.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.780
For instance the endoplasmic reticulum

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.030
controls the secretory pathway

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.880
together with the Golgi apparatus.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.580
It's what's secreting
the paraneural network

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.540
that we heard earlier about.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.440
It's critical for us to really understand

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.470
how these organelles behave
relative to each other

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.250
and from these types of segmented images,

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:26.190
we can create what we've
been able to describe

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.530
what we call the organelle interactome.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.700
Where we just measure
the pairwise contacts

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.616
between these different organelles

00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:38.320
in our images of these cells.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.300
And from that we can see the
frequency of communication

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.140
that different organelles
have with each other.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.630
You can see here that the ER is by far

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.250
the most communicative
of all of the organelles,

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.520
it's contacting everyone.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.490
Importantly if you look
at a single cell over time

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.530
you can see that this
organelle interactome

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:03.000
is conserved over fairly
significant periods of time,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.840
and that is despite the fact

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.830
that any particular contact that we see

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.910
is relatively transient.

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:14.190
I should emphasize that this interactome

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.270
changes dramatically if we

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.280
perturb the cell in different ways,

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.270
we can depolymerize microtubules

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.170
or starve cells in different ways,

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.360
and we dramatically change
the way these organelles

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.870
are interacting with each other.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.250
Now this is a movie
where we've segmented out

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:35.250
the mitochondria as an
example of an organelle

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.520
that is intimately communicating

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.700
with the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.970
On the right hand side
represents the surface,

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.120
all of the surface sites of mitochondria

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.330
where we see ER signal.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:55.470
So the ER is wrapping around
the surface of the mitochondria

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.610
and intimately
communicating with virtually

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.790
all of those mitochondrial
elements that we see in the cell.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.610
This contact we think is what's up,

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.170
we think there's calcium flux

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.440
between the ER and mitochondria.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.380
That calcium is playing an important role

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.400
for mitochondrial output, how much energy

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.540
is being produced by the mitochondria.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.180
We also know there's lipid and
cholesterol being transferred

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.400
across these contact sites,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.230
and importantly reactive oxygens, ROS,

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.090
reactive oxygen species
is being trafficked

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.800
across those contacts

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.642
which could play a big role in the

00:35:35.642 --> 00:35:39.410
disulfide bond formation
and protein remodeling

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:42.120
occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.820
Now let's focus in on the ER for a second.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.610
It occupies 25% of the cell cytoplasm.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.812
We can measure that using
our lattice light sheet

00:35:53.812 --> 00:35:56.200
three-dimensional reconstruction.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.040
What is interesting is that if we look at,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.700
we plot out the position of the ER

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.700
over a 15-minute time period

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.460
which you can see in this movie,

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.240
what we find is that the
ER has pretty much explored

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.020
the entire cytoplasm over just 15 minutes.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.540
So it is a very dynamic organelle

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:20.890
that has lots of capability
of communicating.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.990
Now in my final two minutes or one minute

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.300
I wanna take you through how
fast these organelles can move.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:35.470
We know that the ER has the capability

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.180
of exploring that cytoplasm.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.570
Let's look at its dynamics
at higher resolution.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.380
We can do this using a TIRF-SIM system.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.380
We can see these tubule
matrices move incredibly fast.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.820
Interestingly the tubes themselves

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.640
undergo an oscillatory activity,

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.260
that's ATP and GTP-dependent

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.190
so it's not just thermally driven.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.580
And finally we can actually come in

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.990
and start mapping out individual proteins

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.980
that move or diffuse along the surface

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.110
of the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.260
That's what you're seeing here.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:16.710
Each of these yellow spots
represent a halo tagged protein

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.330
that is associated with
the membrane of the ER

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.380
and we can begin to map out

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.180
the trajectories of these proteins,

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.080
and that's shown here for another ER

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.190
resident protein Sec61 beta.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.570
If you sum up all of these trajectories

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:31.880
you see that these proteins

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.310
and this is a transmembrane
protein you're looking at,

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:38.730
will explore the whole
surface of that ER freely.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.290
Now in my final movie here,

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.110
I just wanna show here's an example where

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:50.040
we're mapping out a protein
that actually interacts,

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.550
it's on the surface of the ER

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:54.780
but it is part of a tethering complex

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.700
that brings the ER close
to the mitochondria.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.290
And what we can see is when we track

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:04.210
these individual molecules
as they diffuse across

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.760
the surface of the ER,

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.610
we can see that as they move
across the area of the ER

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.940
that's in close proximity of mitochondria,

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.700
they slow down significantly.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.430
Consistent with a transient interaction

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.130
of this tethering protein

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.890
with the target protein on mitochondria.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.470
So with that I wanna end and say that

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:30.470
this field is really being
significantly impacted

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.450
by the high resolution
technology that's now available

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:37.350
that scans from electron microscopy

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.880
up to the fast imaging technology.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.290
People in my lab have
been greatly impacted by

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.630
the physicists at Janelia,

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.880
Eric Betzig and Harald in particular

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.320
who've really provided the technology

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.090
that allow us to do this type of work.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.108
Thank you.

00:38:56.108 --> 00:38:58.182
(audience applauding)

00:38:58.182 --> 00:39:01.420
- So as you know, life sciences are always

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.250
trying to make best use of light for many

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.070
different purposes.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:11.070
For instance we use x-ray
beam for crystallography

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.420
and the infrared light for
vibrational spectroscopy.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.990
But most biologists use visible light.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.180
And chromophore is a structure unit

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.200
so that can absorb certain visible light,

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.780
and it is responsible for color

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.730
and in many cases it has
the pi-conjugation system.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:36.300
And single and double
bonds appear alternately

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.430
so that the Pi electrons
can be delocalized.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:43.500
So electrons oscillate or
sing on the chromophore

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.150
and that's quite important
for the interaction

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.943
with the visible light.

00:39:47.943 --> 00:39:49.730
And my laboratory is engaged in

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.170
technological innovation in bio-imaging

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.930
and principally using
fluorescent proteins.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.490
And I'd like to introduce to you,

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.380
so the most classical
the fluorescent protein

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.880
Aequorea GFP.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.950
And long time ago, so in 1962

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.180
Osamu Shimomura discovered protein

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.850
and from the light-emitting
organ of the jelly fish.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.960
And just 30 years later in '92 it's seen

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.590
then it was cloned by Doug Prasher.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:20.590
And in '94, so the heterologous
expression with Aequorea GFP

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.140
was achieved by Martin
Chalfie at Columbia, okay.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.000
And then this is the primary
structure of Aequorea GFP,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.600
just 238 amino acid.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.300
So there's no chromophore
that I defined a moment ago

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.720
in the peptide.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.630
But from this three amino acid

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.820
there's serine, tyrosine, glycine

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.250
so three reactions occur
spontaneously, okay.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.470
And cyclization, dehydration
and oxidation reactions

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.510
to make the Pi-conjugation system.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.180
So this is the GFP's chromophore

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.131
and which observes blue light, okay?

00:40:55.131 --> 00:40:58.081
But this light doesn't say
anything about its fluorescence.

00:41:00.439 --> 00:41:03.440
This is a crystal
structure they call a GFP

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.260
and the beta-barrel structure.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.440
And the 11 stranded beta-barrel

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.610
with one alpha helix inside,

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.120
and the chromophore is
formed on the helix,

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.530
and that the barrel is very robust.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.180
And the chromophore is packed inside

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.210
and it takes very rigid structure

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.200
so that explains why GFP's fluorescence

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.990
quantum yield is very high.

00:41:25.974 --> 00:41:29.620
And the mutagen studies get
done by Dr. Roger Tsien,

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.820
so produced quite a few color variance

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.400
and the the more useful and brighter.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.320
And I stayed in Roger's
lab from '95 to '98

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.360
and I used CFP and the YFP

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.850
and as the donor and acceptor
for FRET so to create.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:51.810
So the genetically encoded
indicator for calcium ion,

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.850
Cameleons as Mark mentioned kindly.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.560
So now I'd like to discuss
why calcium imaging

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.950
is so interesting and appealing.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:04.344
So there should be two major reasons.

00:42:04.344 --> 00:42:09.240
First, calcium signaling
is very, so dynamic.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.780
The concentration of free calcium ion

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.590
it changes so greatly so it should be fun.

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:19.590
To observe for instance
here calcium oscillations.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.280
The second, so due to the endogenous

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.150
and the very abundant
calcium buffering systems

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.350
we can express a huge
amount of calcium probes

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:32.530
so without affecting intracellular calcium

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.590
dynamics very much, okay?

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.009
We can increase the signals,

00:42:37.009 --> 00:42:39.280
signal-to-noise ratio.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.380
Here we expressed a large
quantity of Cameleon

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.140
in excitatory neurons
with the forebrain mouse.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.200
And we signed the skinless
head with excitation light

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.710
and to get these calcium readout.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.600
And through this intact
skull and the video rate

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.850
for more than 30 minutes.

00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:04.320
So this readout reflect
spontaneous neuronal activities

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.290
and which are composed
of multiple oscillations

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:10.800
of different frequencies
and very symmetrical.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.930
And the mouse was half awake

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.060
so when we gave visual stimulation

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.200
so we saw an evoked response in the path,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.080
in the visual cortex.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.510
Now back to, so this slide.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.295
GFP is chromophore

00:43:27.295 --> 00:43:29.760
and it has a phenol ring.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:34.040
So it comes from tyrosine residue, okay?

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.082
Well, almost all of the

00:43:37.082 --> 00:43:39.020
fluorescent proteins now available

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:42.880
so do have phenol rings in
there chromophores, okay?

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.260
And the exceptions, the CFP and the BFP,

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.075
so they have indole ring or imidazole ring

00:43:49.075 --> 00:43:51.898
coming from tryptophan and the histidine.

00:43:51.898 --> 00:43:56.320
But phenol ring containing
chromophore is most common.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.650
And that there is an equilibrium

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.460
between protonated and ionized state

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.350
of the phenol hydroxyl group.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:10.310
And that they then absorb
400 and 480 nanometer light.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:15.610
And in many cases, so the
ionized form fluorescent, okay.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.495
Therefore, GFP basically has

00:44:20.495 --> 00:44:22.790
bimodal absorption spectrum.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.500
And now a circular permutation.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.400
And a long time ago just serendipitously

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.090
Geoff Baird and in Roger's lab found,

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.830
so this site 144, 145,

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:39.010
so the midpoint of the beta
strand number seven (mumbles),

00:44:39.966 --> 00:44:41.300
so circular permutation.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.010
So circular permuted GFP can synthesize

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.690
chromophore very well,

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.440
and now so the chromophore.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:53.440
The equilibrium is quite
sensitive to a neighboring event

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.740
such as a calcium-dependent
protein-protein interaction.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.740
So this is the operational
principle of GCaMP or pericam.

00:45:04.791 --> 00:45:06.720
The very important point is that

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.150
so that here calcium-binding
changes absorption spectrum

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.790
not fluorescence quantum yield, okay.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.670
As a kind of, a future perspective,

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.210
so the GCaMP should be well combined

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.380
with photo-acoustic imaging.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.380
Now I have to say and
not only the jellyfish

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.480
but some of them are done
in animals or marine animals

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.890
so can produce quite similar
fluorescent proteins, okay?

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.900
And while we have cloned
many new fluorescent proteins

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.280
from those animals.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:43.460
By using this, so these
green red proteins,

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.660
we some time ago we
developed cell cycle probe.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:51.910
And we used the Ubiquitin Oscillator.

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:54.050
Cell cycle-dependent proteolysis,

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:56.570
so to create the cell cycle probe

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.690
which labels individual
nuclei in genome phase red

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:02.110
and those in S, G2, M phases green.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.410
That's FUCCI and the
green and red indicate,

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:08.290
so the go and stop.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.690
That S phase entry, so
like a traffic signal

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.390
and when the FUCCI was
introduced into HeLa cells,

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.950
so derived from malignant tumor

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.270
we observed a cell cycle operation

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.510
in the other time at a single cell level.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:25.080
But when we did the same thing using

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.600
benign tumor derived cell line

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.210
we saw very clear contact inhibition.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:34.060
And upon reaching convertible urea

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.660
all of the cells became red

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.250
and then stopped so their proliferation.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.900
And we introduced scratch
and so some of the cells

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.200
or that one in green
after some rate and time,

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.440
so they reenter the cell
cycle and to build a gap.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.860
And we prepared FUCCI transgenic mice,

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.330
so this is a coronal section of an embryo

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:58.900
and in the brain, so neural stem cells

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.230
at the green nuclei line
in the ventricular zone

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:04.870
but post-mortem neurons
had only red nuclei

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:07.107
in the cortical (mumbles).

00:47:07.107 --> 00:47:11.200
And the green and the red
signify cell proliferation

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.650
and the differentiation.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.470
And during the embryogenesis with time,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.600
so green to red ratio decreased,

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.980
so the earlier the more proliferation,

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.170
the later the more differentiation.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.660
And after the burst so the
red signal became predominant

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.530
but even in adult tissue
so we can identify

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.210
very few green nuclei

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.170
and the cells with the green nuclei

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:36.360
corresponded to tissue stem
cells like a neural stem cells

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.360
found in the dentate gyrus, okay.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:45.640
And when we used zebrafish
embryo very transparently

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:50.110
so we can obtain cell cycle
profile in four dimensions.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.320
So this is a segmentation period of embryo

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.590
and a side view on head and tail,

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:58.630
and again with time green
to red ratio decreased

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:02.440
but some other organs
like retina and the brain,

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.580
so very green.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.080
And in top view in addition to two eyes,

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.560
so we saw a notochord.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.780
So differentiating notochord

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.680
and in notochord we discovered,

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.270
so the cell cycle transitions
and moved, traveled

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:23.094
from head to tail like this.

00:48:23.094 --> 00:48:27.140
So this G1, this transition
moved towards here.

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.910
And we think, so the cell cycle regulation

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.300
in the notochord is
linked to somite genesis

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.230
which is also characterized
by head to tail

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:39.970
progression of differentiation.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.510
But anyhow, it's quite very amazing

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.400
that we can visualize that
the middle of the body

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.570
from outside so that's just because,

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:54.590
so the fish embryo's a bit transparent.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.980
And by contrast, mouse embryos,

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.280
well, mammary animals where
including us are turbid.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.820
Yes, visible light
scatters very much inside

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:09.830
so our body so like now mentioned, okay?

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.480
Now, tissue clear identification

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.460
and long time ago we discover that

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.620
the membrane for Western Blotting analysis

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.610
it became transparent when
soaked in 4 molar urea.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.720
And we knew that, so the GFP beta-barrel,

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.520
it's a brave and tough, so rigid

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.730
and tolerant of high
concentration of urea.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:38.590
We started, so the clearing
and devolution 2011,

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.770
so with our paper on ScaleA2

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.940
which is the first and urea-based

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.280
aqueous solution for tissue
clear identification.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.770
And then it was followed by many explosion

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.730
of many new techniques,

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:56.300
and also two years ago we
reported some modification

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:01.300
ScaleS, ScaleS that contains
sorbitol in addition to urea

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.740
and we verify that ScaleS can preserve

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.860
the fluorescent signal
and also outer structures,

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.330
so subset of outer
structures like a synapse.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.870
I think researchers should be aware

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:23.360
of the critical trade-off

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.340
between effective clearing

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.710
and the tissue signal preservation.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.340
And also we invented AbScale method

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.660
so which enables three-dimensional
immunohistochemistry.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.650
And some time ago the Saito group at BSI

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:45.160
generated a single APP
knock-in mouse models

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.810
of Alzheimer disease.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.480
And we applied AbScale method,

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.520
so to the brain of aged APP knock-in mice.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:57.590
And to visualize A beta-plaques we used

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.180
Alexa488 labeled and antibody.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:05.080
And there was a brain got
prepared from a nine-month old

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.320
and APP knock-in mouse and very sparse.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.650
But in 18-month old, so we saw,

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:16.170
we observed so many
immuno-labeled A beta-plaques

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.930
and yes, even the experiment,

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.490
we transcardially perfused
the entire vasculature

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.200
with Texas Red-lectin

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.980
to label blood vessels
with red fluorescence

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:30.330
and then we immune-stained
the A beta-plaques with green

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:33.260
and to obtain this, so the 3D perspective.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.090
Very comprehensive perspective of how

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.800
A beta-plaques interferes
with blood vessels.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.430
Then we took interest
in a special association

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:47.750
of A beta-plaques with microglial cells.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.150
And we applied so the dual color AbScale

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.920
so to a brain slice prepared
from APP knock-in mouse.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.040
And we analyzed the interaction

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.040
between these two object

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.200
by light sheet microscopy observation.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.200
And we measured the distance
from each microglia center

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:12.150
to the nearest plaque age in the 3D space.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.930
Those measurements should
provide the information about

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:21.050
stability of plaque
neuritis, inflammatory state.

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:25.870
For instance, so two neighboring
plaques with similar size

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.320
but different association
with microglial cells,

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:34.320
very direct to contact
versus very isolated.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:39.500
We think they suggest acute
neuritic state versus obsolete.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:47.370
And in a similar way we 3D imaged plaque

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:51.120
microglia association in
post-mortem brain samples

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.310
of AD patient of more than 50 years old.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:58.780
And in these three brain
samples we observed,

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.290
detected very clear cored
plaques, green ones.

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:06.010
And the cored plaques without

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:09.190
and with microglia association.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.570
But in the remaining
six of the brain samples

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:20.460
we didn't see any cored plaques.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.430
So then we became interested
in diffused plaques.

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:28.330
So diffused plaques are
basically undetectable,

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:32.380
not detectable in the
two-dimensional image.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.380
But our new software can re-slice,

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.900
so the 3D reconstruction systemically

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.430
and with different sizes,

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:43.510
different thickness, okay?

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.840
And that helped us to identify

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.530
diffused plaques of different sizes.

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:53.050
And the diffused plaques are usually

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.890
assumed to be very
primitive and very isolated

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.680
from any inflammatory cells,

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.390
but we found, so most of
them can show the sign of

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:06.830
neuritis with considerable

00:54:09.322 --> 00:54:11.440
association with microglial cells.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.510
Clinically, diffused plaques are ambiguous

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:20.700
but they're potentially
very, very important, okay?

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.920
And Scale plus FUCCI we
studied vascular niche

00:54:25.782 --> 00:54:28.730
for neural stem cells
in in the dentate gyrus.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:31.480
And that we were able...

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.220
So neural stem cells or
proliferative neural stem cells

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.380
we used FUCCI S, G2, M phase marker

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:45.640
and the blood vessels
were labeled with red.

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.860
And the green nuclei,
so the neural stem cells

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.790
were indeed localized
inside the dentate gyrus

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:52.800
not outside of it.

00:54:53.799 --> 00:54:57.130
And we again performed
distance measurement

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:59.130
in a three-dimensional space.

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:02.470
We measured distance
from each green nucleus,

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:05.350
so to the nearest blood vessel, okay?

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:07.870
And then we came to a conclusion,

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:11.090
so the neural stem cells are more closely

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:15.800
associated with blood
vessels than matured neurons.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.500
And Rusty has been saying about

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.710
hippocampal neurogenesis is operated by

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:27.900
exposure to enriched environment

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.260
and we performed the
comparative experiment,

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:36.260
comparative experiment and
large-scale 3D reconstruction.

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:41.460
And our data showed the
enriched environment increased

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.490
so the number or density
of neural stem cells

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:50.052
but did not change so their
association with blood vessels.

00:55:50.052 --> 00:55:53.550
This a comprehensive data I think, I hope.

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:59.940
All right, so this slide is an interplay

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.830
between light and life.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.484
Well I remember that Roger Tsien,

00:56:06.484 --> 00:56:11.484
Roger used to remind us
nature is very kind to us,

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:12.970
to researchers

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:15.800
and that nature still
remains the best source

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.840
of bio-imaging tools, okay?

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.580
And this is my last slide

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:26.050
and only a scientist
with a respect for nature

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:29.260
would have been permitted to surpass it

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.490
in English, Japanese and Chinese.

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:34.546
And thank you very much for attention.

00:56:34.546 --> 00:56:37.713
(audience applauding)

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.687
(uptempo music)
