further or it starts to buy eggs
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.500
further or it starts to buy eggs
the expansion is catalyzed further by

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510
the expansion is catalyzed further by
 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.990
the expansion is catalyzed further by
the Texas Revolution Texas gets its

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
the Texas Revolution Texas gets its
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.990
the Texas Revolution Texas gets its
independence from Mexico which itself

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
independence from Mexico which itself
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430
independence from Mexico which itself
got independence only a few decades

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
got independence only a few decades
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.100
got independence only a few decades
before that from Spain but so Texas for

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
before that from Spain but so Texas for
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.600
before that from Spain but so Texas for
a brief amount of time is it's its own

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
a brief amount of time is it's its own
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.150
a brief amount of time is it's its own
independent country but then it joins

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160
independent country but then it joins
 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.180
independent country but then it joins
the u.s. its annexed by the US in 1845

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190
the u.s. its annexed by the US in 1845
 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.890
the u.s. its annexed by the US in 1845
so it's more territory for the US and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900
so it's more territory for the US and
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.890

that was slave territory right yeah so
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.760
that was slave territory right yeah so
again this is an area in the south where

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770
again this is an area in the south where
 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.710
again this is an area in the south where
most of the reasons that we slavery

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
most of the reasons that we slavery
 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240
most of the reasons that we slavery
existed in the south is because it's a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
existed in the south is because it's a
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.490
existed in the south is because it's a
very fertile agricultural region right

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
very fertile agricultural region right
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.880
very fertile agricultural region right
where the things that you grow crops are

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
where the things that you grow crops are
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.730
where the things that you grow crops are
very labor intensive so they figure how

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740
very labor intensive so they figure how
 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.650
very labor intensive so they figure how
are we going to find enough people to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
are we going to find enough people to
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750
are we going to find enough people to
grow these crops and the answer is

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
grow these crops and the answer is
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.880
grow these crops and the answer is
they've been importing African slaves

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.330
gets all of this area in the West right
over here right it's more territory and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340
over here right it's more territory and
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.310
over here right it's more territory and
it's more sort of southern territory

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
it's more sort of southern territory
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.650
it's more sort of southern territory
which means that has a high probability

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660
which means that has a high probability
 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.370
which means that has a high probability
of becoming slave states and so this map

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
of becoming slave states and so this map
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.630
of becoming slave states and so this map
that we looked at earlier in the other

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640
that we looked at earlier in the other
 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.910
that we looked at earlier in the other
video this this is kind of showing what

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
video this this is kind of showing what
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.729
video this this is kind of showing what
the what the u.s. looked like as we as

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739
the what the u.s. looked like as we as
 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.530
the what the u.s. looked like as we as
we exit out of the mexican-american war

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540
we exit out of the mexican-american war
 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.040
we exit out of the mexican-american war
we're getting to about 1850 and so what

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050
we're getting to about 1850 and so what
 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.420
we're getting to about 1850 and so what
happens then I mean is it just one

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
happens then I mean is it just one
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.009
happens then I mean is it just one
compromise after another at this point

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019
compromise after another at this point
 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.690
compromise after another at this point
well this is the point where compromise

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700
well this is the point where compromise
 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.229
well this is the point where compromise
begins to break down right Henry Clay

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239
begins to break down right Henry Clay
 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.270
begins to break down right Henry Clay
again is the architect of what's called

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280
again is the architect of what's called
 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.560
again is the architect of what's called
the compromise of 1850 as soon as the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570
the compromise of 1850 as soon as the
 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.140
the compromise of 1850 as soon as the
u.s. goes to war with Mexico people in

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
u.s. goes to war with Mexico people in

u.s. goes to war with Mexico people in
Congress are wondering our if we get

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
Congress are wondering our if we get
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.150
Congress are wondering our if we get
this territory that we're trying to get

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160
this territory that we're trying to get
 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.290
this territory that we're trying to get
what's going to happen are they going to

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300
what's going to happen are they going to
 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.449
what's going to happen are they going to
be free slaves free states or slave

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
be free slaves free states or slave
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.150
be free slaves free states or slave
states and you know

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160
states and you know
 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.280
states and you know
this compromise over free and slave

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290
this compromise over free and slave
 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.990

thirty years since the Missouri

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530
thirty years since the Missouri
 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.740
thirty years since the Missouri
Compromise and you know even longer if

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750
Compromise and you know even longer if
 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.180
Compromise and you know even longer if
you take it back to 1776 so they're

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190
you take it back to 1776 so they're
 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.860
you take it back to 1776 so they're
doing exactly the same thing they're

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870
doing exactly the same thing they're
 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.720
doing exactly the same thing they're
saying all right well let's try to keep

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730
saying all right well let's try to keep
 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.910
saying all right well let's try to keep
a balance of power between free states

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920
a balance of power between free states
 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.150
a balance of power between free states
and slave states except they add in a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160
and slave states except they add in a
 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.240
and slave states except they add in a
couple of provisos that make people

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250
couple of provisos that make people
 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.510
couple of provisos that make people
really angry in the 1850s and who gets

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520
really angry in the 1850s and who gets
 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.540
really angry in the 1850s and who gets
angry both I would say slave owners and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550
angry both I would say slave owners and
 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.980
angry both I would say slave owners and
abolitionists and anti-slavery activists

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990
abolitionists and anti-slavery activists
 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.810
abolitionists and anti-slavery activists
in the north so I guess that's what

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820
in the north so I guess that's what
 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.460
in the north so I guess that's what
makes it a compromise a little bit of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470
makes it a compromise a little bit of
 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.100
makes it a compromise a little bit of
something to make everyone angry and so

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110
something to make everyone angry and so
 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.100
something to make everyone angry and so
what what what made what made the what

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110
what what what made what made the what
 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.290
what what what made what made the what
what made the slave owners angry about a

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300
what made the slave owners angry about a
 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.430
what made the slave owners angry about a
compromise of 1850

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440
compromise of 1850
 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.890
compromise of 1850
well one of the parts of the compromise

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900
well one of the parts of the compromise
 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.320
well one of the parts of the compromise
of 1850 apart from deciding whether

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330
of 1850 apart from deciding whether
 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.790
of 1850 apart from deciding whether
these new territories were going to be

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800
these new territories were going to be
 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.090
these new territories were going to be
slave or free was a part of the act was

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100
slave or free was a part of the act was
 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.640
slave or free was a part of the act was
called the Fugitive Slave Act and the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.010
Fugitive Slave Act said that it was a
federal offense not to help slave owners

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020
federal offense not to help slave owners

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730
recover so this is something that would
 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.640
recover so this is something that would
make the the abolitionist angle or the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650
make the the abolitionist angle or the
 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.760

Slave Law the southerners the compromise
of 1850 it sounds like was it was a

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:04.410
of 1850 it sounds like was it was a
 

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.560
of 1850 it sounds like was it was a
compromise not everyone was happy but it

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.570
compromise not everyone was happy but it
 

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.420
compromise not everyone was happy but it
sounds like it made the anti-slavery

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:08.430
sounds like it made the anti-slavery
 

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.940
sounds like it made the anti-slavery
folks more unhappy than the slavery

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:10.950
folks more unhappy than the slavery
 

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.160
folks more unhappy than the slavery
folks yeah absolutely so it makes the

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.170
folks yeah absolutely so it makes the
 

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.250
folks yeah absolutely so it makes the
anti-slavery folks super unhappy but it

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260
anti-slavery folks super unhappy but it
 

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.980
anti-slavery folks super unhappy but it
also means that now white slave owners

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:18.990
also means that now white slave owners
 

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.110

in the south they feel like there's a

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120
in the south they feel like there's a
 

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.760
in the south they feel like there's a
target on their heads and so they're

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:22.770
target on their heads and so they're
 

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.130
target on their heads and so they're
going to dig in even further to make

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140
going to dig in even further to make
 

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.190
going to dig in even further to make
sure that their interests in slavery are

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200
sure that their interests in slavery are
 

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.890
sure that their interests in slavery are
protected and this gets us to the

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:30.900
protected and this gets us to the
 

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.590
protected and this gets us to the
election of 1860 which I guess in some

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600
election of 1860 which I guess in some
 

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.600
election of 1860 which I guess in some
ways was the you know the straw that

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:35.610
ways was the you know the straw that
 

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.070
ways was the you know the straw that
breaks the camel's back I guess from a

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080
breaks the camel's back I guess from a
 

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.500
breaks the camel's back I guess from a
southern perspective and why is that

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:38.510
southern perspective and why is that
 

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.920
southern perspective and why is that
well during the 1850s you have all of

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:42.930
well during the 1850s you have all of
 

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.820
well during the 1850s you have all of
these political battles over slavery in

these political battles over slavery in
 

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.580
these political battles over slavery in
fact it kind of breaks the major

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:49.590
fact it kind of breaks the major
 

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.370
fact it kind of breaks the major
political party of the 1850s the Whig

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:52.380
political party of the 1850s the Whig
 

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.350

party so in 1860 some of these leftover
 

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.990
