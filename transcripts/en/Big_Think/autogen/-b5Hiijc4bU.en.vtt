what's interesting is that hope in

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
what's interesting is that hope in
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.849
what's interesting is that hope in
particular seems to have a kind of

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859
particular seems to have a kind of
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.580
particular seems to have a kind of
really low barrier for cognitive

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
really low barrier for cognitive
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.919
really low barrier for cognitive
consistency so as long as I don't

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
consistency so as long as I don't
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.990
consistency so as long as I don't
believe something to be impossible it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
believe something to be impossible it
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.730
believe something to be impossible it
seems to be an object that's at least

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
seems to be an object that's at least
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.650
seems to be an object that's at least
possible for me to hope for so I don't

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
possible for me to hope for so I don't
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.510
possible for me to hope for so I don't
think it's impossible and I don't think

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
think it's impossible and I don't think
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.820
think it's impossible and I don't think
it's certain it seems to be a candidate

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
it's certain it seems to be a candidate
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.040
it's certain it seems to be a candidate
for hope and insofar as then my desire

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
for hope and insofar as then my desire
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.160
for hope and insofar as then my desire
for it kicks in and it engages my agency

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
for it kicks in and it engages my agency
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.480
for it kicks in and it engages my agency
in the right sorts of ways it seems like

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490
in the right sorts of ways it seems like
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.930
in the right sorts of ways it seems like
I can't actually hope for it so in the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940
I can't actually hope for it so in the
 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.860
I can't actually hope for it so in the
religious tradition there's a lot of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
religious tradition there's a lot of
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.840
religious tradition there's a lot of
work that's been done on of course hope

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
work that's been done on of course hope
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.580
work that's been done on of course hope
and particularly the relation between

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
and particularly the relation between
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380
and particularly the relation between
hope and other of the so called

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
hope and other of the so called
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.709
hope and other of the so called
theological virtues faith and love and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
theological virtues faith and love and
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.680
theological virtues faith and love and
one of things we were interested in and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690
one of things we were interested in and
 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.810
one of things we were interested in and
has to do with the connection between

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
has to do with the connection between
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479
has to do with the connection between
state and hope so a lot of people think

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
state and hope so a lot of people think
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490
state and hope so a lot of people think
of faith as having a kind of belief

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
of faith as having a kind of belief
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.189
of faith as having a kind of belief
commitment that something is going to be

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
commitment that something is going to be
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.990
commitment that something is going to be
certain or that something is going to be

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
certain or that something is going to be
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630
certain or that something is going to be
probable that maybe outstrips the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
probable that maybe outstrips the
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000
probable that maybe outstrips the
evidence and the interesting thing about

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
evidence and the interesting thing about
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830
evidence and the interesting thing about
Hope is that it seems to kind of float

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
Hope is that it seems to kind of float
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660
Hope is that it seems to kind of float
free from judgments about the evidence

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
free from judgments about the evidence
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.100
free from judgments about the evidence
so you can hope for something even

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
so you can hope for something even
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530
so you can hope for something even
though you really don't believe it's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
though you really don't believe it's
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539
though you really don't believe it's
likely to come about and so one of the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
likely to come about and so one of the
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.770
likely to come about and so one of the
things we were interested in with this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
things we were interested in with this
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530
things we were interested in with this
project is when it comes to the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
project is when it comes to the
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080
project is when it comes to the
religious context what sorts of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
religious context what sorts of
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.580
religious context what sorts of
religious practices does mirror hoping

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590
religious practices does mirror hoping
 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.499
religious practices does mirror hoping
cultivate so for instance suppose you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
cultivate so for instance suppose you
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510
cultivate so for instance suppose you
were someone who had religious beliefs

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
were someone who had religious beliefs
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.600
were someone who had religious beliefs
but for various reasons have come to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
but for various reasons have come to
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.580
but for various reasons have come to
believe other things maybe become

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
believe other things maybe become
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.460
believe other things maybe become
agnostic about the existence of God say

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470
agnostic about the existence of God say
 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.749
agnostic about the existence of God say
but nevertheless do you still hope that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
but nevertheless do you still hope that
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.630
but nevertheless do you still hope that
God exists and if you do hope that God

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
God exists and if you do hope that God
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.990
God exists and if you do hope that God
exists what sorts of practices does that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
exists what sorts of practices does that
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.249
exists what sorts of practices does that
kind of hoping sort of inspire is it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
kind of hoping sort of inspire is it
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.889
kind of hoping sort of inspire is it
possible to hopefully pray even though

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
possible to hopefully pray even though
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.330
possible to hopefully pray even though
you don't actually believe that God

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
you don't actually believe that God
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.310
you don't actually believe that God
exists can you still pray and hope can

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
exists can you still pray and hope can
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.710
exists can you still pray and hope can
you participate in religious practices

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
you participate in religious practices
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.149
you participate in religious practices
and communities even though you don't

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
and communities even though you don't
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.490
and communities even though you don't
actually endorse the beliefs necessarily

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
actually endorse the beliefs necessarily
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109
actually endorse the beliefs necessarily
anymore but nonetheless you're still

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
anymore but nonetheless you're still
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.569
anymore but nonetheless you're still
hope for an afterlife where you hope for

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
hope for an afterlife where you hope for
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.410
hope for an afterlife where you hope for
the unity of virtue and happiness in the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
the unity of virtue and happiness in the
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.219
the unity of virtue and happiness in the
end so what sorts of distinctive beliefs

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
end so what sorts of distinctive beliefs
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.800
end so what sorts of distinctive beliefs
and practices can we get if we have hope

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810
and practices can we get if we have hope
 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.340
and practices can we get if we have hope
with

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350
with
 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.190
with
out say with respect to the religious

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
out say with respect to the religious
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.680
out say with respect to the religious
situation as long as I don't believe

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
situation as long as I don't believe
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.870
situation as long as I don't believe
that the existence of God say is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
that the existence of God say is
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.650
that the existence of God say is
logically impossible and few even sort

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
logically impossible and few even sort
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.120
logically impossible and few even sort
of adamant atheists would say it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
of adamant atheists would say it's
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.400
of adamant atheists would say it's
logically impossible that God exists or

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
logically impossible that God exists or
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.740
logically impossible that God exists or
that they're absolutely certain that God

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
that they're absolutely certain that God
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.140
that they're absolutely certain that God
doesn't exist just like most theists

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
doesn't exist just like most theists
 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.600
doesn't exist just like most theists
would not say they're absolutely certain

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
would not say they're absolutely certain
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.420
would not say they're absolutely certain
that God exists so here we are we're

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
that God exists so here we are we're
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550
that God exists so here we are we're
between absolute impossibility and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
between absolute impossibility and
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.190
between absolute impossibility and
certainty well that's the perfect space

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
certainty well that's the perfect space
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.830
certainty well that's the perfect space
for hope to operate in and so in a way

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
for hope to operate in and so in a way
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.710
for hope to operate in and so in a way
hope and in the religious context

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
hope and in the religious context
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.770
hope and in the religious context
doesn't necessarily involve assessment

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
doesn't necessarily involve assessment
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.620
doesn't necessarily involve assessment
of the odds or the probability in the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
of the odds or the probability in the
 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.660
of the odds or the probability in the
way that maybe faith would and so as

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670
way that maybe faith would and so as
 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.610
way that maybe faith would and so as
long as you can think yeah there's a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
long as you can think yeah there's a
 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.580
long as you can think yeah there's a
consistent narrative in some particular

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590
consistent narrative in some particular
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.040
consistent narrative in some particular
religious tradition even if I'm not sure

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
religious tradition even if I'm not sure
 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.930
religious tradition even if I'm not sure
that it's true or even I don't even

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940
that it's true or even I don't even
 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.070
that it's true or even I don't even
think it's likely that's true

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
think it's likely that's true
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.470
think it's likely that's true
nonetheless you might engage in the kind

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
nonetheless you might engage in the kind
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.270
nonetheless you might engage in the kind
of hope that say the Christian God

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
of hope that say the Christian God
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.340
of hope that say the Christian God
exists and in doing so that might

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
exists and in doing so that might
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.970
exists and in doing so that might
actually motivate certain kinds of

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980
actually motivate certain kinds of
 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.440
actually motivate certain kinds of
religious practices so I think it's

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
religious practices so I think it's
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.560
religious practices so I think it's
definitely the case that we can do

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570
definitely the case that we can do
 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.820
definitely the case that we can do
certain things that put us in a position

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830
certain things that put us in a position
 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.690
certain things that put us in a position
to have robust deep abiding hopes and so

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
to have robust deep abiding hopes and so
 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.550
to have robust deep abiding hopes and so
in that sense I do think hope can be

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560
in that sense I do think hope can be
 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.620
in that sense I do think hope can be
under the volitional control of an agent

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630
under the volitional control of an agent
 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.360
under the volitional control of an agent
it might not be the sort of thing that I

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
it might not be the sort of thing that I
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.300
it might not be the sort of thing that I
can just bootstrap my way into on a dime

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310
can just bootstrap my way into on a dime
 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.800
can just bootstrap my way into on a dime
and so if on a snap or something like

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810
