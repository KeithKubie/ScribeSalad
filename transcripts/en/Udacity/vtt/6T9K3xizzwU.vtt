00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.262
Now I'm going to talk about Tag Manager.

00:00:02.262 --> 00:00:05.014
I'll be covering two
main uses of Tag Manager.

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:09.343
First, I'll talk about how to use it
to send dynamic configuration data to

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:10.580
your app.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.340
For example, if your app's a game,
you could offer different challenges for

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.960
different levels, depending on
the attack strength the player has left.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.380
If you ran a shopping app,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.080
you could use Tag Manager to
change the daily discount offer.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.965
The second use of Tag Manager relates
to organizing and managing tags.

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:32.549
A tag is a fragment of code that
performs some kind of tracking function.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.908
In the previous lesson,

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:38.540
you added tags to your app to send
tracking data to Google Analytics.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.830
Instead of sending data
directly to Google Analytics,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.790
you could send it to Tag Manager, which
can then send it on to Google Analytics.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.727
It's easy to change the way the data
is reported to Google Analytics using

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:53.234
the Tag Manager dashboard,
without having to change your code.

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:57.029
And Tag Manager helps you visualize and
organize your tags.

00:00:57.029 --> 00:01:00.733
You'll learn how to create tags to
forward hit data from your app to

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.450
Google Analytics in the next lesson.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.629
In this lesson,

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.450
you'll learn how to use Tag Manager to
dynamically update values in your app.
