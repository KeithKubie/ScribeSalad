00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.420
Our last step is to make sure
that our progressive web app

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.260
can become a first class citizen, and
isn't relegated only to the browser, but

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.540
can exist outside of there.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.810
When a native app is installed, it's
automatically added to the users home

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.570
screen place it where the user will see
it every time they look at their device.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.000
With the add to home screen feature,
users can choose to add your app to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.670
their home screen just as an installed
native app gets from the store but

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.080
with a lot less friction.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.703
Then, adding a web app manifest,
your web app can choose the name and

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:38.907
icons used that will
appear on the home screen.

00:00:38.907 --> 00:00:42.357
Be launched in full screen
mode with no URL bar,

00:00:42.357 --> 00:00:46.327
control the screen orientation for
optimal viewing,

00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:50.728
define a splash screen launch
experience and theme color and

00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:55.754
even track wether you'll launch from
the home screen or the URL bar.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:59.915
The web app manifest is
supported by Chrome, Opera, and

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:04.379
Firefox, plus Microsoft
is investigating it.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.430
Safari on iOS is a little bit different,
but we will cover that too.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.510
And of course you'll be putting
all of this knowledge to use

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.520
on your weather app, and
then deploying it to the Web.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.120
Let's jump in.
