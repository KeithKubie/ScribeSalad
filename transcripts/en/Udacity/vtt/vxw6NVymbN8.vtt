00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.186
Well, let's see.
3 miles,

00:00:01.186 --> 00:00:03.485
that's the distance we're working with.

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:05.578
And I'm going to be
relating miles to feet, so

00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:08.900
it looks like I'm going to
use this statement somehow.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.980
And I know I want to
multiply by something,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.770
but what's my conversion
factor going to be?

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.430
Is it going to be 1 mile
divided by 5282 feet?

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.670
No, it can't be,
because miles doesn't cancel out.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.200
Here we have miles up top and
feet down below.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.830
What we really want is to cancel
out this unit of miles so

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.700
that we're left just with feet.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.409
So this, this is wrong.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.496
Instead I'm going to multiply
by 5280 feet divided by 1 mile.

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:42.620
And I'm allowed to do that.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.001
It doesn't matter if feet or

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.944
miles goes on top because either
way I'm multiplying by 1.

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:50.376
I just have to select
the correct conversion factor so

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:52.214
that miles will cancel out.

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:55.117
I'm left with 3 x 5280.

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:57.091
My units are feet.

00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:01.396
And if I plug this into my calculator or
do some multiplication,

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:04.120
I find a distance of 15,840 feet.
