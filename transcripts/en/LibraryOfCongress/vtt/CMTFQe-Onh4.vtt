00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:18.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington,DC.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.770
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Hello,
this is Juan Felipe Herrera,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.990
US Poet Laureate and I'm here
at the Special Collections

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.410
and Rare Books Division
with Mark Manivong.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.450
And we have been looking at
these beautiful materials

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.190
that Mark is going to
begin to tell us about.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.600
What do we have here, Mark?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.840
&gt;&gt; Mark Manivong: Well first
I pulled some materials

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.300
from our Sylvester &amp;
Orphanos collection.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.210
Sylvester &amp; Orphanos is a small
publisher in Los Angeles, CA.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.450
They did about 25 fine editions
of works by popular authors,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.730 position:56%
and culminating with their
Tsarouchis volume which is a tribute

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.840
to the Greek artist Tsarouchis.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.480
It includes about 36
serigraphs and several tributes

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.940
from other authors and painters.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.140
&gt;&gt; Herrera: You know, we were
talking about that collection,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.330
and it's a pretty big collection
in addition to the prints

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.480 position:56%
and art...tell us a little bit about
the art of Tsarouchis actually.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.780
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Okay.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.380
Well, he's a modern Greek painter.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.950
He was most active from about
1930 through about 2000.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.740
He does a lot of very realistic,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.890
very raw paintings,
most of which are men.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.660
A lot of his paintings
are homo-erotic.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.390
The women that he paints
are typically very strong,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.110 position:56%
very much like a Frida Kahlo figure.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.410
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.710
We notice that.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.050
And what is the medium?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.720
It's a very...it looks like a
watercolor...looks like acrylic.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.100
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Acrylic.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.400
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Acrylic.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.700
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Typically.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.120
He did do some drawings, some
charcoal and pen and ink I believe.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.540
And he was also active in the
theatre and he did set designs.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.420
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Ohhh...I
didn't know that part.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.460
Oh, that's amazing.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.370
And...what about the tributes.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.010
This is also very interesting.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.310
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Yes.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.350
The tributes are from authors and
other painters, some hoteliers

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.570
and other major figures--
authors such as Odysseus Elytis,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.930
who was the Poet Laureate of
Poetry, pardon me, in 1976.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.230
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.810
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Yes, and Reynolds
Price, a major American author.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.900
James Merrill, another major
American author and poet.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.890
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And this is
done on letter press?

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.190
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Yes it is.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.970
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's a
lot of good work there.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.150
&gt;&gt; Manivong: And the
tributes were in both English

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.210
and then you could turn it
over and they're in Greek.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.510
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.810
That's right.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.110
I'm really moved by this.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.320
I'm really inspired by
the work of this artist.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.630
And I was looking at the faces.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.120
They kind of remind me of a litle
bit, of course it's very different,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.470
of Matisse's faces and
the dark outline pencil.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.770
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Yes.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.070
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's beautiful.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.370
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Yes

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.880
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And the other work
that you showed me was....

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.370
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Well, the collection,
these are the...a selection

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.260
of the 25 editions
that they published.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.560
And then, as part

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.930
of that acquisition we
also received their archive

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.690
for all 25 editions of their books.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.540
So I pulled out one archive.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.150
Each archive is divided
into...by publication.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.630
And then this one is for
John Cheevers' Expelled,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.250
a miniature book.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.660
And included in the
archive are letters

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.970
from the publishers requesting
permission to publish a work,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.010
any kind of responses the received
from writers or their agents,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.870
and here we have a
selection of letters

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.850
from the artist they contracted
with to do with the book.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.090
And this particular
artist, Warren Chappell,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.500
in all of his publications he
would include a little drawing

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.350
on his letterhead.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.250
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's what I really
liked about these letters.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.440
You wouldn't see this
kind of material at all

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.290
if we hadn't collected
it or acquired it.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.610
And it's so beautiful because
the handwriting of the artist,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.820
and it's a letter, and then the
artist decides to draw something

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.240
on that letter and just kind
of gobble up the whole page.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.540
I like that.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.470
&gt;&gt; Manivong: And some of them
are quite intricate drawings.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.770
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's true.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.070
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Yes.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.370
&gt;&gt; Herrrera: We have...what
is this like a...

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.670
&gt;&gt; Manivong: A gargoyle.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.480
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Like a
gargoyle and we have a...

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.780
[ Laughter ]

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.080
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Who's this guy?

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.380
&gt;&gt; Manivong: I have no idea!

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.680
&gt;&gt; Herrera: He looks
kind of stately there.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.090 position:56%
And then we have like a clown
balancing a feather-- and on and on.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.570
And different colors and
different inks and everything.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.110
I love this.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.880
It's like we could do letters,
on kind of a stationary,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.120
responding to a publisher and then
we could add our drawings in there.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.420
That's beautiful.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.720
So I think that's great.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.460
&gt;&gt; Manivong: And part of the...the
other part of the archive,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.520
we also have author-corrected
proof pages so you could track back

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.280
and see if there are any
changes text over the years,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.460 position:56%
over multiple publications and
where that change may have occurred.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.980
We have samples of
bindings, gatherings,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.580
the individual gatherings
from the publication.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.010
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And the gatherings are
before the book is actually bound

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.950
and produced.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.140
They're like, let's see what
it looks like...and these are

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.440
the gatherings.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.330
So we have gatherings for
even a small size like that.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.630
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Okay.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.930
The next collection I'd like
to show you is our Poet's

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.830
Laureate collection.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.440
This collection is made up of all
the works of the Poets Laureate.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.440
We collect every title,
every edition.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.550
And that frequently includes
small press works, broadsides,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.660
anything that the Poets
have produced.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.960
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's amazing.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.480
I'm looking at the, this
one by Maxine Kumin.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.270
When was that done?

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.570
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Yeah, I
don't know exactly.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.870
I can check.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.170
&gt;&gt; Herrera: A while ago.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.470
That's for sure.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.870
&gt;&gt; Manivong: But typically,
these are signed

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.690
by the poets when they're here.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.280
This is from 1992.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.580
&gt;&gt; Herrera: 1992.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.420
That's a very nice looking book.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.820
&gt;&gt; Manivong: But anything that
she's produced we will add it

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.490
to our collection.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.790
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Right.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.090
And then the broadsides.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Broadsides are amazing.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.890
These are typically single poems
and they are combined with artwork,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.410
most often a woodblock print.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.540
Sometimes there's a drawing or a
small painting that goes on them.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.910
They are usually done in limited
edition, so maybe about a hundred

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.980
to a hundred and fifty copies.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.980
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's what I
noticed that there are not many,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.870
there are not like 200 or
300, there's around a hundred.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.170
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Right.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.470
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yeah like a hundred.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.770
There's not like a thousand.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.070
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Right.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.370
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's a short edition.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.670
And then they're also
signed, and numbered

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.590
and signed mostly in pencil.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.890
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Right.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.190
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's interesting.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.500
Not all of the time,
but most of the time.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.160
&gt;&gt; Manivong: And they're
usually done by fine presses.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.450
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.490
&gt;&gt; Manivong: And we even
have your works right here,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.250
the most recent Poet Laureate.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.770
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I just noticed.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.180
Good going.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.280
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Thank you.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.610
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And this is
a bigger piece over here.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.910
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Right.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.440
That's a fine press book by
a small press in Richmond,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.890
VA and it's Charles
Wright's Yard Journal.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.750
And this has what I believe,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.530
I think these are serigraphs
combined with his poetry.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.830
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Very nice.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.120
Kind of a...the serigraphs
are very interesting.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.390
They're kind of galactic
or something.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.690
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Very modern looking.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.080
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Very modern looking.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.010
Kind of like a new
universe coming into being.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.310
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Right.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.610
[ Laughter ]

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.910
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Maybe that's
what he's talking about.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.210
Maybe it corresponds.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.680
A mist in the trees.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.560
A mist in the trees and
new stars, old songs.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.270
Maybe that's going on.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.020
Beautiful poems, beautiful
serigraphs,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.710
beautiful book, beautiful
collection.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.010
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Thank you.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.310
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Thank you so much.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.610
&gt;&gt; Manivong: Thank you for coming.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.910
