00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:08.041
All right, it's the time of year
where you're either depressed

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.308
because you're alone
or depressed

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:11.344
because you're trapped
in a relationship.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.946
Happy Valentine's Day.
To make it extra special,

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.681
I gave my Twitter
followers the chance

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.650
to proclaim their love on TV

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.852
as long as they included
one thing

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.155
they wanted to change
about their sweetheart,

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.558
in a segment called
Be Mine and Be Better.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:30.029
I love you Kim, but please stop
gossiping while in the car,

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:32.799
it makes me want to drive
into oncoming traffic.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:37.103
Love Ron. You don't gossip while
your man is driving a vehicle.

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.005
Here's what you do,
you sit there quietly

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.239
and about five minutes

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:42.041
before you reach
your destination you say

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:43.910
hey would you like
some road head?

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.448
I love you but, I'm also in love
with Swedish Fish

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.617
that's my shit,
cha cha cha smiley face.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.821
I love you Rachel, but you got
to stop wearing socks to bed.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.390
Jim. Rachel take off your socks
it's fucking gross.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.862
I love you Amy, but I wish you
knew how to make a decent gravy.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:07.500
Why is gravy capitalized?
Is that how bad her gravy is?

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.105
Amy has no idea,
she's making a subpar gravy.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.407
This guy's not asking
for an excellent gravy,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.677
I want the best gravy.
He wants a decent gravy,

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.281
so he can choke down
that dog food you call dinner.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.350
This is the harmonic kiss.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:33.926
That's how I great my staff
every morning.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.029
Let's them know I still care
without crossing any lines.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:38.364
Morning guys.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.100
Morning Daniel.

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:09.896
Real mature,
there's not harmonic queefing.

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:15.568
Some people just don't know
how to behave in the workplace.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.972
Look what's on our door,
Princess.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:22.175
Here's why you never marry
the baby voice girl.

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.848
Aw, princess.
Princess Jennifer Ross.

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.984
First of all
you're not a princess

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:35.488
Jennifer, princesses vacation
on yachts in the Mediterranean.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.223
Not at amusement parks
in Anaheim.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.562
Look at my flowers, why did
they not put any water in them?

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.298
My guess is the poor pussy
whipped bastard that's married

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.001
to you wants them to die
just like this relationship.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:52.939
Holy shmoley, I get a sash.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:56.976
Look at my fantastically
fantastic princess sash.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.879
Spectacular, spectacular.

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.381
Wait I don't never know
how to put a sash on.

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:05.051
I'm not a beauty queen,
did I do it right?

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.752
Looks right.

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:07.987
A-ha.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.156
A-ha.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.226
Now give that to your husband
so he can hang himself with it.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:18.531
Here's my scepter, it's sparkly.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:20.733
The only way this is worth it is

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.869
if that scepter ends up
in her butt later.

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:31.878
Dream. Wow. That's a crown.

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:37.883
Holy moley. It came on
a pillow and everything.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.986
Good lord,
this bitch better have cancer.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:44.857
Personally I don't treat
my girlfriend like a princess,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.059
I treat her like a queen.

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.295
Not just on her birthday,
every day.

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:52.231
Hey I can't find my phone,
will you call it real quick?

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:54.634
This is madness.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.670
I swear on the sword of dragons
that the queen's name

00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.173
shall never be spoke
in my kingdom again.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.642
Guard.

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.545
Fine. I'm getting
Thai food for dinner.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.816
You speak with such disdain,
yet you beg for mercy.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:13.886
Winter is coming.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.956
If this next pillow could talk
it would be sobbing.

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:24.530
They are gonna so many little
throw pillows.

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:29.268
That's just how you fluff up
a pillow in my house.

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:31.370
I actually had to stop
fucking my couch cushions

00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:34.540
because it was always so awkward
at breakfast the next morning.

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:36.442
If that pillow didn't want it,

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:38.978
it shouldn't have worn
that slutty red pillowcase.

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.984
Wow you were really aggressive
tonight Cameron,

00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:46.185
you're sure you're
not upset about

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:47.486
my parents
staying the weekend?

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.156
Here's the best way to keep
your relationships fresh.

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:52.391
Yeah I can't watch this,

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:54.927
I get claustrophobic
if I even hold a girl's hand.

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.998
Now psychopaths
can fit five times

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.933
as many victims
in their meat locker.

00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:05.404
Are you guys smiling?

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:07.840
Just put on matching
white shirts and rolled up jeans

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:10.009
and pose in the sand
like normal lovebirds.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:12.979
This is what cannibals do
with their leftovers.

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:16.316
You need eat or freeze them
by the end of the month.

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:19.885
I have to preserve my staff
at the end of every season,

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:22.355
but I just pickle them.

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.991
All right, see you guys
next season.
