00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.810
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER: It's a
honor to be here with you guys

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.410
this morning.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.910
I wrote a new book
called "The Black Tax--

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.150
The Cost of Being Black
in America," and it's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.450
about what is the financial
cost of discrimination

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.700
against black people.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.270
Often when people are
talking about discrimination,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.210
we're talking about
the morality of it,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.640
we're talking about the
injustice associated with it,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.630
and I wanted to take a
different look at it.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.360
I wanted to look at what is
the financial cost, right?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.400
I wanted to look
at what researchers

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.170
have said is that cost,
and then over time,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.740
see if we can aggregate that
to build a picture of actually

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.460
what's happening.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.240
So the book is broken
into three parts.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.180
It's lot of words.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.540
You can focus on me.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.200
It's OK.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.940
The first part is a look at
the costs of discrimination

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.170
across multiple industries.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.480
The housing, automotive, job
search, high-end careers,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.940
online commerce,
business, financing,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.400
to see what that
picture looks like.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.550
The second part
of the book, I try

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.200
to answer a pressing
question which is, how is it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.510
that after 400 years, 40-plus
million African Americans own

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.470
just 2% of US wealth?

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:01.230
Either we are
consistently inept,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.310
or there is something else
happening in the environment

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.830
that we need to take
a closer look at.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.120
The third part of the book, we
explore an economic framework

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.610
that I call PHD as a framework
that individuals and families,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.590
corporations, businesses,
so on and so forth,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.570
can employ if they want to
address two particularly

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.380
pressing issues.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.720
The first is we're missing
6 million jobs and 1.4

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.700
million businesses with staff.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.550
Not sole proprietors, businesses
with staff across the broader

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.290
black community in America.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.370
Those two things
combined with $8 trillion

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.140
of net worth that
is also missing

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.560
are the single biggest
drivers for almost all

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.480
of the socioeconomic issues and
challenges that we are facing.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.520
So what is the black tax?

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.160
The black tax is the financial
cost placed on black Americans

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.240
by people and our
institutions that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.460
have conscious or unconscious
bias against black Americans.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.900
Conscious or unconscious bias.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.850
Either they are
aware or unaware.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.000
This clearly begs
the question, right?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.390
Are Americans really biased
against black people,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.640
or do we just feel that way?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.280
So what I wanted to
do was take a look

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.220
at what research has said.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.600
So in 2012, AP, the
Associated Press,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.830
along with Stanford, Michigan,
University of Chicago

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.790
did a study to try to
ascertain how much bias was

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.590
across the greater electorate.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.040
And they found a
couple of things.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.790
They found that the portion of
Americans expressing explicit,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.360
conscious, they are aware of
it, bias or anti-black attitudes

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.650
was about 50% of
the population which

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.730
is a significant portion
of the population.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.149
They also took a look and said,
how much of the population

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:21.050
has an implicit or
unconscious bias,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:28.400
and that's closer to 56%,
about 6 in 10 in 2012.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.040
Harvard has been researching
this for a number of years.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.540
Their researchers developed
something called the Implicit

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.070
Association Test that they
use to tease out unconscious

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.800
bias in various people
who take the test,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.040
and over three million
people have taken this test.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.460
And what they have found
is that 75% of Americans,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.900
so it's almost 8 out of 10,
have an implicit, unconscious

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.915
preference for white
people over black people.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.400
They also found that this
automatic preference,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.440
as they call it, predicts
discriminatory behavior

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.330
even for people who
earnestly believe that they

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.740
don't discriminate at all.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.530
As a matter of fact, they say
that this is empirical truth.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:33.350
So if this is the
case, then we should

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.400
be able to see some evidence
of this kind of showing up

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.080
in a marketplace as opposed
to just talk about it

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.780
qualitatively.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.220
So back in 2002, the
university researchers

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.810
at University of
Chicago did a study

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.070
and they wanted to take a look
at discrimination in the labor

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.910
market.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.980
And what they did was
they created resumes,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.640
and they allowed the
resumes to vary in quality,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.170
what they called quality.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.320
So this was like the prestige
of the school you went to.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.910
The depth of your experience,
the length of your experience,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.020
right?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.920
And what they did was
they changed the names

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.580
on the resumes.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.330
So they would put white-sounding
names on certain resumes

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.460
and they used Brandon and Emily.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.460
And they would put, same
resume, black-sounding names.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.550
So Jamal, Lekeisha.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.050
Right?

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.410
And they would send them
out to various employers.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.285
And they wanted to see
what the response was.

00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:45.670
So one of the first
things that they saw

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.540
was for the name, the
white-sounding names,

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.280
they saw 50% more callbacks
than the same resume,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.840
very same resume, that just
had a black-sounding name.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.970
So Emily 50% more
callbacks than Lakeisha.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.974
No difference on her
resume whatsoever.

00:07:07.974 --> 00:07:09.390
The other thing
that they observed

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:16.920
was as you increase the quality
of the resumes, so the schools

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.570
and the depth of experience
and the length of experience,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.040
so on and so forth, they saw
with the white-sounding names,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.410
the callbacks went up 30%.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.840
This makes sense, right?

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.520
Stronger candidates,
yeah, I want

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.310
to talk to that young lady, I
want to talk to that young man.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.530
Fantastic.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.170
Same resume when the
quality was increased

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.250
but had a black name,
no change in callback.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.030
Zero incremental interest.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.160
Statistically insignificant.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.239
Same resume, same level
of quality increase,

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:53.905
different names.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.410
Well, they also found
was that to overcome

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.920
this effect of the
name, one might need up

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.800
to eight years of
additional experience

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.468
if you have a
black-sounding name.

00:08:12.468 --> 00:08:17.460
They found that the level of
discrimination was significant,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.006
and it was uniform
across industries

00:08:20.006 --> 00:08:26.910
and across occupations,
even size of the company.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.929
So another study was done by
a nonprofit research firm,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.239
and they also wanted
to test discrimination

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:37.030
in the marketplace.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.919
So what they did was they
went and spoke to businesses.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.710
They actually did a
really smart thing.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.085
They went and
spoke to businesses

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:46.590
and they said, listen, what
are the skills that you need?

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.714
Let's just start
with your desires.

00:08:48.714 --> 00:08:50.130
What are the skills
that you need?

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.505
Tell us the skills
that you need.

00:08:51.505 --> 00:08:53.880
Tell us the skills that
you will hire people

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.860
if they have these
things, right?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.664
Smart thing to do.

00:08:56.664 --> 00:08:58.080
Businesses share
that information.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.517
Here are the skills
that we need.

00:08:59.517 --> 00:09:01.350
So they say, OK, we're
going to put together

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.270
a year-long training program to
develop an enhance those skills

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.860
within various candidates.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.450
If the people have these
skills are you interested?

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.410
Yes, we are interested.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.580
Of course you're interested.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.480
Right?

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.140
So they go through
this yearlong program,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:22.830
and what they observed was
for women, for Hispanics,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.320
for foreign-born participants
in the program whose

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.900
skills developed over
the course of that year,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.450
their employment
rates all went up.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.570
For the African Americans in the
program whose skills increased

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:41.360
over the course of that year, no
change, no takers, no interest.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:50.070
Now, the level of discrimination
in the marketplace

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.810
is quite significant.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.920
And it's so significant that
researchers from Arizona State

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.770
University found that if you are
white with a felony conviction,

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.430
you'll get more callbacks
than a black candidate

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.724
with no record at all.

00:10:09.724 --> 00:10:11.490
Right?

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.770
Think about what that implies.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.625
So you could say, look, I
hear you, I kind of get it,

00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:24.090
my best were regular
people, I'm a high achiever.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.810
Right?

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.880
What I do, is I go to the top.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.900
You know what I mean?

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.670
Doctor, lawyer, engineer,
that's what we do.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.450
We don't do this kind
of other business.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.570
Right?

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.460
So I hear you.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.770
I get it.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.500
So another research
study was done

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.420
by a firm called
[? Nexten ?] So they

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.060
wanted to get a sense for
discrimination that might

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.170
be in the legal profession.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.090
Right?

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.320
So here's what they did.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.660
So they develop a memo, right?

00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.630
And in the memo they
proceed to insert errors.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:06.960
So you can see errors in grammar
and spelling, errors in fact,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.706
and the analysis
of the fact, OK?

00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:15.810
Have you ever presented a memo
to a senior level executive.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.370
You can't have these things.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.240
But these are
embedded in the memo.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.080
And then what they do
is they send this memo

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.980
off to 60 law firm partners.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.030
Right?

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.390
And they tell one
half of the group

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.850
the memos written by
a lawyer who is black,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.780
and they tell an
associate who's black.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.140
And they tell the
other set of partners

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.620
it's written by an
associate who's white.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.220
They wanted to see what
the response would be.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.080
So what was the response?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.020
For the partners who
were reviewing the memo

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.170
and thought it was a white
lawyer that wrote it,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:03.860
their grade of the memo
was a 4.1 out of 5.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.810
So a 82, like a B,
kind of B minus.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.474
Right?

00:12:09.474 --> 00:12:10.640
Nothing to write home about.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.330
But this is a memo that
has errors in facts,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:22.080
and the analysis of the facts,
and grammar and spelling.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.280
Right?

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.300
That's a pretty high grade.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.480
Now, for the
partners that thought

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.630
the memo was written by a
black lawyer, 3.2 out of 5.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.920
That's a failing grade.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.840
That's a 64.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.610
You do not pass go.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.640
And not only did they
receive that failing grade,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:48.061
but their projections of this
person being a good lawyer

00:12:48.061 --> 00:12:50.430
was much, much lower.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.320
Same memo.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.330
No difference.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.420
Just told you one, this is
a white person who wrote it,

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.010
this is a black
person who wrote it.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.350
Very different take on it.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.340
Now, another
interesting thing was

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.640
in terms of why the grammar
and spelling errors.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.190
When they thought that it was
a white lawyer that wrote it,

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.323
they found three out
of the seven errors.

00:13:17.323 --> 00:13:18.710
Right?

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.590
When they thought that it was
a black lawyer that wrote it,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.740
they found six out
of seven errors.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.700
Same number of errors, same
exact paper, just who you think

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.580
wrote it.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.850
That's 100% more errors found.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.490
Same information.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.550
Nothing different,
nothing changed.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.730
Now, if you're a partner,
and that's your assessment,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.220
then it might be
difficult for that person

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.020
to get the mentorship
or to get put

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.700
on special assignments
or the things

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.070
that you would need to get
on a track to be a partner.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.570
Right?

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.030
That could have a significant
and dramatic effect

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.446
because you're
saying, listen, I'm

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:05.220
not sure that this guy is the
one based on what I've seen.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.870
Now, you might still
do OK as an attorney.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.320
You can go work someplace else.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.440
But you have the skills
and the availability

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.180
and the capabilities
to be a partner,

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.700
but you're not going
to get on that track,

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.420
or it's very unlikely.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.480
And the difference in
earnings over a career

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.740
could be $11 million off
of interpretation, not

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.870
the actual work.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.350
Now, if you think about what's
the impact on the family

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.910
of this individual?

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.720
What's the impact
on the community?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.660
What's the impact on the church?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.840
What's the impact on a nonprofit
board that they may sit on?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.800
So on and so forth.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.510
It reverberates, right?

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.970
Now, a large law firm, it's only
about 3% of lawyers are black.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.430
Less than 2% of the
partners are black.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.260
Does this have
anything to do with it?

00:15:00.038 --> 00:15:01.661
Right?

00:15:01.661 --> 00:15:03.410
Well, you can say,
well, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.720
but I'm going to be a doctor.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.910
So I'm just going to bypass
all that kind of stuff

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.170
because they just
stick to the facts.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.894
So the British Medical Journal--

00:15:13.894 --> 00:15:15.935
I should have said that
in like a British accent,

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:20.340
but I'll do that
next time, right--

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.154
they did some research
and what they found

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:23.320
was some interesting things.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.960
Number one, they found
that black male doctors

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.910
make about $65,000
less, on average,

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.850
than white male doctors.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.090
Or said differently, white male
doctors make about 35% more.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:43.350
Now, this is adjusting for
experience and specialty

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.980
and hours worked, all
that kind of stuff.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.900
Let's just adjust for it so we
kind get rid of all that noise.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.940
$65,000 annually.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.650
That's real money, right?

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:58.790
If you think about that
over the course of a year

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.090
or over the course of a career,
that could be almost $3 million

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.910
of lifetime earnings
that's lost.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.490
Now, there are
about 20,000 or so,

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.290
maybe a little more, black
male doctors in the US.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:13.830
Right?

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.960
This is a average number
across those doctors.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.650
So across that
broader group, you're

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.750
talking about 1.3
billion a year.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.690
Last year, this year, next year.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.970
Right?

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.370
And over a career,
pushing 60 billion.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:30.870
Significant.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.211
Again, this is, is
there a cost to it?

00:16:34.211 --> 00:16:34.710
Right?

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.860
It's not just does it happen.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.210
It's not just do people
mean for it to happen.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:46.070
When it lands, it's their
cost, appears to be a cost.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.320
The American College of
Healthcare Executives

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.050
found that black
healthcare executives

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.360
earn about $26,000 less.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.450
That's maybe a million two
over lifetime earnings.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.820
Newly-minted software engineers
start out about $10,000 less.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.012
Right?

00:17:05.012 --> 00:17:06.220
That could be half a million.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.690
That would actually
be a lot more

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.720
because salaries skyrocket
and can broaden quite

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.730
a bit but just conservatively.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:19.560
So the question of is there
a bias seems to be yes.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.890
The question of
is it significant?

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.069
It seems to go from high to
kind of like really high,

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:30.160
and it appears to have a effect.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.400
Now, we don't have
time, I don't have time

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.420
to go through all of the
areas that we looked at.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.581
So I haven't gone
through housing.

00:17:41.581 --> 00:17:42.080
Right?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.930
The search process,
the financing process,

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.060
the equity appreciation.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.200
Right?

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.260
We don't have time to go through
the automotive piece in terms

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.780
of the purchasing,
the financing,

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.150
the insurance
associated with it.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.680
Or the online piece.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:04.430
What did the study say about
commerce on eBay and Airbnb.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.271
Or the small business financing.

00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:06.770
Right?

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.210
The denial rates, the
cost of borrowing.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.450
There's research behind
all of these things

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.940
that speak to these
incremental costs

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.360
when you hold things
the same, all of which

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.540
are covered in the book.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:25.190
What I want to do, though,
is kind of double back

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.540
and go to a broader question.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.160
And it's this
question of how is it

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.860
that after all this time, well,
it's only 2% of US wealth.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.720
That's a dramatically
small number

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.490
for 13-14% of the population.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.110
It's a dramatically
small number.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.890
Like, how is that possible?

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.440
How is that the case?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:45.955
Right?

00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:48.080
And then there's also other
questions that come up.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.460
Like, people say listen,
I don't understand

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.470
why you guys keep
talking about, slavery's

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.720
a super long time ago.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.840
At some point you
need to get over it.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.990
Other people have come here,
they have faced hardships,

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.890
they have faced difficulties,
they have worked through it,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.630
and they've done pretty well.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.270
But you guys haven't.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.220
And you keep complaining about
it and won't let it go, right?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.380
Now, in the absence
of information,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.160
that seems like a perfectly
legitimate series of questions.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.030
Right?

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.690
So as we would say when I was
an undergrad as an engineer,

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.970
let's go to the blackboard.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.020
Let's just look through it
and see what the context is.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.840
And if we can start
seeing some patterns,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.320
if we can start putting
some numbers next to it.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.970
So to do this we're
going to need to go back.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.880
And I want you guys to go
back with me in your minds

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.350
to roughly about 1860.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.550
Right?

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.950
Now, we're not going
to have enough time

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.390
to talk about the whole
period of slavery,

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.790
it was 250 years, volumes and
volumes written about that.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.460
We just want to focus on
cost and finance, right?

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.990
The first thing I
need to understand

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.620
is that slavery by definition
is a 100% tax on your labor.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.810
It is a 100% tax of your labor.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.760
Nothing that you generate
belongs to you, not even you.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.260
Right?

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.900
It is by definition a tax.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.270
Now, there is so
much of that period

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.520
that is difficult to quantify.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.010
But what you can look at
is the labor extracted.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.317
Because economists
have looked at this.

00:20:27.317 --> 00:20:28.900
They've come up with
different numbers

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.250
as they've been
trying to tally it up.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.410
So some researchers peg the
number, the value of labor

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:41.000
extracted from millions of
people over 250 years, quarter

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.670
of a millennia, as high
as $24 trillion dollars.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.060
Others as high as
97 trillion dollars.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.130
Let's say the answer is
somewhere in the middle.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.810
And we say it's as high
as 50 trillion dollars.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:05.020
You split the difference,
you're doing comps, right?

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.520
OK.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:13.000
What would the people who were
enslaved and were property,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.030
what were they worth?

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.190
Because if it wasn't a
big deal, these should all

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.070
be really small numbers, and
we could just kind of move on,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.937
right?

00:21:20.937 --> 00:21:22.770
So let's just for a
minute, let's figure out

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:23.645
what were they worth?

00:21:23.645 --> 00:21:25.440
Like, what did
researchers say was

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.000
the economic value
of those people

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.280
because they were
property, right?

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.170
So you can measure the value
of those roughly four million

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.890
people, and you have to do it.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.450
The numbers are so
big you have to do

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:44.490
in terms of total US
wealth or years of GDP

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.350
or debt income, national income.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.850
Right?

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.391
That's the size and
scales that we're

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:51.730
talking about to be able
to get us a sense of it.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:57.655
So if you do in terms of
wealth, well, US net wealth

00:21:57.655 --> 00:22:00.232
is about $85 trillion.

00:22:00.232 --> 00:22:03.730
Annual GDP is
about $19 trillion.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.690
Pretty big numbers.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.290
So if you value those
people in terms of wealth,

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.000
you're talking between 14 in
trillion dollars in today,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.600
in present dollars, equivalent.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.990
So about 15 and a half,
you split the difference.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.860
If you value it in
terms of GDP, now you're

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.850
talking about the difference
between $19 and $38 trillion.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.030
Big numbers.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.090
If you average those,
it's about $28 trillion.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.327
If you look at those
two modes of valuing it,

00:22:37.327 --> 00:22:39.410
and you say you know what,
it's probably somewhere

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.700
in the middle.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.630
Right?

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.620
Now we're talking
about $22 trillion,

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.120
the economic value of those
four million people and kind

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.870
of today's equivalent.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.240
Now, here's the thing.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.930
The net worth of black
people, African Americans,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:04.480
today is about $1.5
trillion dollars, all 40

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.280
plus million, which means
that the worth to the country

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.080
in today's equivalent
was about 15 times more

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.390
then than now after
150 years later.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.258
Something to ponder
and to think through.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.920
I think most of us
has heard something

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.230
about this issue of
40 acres and a mule.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.100
Right?

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.710
So I just want to add a
little context to that.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:41.740
This was discussed as a
potential remedy for slaves.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.010
So the idea is
you have land, you

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.440
have a mule which
can help you create

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.720
cash crops from the
land, so on and so forth,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.790
you get a start in life.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.100
That never came
through fruition.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.430
But let's just think
about the economic size

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.480
of what you're
talking about there.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.740
So 40 acres and a mule
is 160 million acres

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.710
if you apply that across
four million people.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.110
That's a massive amount.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.790
I once looked at what's a group
of people buying some land,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.880
it was like 400 acres.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.510
You got to go up in a
helicopter for 400 acres, right?

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.680
This is 160 million acres.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.231
It's kind of inconceivable size.

00:24:22.231 --> 00:24:24.730
Now, if you value that which
you can kind of approximate it,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.280
right?

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.920
The average value
of land per acre

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.400
today is roughly between
$3,000 and $6,400.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.200
So you put numbers on it.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.170
So you're talking about maybe
a trillion dollars of value

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.890
on the high end.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.400
You say, wow, that's
a huge number.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.630
Now, if you compare that to the
50 trillion that was extracted,

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:48.020
that's barely 2% of the total
value that was extracted.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.140
Not even getting a return
of 2% was sufficient.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.430
You will not get that, right?

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.640
Now, at the same time,
three, two and three years

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.060
before, Congress passes what
they call the Homestead Act

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.940
which you may be familiar with.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.050
And what the
Homestead Act is, is

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.600
over the course of
the next 60 years,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.280
they go out the process of
distributing 246 million acres

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.350
to 1.5 million white families.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:20.740
246 million acres.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.250
Now, if you kind of put that
in kind of today's dollars

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.840
because it is hard to
conceptualize what that is.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.827
Well, you're talking of upwards
of $1.6 trillion dollars.

00:25:32.827 --> 00:25:34.410
Another way you could
think about that

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.130
is upwards of a million
dollars a family.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:44.550
The way it worked was you could
get 160 acres for yourself.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:49.300
You stayed on it for five years,
and then it will be yours.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.940
By the way, five years is about
how long, in the early days,

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.689
it would take for you
to become a citizen.

00:25:53.689 --> 00:25:59.080
So you could come here with
nothing, be given 160 acres

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.550
and then leave owning
the whole thing,

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.070
having exchanged no value for
it other than being on it.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.942
And up to 93 million Americans
are direct beneficiaries,

00:26:12.942 --> 00:26:14.400
according to
research, of this kind

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.040
of massive
wealth-building program.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.550
Right?

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.650
It just puts context
to it because people

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.257
are talking about bootstraps.

00:26:21.257 --> 00:26:23.590
And I get it, man, and I
believe in the whole bootstraps

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.140
thing and hard work, and all
this kind of different stuff,

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.490
right?

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.080
But a million dollars
a hell of a bootstrap.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.130
Right?

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.405
Now, if you're in
this kind of period,

00:26:35.405 --> 00:26:37.530
you've got to get a sense
of like what's happening?

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.150
But there was a lot of stuff
happening during this period,

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:39.820
right?

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.160
You've got the Civil War.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.330
I mean the Southern economy is
in shambles, it's devastated.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.230
Right?

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.480
You got $22 trillion
of value's gone.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.070
Whoo.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.067
Emancipation, it's gone.

00:26:53.067 --> 00:26:54.650
The other thing you
have to understand

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.360
is that 50% of the full
net worth of the south.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.340
50% with just those people.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.010
It's gone.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:08.180
Now, people say, well, you
know, was it a big deal?

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.880
You know, cotton was
the biggest industry

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.120
that the world had ever seen.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.494
It was global.

00:27:13.494 --> 00:27:15.910
[? Squint ?] upwards of 20
million people around the world

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.340
were employed in that industry
in one way or another.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.680
A million people
across Europe and

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.920
other cotton-producing
countries lost their jobs

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.270
with the Civil War.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.941
We produced, 61% of our
exports were cotton.

00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:30.440
Right?

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.760
We were supplying the world.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.840
We were dominant.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.170
You cannot beat free labor.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.090
What does that
mean for the world?

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.330
There's a massive cotton famine.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.860
This affects everywhere.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.710
This affects Europe, it affects
Russia, it affects Egypt,

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.110
it affects India,
it affects Japan,

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.930
it affects all of these places.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.720
And a central question
is what is America

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.400
going to do to put her newly
freed people back to work?

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.460
And the land that
was confiscated,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.780
that all the Southerners
lost as a result of fighting

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.780
and breaking from the union
because it was all confiscated,

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:16.210
none of it was theirs, was
all given back to them.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.670
And what did they need?

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.330
They need labor.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.690
Land is worthless without labor.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:29.500
So what is the solution?

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.440
The solution is what we
call this Jim Crow system.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.241
Now, Jim Crow is
amazingly not descriptive.

00:28:40.241 --> 00:28:40.740
Right?

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.120
It's like the Sean Rochester
period, dun, dun dun, right?

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.720
Like what is that?

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.220
Right?

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.820
Who is Jim Crow?

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.340
What is that?

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.080
So what it is is a system
of laws and customs

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.390
reinforced with
extreme violence.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:04.070
And it's designed to reinstitute
100% tax on the sharecroppers

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.780
labor.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.000
Now, you can say,
listen, I think you're

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.230
getting a little hyperbolic.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.530
I know they didn't make that
much, but they got something,

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.244
and you're talking about this
100% tax business, right?

00:29:15.244 --> 00:29:16.160
You've got to be easy.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.930
Slow your roll.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.420
And I'm saying, you know what?

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.510
I'm going to let you
decide if it's a 100% tax,

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.550
so just walk with me
through the process.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:30.660
So the crux, the
foundation of this society

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.540
is sharecropping which is
based on a contract, right?

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.900
The way this worked is the large
mega plantations, a lot of them

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.660
were broken into smaller pieces.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.920
And black families would
settle on those pieces.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.670
The idea would be they would
work a portion of the land

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.920
to produce cash
crops, and then they

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.620
would share a portion
of the harvest,

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.440
or any portion of
the harvest, right?

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.700
Now, here's the thing.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.090
The white landowners set
all the terms and conditions

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.490
on the contract.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.450
Here's what I want
you to remember.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.440
You don't get crops tomorrow.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.160
Right?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.780
It takes a long time to till
land and clear it and do

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.670
all these kinds of
things before you get it.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.470
These people have nothing.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:24.420
At the end of slavery they
have 0.17% of US wealth,

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.280
effectively nothing.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.710
So the farmer, the
white farmer, has

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:34.640
to give them shelter and food
and clothes and seed and tool.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.360
They had to spot
them all of that

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.455
for an entire year on
credit at rates up to 70%.

00:30:44.181 --> 00:30:44.680
Right?

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.310
And some of these contracts,
if you felt ill or sick

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.430
they had the right to outsource
your portion of the labor

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.044
to someone else and
charge you for it.

00:30:55.044 --> 00:30:59.770
Now, I know what you thinking.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.701
I would not sign that contract.

00:31:03.701 --> 00:31:04.200
Right?

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.280
I hear you.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.290
Like, I feel you.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:07.890
Right?

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.450
So let's say you
do sign a contract.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.010
There is a law for that.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.270
These are called vagrancy
laws because you have no land,

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.190
and you don't have a
means of employment.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.520
And if you cannot prove that
you're gainfully employed,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.340
if you are idle, and
you are not a landowner,

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.240
you can be charged with a crime
and put in the state or county

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.540
jail.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.540
And you can say look,
you guys are super smart.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.184
You say, all right,
that's not going to work,

00:31:33.184 --> 00:31:34.350
here's what I'm going to do.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.960
I'm going to sign it, but I'm
just not going to do the work,

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.900
I'm going to break
the contract, right?

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.880
And lo and behold,
there is a law for that,

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.510
they're called a contract
enforcement laws, which

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.060
means that if you
break those contracts,

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.730
that you'll be charged
with the crime,

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.760
and you'll be placed in
a state or county jail.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.350
Right?

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.850
But you guys are beyond smart.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.660
You say I get that.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.993
But here's what I'm going to do.

00:31:58.993 --> 00:32:01.770
I'm going to jail, and
I'm not doing nothing,

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.510
and they going to
give me three squares.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.718
And I'm going to be straight.

00:32:04.718 --> 00:32:06.810
They're going to get tired
of that, and I'm out.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.850
They have something
for that, and it's

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.210
called convict leasing.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.930
Right?

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.520
Which means that
as a prisoner, they

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.730
lease you out again to
the very same farmer

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.470
that you didn't want to work
for or to a private corporation.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.810
Now here's the thing
with convict leasing

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.920
that's even potentially
much, much worse than slavery

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.020
in this one respect.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.230
A slave owner actually
has an interest

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.140
in your residual value.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.910
They would kill you if need be.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.010
They would beat you into
an inch of your life,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.570
but they really
would rather you be

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.990
around for the next 20 or
25 years working, right?

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.090
Under this lease agreement
they had no interest

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.100
in your residual value.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.650
I care not about you
15 years from now.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.360
What I care about you is
six months, eight months,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.890
18 months, 13 months,
whatever that time is.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.300
Right?

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.660
The impact of that is
mortality rates up to 50%.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.280
Mortality rates.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.120
So you don't sign
the contract, you

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.550
get put in state
and county jail.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.980
You break the contract, you
get put state and county jail.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.396
You decide to sit
in the jail, you

00:33:15.396 --> 00:33:17.130
get convict leased
to the same person

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.900
that you want to
do it for, and now

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:23.130
your life expectancy is now
50% risk of you being dead.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.100
And you have a family, and
you have wife and children,

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.920
and so on and so forth, right?

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:35.920
Now, that sounds like
100% tax on your labor.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.520
I set your income, your revenue.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.280
I set your expense.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.097
That means I
control your profit.

00:33:45.097 --> 00:33:47.680
And because I don't want you to
go any place else for somebody

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.555
who's generous, I'm
always going to make sure

00:33:49.555 --> 00:33:52.347
that your expenses are
far more than your profit.

00:33:52.347 --> 00:33:53.680
And I'm going to roll that over.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.820
That's called debt servitude.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.810
Now convict leasing,
50% death rates.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.480
By the way, it's very lucrative.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.590
Very lucrative.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:12.110
Because as a small farmer,
you can afford a whole slave,

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:15.409
but now you get to rent
one for like two years.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.949
Right?

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.260
Much more affordable.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.570
The state made so much
money that in 1914

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.480
the state of Alabama,
20% of their revenues

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.267
were from convict leasing alone.

00:34:28.267 --> 00:34:30.183
Right?

00:34:30.183 --> 00:34:34.300
Now, this system
of laws and custom

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:40.630
lasted for 75 years
during which time

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.850
4,000 black people were lynched.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:49.170
That's a public execution
in an extremely brutal way.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.380
You can run the math on it.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.429
4,000 is equivalent to one
person executed publicly

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:56.830
every week for 75 years.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:58.301
You going to get the hint.

00:34:58.301 --> 00:34:59.800
Your children going
to get the hint.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.508
Your neighbors are
going to get the hint.

00:35:01.508 --> 00:35:03.340
Everybody's going
to get the hint.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:03.880
Right?

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.680
Nobody has been prosecuted
for any of those.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.220
Right?

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:13.260
That is the condition under
which they are surviving.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.650
That is why it's a 100% tax.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.710
That is why people call
it as slavery, but just

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.850
by another name.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.660
It was legal.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.560
So at the value
extracted with 250

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.860
years was approximately
50 trillion.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.910
Right?

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.820
And this lasted a third
of that whole period,

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.770
and it was a 100% tax
on their labor, that

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.470
could be $15 trillion
dollars extracted

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.450
over that 75-year period.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.280
If that is the case, then
I want you to ponder this.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.610
At emancipation they
lost $22 trillion dollars

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.630
when those people were freed.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.210
And over the next
75 years, they would

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:02.600
go and claw back
$15 trillion of it

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.030
from the descendants
of those people.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:11.800
That's an extraordinary tax with
nothing you can do about it.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:23.030
Now, I want to talk also
about education, human capital

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.190
development, critical
and important.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:32.260
Now, what you will find is
when the land was returned

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.810
to the planters,
as we talked about,

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:41.950
they needed an abundant,
ready supply of people

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.610
to work the land.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:49.100
They made a deal
with white farmers

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.380
because they wanted to
expanded public education

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.772
for their children.

00:36:52.772 --> 00:36:55.540
And they said listen,
we will expand it,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.400
but we will divert the
resources from black students

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.610
towards the white students.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.180
And separate but equal in
1898 became a perfect vehicle

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.740
to do that.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.020
What were some of the
ramifications of that?

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.880
Number one, by 1900, you had one
black teacher for every 1,000

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.990
students, 1,000 students.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:23.460
By 1917, we had just
64 public high schools

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.840
across the entire South
for black students.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.800
44% of all the buildings
that were schools

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.250
were constructed and
owned by black people.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:39.450
And many of the buildings
that were owned by the public

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.220
had been gifted to
them, but were actually

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.647
built by black
people so that they

00:37:44.647 --> 00:37:46.980
could get recognized and get
funding associated with it.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.260
William H. Baldwin,
the President

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.910
of the General Education Board--

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.460
kind of like the Department
of Education back in the day--

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.860
stated that the South
needs Negroes educated

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.970
so that they can be directed to
be the best possible laborers.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.700
With the right
kind of education,

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.930
the Negro will willingly
work menial jobs

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.390
and will open up an
opportunity for Southern whites

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.550
to perform more expert labor.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.150
So a couple of quick things.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:17.080
When we talk about separate but
equal to put this in a context.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:22.620
New, York City,
1920, 50 times more

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.360
is spent on children
in New York City,

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.760
97% of whom are
white, than are spent

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.100
on children in South Carolina.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.880
Migrants who came to
New York, immigrants, so

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.930
are getting an education that is
significantly more well-funded.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:42.790
In the South, for every dollar
invested in a black child,

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.790
you've got five to eight
invested in a white child.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.120
For every white student,
received 50% more years

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:54.010
of education, and black
teachers often got 25 to 34%

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.050
of what white
teachers were paid.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:59.800
Researchers say
that if you had just

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.431
invested the children equally,
kept all the other stuff

00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:03.930
the same.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:05.750
Just invest in the
children equally.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.320
Do what the law says.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.737
That would have closed
the earnings gap by 50%,

00:39:09.737 --> 00:39:10.820
just that one thing alone.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.153
Keep all the discrimination,
keep all that kind of stuff

00:39:13.153 --> 00:39:13.781
in place.

00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:14.280
Right?

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:14.780
By 50%.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.590
For a generation, that's
over $600 billion.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:28.180
For multiple generations,
from 1898 to almost 1955,

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:33.070
that could be north
of 3 trillion dollars.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.710
Then a quick thing I want
to talk about, real quick,

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.380
is what happened to
all the black teachers?

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.697
This was always something
that was curious to me.

00:39:40.697 --> 00:39:43.280
At one point, all black students
got taught by black teachers.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.570
Now, it's very hard to have
to find black teachers.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:54.600
So in 1954, right before
segregation became illegal,

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.950
you had a 82,000 black teachers
for two million students.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:03.400
They were 50% of the
black professional class.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.040
Within a decade of Brown
v. Board of Education,

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:11.070
40,000 of those
teachers were fired

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:14.460
wiping out 25% of the
black professional class.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.920
Researchers say that
90% of black principals

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.130
lost their jobs in
11 southern states.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.630
The number of black students
applying to be teachers

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.970
dropped within 20,
25 years after that.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.080
And currently, 18% of
the public school system

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.100
are African American, 7%
of the teachers are black.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.462
Just 2% of those teachers, of
all teachers, are black males.

00:40:39.462 --> 00:40:41.670
Now, if you look at that
from a different perspective

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.294
it means proportionately,
we're missing

00:40:43.294 --> 00:40:47.140
352,000 black teachers,
public school system today,

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.819
proportionally.

00:40:48.819 --> 00:40:50.610
If you looked at what
they would be earning

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.320
on average, average
teacher salary,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.830
across that number
of people, 350,000,

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.410
you're talking about
$20 billion that

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.570
is not going to those
teachers, that is not

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.510
going to the black
community this year

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.880
and last year and
next year, and that's

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.660
been going on for 60 years now.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.820
What is the impact of
that on those families?

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:19.059
So we're not going to talk about
discrimination of labor market,

00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:19.850
we don't have time.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.910
We're not going to talk
about housing discrimination,

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:22.710
we don't have time.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:24.460
We're not going to
talk about the GI bill,

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.300
we don't have time.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.508
We're not going to talk
about the black tax from 1965

00:41:27.508 --> 00:41:29.010
to the present, we
don't have time.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.710
It is all, of course,
available in the book.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.670
[QUIET LAUGHTER]

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.210
Right?

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.130
So.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:43.750
But the answer is
always just try harder.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.720
65%, 63% of white Americans
say look, you know,

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.250
blacks just not trying
hard enough to get ahead.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.970
Keep blaming racial
discrimination on everything.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.830
60 percent of white
Americans say look,

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.496
you got the same or
better opportunities

00:41:56.496 --> 00:41:59.500
than everybody else, you're
just not making it happen.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.220
70 percent say you're just
using this as an excuse.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.780
Now, before you
have information,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.550
before you have
context, these things

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.820
seem like they
might be reasonable.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.080
But in light of information
in context they seem absurd.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.100
Right?

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.180
So I'm going to pause
here, all right?

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:27.034
And we'll do some Q&amp;A because
I don't want to kind of hog

00:42:27.034 --> 00:42:27.700
the whole thing.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.630
We can have some questions
associated with it.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:34.137
And I'll let Shadan
take it over.

00:42:34.137 --> 00:42:35.535
SHADAN DELEVEAUX: Absolutely.

00:42:35.535 --> 00:42:37.910
First of all, can we have just
round of applause, please?

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:41.242
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:47.136
What prompted you
to write this book?

00:42:47.136 --> 00:42:48.872
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER: Wow.

00:42:48.872 --> 00:42:50.580
So there was a couple
of different things

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.160
that went into it.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.619
One, over time, I
just kept reading

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:56.618
about these various studies
that would come out,

00:42:56.618 --> 00:42:58.170
would talk about discrimination.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:02.610
And it would come out like drip,
drip, drip, to me over years.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:06.330
But it always seemed
like it was a tax, right?

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.070
And I always said,
you know, I'm just

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.236
going to kind of keep track
of some of these things,

00:43:10.236 --> 00:43:12.690
and I'm come back to
it one of these days,

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.330
and I see if I'm
going to tally it up.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.790
And what wound up being
the ultimate trigger

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.450
is so I work with, like,
individuals helping

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.390
to put their financial
plans together, right?

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.349
And we focus on the
importance of cash flow,

00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:28.890
we focus on the
importance of assets,

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.350
we focus on the importance
of leaving a legacy

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.910
and how you break
those things down.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.670
Anything that reduces cash flow
reduces your asset ownership

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.620
of assets and reduces legacy.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.560
This seemed to me, and it is
in fact, a reduction to legacy.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.280
If there is a cost,
a cash flow cost,

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.640
it is reducing our
ability to leave legacy.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.660
So I decided to
take a look at it,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.700
go into what
research was saying,

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:58.620
and see if I could uncover
some really interesting things.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.774
SHADAN DELEVEAUX: Awesome.

00:43:59.774 --> 00:44:01.440
One of the things
from reading the book,

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.020
and you touched on it
during the presentation that

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.800
really struck me was
the study with regard

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.570
to the legal briefs.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:13.330
And in tech, as you
as you're well aware,

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.120
one of the things
that we struggle with

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.250
is essentially very
low percentages

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:21.160
of minorities in the
technology industry overall.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:27.210
And when I think about the legal
briefs and the result of that,

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.760
I wonder if you have
some thoughts on maybe

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.325
just potential connections
between those two things.

00:44:32.325 --> 00:44:34.830
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER:
Yeah, I think

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:38.940
the data says that there is
significant subconscious bias.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.110
The data says there's
significant conscious bias

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.070
across.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.220
It's a matter of how is
it manifesting itself?

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.770
The fact of the matter is
wherever and whenever there

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.500
is a trigger, the bias flows.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.370
Right?

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:59.130
They used to have these
problems in the music industry,

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.200
in orchestras, right?

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.310
And it was with women.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.620
It was dominated by men, right?

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.760
So what they did over time
was put up some screens

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.300
where they could just hear the
music and not see the person.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.180
And when they could just hear
the music and focus on that,

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.221
the percentage of
women went way up.

00:45:17.221 --> 00:45:17.720
Right?

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.320
So it's the triggers for bias.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.120
The first thing is just
accepting that it exists.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.820
The second thing is accepting
that it's significant

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.960
and it's unconscious.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.870
Like, you don't know
what you're doing,

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.240
or what I'm doing
or whatever, right?

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.960
There's no level of
introspection and reflection

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.300
that's going to show you this.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.600
It's subconscious.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.730
The key thing you have to
focus on is the effect.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.690
Does it have an effect?

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:47.190
Right?

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:48.310
You can't say, well,
I'm doing this,

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:50.220
I'm doing that, it's
beyond your ability

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.910
to know what is being
done, but it has an effect

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.300
and it has of cost.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:58.970
There was a study that
was done on eBay, right?

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.370
Baseball cards.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:02.400
I don't collect baseball cards.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.130
But it's a noble pursuit.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.050
Please baseball fans don't--

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.926
noble pursuit, right?

00:46:06.926 --> 00:46:09.466
And they were taking a look at
it, and they were just saying,

00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:11.930
all right, various baseball
cards and they have, like,

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.690
white Americans selling it,
black Americans selling it,

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.360
and they would see
what would happen.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.960
So it turns out that you have
a huge price differential

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.310
between when black
people are selling it,

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.740
when white people
are selling it.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.506
It's like 35%,
something like that.

00:46:23.506 --> 00:46:25.130
But the question's
like how would you--

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:26.990
like what, how do you
know, it's a baseball card,

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.830
like, how do you know?

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.060
And what that would
do is really clever.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.830
They would take
pictures and just

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:34.445
have of the tip of the
person's fingers in it.

00:46:34.445 --> 00:46:35.756
That's it.

00:46:35.756 --> 00:46:37.880
That's all it took, triggered
a price differential.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.760
Like, it's this real,
and it's this serious.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.500
And you can't deal
with it unless you

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.210
admit that it exists.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.970
And admit that it could
possibly exist with you.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:51.560
And not that it's possible,
that it's probable.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.245
Right?

00:46:52.245 --> 00:46:53.870
And then you can
start dealing with it.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:56.040
Like, you guys got some of
the super smartest people

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.170
in the whole world
working here, right?

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:59.378
I mean, you could build
software to track this stuff,

00:46:59.378 --> 00:47:02.115
do it, and view it as
helping decision makers.

00:47:02.115 --> 00:47:02.990
You know what I mean?

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.740
It can be addressed.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:05.240
You know.

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:13.910
In the book I quote
[? Sun Tzu. ?] Seems kind

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.304
of cliché, but he's
really awesome, right?

00:47:16.304 --> 00:47:17.720
And he says, listen,
man, anything

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.678
that has a form can be
named, and anything that

00:47:19.678 --> 00:47:21.940
has a name can be conquered.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:26.256
Give it a name, give it
a form and address it.

00:47:26.256 --> 00:47:28.042
SHADAN DELEVEAUX: And
then last question,

00:47:28.042 --> 00:47:29.500
and I'll open it
up to the audience

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:34.750
but can you speak about the
opportunity or the ability

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.260
for black community
as well as allies

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:44.110
to address this tax and these
huge, huge, huge massive

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.810
deficits that you're
addressing and highlighting.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.360
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER: Yeah,
so there's a framework

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.830
that I proposed, right?

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:53.260
I just I call a PHD.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.691
And PHD stands for
purchase, higher, deposit

00:47:55.691 --> 00:47:57.190
because we're really
thinking deeply

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:58.660
about how do you affect things.

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.576
And I think that I'm
trying to effect, really,

00:48:00.576 --> 00:48:02.500
are the six million
jobs that are missing,

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.999
and the $1.4 million
businesses that

00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:08.230
are missing because so much
is emanating from that.

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.087
And if you want to
affect those things,

00:48:11.087 --> 00:48:13.420
it's all about how you're
purchasing, how you're hiring,

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:14.694
and how you depositing, right?

00:48:14.694 --> 00:48:17.110
Now, when you think about it
from a purchasing standpoint,

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.120
at the individual is how and
where you spend your money.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.334
You have total
control over that.

00:48:23.334 --> 00:48:25.000
And that's both for
people who are black

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.333
and people who were not black,
how we spend our money is

00:48:27.333 --> 00:48:28.780
super important, right?

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.270
African Americans,
unfortunately, spend about 98%

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:35.110
of are spend on
non-black enterprises.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:38.920
So small changes in that
can have a massive impact

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.699
because it stimulates
demand, and demand

00:48:40.699 --> 00:48:42.115
stimulates the
need for employees,

00:48:42.115 --> 00:48:43.930
and so on and so forth.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.070
From a corporate or
organizational standpoint,

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:47.528
you're talking
about supply chains.

00:48:47.528 --> 00:48:49.900
That's where the purchasing
is happening, Right?

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.942
So in addition to
cutting the check

00:48:51.942 --> 00:48:53.650
for various nonprofits,
which I encourage

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.720
you to do and to keep doing.

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.800
But if you're sitting on top of
anyone, right, an $18 billion

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:06.820
supply chain, having more black
firms in those supply chains

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.890
is what's going to drive
that jobs [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:12.520
You can create 10, 15,
20,000 jobs by doing that.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.390
Right?

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.730
And it's incredibly powerful.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:16.480
Why?

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.170
Because generally, about 75% of
folks employed at black firms

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:23.000
tend to be black,
African American.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.300
That means 25% are not,
which by definition

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.610
means that we're the most
diverse companies in the world.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.250
Right?

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.877
And then hiring, obviously,
you guys work on that, right?

00:49:35.877 --> 00:49:38.460
There's some things that I would
say that goes along with them

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.710
that I say like be careful of.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.334
Let the numbers kind
of tell the story,

00:49:41.334 --> 00:49:42.470
like, be careful of, right?

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:43.886
Because we got to
this point where

00:49:43.886 --> 00:49:48.180
we say like diversity, and
minority, and inclusion,

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.340
I think is the other word.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.850
Typically euphemism
for not white male.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:54.520
OK?

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.530
Typically euphemism
for not white male.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.120
Let me explain to
you who that is--

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.180
90 percent of people on Earth.

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.370
That's who not white male is.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.150
Like, that's targeting the
world to address issues.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.040
Now, when I'm talking
about try to address

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.320
the gap of the six
million people, right?

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.420
Employees that are missing and
the gap of these businesses

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.330
that are underpinning
of communities.

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.760
I'm talking about
being specific.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:19.566
Right?

00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:21.190
And so we have to
look at those things.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.350
If you say, listen,
man, you know,

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:26.020
we're going to focus
on ensuring that we

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.880
have more women involved.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.780
Fantastic.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.680
God bless them.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.701
Do that all day
long, super critical.

00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:32.200
Right?

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.240
But when you get
into the numbers,

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.860
if you look at women
businesses with employees,

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.660
they're $1.2 trillion of revenue
that they are generating.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.630
If you say, of those women, how
many of those are black women?

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:46.150
Less than 2%.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.930
So if you're driving
programs, spend

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:52.365
to increase the presence of
women which you should do,

00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:54.240
it's not until you're
99th dollar that you're

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.880
going to affect a black woman.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.080
So you're not going to
affect that gap that's there,

00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.670
and you're not going to effect
all the issues associated

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:00.169
with it.

00:51:00.169 --> 00:51:03.030
You have to be specific.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.810
Right?

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.393
If you say, all
right, well, you know,

00:51:05.393 --> 00:51:10.420
I want to make sure that I
empower Latino businesses.

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.520
Absolutely wonderful.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.080
Do it, keep doing
it, expanding it.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.620
And you look at the total
spend for those businesses

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.749
who have employees.

00:51:17.749 --> 00:51:19.290
And those are mega
businesses, right?

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.190
They have employees.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.720
It's almost about $400 billion.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.042
If you look at how many of
those are black, it's like 2%.

00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:28.000
Like, that's not how
you're going to affect it.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.980
So you could have a
thriving minority program

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.530
and have marginal to no effects
for black Americans Like,

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.680
this is what I want
us to be cognizant of

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.620
and be laser focused on.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.160
Right?

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.130
When we talk about minority
and diversity and inclusion,

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.790
you're not speaking
about black people,

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:48.830
you're talking about everybody
who is not a white male.

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:49.370
Right?

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:52.312
That's not very specific.

00:51:52.312 --> 00:51:53.930
SHADAN DELEVEAUX: Then deposit.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.130
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER: Deposit.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.680
Thank you for the
reminder there.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.420
So deposit's super critical.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.555
What is the primary
function of banks?

00:52:02.555 --> 00:52:03.640
It's commercial lending.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.960
If you look at the
US banking system,

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.930
lending to commercial
enterprises,

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:14.540
lending to agribusiness,
lending to consumer,

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.250
lending to government,
that's where

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:17.840
the money is going, right?

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.510
Now, when you look
at black businesses,

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.900
again, there's only
104,000 black businesses

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.780
that have employees
in America, so that's

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.820
why I'm alluding to the 1.4
million that are missing.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.220
Supposed to be 1.5.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:35.870
Those businesses are starved
for lending and credit.

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:37.760
80% say that they
would hire if they

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.170
had access to the resources.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.390
Researchers say that those
few businesses need up to $9

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:47.790
billion of capital today.

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:52.910
They're the most likely to
hire us, network effect.

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:53.900
Right?

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.540
And they're extremely
undercapitalized.

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.870
What do I mean by that?

00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:01.310
Of all the deposits that African
Americans have in general,

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:04.790
only about 2% are in black
financial institutions.

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.860
It's a historical
issue and challenge

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.960
that we've been
dealing with, right?

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.870
If you look at the
total US banking system,

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:17.330
only four out of every
$10,000 is in a black bank.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.220
They simply don't
have the deposits

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.189
to do the lending
that is necessary

00:53:21.189 --> 00:53:22.230
and that they want to do.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:26.270
And, by the way, they have
the same regulatory expense.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:28.250
Extremely small base.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.060
Right?

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.170
That is powerful.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.940
Corporations where
they deposit their

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.387
[INAUDIBLE] with their money.

00:53:33.387 --> 00:53:35.720
Businesses, governments, where
they deposit their money.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.910
Individuals, where you
deposit your money.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:39.410
Right?

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:40.700
And the other thing
that's very powerful

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.170
is that you have something
called a money multiplier

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.220
effect.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.270
You guys remember this
from economics, right?

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.440
So every dollar you put in
is $10 of economic activity

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.340
that goes with it.

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.790
Put in a dollar, Federal
Reserve requirement,

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.800
$0.90 get lent out,
so on and so forth,

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.980
till you have a $10 impact.

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:59.120
That's huge, that's powerful,
that's not happening

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.200
in this banking system.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.154
And the idea of PHD, really.

00:54:04.154 --> 00:54:06.320
I don't know if you guys
hear, but people will often

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:10.740
talk about how long money
circulates in communities.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.910
Some communities it's
six days, some it's

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.592
100 days, some it's
like 35 minutes, all

00:54:14.592 --> 00:54:15.800
that kind of different stuff.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:16.910
What they are talking about--

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:18.993
I'm telling you how to
calculate that by the way--

00:54:18.993 --> 00:54:21.640
is PHD.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:27.280
You have individuals who
are depositing and spending

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.620
and hiring in ways that create
jobs and expand businesses

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.970
within their communities.

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:39.340
Just from the little bit of the
walk-through that we did just

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.840
now, you can see that there
was no real opportunity for us

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:47.321
to do that in a significant way.

00:54:47.321 --> 00:54:47.820
Right?

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.430
You got 250 years
of slavery followed

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.160
by another 75
years of extracting

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.020
every nickel from you.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.860
Very often what you see today
are miracles walking around.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.710
It's amazing that you have
this level of achievement

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:02.550
despite that.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.290
And I haven't finished
telling all the other stuff.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:06.070
Right?

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:06.611
So.

00:55:06.611 --> 00:55:08.110
SHADAN DELEVEAUX:
The one thing just

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:11.650
to dovetail with what you
just said on that in terms

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:16.960
of the miracles, that you
literally have miracles walking

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.370
around which I want to
highlight that because speaking

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.910
to so many people of color,
especially in tech, especially

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.060
here at Google, so many
of them are experiencing

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:31.420
imposter syndrome which
we spoke about before.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.620
And when you go through the
book in some of the things

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:39.370
that you've outlined
and through the layers

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:43.270
of the systemic barriers
that were intentionally put

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:46.940
into place to extract wealth,
to extract opportunity,

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:51.580
to extract all these things, and
you see that despite all that,

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.590
you have people who
are here, could you

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:56.815
talk a little bit about what you
think of an imposter syndrome?

00:55:56.815 --> 00:56:02.111
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER: Yeah, so
we spoke about this earlier,

00:56:02.111 --> 00:56:03.610
and I'll kind of
be honest with you,

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:06.924
it was hard for me to relate
to because I had never

00:56:06.924 --> 00:56:07.840
felt like an imposter.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.210
I think what is very
difficult is now

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:18.720
it's you against the world.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.290
When we were growing
up, it was us

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.690
against people in our circle.

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:24.930
Now, the circle is the world.

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:28.700
It's like anybody who has
access to communication, right?

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:33.744
And you have people that are
truly amazing and show that.

00:56:33.744 --> 00:56:35.160
I think you have
a lot of people--

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.951
we kind of talked about
this a little bit--

00:56:36.951 --> 00:56:38.370
that pretend to be amazing.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:41.600
But it looks very
authentic because you

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.970
can be anybody, James Bond
if you want, kind of, online.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:50.870
But part of the
problem is everything

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:53.210
needs to be within context.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.720
Right?

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.370
And that's what we don't have.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.890
We don't have context.

00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:01.040
Like, if you're coming
from a community

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.630
that has 50 to 100 times
more economic resources,

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.750
and I'm not being hyperbolic,
than another community, what

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:12.760
is happening in your sphere is
that success becomes probable.

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.360
When you are coming
from a community that

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.480
has one one hundredth of
what you're dealing with,

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.745
success is merely possible.

00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:25.620
Anything is possible.

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:29.140
I could disform and reform
in the room next door.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.020
I mean, quantum mechanics
says that that's possible.

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.650
You can look at the numbers
and see the probability

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:35.530
of that happening.

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:36.690
It's particularly low.

00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:39.270
If you're going to build your
strategy on that happening,

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:41.430
that's not going to
work very well, right?

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:44.724
It's the issue is
of the context.

00:57:44.724 --> 00:57:46.515
You know, people come
and they say, listen,

00:57:46.515 --> 00:57:47.410
I just don't get it.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.993
Like, I look around I just see
all this opportunity people are

00:57:49.993 --> 00:57:56.010
not taking advantage of it, and
it's because the same barriers,

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:58.500
and I'm being so kind
with the word barriers.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:02.630
You could literally be
killed for economic,

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:04.417
for starting a business.

00:58:04.417 --> 00:58:05.750
You could literally be murdered.

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.490
There's nobody to complain to.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:12.052
I think Congress didn't even
pass anti-lynching laws.

00:58:12.052 --> 00:58:13.260
People were lobbying forever.

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:14.700
They didn't even pass it.

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.270
Can't do it.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.720
So it's the context, right?

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.030
I read someplace or
something at Harvard call

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:27.710
like the bottom third.

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:32.180
Which is like super smart people
at Harvard feel like not smart

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:35.090
because they're competing
with other super smart people,

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:37.250
so they want to be
in the bottom third.

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.740
And so you're like on Krypton.

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.080
You're like, oh, I could
only lift three mountains,

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.021
you know what I mean?

00:58:43.021 --> 00:58:43.520
Right?

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.930
And this guy can lift 10.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:47.180
I'm so not worthy, right?

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:51.070
Other people are like, dude,
I'm trying to lift bricks,

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.100
and you're up in
the third mountain.

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:53.600
Right?

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.940
They need context, right?

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:58.070
They need to see, listen, man,
on a broader scheme of things,

00:58:58.070 --> 00:58:58.760
you're amazing.

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.710
This place just doesn't
have enough seats

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:02.740
for all the amazing people.

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.740
And that's the context--

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.239
I'm sorry, I'll
come to you-- that's

00:59:05.239 --> 00:59:07.880
the context that we don't
have and that we don't get,

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.490
so we can't measure
it appropriately.

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:13.546
SHADAN DELEVEAUX: I'm going
to pass the mic to questions.

00:59:13.546 --> 00:59:17.945
AUDIENCE: One of the challenges
of doing this kind of work

00:59:17.945 --> 00:59:20.870
or trying to transform
within organizations,

00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:24.327
is that one, a lot
of the people I

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:26.090
see in the white
community who step up

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:30.390
to work with you are willing
and mean extremely well.

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:32.240
But one of the things
that can sometimes

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.801
work against those
efforts is that I'm not

00:59:35.801 --> 00:59:37.550
sure most people are
even aware that there

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:41.000
is a very implicit demand
from the white community

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.650
to be validated and to have
to feel good in whatever

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.120
is being discussed.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.550
And where that
comes into conflict,

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:52.190
I think about the statement
that you made about specificity.

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.650
Because we've had that
discussion internally about--

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:56.570
you know, don't
just say inclusion,

00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:01.190
if you're going to battle sexism
then name it and battle that.

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.770
And the strategy for
that versus a strategy

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:07.130
for new or diverse
people who are artistic

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.225
and the strategy
for white supremacy

01:00:09.225 --> 01:00:10.850
and the effects on
the black community,

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.349
those are very
different strategies,

01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:14.040
you can't put them all together.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.400
But when you become
specific, when

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.190
the leaders in the room who are
going to be the majority white,

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:21.290
don't feel good
about it, everything

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:26.030
gets pushed back on it, and
you can spend an entire year

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:29.210
creating programs,
giving speeches, giving

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.100
impassioned pleas, standing
ovations, rolling on the floor

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.850
like Patti LaBelle,
and at the end of it,

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:39.110
it will come back to being
smushed like Play-Doh

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:42.970
into a very general,
innocuous term

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:45.950
that people feel
good about, and that

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:48.041
is exasperating to go through.

01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:49.790
I'm interested in
hearing your perspective

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:52.310
on how you move in
organizations where

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.880
even in the most well-meaning
organizations with the most

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.100
well-meaning people,
because a lot of times

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:05.310
people who are more liberal are
actually more offended when you

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:09.780
become specific because they
often feel that their presence

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.480
and well-meaning should mean
that we shouldn't be having

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.590
conversations that are as heavy.

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.590
Interested in hearing
what you think about that.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.150
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER:
Yeah, so there

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:20.790
are a couple different
things there, right?

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:24.570
The first is it's important
that people are kind of all have

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:26.410
the same amount of information.

01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:29.290
See, what we have is
lack of information.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.520
What we have is strong
feelings combined

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.340
with lack of information and
then asymmetric distribution

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.016
of power.

01:01:36.016 --> 01:01:37.640
So I'm shutting down
this conversation.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.370
It's a wrap.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.200
If you want to keep it
popping in your bank

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.770
account than it should
be a wrap for you.

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:45.570
Right?

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:47.280
Part of reason I
wrote the book is

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.860
so that we can have more
productive conversations.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:56.040
When you're ignorant,
nonsense makes perfect sense.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.990
So the idea is to
provide context.

01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:01.290
Like, people react to it.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.750
The first thing it's like I
didn't know, I had no idea.

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:06.441
I didn't know, right?

01:02:06.441 --> 01:02:08.940
So one of the things that I'm
interested in doing and trying

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.640
to do and encourage
people to do is this idea

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.920
of doing more business
with black enterprises

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.750
because it creates jobs.

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.404
And communities,
families are supported

01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:19.320
by jobs and communities
supported by families,

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.510
so on and so forth.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:25.230
I don't start with leading
with that discussion

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.944
because everybody has
opinion already formed on it.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.610
What I start with is
like the discussion

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.624
that we're having
because it causes

01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:32.790
people to think differently.

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.291
Because you're,
like, I didn't know.

01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:35.123
You know I'm saying?

01:02:35.123 --> 01:02:37.080
Like, I didn't know,
like, no one told me.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.480
We all have similar
curriculums, we

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.700
don't learn this stuff
at any of our schools,

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.290
we don't learn at church.

01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:45.360
So if there are people
who say, listen,

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.850
I'm interested in having
these type of effects.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:49.650
They don't have to
be, but if they are,

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:51.780
then one of the things
that they need to read

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.550
is get access to
that is information.

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:55.770
Took me a long time to
pull it together, right?

01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:58.103
To be able to kind of tell a
story because it compounds.

01:02:58.103 --> 01:03:00.660
This all is happening
at the same time.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.170
And what you will find is if
these individuals read this,

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:06.450
it starts to shift
people from why are we

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.510
having this conversation,
and why is this a big deal,

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:12.180
because that's where people
are right now, right,

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.870
to how do we resolve it?

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:16.560
See, the fundamental
problem is we

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.114
try to solve problems that
aren't problems for people.

01:03:20.114 --> 01:03:21.530
If I just start
leading with me, I

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:23.900
do this or black
people be oh, my god,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.366
it's another minority program.

01:03:26.366 --> 01:03:28.459
I'm banging my head on the wall.

01:03:28.459 --> 01:03:29.500
You know what I'm saying?

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.040
But when you say, wait a
minute, let's kind of walk

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.630
through this, let's kind
of talk about this stuff,

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:34.627
you get exposed to it
for the first time,

01:03:34.627 --> 01:03:35.710
you see how it's building.

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:38.420
You're, like, good God
almighty, like, no one told me

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.130
that this stuff
was the case, you

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:44.420
start to shift and evolve to
wow, what do we do about it?

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.120
Now, X program becomes
important, right?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.800
Now, you see there's
a difference.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.720
What we have is
someone is, like,

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.890
man I didn't eat in five days.

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:57.550
OK, so I think you're getting
into the starving realm, right,

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.320
certainly in the ketoning phase.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.610
And somebody else is, like,
I haven't eaten in 55 days.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:09.020
And they say, well, we're the
same, we both haven't eaten.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.969
So my solution is I'm going
to have a box of crackers,

01:04:11.969 --> 01:04:13.010
and I'm going to be good.

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:14.759
And you should have a
box of crackers too.

01:04:14.759 --> 01:04:17.390
And you have a box of crackers
and you're still dying.

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:19.723
Like, I don't understand
what's matter with this person.

01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:21.750
The issue isn't it's degrees.

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:22.665
It's not binary.

01:04:22.665 --> 01:04:24.540
It's not whether or not
you have to struggle.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.080
It's what's the struggle and
the context of the struggle

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.610
and information behind it.

01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:31.670
So for these individuals
who are open to this, then

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:33.440
I say, start with this book.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.370
Walk through it, discuss it, see
the extent to which that helps.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:45.750
Democrats they're
explicit bias is like 35%.

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:46.250
Right?

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.898
So it's low.

01:04:48.898 --> 01:04:50.397
I can be generous
and say, they know

01:04:50.397 --> 01:04:51.605
what the right things to say.

01:04:51.605 --> 01:04:53.780
They're implicit
bias is like 55%.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.060
Subconscious.

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.280
So it's there.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.230
They don't mean it, is there.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:02.030
So you wind up running
into those things.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:05.510
But faced with information
that kind of compounds,

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:08.870
it tends to have an effect on
people who say, listen, let's

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:12.770
really talk about what programs
could actually be effective.

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:14.690
And now I kind of get it.

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:15.620
You know what I mean?

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.744
So that's what I would say.

01:05:16.744 --> 01:05:19.000
It's kind of a long
answer, but necessary.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.600
AUDIENCE: What is
the earliest age

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.340
we should make black kids aware
of the societal bias against--

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.740
for example, at what age
should we tell black boys

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:31.680
that they may be followed in
stores because of their color.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.250
Could making the kids aware
of these things too early

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:36.110
be less optimal?

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.240
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER:
That's a great question.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.970
We have two kids ourselves.

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:44.200
You know, we live in a
predominantly white community,

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.890
like, predominantly.

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:46.730
Right?

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:49.820
So these things come up
whether you want them or not,

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.650
and our kids are really young.

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:53.390
I say talk to them early.

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:54.690
Let them know.

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.000
Right?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.970
Society is not waiting
for them to mature

01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:03.020
to break the news to
them about how they feel

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.511
and how they're valued,
so on and so forth.

01:06:05.511 --> 01:06:07.010
We've been dealing
with those issues

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:09.661
since our kids were
in kindergarten.

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:10.160
Right?

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.180
So we've had really
frank discussions.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.180
You know what I mean?

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.760
Even along the
lines of, like, you

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.570
know talking about
slavery in school.

01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:21.002
It can be a very shameful
experience, right?

01:06:21.002 --> 01:06:23.460
People looking at you and all
this kind of different stuff.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.340
And what we tell our kids,
it's, like, you have nothing

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.200
to be ashamed.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.650
Like, what did you do?

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:28.410
You did nothing.

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:28.910
Right?

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:30.060
Things were done to you.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:33.510
I mean, it's for other
people to be ashamed, right?

01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:36.781
And it's important that
they have that perspective.

01:06:36.781 --> 01:06:37.280
Right?

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.537
You're other.

01:06:38.537 --> 01:06:41.120
Why are you like this, and all
those kind of different things.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.610
And it's important that you
instill a sense of, like,

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:47.120
feel awesome about yourself
even if others don't.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.320
Right?

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:53.510
Like I teach, we teach our
kids about black history.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.450
We teach them about
history long before America

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:59.560
so that it's normalized to them.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.630
Like, they get it and can feel
good about the contributions

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:03.680
that you've made.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.330
Right?

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:07.055
It's so, so important
for young people.

01:07:07.055 --> 01:07:08.180
So that's what I would say.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.850
Have the conversations
early because society is not

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:12.155
waiting for them to mature.

01:07:12.155 --> 01:07:13.040
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.760
Thank you.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.810
Another question I kind of had
floating on the back of my mind

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:20.990
as you were talking
about buying black,

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:23.660
essentially, buying
into black businesses

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.410
and being more intentional
about including black business

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.820
owners in our supply chains
and all those things.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.550
So I was wondering
if we can quantify

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.210
to profit of doing that.

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:36.230
So for example,
let's say if we had

01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:41.180
a 10% increase of the population
buying in black right now,

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.740
what would that translate into
in how many years in terms

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.177
of money?

01:07:47.177 --> 01:07:49.010
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER:
That's a great question.

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:53.960
It's kind of like a business
school professor might ask

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.720
that kind of question, right?

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.550
This is how I would speak to it.

01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:04.560
The first thing is we don't
have to boil the ocean.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.060
Right?

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.160
Small moves can have
massive effects.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.390
There's 104,000 really
large black businesses

01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:12.500
with staff and employees.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:16.994
They generate about $150
billion a year in spend.

01:08:16.994 --> 01:08:18.410
Before you get to
the whole world,

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.260
if you're just focused
on African Americans,

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:24.250
like our total spend
is $1.2 trillion.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.819
So shifting how that's
spent in even small ways

01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:30.279
could have enormous
impacts on demand.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:31.810
Now, take it a different way.

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:35.170
That $1.2 trillion is
generating about 24 million jobs

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:37.250
across the US economy.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:41.029
Very, very few of those are
within our own communities,

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:41.569
right?

01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:44.510
I think it's
important that we do

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:49.479
what we expect other people to
do because we get to control

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:50.890
how we spend and when we spend.

01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:52.930
Nobody else gets to do that.

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:56.550
And I want people
to say, listen, man,

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.550
I, too, am interested
in economic development

01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:59.770
because I kind of get it.

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:00.811
You know what I'm saying?

01:09:00.811 --> 01:09:03.474
Nothing gets better when
there's economic deprivation.

01:09:03.474 --> 01:09:04.640
So I want to march with you.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.939
I love it, march.

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:08.410
But don't just march, right?

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:09.910
Deposit.

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:10.779
Right?

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.040
Don't just march.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.870
And you have a $150
million business,

01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:17.560
think through who are you buying
products and services from,

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.119
and where do these
businesses fit in

01:09:19.119 --> 01:09:21.790
into that because those
businesses are employing people

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.950
who are generate
income for families,

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:26.162
and that's creating the
resources to cover today,

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.370
have some for tomorrow, to
do the enrichment, and all

01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:30.745
the kind of other things that
we're talking about, right?

01:09:30.745 --> 01:09:32.979
If you have a certain
kind of economic profile,

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:36.140
you get to move if you
don't like what's going on.

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.910
You're not stuck in that spot.

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:42.240
But if you don't, you're stuck,
you're just along for the ride.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.090
So it isn't to be to
be more specific, there

01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:50.470
are important things that we
can do with our resources.

01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:53.057
People will open up a
$500,000 bank accounts,

01:09:53.057 --> 01:09:53.890
so things like that.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:58.360
We got over $100
billion in a bank.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.136
Black banks only have
4.9 ish billion that kind

01:10:01.136 --> 01:10:02.260
of the last time I checked.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:05.170
I mean, we could
oversubscribe them in no time.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:07.185
If you move that money
into those banks,

01:10:07.185 --> 01:10:09.810
they'd have a hire 31,000 people
today to be able to manage it.

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:13.510
And It would generate another
$70,000 in the supply chain

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:14.510
to be able to help that.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:15.561
That would be $100,000.

01:10:15.561 --> 01:10:16.060
Just that.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.310
That's before we even get
to all the lending and stuff

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:19.727
that they would be doing.

01:10:19.727 --> 01:10:21.310
We have a lot of
stuff in our control,

01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:25.458
we just need to
do a little more.

01:10:25.458 --> 01:10:26.310
Yes sir.

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.490
AUDIENCE: I have a
really basic question.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:29.650
What do you mean when you
say like black business?

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:33.130
And how do you as a consumer,
just like Google searching,

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:35.170
figure out what that is?

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:38.450
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER:
So great question.

01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:43.582
So typically, it depends on
who's defining it, right?

01:10:43.582 --> 01:10:45.040
So when you think
of black business

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.956
you think of a business
owned by black people,

01:10:46.956 --> 01:10:49.060
but ownership varies
quite a bit, right?

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.530
So for governmental
purposes, it's

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:53.980
generally like 51% or more.

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:57.310
For purposes in
general, it's people

01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:01.640
who have like a substantial
equity position in the company.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.460
That's very, very helpful.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.990
There are various
directories that try

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:11.620
to aggregate black businesses.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.310
There are online
sites that do that.

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:18.700
I don't think there is
a universal one that

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.549
ties everything
together at this point.

01:11:22.549 --> 01:11:25.090
Here's something else I want to
say about this concept of PHD

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:25.760
real quick.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.910
So PHD is like, purchase,
hire, deposit, right?

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:30.340
So it's not just about
black businesses,

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.800
it's not exclusively
black businesses, right?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.110
So purchasing is about
your supply chain

01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:36.670
if you're a business.

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:38.980
Hiring is about your payroll.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:43.270
So it's to what extent are
we showing up in your payroll

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:46.236
and in your supply chain
in representative ways.

01:11:46.236 --> 01:11:47.110
You know what I mean?

01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:49.780
Because those people
are creating jobs.

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.780
They're executing PHD
which is powerful.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.610
Why is that important?

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:58.090
Because 80% of all spend is
going through those two areas.

01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:02.010
That's generating a lot
of economic activity.

01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:03.490
AUDIENCE: So my
question is related

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:04.698
to what you're talking about.

01:12:04.698 --> 01:12:07.960
I was wondering if you had
created any sort of perspective

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.260
on your numbers on what's
the negative impact

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:15.150
of the black taxes to
like US economy period?

01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:16.930
Like, to all this
under-investment, right?

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:20.080
It's not only affecting
black people, right,

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.330
there's some bottom line
being impacted on the US

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:24.370
overall in the short-term
and the long-term.

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:28.259
So I was wondering if you
had told that story, kind of

01:12:28.259 --> 01:12:30.175
with your own numbers
or extracted that story.

01:12:30.175 --> 01:12:32.133
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER: So
that's a great question.

01:12:32.133 --> 01:12:35.220
The short version is I
have not quantified that.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.550
Right?

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:38.540
That's the opportunity cost.

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.610
You know what I'm saying?

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:44.230
Because we operate in
a zero-sum game, right?

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:48.430
My gain is your
loss kind of thing.

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:52.750
Part of what this
is costing, you've

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:55.450
got a million black
men in jail today.

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:57.220
It's not even
possible to get that

01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.669
in like a natural environment.

01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:59.710
You know what I'm saying?

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:01.420
Like from the beginning of time.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:08.006
It costs $30 billion a year
to keep them in prison.

01:13:08.006 --> 01:13:09.740
If they were
working, $15 an hour,

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.240
they'd be making
$30 billion a year.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.880
That's a net $60
billion dollar cost

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.420
just to the country
for those people.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.080
Right?

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.539
Why are folks in jail?

01:13:18.539 --> 01:13:20.080
Like, when you kind
of go through it,

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.730
and you see like the
economic hollowing out

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.050
that's happened to the
community over and over again,

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:29.220
what happens is you wind
up having depression,

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.580
people self-medicate,
do it with drugs, right?

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.230
You're economically deprived.

01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:37.186
You're trying to make
money, economic activity.

01:13:37.186 --> 01:13:38.310
You're doing it with drugs.

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:40.200
It's something that's
available to you.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.060
You're not doing
because you love it,

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:43.226
you're doing it because you
need economic resources.

01:13:43.226 --> 01:13:45.090
Right?

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:47.280
And then that starts a
negative feedback cycle.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.490
And the response to that
is incarceration as opposed

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:54.770
to, OK, I have a medical
issue here to address,

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:58.230
or I have economic
issue to address, right?

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.030
So that's a $60 billion cost.

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:02.310
Like, all of these
incremental-- it all

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:05.730
comes back-- all these
incremental supplements

01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.880
that they wind up having
to do with food all kind

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.310
of different support,
it's because we've

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:13.980
had double the employment
rate for white Americans

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.910
for 60 years.

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:17.480
Right?

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.896
If you don't have
that problem you

01:14:18.896 --> 01:14:20.770
don't need to make
all those investments.

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:22.850
People are above
sustenance, right?

01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:25.670
So the short answer
is, I haven't

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:28.500
compiled that in one
kind of aggregate number.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:32.530
I think that's an assignment
for me to take on.

01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:33.815
I got the marching orders.

01:14:33.815 --> 01:14:35.231
SHADAN DELEVEAUX:
Again, thank you

01:14:35.231 --> 01:14:37.820
so much for just putting
the effort into this

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:42.530
to allow a platform
for people to be

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:45.530
able to have
informed discussions

01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:48.440
and data-backed
discussions instead

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.700
of opinion-backed discussions.

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.980
So one more round
of applause, please?

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:53.480
SHAWN D. ROCHESTER:
Thank you, guys.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.130
[APPLAUSE]
