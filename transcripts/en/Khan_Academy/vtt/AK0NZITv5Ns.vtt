00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.366
Voiceover:Let's try to think about

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:05.333
what 8 plus 7 is equal to.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.966
And we could imagine that this is like

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.700
taking 8 tomatoes and adding 7 blueberries

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.433
and then saying, "How many pieces of fruit

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:14.000
"do you have in total?"

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.166
I encourage you to pause the video and try

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.666
this out on your own.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.666
So, I'm assuming you've given a try.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.466
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.233
And the way I'm going
to think about it is,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.700
I'm going to keep adding
tomatoes until I fill up

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.367
my first bucket of 10
and then I'm going to see

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:34.387
how many more I have to add to get,

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:37.000
to essentially, add a total of 7.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:45.200
So let's have 1 tomato,
2 tomatoes, 3 tomatoes,

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:55.033
4 tomatoes, 5 tomatoes, 6 tomatoes, 7,

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:57.533
and 8 tomatoes.

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.166
Now, to those 8 tomatoes I'm going to

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.933
add 7 blueberries.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:08.333
So that's going to be 1, 2 ...

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.633
And actually, I'm going to pause there.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.866
Because I just finished a group of 10.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.833
This, right over here, I've only added 2

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:15.700
of the blueberries.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.367
I still have some more blueberries to add,

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:19.833
but just with adding those 2 blueberries,

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.134
I have completed a group of 10.

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.933
So I already have 10 pieces of fruit.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.767
So I can represent that.

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.500
I know, since I have a group of 10 here,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.666
that I have 1 group of 10.

00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:35.933
So this is going to be a 2 digit number,

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.400
where the digit on the
left is going to be a 1.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.233
But I'm not done adding blueberries.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.600
I've only added 2 blueberries.

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.800
Now let me add a third.

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:48.800
3 blueberries, 4
blueberries, 5 blueberries,

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:53.933
6 blueberries, and 7 blue berries.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:57.233
So I have a group of 10 and then,

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:59.546
above and beyond filling
out that group of 10,

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:01.966
which is represented here,
because this is going

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.600
to be a 2 digit number.

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.333
This is the left digit.

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:08.100
So this 1, since it's in
the tens place, it literally

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.800
represents 1 group of 10,
which is right over there.

00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:15.333
And then how many more do I have?

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.600
Well I have another ...

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:20.200
I have another 5, 1's.

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.933
5, 1's right over here.

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:27.533
So we have 1, 10 and we have 5, 1's.

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:30.000
So what is 8 plus 7?

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.866
It is 15.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.901
And another way, just to remind ourselves

00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:37.000
what 15 represents.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.867
The 1 in 15 represents 1, 10.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.233
Let me write it down.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:45.866
It represents, it represents 1, 10.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.466
And the 5 represents 5, 1's.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.133
5, 1's.

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.017
And so another way of thinking about it,

00:02:56.017 --> 00:03:00.207
1, 10 is the same thing as 10 and 5, 1's

00:03:00.207 --> 00:03:03.333
is the same thing as 5.

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.200
So 8 plus 7 is 15.

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:07.934
That was the whole point of this video.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.566
But we also want to think about what

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:11.201
these numbers represent.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.266
15 literally represents 1, 10 plus 5, 1's.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.533
Or 10 plus 5.
