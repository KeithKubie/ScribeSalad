tablets would actually give you the full
screen size and that's screwed everybody

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970
screen size and that's screwed everybody
 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.300

one of the things that um but not

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.150
one of the things that um but not
 

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.750
one of the things that um but not
everywhere like for example not here but

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760
everywhere like for example not here but
 

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.160

one of things that does not actually do
 

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.550
one of things that does not actually do
is it does not correctly target multiple

not targeting a new SDK version so we
 

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.400
not targeting a new SDK version so we
still have the menu showing up and we're

that the train has a very small little
 

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.840
that the train has a very small little
green thing so now yeah we gotta sort

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:57.850
green thing so now yeah we gotta sort
 

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.150

and you know I think it's supposed to
 

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:08.579
and you know I think it's supposed to
represent the route that they're going

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:08.589
represent the route that they're going
 

00:11:08.589 --> 00:11:11.220
represent the route that they're going

a real real problem with this particular
screen size and resolution you can see

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.170
screen size and resolution you can see
 

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.569
screen size and resolution you can see
the richest retry button and a quit

00:12:27.569 --> 00:12:27.579
the richest retry button and a quit
 

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:29.519
the richest retry button and a quit
button really squashed and this actually

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:29.529
button really squashed and this actually
 

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:31.079
button really squashed and this actually
goes to be happy we have you brought to

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:31.089
goes to be happy we have you brought to
 

00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:32.670
goes to be happy we have you brought to
be fair this isn't an easy resolution

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680
be fair this isn't an easy resolution
 

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.800
be fair this isn't an easy resolution
it's not a common resolution in common

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:34.810
it's not a common resolution in common
 

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.990
it's not a common resolution in common
aspect ratio yeah it's it's it's just

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000
aspect ratio yeah it's it's it's just
 

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.340
aspect ratio yeah it's it's it's just
the resolution used by every single

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:38.350
the resolution used by every single
 

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.860
the resolution used by every single
Android tablet out there oh no no this

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:40.870
Android tablet out there oh no no this
 

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.780
Android tablet out there oh no no this
isn't oh yeah yeah this would this one

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:42.790
isn't oh yeah yeah this would this one
 

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.550
isn't oh yeah yeah this would this one
to HDMI excuse me yeah but even outside

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560
to HDMI excuse me yeah but even outside
 

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.929
to HDMI excuse me yeah but even outside
to make sure my motors still squat well

00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:45.939
to make sure my motors still squat well
 

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:47.460
to make sure my motors still squat well
what I'm yeah so what I'm saying though

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:47.470
what I'm yeah so what I'm saying though
 

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.340
what I'm yeah so what I'm saying though
is that yeah you know the particular

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:50.350
is that yeah you know the particular
 

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.660
is that yeah you know the particular
aspect ratio that we're looking at is

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:51.670
aspect ratio that we're looking at is
 

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.429
aspect ratio that we're looking at is
extremely squashed because we're in HDMI

00:12:53.429 --> 00:12:53.439
extremely squashed because we're in HDMI
 

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.929
extremely squashed because we're in HDMI
mode but it's a little bit weird but let

00:12:54.929 --> 00:12:54.939
mode but it's a little bit weird but let
 

00:12:54.939 --> 00:12:57.090
mode but it's a little bit weird but let
me pointing out here okay sorry go on

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:57.100
me pointing out here okay sorry go on
 

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.620
me pointing out here okay sorry go on
so this is this is actually their

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:58.630
so this is this is actually their
 

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.290
so this is this is actually their
listing and the listing also has a

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:01.300
listing and the listing also has a
 

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.059
listing and the listing also has a
completely squashed in different aspect

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:03.069
completely squashed in different aspect
 

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:06.090
completely squashed in different aspect
ratio from the actual my my point really

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:06.100
ratio from the actual my my point really
 

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.389
ratio from the actual my my point really
is that you know as I mean phones are

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399
is that you know as I mean phones are
 

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:13.800
is that you know as I mean phones are
getting longer yeah aspect ratios change

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:13.810
getting longer yeah aspect ratios change
 

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.980
getting longer yeah aspect ratios change
you know there is no device on the

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:16.990
you know there is no device on the
 

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.660
you know there is no device on the
market that I'm aware of that that will

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:18.670
market that I'm aware of that that will
 

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.329
market that I'm aware of that that will
guarantee always being the same forever

00:13:21.329 --> 00:13:21.339
guarantee always being the same forever
 

00:13:21.339 --> 00:13:22.110
guarantee always being the same forever
yes

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120
yes
 

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.600
yes
with Android the nice thing is that at

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:24.610
with Android the nice thing is that at
 

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.280
with Android the nice thing is that at
least we've you know thought about that

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.290
least we've you know thought about that
 

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.879
least we've you know thought about that
and gone through the pain so that you

00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:29.889
and gone through the pain so that you
 

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:33.329
and gone through the pain so that you
can okay we have a new rule right at no

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:33.339
can okay we have a new rule right at no
 

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:34.879
can okay we have a new rule right at no

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.059
so any let's go back but I just wanted
to show that because it was sort of it

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:39.069
to show that because it was sort of it
 

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.710
to show that because it was sort of it
was sort of and I didn't want to

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720
was sort of and I didn't want to
 

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.050
was sort of and I didn't want to
actually mention that that that this is

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:43.060
actually mention that that that this is
 

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.300
actually mention that that that this is
also not a particularly good listing

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.310
also not a particularly good listing
 

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.650
also not a particularly good listing
page like you know it doesn't know it's

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:46.660
page like you know it doesn't know it's
 

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.150
page like you know it doesn't know it's
not although but it is representative of

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160
not although but it is representative of
 

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.040
not although but it is representative of
the game at least which is good there's

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.050
the game at least which is good there's
 

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.319
the game at least which is good there's
a lot of listings that aren't but anyway

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:52.329
a lot of listings that aren't but anyway
 

00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:53.879
a lot of listings that aren't but anyway
to be fair what I guess what I was

00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:53.889
to be fair what I guess what I was
 

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:56.040
to be fair what I guess what I was
trying to say is we you know Android

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.050
trying to say is we you know Android
 

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.360
trying to say is we you know Android
gives you the tools to deal with these

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:57.370
gives you the tools to deal with these
 

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.759
gives you the tools to deal with these
aspect ratio changes and especially when

00:13:59.759 --> 00:13:59.769
aspect ratio changes and especially when
 

00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:00.929
aspect ratio changes and especially when
you're doing vector graphics there

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:00.939
you're doing vector graphics there
 

00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:03.329
you're doing vector graphics there
really shouldn't be any reason to make

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:03.339
really shouldn't be any reason to make
 

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:05.639
really shouldn't be any reason to make
these mistakes yeah yeah I think now

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:05.649
these mistakes yeah yeah I think now
 

00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:07.139
these mistakes yeah yeah I think now
I've said my piece yeah no that's good

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:07.149
I've said my piece yeah no that's good
 

00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:09.900
I've said my piece yeah no that's good
and down I'm gonna shut up now I have a

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:09.910
and down I'm gonna shut up now I have a
 

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.069
and down I'm gonna shut up now I have a
really important question from someone

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079
really important question from someone
 

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:13.199
really important question from someone
in the YouTube oh yes oh yes important

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:13.209
in the YouTube oh yes oh yes important
 

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:15.179
in the YouTube oh yes oh yes important
the question is how can you play with

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:15.189
the question is how can you play with
 

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:19.379
the question is how can you play with
beer how can we not play with a beer

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:19.389
beer how can we not play with a beer
 

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:20.699
beer how can we not play with a beer
yeah I think that that's a harder that's

00:14:20.699 --> 00:14:20.709
yeah I think that that's a harder that's
 

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:25.410
yeah I think that that's a harder that's
that's okay you tried this game don't do

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:25.420
that's okay you tried this game don't do
 

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.639
that's okay you tried this game don't do
it in a dry County that's all I'm saying

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:28.649
it in a dry County that's all I'm saying
 

00:14:28.649 --> 00:14:31.110
it in a dry County that's all I'm saying
all right well I think that pretty much

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120
all right well I think that pretty much
 

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.429
all right well I think that pretty much
says it all

00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:32.439
says it all
 

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.170
says it all
yeah there's I mean there's there's some

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:34.180
yeah there's I mean there's there's some
 

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.059
yeah there's I mean there's there's some
good ideas here it definitely needs to

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:36.069
good ideas here it definitely needs to
 

00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:38.189
good ideas here it definitely needs to
feel more fluid you know my basic

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199
feel more fluid you know my basic
 

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:39.600
feel more fluid you know my basic
feeling my basic complaint with this

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:39.610
feeling my basic complaint with this
 

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.119
feeling my basic complaint with this
game is it is actually and I think part

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:42.129
game is it is actually and I think part
 

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:43.470
game is it is actually and I think part
of it is the aspect ratio like I think

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480
of it is the aspect ratio like I think
 

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.999
of it is the aspect ratio like I think
it is having trouble I'm dealing with

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:45.009
it is having trouble I'm dealing with
 

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.490
it is having trouble I'm dealing with
touches and with handling the characters

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:47.500
touches and with handling the characters
 

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.040
touches and with handling the characters
on this particular screen you know it's

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.050
on this particular screen you know it's
 

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.379
on this particular screen you know it's
just you know when you're doing a

00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:52.389
just you know when you're doing a
 

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:54.030
just you know when you're doing a
sorting game like this yeah now and I'll

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040
sorting game like this yeah now and I'll
 

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.530
sorting game like this yeah now and I'll
tell you what the main problem is with

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:55.540
tell you what the main problem is with
 

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.210
tell you what the main problem is with
the mechanics piece let's talk about the

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:57.220
the mechanics piece let's talk about the
 

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.470
the mechanics piece let's talk about the
things they did right right okay yeah

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480
things they did right right okay yeah
 

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.970
things they did right right okay yeah
did vector graphics of vector graphics

00:14:59.970 --> 00:14:59.980
did vector graphics of vector graphics
 

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.949
did vector graphics of vector graphics
look really what really good so those

00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959
look really what really good so those
 

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:03.569
look really what really good so those
turned out well yeah they did they're

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:03.579
turned out well yeah they did they're
 

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:04.970
turned out well yeah they did they're
higher I think they're high-res graphics

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980
higher I think they're high-res graphics
 

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.259
higher I think they're high-res graphics
that have been rendered new they're not

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:07.269
that have been rendered new they're not
 

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:08.400
that have been rendered new they're not
I don't think they're actually vector

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:08.410
I don't think they're actually vector
 

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.540
I don't think they're actually vector
here I think they've just been rendered

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:09.550
here I think they've just been rendered
 

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.540
here I think they've just been rendered
into bitmaps but yes well you know the

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:12.550
into bitmaps but yes well you know the
 

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.030
into bitmaps but yes well you know the
the basic game idea there's nothing

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040
the basic game idea there's nothing
 

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.369
the basic game idea there's nothing
wrong with it I would say that the

00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:17.379
wrong with it I would say that the
 

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:18.929
wrong with it I would say that the
interaction is a little difficult a

00:15:18.929 --> 00:15:18.939
interaction is a little difficult a
 

00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:21.090
interaction is a little difficult a
sorting game like this you probably want

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:21.100
sorting game like this you probably want
 

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.430
sorting game like this you probably want
to have a little

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440
to have a little
 

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.500
to have a little
momentum physics mm-hmm so that it

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:24.510
momentum physics mm-hmm so that it
 

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.440
momentum physics mm-hmm so that it
doesn't turn into a laborious dragging

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:27.450
doesn't turn into a laborious dragging
 

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:27.920
doesn't turn into a laborious dragging
game

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:27.930
game
 

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.450
game
well enter your fighting the interface

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:29.460
well enter your fighting the interface
 

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.830
well enter your fighting the interface
more than yours and that was gonna say

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:30.840
more than yours and that was gonna say
 

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.880
more than yours and that was gonna say
it's on a phone it's also bad because

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:31.890
it's on a phone it's also bad because
 

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.650
it's on a phone it's also bad because
you don't to drag it far but when you

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660
you don't to drag it far but when you
 

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.150
you don't to drag it far but when you
soon as you get to a tablet if you don't

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160
soon as you get to a tablet if you don't
 

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.680
soon as you get to a tablet if you don't
actually have the physics built into it

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:36.690
actually have the physics built into it
 

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.510
actually have the physics built into it
then you really are just be like oh I'm

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:38.520
then you really are just be like oh I'm
 

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.770
then you really are just be like oh I'm
dragging this thing across the screen

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:39.780
dragging this thing across the screen
 

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.920
dragging this thing across the screen
well yeah how many times Dan made this

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:42.930
well yeah how many times Dan made this
 

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.930
well yeah how many times Dan made this
same mistake do you leave let go just a

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940
same mistake do you leave let go just a
 

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.310
same mistake do you leave let go just a
fraction of a second too early

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320
fraction of a second too early
 

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.830
fraction of a second too early
mm-hm and instead of getting in and

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:48.840
mm-hm and instead of getting in and
 

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.810
mm-hm and instead of getting in and
giving you points dude just you know you

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820
giving you points dude just you know you
 

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.180
giving you points dude just you know you
hit a bug basically I just like yeah

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.190
hit a bug basically I just like yeah
 

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.210
hit a bug basically I just like yeah
sits on top of the Train looking weird

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:55.220
sits on top of the Train looking weird
 

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.580
sits on top of the Train looking weird
um it's really really soft and runs them

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:58.590
um it's really really soft and runs them
 

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.830
um it's really really soft and runs them
all over by the way which it does do but

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:00.840
all over by the way which it does do but
 

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.850
all over by the way which it does do but
you know there's no there's no like

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860
you know there's no there's no like
 

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.580
you know there's no there's no like
running over yeah yeah okay kind of fun

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:04.590
running over yeah yeah okay kind of fun
 

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.580
running over yeah yeah okay kind of fun
yeah anyway I this is some great

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:07.590
yeah anyway I this is some great
 

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.590
yeah anyway I this is some great
programming no question about it is this

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600
programming no question about it is this
 

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.580
programming no question about it is this
it's not finished

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:10.590
it's not finished
 

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.950
it's not finished
yes not a finished game yeah it needs

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:12.960
yes not a finished game yeah it needs
 

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.780
yes not a finished game yeah it needs
more work all right let's move on all

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:14.790
more work all right let's move on all
 

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.570
more work all right let's move on all
right so our next title in all of this

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:17.580
right so our next title in all of this
 

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.250
right so our next title in all of this
and I want to go back Tori this this is

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260
and I want to go back Tori this this is
 

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.660
and I want to go back Tori this this is
this is this was this was the fun one

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:20.670
this is this was this was the fun one
 

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.720
this is this was this was the fun one
for us this is a game that we actually

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.730
for us this is a game that we actually
 

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.660
for us this is a game that we actually
were unable to get to run an enterprise

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:25.670
were unable to get to run an enterprise
 

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.520
were unable to get to run an enterprise
yeah we were excited were like well

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:28.530
yeah we were excited were like well
 

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.510
yeah we were excited were like well
actually looking at the listing we

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:29.520
actually looking at the listing we
 

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.830
actually looking at the listing we
weren't particularly excited no I'm

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:30.840
weren't particularly excited no I'm
 

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.600
weren't particularly excited no I'm
really stoked away in their video look

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:32.610
really stoked away in their video look
 

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.760
really stoked away in their video look

on an mdpi device when you're actually
 

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.440
on an mdpi device when you're actually
looking at and how do I make my app

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:03.450

resource type and you can actually do

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700
resource type and you can actually do
 

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.000
resource type and you can actually do
that so that's what's one thought here

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.010
that so that's what's one thought here
 

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.510
that so that's what's one thought here
and we actually go to new game and you

see unfortunately it's like a Nyquist

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:36.450
see unfortunately it's like a Nyquist
 

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.240

game

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.250
game
 

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.470
game
unfortunately the oh yeah this Domino

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480
unfortunately the oh yeah this Domino
 

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.779
unfortunately the oh yeah this Domino
doesn't just affect itself

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:41.789
doesn't just affect itself
 

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:44.029
doesn't just affect itself
it affects dots in other dominoes as

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039
it affects dots in other dominoes as
 

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:45.919
it affects dots in other dominoes as
well so unfortunately we're seeing here

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:45.929
well so unfortunately we're seeing here
 

00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:49.100
well so unfortunately we're seeing here
is that the the matrix that's being used

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:49.110
is that the the matrix that's being used
 

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.760
is that the the matrix that's being used
to scale the bitmap is just not correct

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:52.770
to scale the bitmap is just not correct
 

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.799
to scale the bitmap is just not correct
for this screen size and resolution and

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:54.809
for this screen size and resolution and
 

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:56.539
for this screen size and resolution and
so we're just we're seeing the dots

00:20:56.539 --> 00:20:56.549
so we're just we're seeing the dots
 

00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:58.370
so we're just we're seeing the dots
they're actually all over overlapping

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380
they're actually all over overlapping
 

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.700
they're actually all over overlapping
each other and in a game is not it's not

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:01.710
each other and in a game is not it's not
 

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.520
each other and in a game is not it's not
playable but because we are trying to

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:04.530
playable but because we are trying to
 

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.750

make sure that you guys can actually see
 

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.220
make sure that you guys can actually see
that how the game is played we're now

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:07.230
that how the game is played we're now
 

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.830

going to switch from the tablet view

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840
going to switch from the tablet view
 

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.570
going to switch from the tablet view
you'll you'll see us lose this

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580
you'll you'll see us lose this
 

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.320
you'll you'll see us lose this
momentarily to our trusty Galaxy Nexus

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:15.330
momentarily to our trusty Galaxy Nexus
 

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.200
momentarily to our trusty Galaxy Nexus
all right yes and although we have this

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.210
all right yes and although we have this

everything looks really smooth yeah

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:21.690
everything looks really smooth yeah
 

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.810
everything looks really smooth yeah
that's a result of you picking up a

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820
that's a result of you picking up a
 

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.220
that's a result of you picking up a
court off the floor

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:25.230
court off the floor
 

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:30.919
court off the floor
yeah and plugging it in and I know I'd

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:30.929
yeah and plugging it in and I know I'd
 

00:21:30.929 --> 00:21:32.570
yeah and plugging it in and I know I'd
end Daniels firework so here is here is

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580
end Daniels firework so here is here is
 

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.190
end Daniels firework so here is here is
Domino and here's what it looks like now

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200
Domino and here's what it looks like now
 

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.510
Domino and here's what it looks like now
there is there are some rendering

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520
there is there are some rendering
 

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.010
there is there are some rendering
problems even on Galaxy Nexus you can

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020
problems even on Galaxy Nexus you can
 

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.310
problems even on Galaxy Nexus you can
see that it's cut off I'm not sure why

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320
see that it's cut off I'm not sure why
 

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.289
see that it's cut off I'm not sure why
this is actually the case because it

00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299
this is actually the case because it
 

00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:44.090
this is actually the case because it
doesn't actually happen but it happened

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100
doesn't actually happen but it happened
 

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.090
doesn't actually happen but it happened
at this point I don't even

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:45.100
at this point I don't even
 

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.470
at this point I don't even
what I'm looking at yeah so what's

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480
what I'm looking at yeah so what's
 

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.880
what I'm looking at yeah so what's
actually going on here is you're seeing

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:47.890
actually going on here is you're seeing
 

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.200
actually going on here is you're seeing
a couple of rendering problems it's

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.210
a couple of rendering problems it's
 

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.270
a couple of rendering problems it's
worse with the HDMI IN because you're

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280
worse with the HDMI IN because you're
 

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.470
worse with the HDMI IN because you're
getting a slightly different screen size

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480
getting a slightly different screen size
 

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.060
getting a slightly different screen size
there as well if you actually get it

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.070
there as well if you actually get it
 

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.000
there as well if you actually get it
fullscreen it's less cut off but as you

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.010
fullscreen it's less cut off but as you
 

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.230
fullscreen it's less cut off but as you
can see at least we can see the game to

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240
can see at least we can see the game to
 

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.180
can see at least we can see the game to
play it so we can rotate the Dominos

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:00.190
play it so we can rotate the Dominos
 

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.770
play it so we can rotate the Dominos
so that though that's so that they line

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:01.780
so that though that's so that they line
 

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.740
so that though that's so that they line
up and the goal is to get blocks of

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:04.750
up and the goal is to get blocks of
 

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.560
up and the goal is to get blocks of
bricks of dominoes that line up together

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:06.570
bricks of dominoes that line up together
 

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.820
bricks of dominoes that line up together
this is actually really hard to play

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:08.830
this is actually really hard to play
 

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.010
this is actually really hard to play
with HDMI because I can't see that how

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:11.020
with HDMI because I can't see that how
 

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.789
with HDMI because I can't see that how
many dominoes are how many how many dots

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799
many dominoes are how many how many dots
 

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:20.700
many dominoes are how many how many dots
are actually on each Domino I'm not sure

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:20.710
are actually on each Domino I'm not sure
 

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.799
are actually on each Domino I'm not sure
honestly I I have to look at that there

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:22.809
honestly I I have to look at that there
 

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:25.230
honestly I I have to look at that there
layout you know if I had a little more

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240
layout you know if I had a little more
 

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.029
layout you know if I had a little more
time I would have actually tried to pull

00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039
time I would have actually tried to pull
 

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:28.560
time I would have actually tried to pull
apart their layout and see why it's

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:28.570
apart their layout and see why it's
 

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.720
apart their layout and see why it's
wrong don't lean against that God how

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:30.730
wrong don't lean against that God how
 

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.490
wrong don't lean against that God how

yeah we should totally do that yeah
 

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.770
yeah we should totally do that yeah

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.600
really not very dynamic so that's
something that I'm not gonna say that

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:26.610
something that I'm not gonna say that
 

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.260
something that I'm not gonna say that
that your typical but still no I know

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:30.270
that your typical but still no I know
 

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.120
that your typical but still no I know
it's always nice to add a little bit of

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:32.130
it's always nice to add a little bit of
 

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.500
it's always nice to add a little bit of
discoverability ah

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:33.510
discoverability ah
 

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.130
discoverability ah
die die stick ball that was cool

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140
die die stick ball that was cool
 

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.230
die die stick ball that was cool
this stuck ball gave me a basket so

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240
this stuck ball gave me a basket so
 

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.660
this stuck ball gave me a basket so
anyways I actually the aim is really fun

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:41.670
anyways I actually the aim is really fun
 

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.010
anyways I actually the aim is really fun
I would like to the accelerometer

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020
I would like to the accelerometer
 

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.180
I would like to the accelerometer
mechanic to be a little bit easier found

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:44.190
mechanic to be a little bit easier found
 

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.140
mechanic to be a little bit easier found
and I actually don't think this game

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:45.150
and I actually don't think this game
 

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.190
and I actually don't think this game
needs an accelerometer

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200
needs an accelerometer
 

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.200
needs an accelerometer
it's all it games that that have

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:48.210
it's all it games that that have
 

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.430
it's all it games that that have
accelerometer where they don't really

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440
accelerometer where they don't really
 

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.260
accelerometer where they don't really
need one drive me nuts it's a general

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:51.270
need one drive me nuts it's a general
 

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.580
need one drive me nuts it's a general
rule now there may be there is a way to

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:52.590
rule now there may be there is a way to
 

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.140
rule now there may be there is a way to
change the controls maybe I can go back

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:54.150
change the controls maybe I can go back
 

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.030
change the controls maybe I can go back
and if there's a way to say I mean I

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:56.040
and if there's a way to say I mean I
 

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.350
and if there's a way to say I mean I
think you could make the argument that

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360
think you could make the argument that
 

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.900
think you could make the argument that
you know you need one hand for shooting

00:29:59.900 --> 00:29:59.910
you know you need one hand for shooting
 

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.720
you know you need one hand for shooting
and you're but the problem is too is if

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:02.730
and you're but the problem is too is if
 

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.090
and you're but the problem is too is if
you actually know this is I'm gonna ran

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100
you actually know this is I'm gonna ran
 

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.660
you actually know this is I'm gonna ran
for a second here's a problem when

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:08.670
for a second here's a problem when
 

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.700
for a second here's a problem when
you're doing accelerometer stuff mm-hmm

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:10.710
you're doing accelerometer stuff mm-hmm
 

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.340
you're doing accelerometer stuff mm-hmm
that takes a hand he needs at least one

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.350
that takes a hand he needs at least one
 

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.380
that takes a hand he needs at least one
hand and it feels better with two hands

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:15.390
hand and it feels better with two hands
 

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.560
hand and it feels better with two hands
yeah now at the same time let's say that

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:18.570
yeah now at the same time let's say that
 

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.300
yeah now at the same time let's say that
you need to touch the screen in a in its

why cuz you're tilting the device all

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:24.930
why cuz you're tilting the device all
 

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.780
why cuz you're tilting the device all
over the place do you see how hard I'm

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:26.790
over the place do you see how hard I'm
 

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.090
over the place do you see how hard I'm
trying well it it definitely makes it

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100
trying well it it definitely makes it

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:33.730
because could be that it's one thing

you're you know twisting it around
 

00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:44.340
you're you know twisting it around
mm-hmm but if you have to move your

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:44.350
mm-hmm but if you have to move your
 

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.000
mm-hmm but if you have to move your
device and do any kind of precision

touching that's gonna be frustrating for

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:50.500
touching that's gonna be frustrating for
 

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.740

most of your users well you know what

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:52.750
most of your users well you know what
 

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.270
most of your users well you know what
kind of device they have yeah and the

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:54.280
kind of device they have yeah and the
 

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.430
kind of device they have yeah and the
other thing is in general accelerometer

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440
other thing is in general accelerometer
 

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.860

games on tablets you know have to be

00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:58.870
games on tablets you know have to be
 

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.529
games on tablets you know have to be
really really carefully thought through

00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539
really really carefully thought through
 

00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:04.220
really really carefully thought through
so that would be my only my only

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.230
so that would be my only my only
 

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.230
so that would be my only my only
comments is if you've got to do one you

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240
comments is if you've got to do one you
 

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.310
comments is if you've got to do one you
know first of all it's better have it

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320
know first of all it's better have it
 

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.330
know first of all it's better have it
it's better have multiple control

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:09.340
it's better have multiple control
 

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.649
it's better have multiple control
options anyways we've already shown that

00:31:10.649 --> 00:31:10.659
options anyways we've already shown that
 

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:13.080
options anyways we've already shown that
you know if you give people the options

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:13.090
you know if you give people the options
 

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.279
you know if you give people the options
to have different controllers they'll

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:14.289
to have different controllers they'll
 

00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:16.470
to have different controllers they'll
love you if you don't oh man

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480
love you if you don't oh man
 

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.419
love you if you don't oh man
I totally want to get that trick work

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:18.429
I totally want to get that trick work
 

00:31:18.429 --> 00:31:20.070
I totally want to get that trick work
simplify your control I mean do you

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080
simplify your control I mean do you
 

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.020
simplify your control I mean do you
really have to control the way this guy

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:22.030
really have to control the way this guy
 

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.539
really have to control the way this guy
runs it's obvious where he's gonna run

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:24.549
runs it's obvious where he's gonna run
 

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.980
runs it's obvious where he's gonna run
to maybe you should think about making

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:25.990
to maybe you should think about making
 

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.350
to maybe you should think about making
that yeah make making a mode where he

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360
that yeah make making a mode where he
 

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.610
that yeah make making a mode where he
just goes and grabs it although it is a

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:29.620
just goes and grabs it although it is a
 

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.370
just goes and grabs it although it is a
nice - TNT yeah laughs Oh mm-hmm

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:32.380
nice - TNT yeah laughs Oh mm-hmm
 

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:37.049
nice - TNT yeah laughs Oh mm-hmm
that was bad um case the but I love the

00:31:37.049 --> 00:31:37.059
that was bad um case the but I love the
 

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:38.310
that was bad um case the but I love the
different game modes in the game I

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320
different game modes in the game I
 

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.649
different game modes in the game I
actually really like the the game is is

00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:40.659
actually really like the the game is is
 

00:31:40.659 --> 00:31:42.960
actually really like the the game is is
totally cool in the way it plays I

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:42.970
totally cool in the way it plays I
 

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.250
totally cool in the way it plays I
actually would like to see it not use an

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:44.260
actually would like to see it not use an
 

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.289
actually would like to see it not use an
accelerometer because it changes the

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:46.299
accelerometer because it changes the
 

00:31:46.299 --> 00:31:48.299
accelerometer because it changes the
control screen the the graphics are nice

00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:48.309
control screen the the graphics are nice
 

00:31:48.309 --> 00:31:50.730
control screen the the graphics are nice
the animations nice it's got you know a

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:50.740
the animations nice it's got you know a
 

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.890
the animations nice it's got you know a
fun mechanic it's not super deep but

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:52.900
fun mechanic it's not super deep but
 

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.909
fun mechanic it's not super deep but
it's interesting yeah I want to see

00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919
it's interesting yeah I want to see
 

00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:55.440
it's interesting yeah I want to see
higher res graphics admittedly like this

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:55.450
higher res graphics admittedly like this
 

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.450
higher res graphics admittedly like this
is a kind of game I can imagine you know

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:57.460
is a kind of game I can imagine you know
 

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.640
is a kind of game I can imagine you know
taking a bar just like make some bets

00:31:59.640 --> 00:31:59.650
taking a bar just like make some bets
 

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.010
taking a bar just like make some bets
over just kinda happy and you know

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:02.020
over just kinda happy and you know
 

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.409
over just kinda happy and you know
trash-talking with my friends oh man I

00:32:04.409 --> 00:32:04.419
trash-talking with my friends oh man I
 

00:32:04.419 --> 00:32:06.060
trash-talking with my friends oh man I
bet you can't make this many baskets or

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.070
bet you can't make this many baskets or
 

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.399
bet you can't make this many baskets or
whatever and yeah I know it's totally

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:08.409
whatever and yeah I know it's totally
 

00:32:08.409 --> 00:32:09.960
whatever and yeah I know it's totally
quiet I want it I would love to see kind

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:09.970
quiet I want it I would love to see kind
 

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.430
quiet I want it I would love to see kind
of a social there is social stuff built

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440
of a social there is social stuff built
 

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.980
of a social there is social stuff built
into the game but you know there I'm

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:13.990
into the game but you know there I'm
 

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.960
into the game but you know there I'm
sure it can be taken further actually I

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:15.970
sure it can be taken further actually I
 

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.940
sure it can be taken further actually I
don't need a social stuff built into the

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:17.950
don't need a social stuff built into the
 

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:24.899
don't need a social stuff built into the
game mm-hmm oh so hey come on and we're

00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:24.909
game mm-hmm oh so hey come on and we're
 

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:28.110
game mm-hmm oh so hey come on and we're
so yeah I mean uh it does have gree

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120
so yeah I mean uh it does have gree
 

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.700
so yeah I mean uh it does have gree
built into it I don't actually know if

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:29.710
built into it I don't actually know if
 

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.560
built into it I don't actually know if
it enables any social nodes because I

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:31.570
it enables any social nodes because I
 

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.820
it enables any social nodes because I
think it's because well I see these

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:32.830
think it's because well I see these
 

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.409
think it's because well I see these
things I'm like I don't like fun so so

art using matrices for different screen

00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:37.909
art using matrices for different screen
 

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.389
art using matrices for different screen
resolutions so there's a couple ways of

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399
resolutions so there's a couple ways of
 

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:43.149
resolutions so there's a couple ways of
doing it I mean you give you if you're a

00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159
doing it I mean you give you if you're a
 

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:47.110
doing it I mean you give you if you're a
view based game you can actually using

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.120
view based game you can actually using
 

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.090
view based game you can actually using
canvas no node if your view based game

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:49.100
canvas no node if your view based game
 

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.290
canvas no node if your view based game
like if you're if you are one in which

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:50.300
like if you're if you are one in which
 

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.000
like if you're if you are one in which
you're actually using custom views you

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.010
you're actually using custom views you
 

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.290
you're actually using custom views you
can use image view you can use a matrix

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:53.300
can use image view you can use a matrix
 

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.419
can use image view you can use a matrix
associated with that you can actually we

00:34:55.419 --> 00:34:55.429
associated with that you can actually we
 

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:56.260
associated with that you can actually we
actually it's kind of

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:56.270
actually it's kind of
 

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.750
actually it's kind of
nice we would give you a matrix that

00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760
nice we would give you a matrix that
 

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.180
nice we would give you a matrix that
actually had that has multiple different

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:01.190
actually had that has multiple different
 

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.970
actually had that has multiple different
kinds of transformations and we actually

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:03.980
kinds of transformations and we actually
 

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.740
kinds of transformations and we actually
give you a bunch of functions to allow

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:05.750
give you a bunch of functions to allow
 

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.730
give you a bunch of functions to allow
you to create the matrix without

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:06.740
you to create the matrix without
 

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.110
you to create the matrix without
understanding the matrix map present

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:08.120
understanding the matrix map present
 

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.360
understanding the matrix map present
kind of glory by three matrix and if you

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:10.370
kind of glory by three matrix and if you
 

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:11.620
kind of glory by three matrix and if you
don't understand the matrix math you'll

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:11.630
don't understand the matrix math you'll
 

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.570
don't understand the matrix math you'll
never need be able to debug it yes

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:13.580
never need be able to debug it yes
 

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.490
never need be able to debug it yes
that's true and the functions don't

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:15.500
that's true and the functions don't
 

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.660
that's true and the functions don't
always work the way you think they

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:16.670
always work the way you think they
 

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.630
always work the way you think they
should and the moral of the story is

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640
should and the moral of the story is
 

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.820
should and the moral of the story is
learn math oh yeah and actually if you

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:21.830
learn math oh yeah and actually if you
 

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.980
learn math oh yeah and actually if you
go to ian's has a really really great

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:23.990
go to ian's has a really really great
 

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.140
go to ian's has a really really great
code sample that he did which is part of

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:26.150
code sample that he did which is part of
 

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.900
code sample that he did which is part of
Android U which is his custom view code

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:28.910
Android U which is his custom view code
 

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.150
Android U which is his custom view code
sample which actually goes through using

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160
sample which actually goes through using
 

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.350
sample which actually goes through using
matrix math to do a bunch of

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:32.360
matrix math to do a bunch of
 

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.820
matrix math to do a bunch of
transformations including you know

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:33.830
transformations including you know
 

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.090
transformations including you know
including rotation and scaling right

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.100
including rotation and scaling right
 

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.990
including rotation and scaling right
that is yeah that's somewhat true you

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000
that is yeah that's somewhat true you
 

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.190
that is yeah that's somewhat true you
cut it down a lot because people said oh

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200
cut it down a lot because people said oh
 

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.330
cut it down a lot because people said oh
you know maybe it's a little too hard

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:46.340
you know maybe it's a little too hard
 

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.770
you know maybe it's a little too hard
yeah maybe you shouldn't expect people

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:47.780
yeah maybe you shouldn't expect people
 

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.210
yeah maybe you shouldn't expect people
to know math I think that was I think I

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:49.220
to know math I think that was I think I
 

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.490
to know math I think that was I think I
think that yeah that might um yeah yeah

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:51.500
think that yeah that might um yeah yeah
 

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.020
think that yeah that might um yeah yeah
Ian had a much better example to lose

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:53.030
Ian had a much better example to lose
 

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.590
Ian had a much better example to lose

because there was not only bad math but

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:55.460
because there was not only bad math but

there was a memory overwrite that we
 

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.990
there was a memory overwrite that we
didn't catch we made it look like it was

the main thing is that yeah you're

00:37:37.569 --> 00:37:37.579
the main thing is that yeah you're
 

00:37:37.579 --> 00:37:43.359
the main thing is that yeah you're
applying a scale matrix to to your

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:43.369
applying a scale matrix to to your
 

00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:45.700

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:48.230
specific place but it seemed like you
 

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.049
specific place but it seemed like you
know either the scaling was wrong or it

00:37:50.049 --> 00:37:50.059
know either the scaling was wrong or it
 

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:51.609
know either the scaling was wrong or it
was being applied in the wrong order

00:37:51.609 --> 00:37:51.619
was being applied in the wrong order

my end yeah the one more thing I like to

00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:07.369
my end yeah the one more thing I like to
 

00:38:07.369 --> 00:38:08.710
my end yeah the one more thing I like to
add is that it's it's is that it's

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720
add is that it's it's is that it's
 

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.210
add is that it's it's is that it's
really important

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:10.220
really important
 

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.770
really important
since the matrix can do all those

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:11.780
since the matrix can do all those
 

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.780

transformations use the matrix for all

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:13.790

of them don't try to say well I'm gonna

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:15.589
of them don't try to say well I'm gonna
 

00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:17.260
of them don't try to say well I'm gonna
put this thing in a surface view and I'm

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:17.270
put this thing in a surface view and I'm
 

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.490
put this thing in a surface view and I'm
gonna try to set a scale factor

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:18.500
gonna try to set a scale factor
 

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.109
gonna try to set a scale factor
somewhere else oh yeah yeah since

00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119
somewhere else oh yeah yeah since
 

00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:22.000
somewhere else oh yeah yeah since
they'll I rely on the matrix to do

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.010
they'll I rely on the matrix to do
 

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.000
they'll I rely on the matrix to do
everything one it's really fast and and

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.010
everything one it's really fast and and
 

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.490
everything one it's really fast and and
and two it actually will make your code

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:27.500
and two it actually will make your code
 

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.960
and two it actually will make your code
a lot simpler well you got to remember

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:28.970
a lot simpler well you got to remember
 

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.329
a lot simpler well you got to remember
to what's going on here right I mean the

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:31.339
to what's going on here right I mean the
 

00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:33.099
to what's going on here right I mean the
software line the matrix I feel like I'm

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:33.109
software line the matrix I feel like I'm
 

00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:35.980
software line the matrix I feel like I'm
in a movie or something like that yeah I

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:35.990
in a movie or something like that yeah I
 

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.349
in a movie or something like that yeah I
know

00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359
know
 

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:41.650
know
so the thing is I remember that you know

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:41.660
so the thing is I remember that you know
 

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.359
so the thing is I remember that you know
obviously for software rendering this

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:43.369
obviously for software rendering this
 

00:38:43.369 --> 00:38:45.789
obviously for software rendering this
doesn't matter but for Hardware

00:38:45.789 --> 00:38:45.799
doesn't matter but for Hardware
 

00:38:45.799 --> 00:38:49.059
doesn't matter but for Hardware
rendering anything that's done using the

00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:49.069
rendering anything that's done using the
 

00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:53.829
rendering anything that's done using the
matrix will be done by the GPU I'm sure

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839
matrix will be done by the GPU I'm sure
 

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:55.240
matrix will be done by the GPU I'm sure
there are some exceptions that but

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:55.250
there are some exceptions that but
 

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:57.819
there are some exceptions that but
that's a general rule whereas if you do

00:38:57.819 --> 00:38:57.829
that's a general rule whereas if you do
 

00:38:57.829 --> 00:39:00.400
that's a general rule whereas if you do
something without using the matrix it's

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:00.410
something without using the matrix it's
 

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.780
something without using the matrix it's
a bit of a crapshoot you don't know if

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:01.790
a bit of a crapshoot you don't know if
 

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:03.400
a bit of a crapshoot you don't know if
you're gonna get it or not now there are

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.410
you're gonna get it or not now there are
 

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.930
you're gonna get it or not now there are
some things you need to be careful of

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:04.940
some things you need to be careful of
 

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.390
some things you need to be careful of
for instance let's say that you draw a

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400
for instance let's say that you draw a
 

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.970
for instance let's say that you draw a
path and then scale it using the matrix

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:09.980
path and then scale it using the matrix
 

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.760
path and then scale it using the matrix
and we'll be very fast but the quality

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:12.770
and we'll be very fast but the quality
 

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.819
and we'll be very fast but the quality
will be low because we draw GPUs aren't

00:39:15.819 --> 00:39:15.829
will be low because we draw GPUs aren't
 

00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:17.230
will be low because we draw GPUs aren't
very good at drawing paths so we draw

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240
very good at drawing paths so we draw
 

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.960
very good at drawing paths so we draw
the path in software and then scale it

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:19.970
the path in software and then scale it
 

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:20.550
the path in software and then scale it
up or scale

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560
up or scale
 

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.350
up or scale
down which means one of my favorite

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:22.360
down which means one of my favorite
 

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.840
down which means one of my favorite
things to do in the old system which was

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:24.850
things to do in the old system which was
 

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.020
things to do in the old system which was
to always draw paths in a 1x1 box and

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.030
to always draw paths in a 1x1 box and
 

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.730
to always draw paths in a 1x1 box and
then scale it to whatever didn't know

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:29.740
then scale it to whatever didn't know
 

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.330
then scale it to whatever didn't know
bad that that would be a sad thing yeah

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:32.340
bad that that would be a sad thing yeah
 

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.040
bad that that would be a sad thing yeah
but for things that are already drawn

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.050

you know bitmaps text especially things

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:40.180
you know bitmaps text especially things

that can be scaled and rotated by the

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:43.840
that can be scaled and rotated by the
 

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.110

hardware you know make sure that you do

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.120
hardware you know make sure that you do
 

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.150
hardware you know make sure that you do
that of course it's a little bit more

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160
that of course it's a little bit more
 

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.060
that of course it's a little bit more
complicated than just using the canvas

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:51.070
complicated than just using the canvas
 

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.980
complicated than just using the canvas
matrices you also have to make sure that

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:52.990
matrices you also have to make sure that
 

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:57.030

you're in a layer and my my class on do

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040
you're in a layer and my my class on do
 

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.940

yeah anyway I have a class on on doing

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:08.020
yeah anyway I have a class on on doing
 

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.410
yeah anyway I have a class on on doing
custom controls and it explains how to

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:10.420
custom controls and it explains how to
 

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.150
custom controls and it explains how to
draw something to a layer so you can

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160
draw something to a layer so you can
 

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.460
draw something to a layer so you can
very quickly rotate it and get buttery

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:14.470
very quickly rotate it and get buttery
 

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:16.080
very quickly rotate it and get buttery
smooth graphics even though the

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.090
smooth graphics even though the
 

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.370
smooth graphics even though the
operation that you're doing is kind of

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:17.380
operation that you're doing is kind of
 

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.630

and the other guys who should look at

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640
and the other guys who should look at
 

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.840
and the other guys who should look at
his class actually are the guys who did

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:21.850
his class actually are the guys who did
 

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.240

his gait is a custom control actually

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680
his gait is a custom control actually
 

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.290
his gait is a custom control actually
talks about physics and he actually has

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:28.300
talks about physics and he actually has
 

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.570
talks about physics and he actually has
some very very nice fling physics in

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:30.580
some very very nice fling physics in
 

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.830
some very very nice fling physics in
that and I think that would help the

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:31.840
that and I think that would help the
 

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.200
that and I think that would help the
game out immensely and you can actually

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:34.210
game out immensely and you can actually
 

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.100
game out immensely and you can actually
use the built-in physics model you get

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:37.110
use the built-in physics model you get
 

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:42.540
use the built-in physics model you get

it there's kind of two different things

00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599
it there's kind of two different things
 

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:47.079
it there's kind of two different things
um you know if your vector art you're

00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:47.089
um you know if your vector art you're
 

00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:49.479
um you know if your vector art you're
importing it as a bitmap oh yeah we

00:41:49.479 --> 00:41:49.489
importing it as a bitmap oh yeah we
 

00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:51.400
importing it as a bitmap oh yeah we
imported yeah that's one really

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:51.410
imported yeah that's one really
 

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.259
imported yeah that's one really
important thing are you are you doing it

00:41:53.259 --> 00:41:53.269
important thing are you are you doing it
 

00:41:53.269 --> 00:41:56.289
important thing are you are you doing it
as vector or you know you said bitmap so

00:41:56.289 --> 00:41:56.299
as vector or you know you said bitmap so
 

00:41:56.299 --> 00:41:58.329
as vector or you know you said bitmap so
that's who's gonna author that yeah so

00:41:58.329 --> 00:41:58.339
that's who's gonna author that yeah so
 

00:41:58.339 --> 00:42:01.690
that's who's gonna author that yeah so
in general there's AG yeah so in general

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:01.700
in general there's AG yeah so in general
 

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.849
in general there's AG yeah so in general
if you can't actually display vector art

00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:03.859
if you can't actually display vector art
 

00:42:03.859 --> 00:42:07.269
if you can't actually display vector art
in your game then what we generally

00:42:07.269 --> 00:42:07.279
in your game then what we generally
 

00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:09.460
in your game then what we generally
recommend is exporting a relatively high

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:09.470
recommend is exporting a relatively high
 

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.799
recommend is exporting a relatively high
quality version of it and putting it in

00:42:11.799 --> 00:42:11.809
quality version of it and putting it in
 

00:42:11.809 --> 00:42:14.229
quality version of it and putting it in
a higher density to start with that

00:42:14.229 --> 00:42:14.239
a higher density to start with that
 

00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:17.079
a higher density to start with that
helps the phones like the galaxy nexus

00:42:17.079 --> 00:42:17.089
helps the phones like the galaxy nexus
 

00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:19.720
helps the phones like the galaxy nexus
that are xhdpi because you'll end up

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:19.730
that are xhdpi because you'll end up
 

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.430
that are xhdpi because you'll end up
with getting getting high resolution

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440
with getting getting high resolution

with getting getting high resolution
artwork on there now the bigger question

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:23.690
artwork on there now the bigger question
 

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.299
artwork on there now the bigger question
is how do i how do i do the same thing

00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:25.309
is how do i how do i do the same thing
 

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:27.519
is how do i how do i do the same thing
on a tablet there's a couple of

00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:27.529
on a tablet there's a couple of
 

00:42:27.529 --> 00:42:30.609
on a tablet there's a couple of
different ways of doing that one way you

00:42:30.609 --> 00:42:30.619
different ways of doing that one way you
 

00:42:30.619 --> 00:42:32.559
different ways of doing that one way you
can do things and this is this is fairly

00:42:32.559 --> 00:42:32.569
can do things and this is this is fairly
 

00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:34.239
can do things and this is this is fairly
straightforward is you can actually you

00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:34.249
straightforward is you can actually you
 

00:42:34.249 --> 00:42:36.519
straightforward is you can actually you
can actually throw the artwork into a

00:42:36.519 --> 00:42:36.529
can actually throw the artwork into a
 

00:42:36.529 --> 00:42:38.769
can actually throw the artwork into a
node and into a node epi folder and you

00:42:38.769 --> 00:42:38.779
node and into a node epi folder and you
 

00:42:38.779 --> 00:42:41.559
node and into a node epi folder and you
can just try to select you can just try

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:41.569
can just try to select you can just try
 

00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:43.269
can just try to select you can just try
to select a scale factor that makes

00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:43.279
to select a scale factor that makes
 

00:42:43.279 --> 00:42:45.039
to select a scale factor that makes
sense don't rely on the system to scale

00:42:45.039 --> 00:42:45.049

take care of that then what so here's

00:43:11.259 --> 00:43:11.269
take care of that then what so here's
 

00:43:11.269 --> 00:43:13.450
take care of that then what so here's
let me try and break down yeah well

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:13.460
let me try and break down yeah well
 

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.950
let me try and break down yeah well
we're talking about matrices right as

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960
we're talking about matrices right as
 

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.109
we're talking about matrices right as
Dan says matrix anytime he wants to

00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119
Dan says matrix anytime he wants to
 

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:18.970
Dan says matrix anytime he wants to
sound smart so here's what we're gonna

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:18.980
sound smart so here's what we're gonna
 

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.970
sound smart so here's what we're gonna
do all you're going to do is scale this

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:21.980
do all you're going to do is scale this
 

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.440
do all you're going to do is scale this
but the important thing is there's

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:24.450
but the important thing is there's
 

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.870
but the important thing is there's
two ways to scale a bitmap in Android

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880
two ways to scale a bitmap in Android
 

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.930
two ways to scale a bitmap in Android
you can use a draw bitmap and give it a

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940
you can use a draw bitmap and give it a
 

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.819
you can use a draw bitmap and give it a
destination rect that's different from

00:43:31.819 --> 00:43:31.829
destination rect that's different from
 

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:33.470
destination rect that's different from
your source rect and that will do

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480
your source rect and that will do
 

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.440
your source rect and that will do
scaling or you can draw it to a canvas

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:36.450
scaling or you can draw it to a canvas
 

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:39.800
scaling or you can draw it to a canvas
at its original rectangle and apply a

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:39.810
at its original rectangle and apply a
 

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.960
at its original rectangle and apply a
scale matrix to the entire canvas and

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:41.970
scale matrix to the entire canvas and
 

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.670
scale matrix to the entire canvas and
the problem comes when you mix them okay

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680
the problem comes when you mix them okay
 

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.230
the problem comes when you mix them okay
so when you mix the two techniques now

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240
so when you mix the two techniques now
 

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.390
so when you mix the two techniques now
well no because of applying the scale

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400
well no because of applying the scale
 

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.250
well no because of applying the scale
matrix to the canvas is applying at each

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260
matrix to the canvas is applying at each
 

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.310
matrix to the canvas is applying at each
drawing operation centerfold so what we

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:55.320
drawing operation centerfold so what we
 

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.670
drawing operation centerfold so what we
were suggesting is that you pick the

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680
were suggesting is that you pick the
 

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.050
were suggesting is that you pick the
canvas size that you feel is native so

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060
canvas size that you feel is native so
 

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.910
canvas size that you feel is native so
whatever your you had in mind now

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920
whatever your you had in mind now
 

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.890
whatever your you had in mind now
remember this isn't gonna take care of

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900
remember this isn't gonna take care of
 

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.260
remember this isn't gonna take care of
aspect ratio all right it's gonna take

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:09.270
aspect ratio all right it's gonna take
 

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.630
aspect ratio all right it's gonna take
care of size and for aspect ratio you

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640
care of size and for aspect ratio you
 

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.440
care of size and for aspect ratio you
need to make some other you need to make

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:15.450
need to make some other you need to make
 

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:18.050
need to make some other you need to make
some other decisions you may want to do

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060
some other decisions you may want to do
 

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.130
some other decisions you may want to do
a little bit of letter bottom you'll

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140
a little bit of letter bottom you'll
 

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.579
a little bit of letter bottom you'll
move some some of your your UI elements

00:44:22.579 --> 00:44:22.589
move some some of your your UI elements
 

00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:24.410
move some some of your your UI elements
out further looking like that and the

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420
out further looking like that and the
 

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.550
out further looking like that and the
other thing that's little tricky is on a

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560
other thing that's little tricky is on a
 

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.530
other thing that's little tricky is on a
tablet so normally what we what Android

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540
tablet so normally what we what Android
 

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.329
tablet so normally what we what Android
does if you haven't you know and let's

00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:29.339
does if you haven't you know and let's
 

00:44:29.339 --> 00:44:31.790
does if you haven't you know and let's
say an xhdpi resource right and you try

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800
say an xhdpi resource right and you try
 

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.770
say an xhdpi resource right and you try
to load it onto a tablet which is an

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780
to load it onto a tablet which is an
 

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.520
to load it onto a tablet which is an
mdpi device

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:34.530
mdpi device
 

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.319
mdpi device
you know androids automatically to go

00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:36.329
you know androids automatically to go
 

00:44:36.329 --> 00:44:38.630
you know androids automatically to go
and it's going to squish that down and

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640
and it's going to squish that down and
 

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.579
and it's going to squish that down and
it's going to make an mdpi size because

00:44:40.579 --> 00:44:40.589
it's going to make an mdpi size because
 

00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:43.670
it's going to make an mdpi size because
its goal is it's trying to retain the

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680
its goal is it's trying to retain the
 

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.290
its goal is it's trying to retain the
physical size of that bitmap which for a

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300
physical size of that bitmap which for a
 

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.839
physical size of that bitmap which for a
lot of actual non game UI is very nice

00:44:50.839 --> 00:44:50.849
lot of actual non game UI is very nice
 

00:44:50.849 --> 00:44:52.040
lot of actual non game UI is very nice
because what you really want in a tablet

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:52.050
because what you really want in a tablet
 

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:53.660
because what you really want in a tablet
often is just to display more

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:53.670
often is just to display more
 

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.720
often is just to display more
information however there's a balance so

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:56.730
information however there's a balance so
 

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.920
information however there's a balance so
what you can do is a couple of things

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:57.930
what you can do is a couple of things
 

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.260
what you can do is a couple of things
one is you can actually say you know

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:00.270
one is you can actually say you know
 

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.059
one is you can actually say you know
what I'm on an extra-large device let's

00:45:02.059 --> 00:45:02.069
what I'm on an extra-large device let's
 

00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:05.030
what I'm on an extra-large device let's
not use the DPI that is built into it

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040
not use the DPI that is built into it
 

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.770
not use the DPI that is built into it
you can actually say I'm on Al extra

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780
you can actually say I'm on Al extra
 

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.329
you can actually say I'm on Al extra
large screen device I'm gonna take use

00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339
large screen device I'm gonna take use
 

00:45:08.339 --> 00:45:10.040
large screen device I'm gonna take use
I'm gonna make use of higher resolution

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:10.050
I'm gonna make use of higher resolution
 

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:11.240
I'm gonna make use of higher resolution
assets and you can actually set that

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:11.250
assets and you can actually set that
 

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.150
assets and you can actually set that
until the resource load or actually go

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160
until the resource load or actually go
 

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.940
until the resource load or actually go
load me the next level up the other

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:16.950
load me the next level up the other
 

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:17.990
load me the next level up the other
thing you can do is if you're if you're

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000
thing you can do is if you're if you're
 

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.280
thing you can do is if you're if you're
going to do that a lot you can simply

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:19.290
going to do that a lot you can simply
 

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:22.609
going to do that a lot you can simply
store your resources in a no dpi folder

00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619
store your resources in a no dpi folder
 

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.829
store your resources in a no dpi folder
and then do some calculations yourself

00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839
and then do some calculations yourself
 

00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:26.210
and then do some calculations yourself
to determine how to scale because

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220
to determine how to scale because
 

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.920
to determine how to scale because
actually if you look at what's going on

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:27.930
actually if you look at what's going on
 

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.260
actually if you look at what's going on
inside of the resource loader all of

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:30.270
inside of the resource loader all of
 

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.819
inside of the resource loader all of
it's doing is it's telling the bitmap

00:45:31.819 --> 00:45:31.829
it's doing is it's telling the bitmap
 

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.800
it's doing is it's telling the bitmap
factory to scale now one thing that's

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:33.810
factory to scale now one thing that's
 

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.660
factory to scale now one thing that's
kind of nice you can also do if you want

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:35.670
kind of nice you can also do if you want
 

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.980
kind of nice you can also do if you want
to do it a little bit more optimally is

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:36.990
to do it a little bit more optimally is
 

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.210
to do it a little bit more optimally is
that there's actually two ways

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220
that there's actually two ways
 

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.339
that there's actually two ways
in which unloading you can scale bitmaps

00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:40.349
in which unloading you can scale bitmaps
 

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:42.200
in which unloading you can scale bitmaps
well but the thing is I think when we

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:42.210
well but the thing is I think when we
 

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.250
well but the thing is I think when we
were talking about the dominoes and this

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260
were talking about the dominoes and this
 

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.690
were talking about the dominoes and this
is this is why I was going yeah yeah

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700
is this is why I was going yeah yeah
 

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.310
is this is why I was going yeah yeah
matrix direction where they I mean I

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:46.320
matrix direction where they I mean I
 

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.450
matrix direction where they I mean I
think I feel like we're sort of

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460
think I feel like we're sort of
 

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.790
think I feel like we're sort of
diverging into 200 stories right the

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800
diverging into 200 stories right the
 

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.300
diverging into 200 stories right the
problem was not that I nobody I'm sure

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:53.310
problem was not that I nobody I'm sure
 

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.650
problem was not that I nobody I'm sure
he was loading the wrong resource but it

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660
he was loading the wrong resource but it
 

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.210
he was loading the wrong resource but it
felt like the real problem was he was

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220
felt like the real problem was he was
 

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.089
felt like the real problem was he was
drawing the Domino's with with one set

00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099
drawing the Domino's with with one set
 

00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:02.000
drawing the Domino's with with one set
of scale factors anyway yes drawing dots

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.010
of scale factors anyway yes drawing dots
 

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.950
of scale factors anyway yes drawing dots
with the others that's right exactly and

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960
with the others that's right exactly and
 

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.690
with the others that's right exactly and
the other thing is that the dot the

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700
the other thing is that the dot the
 

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.339
the other thing is that the dot the
Domino's alert Brian there we've got

00:46:07.339 --> 00:46:07.349
Domino's alert Brian there we've got
 

00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:09.200
Domino's alert Brian there we've got
that we got the DPI saying we got the

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:09.210
that we got the DPI saying we got the
 

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.880
that we got the DPI saying we got the
matrix thing let's separate those and

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:10.890
matrix thing let's separate those and
 

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.320
matrix thing let's separate those and
finish one of those can't talk about the

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:12.330
finish one of those can't talk about the
 

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:15.740
finish one of those can't talk about the
DPI thing so yeah so for dpi you know

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:15.750
DPI thing so yeah so for dpi you know
 

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.180
DPI thing so yeah so for dpi you know
you've got kind of two problems that are

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:17.190
you've got kind of two problems that are
 

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.109
you've got kind of two problems that are
fighting each other you want to make

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119
fighting each other you want to make
 

00:46:18.119 --> 00:46:19.550
fighting each other you want to make
sure that you make video memories to

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560
sure that you make video memories to
 

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.930
sure that you make video memories to

memory so you do kind of so where it

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:22.710
memory so you do kind of so where it
 

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.400
memory so you do kind of so where it
makes sense to do what is going on with

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.410
makes sense to do what is going on with
 

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.109
makes sense to do what is going on with
the standard transformations it does

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119
the standard transformations it does
 

00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:28.820
the standard transformations it does
make sense to use them or to simply

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:28.830
make sense to use them or to simply
 

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.280
make sense to use them or to simply
apply similar ones yourself the second

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:31.290
apply similar ones yourself the second
 

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:32.839

thing is that you really want to make

00:46:32.839 --> 00:46:32.849
thing is that you really want to make
 

00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:34.339
thing is that you really want to make
sure that on a tablet if you want to

00:46:34.339 --> 00:46:34.349
sure that on a tablet if you want to
 

00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:35.690
sure that on a tablet if you want to
display things bigger that you do select

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700
display things bigger that you do select
 

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.390
display things bigger that you do select
larger size larger resolution assets and

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400
larger size larger resolution assets and
 

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.430
larger size larger resolution assets and
and you know the easiest thing to do is

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440
and you know the easiest thing to do is
 

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.349
and you know the easiest thing to do is
simply to enumerate the kind of assets

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359
simply to enumerate the kind of assets
 

00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:44.060
simply to enumerate the kind of assets
you have and select the right one that's

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:44.070
you have and select the right one that's
 

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.230
you have and select the right one that's
what a lot of a lot of game developers

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240
what a lot of a lot of game developers
 

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.470
what a lot of a lot of game developers
do try to reliably the API had thing too

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480
do try to reliably the API had thing too
 

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.849
do try to reliably the API had thing too
if you're in the DPI folders you can

00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859
if you're in the DPI folders you can
 

00:46:49.859 --> 00:46:52.040
if you're in the DPI folders you can
basically work in dips right you don't

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:52.050
basically work in dips right you don't
 

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.900
basically work in dips right you don't
have to work in actual pictures that's

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:53.910
have to work in actual pictures that's
 

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.130
have to work in actual pictures that's
correct you can you can do all of your

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140
correct you can you can do all of your
 

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.630
correct you can you can do all of your
layouts and dips the only problem with

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640
layouts and dips the only problem with
 

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.920
layouts and dips the only problem with
that is that obviously this thing has a

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:57.930
that is that obviously this thing has a
 

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:01.490
that is that obviously this thing has a
much larger amount of dips and so and so

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500
much larger amount of dips and so and so
 

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.480
much larger amount of dips and so and so
you're gonna actually want have

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:02.490
you're gonna actually want have
 

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.099
you're gonna actually want have
different resources people don't want to

00:47:04.099 --> 00:47:04.109
different resources people don't want to
 

00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:06.560
different resources people don't want to
have like hdpi slash extra-large

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:06.570
have like hdpi slash extra-large
 

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.030
have like hdpi slash extra-large
resources that's actually the correct

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040
resources that's actually the correct
 

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.760
resources that's actually the correct
way of having different scaled resources

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:10.770
way of having different scaled resources
 

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.470
way of having different scaled resources
is to actually have separate bitmaps

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480
is to actually have separate bitmaps
 

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.390
is to actually have separate bitmaps
that are for tablets for hdpi

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400
that are for tablets for hdpi
 

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.210
that are for tablets for hdpi
and for phones for hdpi and you know

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220
and for phones for hdpi and you know
 

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.609
and for phones for hdpi and you know
that that just gets kind of messy so so

00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619
that that just gets kind of messy so so
 

00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:20.900
that that just gets kind of messy so so
you know they're you know in this case

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:20.910
you know they're you know in this case
 

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.900
you know they're you know in this case
became a keep the image really small in

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:23.910
became a keep the image really small in
 

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:25.280
became a keep the image really small in
order to keep things relatively simple

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:25.290
order to keep things relatively simple
 

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:26.240
order to keep things relatively simple
you'll probably want to do a little bit

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:26.250
you'll probably want to do a little bit
 

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.740
you'll probably want to do a little bit
of math just to make sure you get the

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:27.750
of math just to make sure you get the
 

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.020
of math just to make sure you get the
right size images with the highest

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:30.030
right size images with the highest
 

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.660
right size images with the highest
quality available for these mdvi tablets

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:32.670
quality available for these mdvi tablets
 

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:34.480
quality available for these mdvi tablets
right so let's move on to that then yes

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:34.490
right so let's move on to that then yes
 

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:36.380
right so let's move on to that then yes
the way you could do it if you're

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:36.390
the way you could do it if you're
 

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:37.910
the way you could do it if you're
especially if you're thinking in dips

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920
especially if you're thinking in dips
 

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.440
especially if you're thinking in dips
right so the dips are sort of supposed

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:39.450
right so the dips are sort of supposed
 

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:42.349
right so the dips are sort of supposed
to be related to physical units yes and

00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359
to be related to physical units yes and
 

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:45.349
to be related to physical units yes and
so they are actually right well yes

00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359
so they are actually right well yes
 

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:47.390
so they are actually right well yes
they're related yes they're not I know

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400
they're related yes they're not I know
 

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.370
they're related yes they're not I know
they're not a so related

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380
they're not a so related
 

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.489
they're not a so related
so the trick here is that a four inch

00:47:52.489 --> 00:47:52.499
so the trick here is that a four inch
 

00:47:52.499 --> 00:47:54.890
so the trick here is that a four inch
phone and a 10 inch tablet may actually

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900
phone and a 10 inch tablet may actually
 

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.749
phone and a 10 inch tablet may actually
have the same number of pixels but a

00:47:56.749 --> 00:47:56.759
have the same number of pixels but a
 

00:47:56.759 --> 00:47:58.249
have the same number of pixels but a
different number of dips so I think what

00:47:58.249 --> 00:47:58.259
different number of dips so I think what
 

00:47:58.259 --> 00:48:00.829
different number of dips so I think what
we're suggesting is that you might want

00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839
we're suggesting is that you might want
 

00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:03.979
we're suggesting is that you might want
to go ahead and decide on a sort of

00:48:03.979 --> 00:48:03.989
to go ahead and decide on a sort of
 

00:48:03.989 --> 00:48:06.380
to go ahead and decide on a sort of
native set native dimensions and dips

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:06.390
native set native dimensions and dips
 

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:10.910
native set native dimensions and dips
and then either expand or contract by

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920
and then either expand or contract by
 

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.769
and then either expand or contract by
setting a scale factor now how do you

00:48:12.769 --> 00:48:12.779
setting a scale factor now how do you
 

00:48:12.779 --> 00:48:14.809
setting a scale factor now how do you
set that scale factor well you do it in

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819
set that scale factor well you do it in
 

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:17.150
set that scale factor well you do it in
the matrix of your canvas and you make

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160
the matrix of your canvas and you make
 

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.029
the matrix of your canvas and you make
sure that in for all of the elements

00:48:20.029 --> 00:48:20.039
sure that in for all of the elements
 

00:48:20.039 --> 00:48:21.739
sure that in for all of the elements
that are supposed to be occupying the

00:48:21.739 --> 00:48:21.749
that are supposed to be occupying the
 

00:48:21.749 --> 00:48:24.049
that are supposed to be occupying the
same physical space in your game board

00:48:24.049 --> 00:48:24.059
same physical space in your game board
 

00:48:24.059 --> 00:48:26.870
same physical space in your game board
that matrix needs to be the same and the

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880
that matrix needs to be the same and the
 

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.819
that matrix needs to be the same and the
domino game is probably using one matrix

00:48:31.819 --> 00:48:31.829
domino game is probably using one matrix
 

00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:34.940
domino game is probably using one matrix
for drawing the triangles and using

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:34.950
for drawing the triangles and using
 

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.559
for drawing the triangles and using
another matrix for drawing the dots and

00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:36.569
another matrix for drawing the dots and
 

00:48:36.569 --> 00:48:37.549
another matrix for drawing the dots and
that's where they're running into

00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559
that's where they're running into
 

00:48:37.559 --> 00:48:38.989
that's where they're running into
problems I think so I think that's

00:48:38.989 --> 00:48:38.999
problems I think so I think that's
 

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:40.279
problems I think so I think that's
exactly what's going I think actually

00:48:40.279 --> 00:48:40.289
exactly what's going I think actually
 

00:48:40.289 --> 00:48:43.279
exactly what's going I think actually
it's probably drawing the triangles as

00:48:43.279 --> 00:48:43.289
it's probably drawing the triangles as
 

00:48:43.289 --> 00:48:46.849
it's probably drawing the triangles as
based just purely on on what's coming on

00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859
based just purely on on what's coming on
 

00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:48.410
based just purely on on what's coming on
the screen and it's probably loading

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420
the screen and it's probably loading
 

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.599
the screen and it's probably loading
it's probably loading the bitmap images

00:48:50.599 --> 00:48:50.609
it's probably loading the bitmap images
 

00:48:50.609 --> 00:48:52.339
it's probably loading the bitmap images
and making assumptions about the size of

00:48:52.339 --> 00:48:52.349
and making assumptions about the size of
 

00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:53.509
and making assumptions about the size of
them and then trying to scale about to

00:48:53.509 --> 00:48:53.519
them and then trying to scale about to
 

00:48:53.519 --> 00:48:55.880
them and then trying to scale about to
scale those that's my that's my guess we

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:55.890
scale those that's my that's my guess we
 

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:57.410
scale those that's my that's my guess we
see even saw in Galaxy Nexus with that

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420
see even saw in Galaxy Nexus with that
 

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.450
see even saw in Galaxy Nexus with that
device with that game that even going to

00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460
device with that game that even going to
 

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.640
device with that game that even going to
HDMI and plugging that in made the game

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:01.650
HDMI and plugging that in made the game
 

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:02.839
HDMI and plugging that in made the game
unplayable so there's probably some

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:02.849
unplayable so there's probably some
 

00:49:02.849 --> 00:49:04.910
unplayable so there's probably some
calculations going on that are based on

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920
calculations going on that are based on
 

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.440
calculations going on that are based on
the display size rather than on the

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:06.450
the display size rather than on the
 

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.749
the display size rather than on the
viewport size that's given as well so

00:49:08.749 --> 00:49:08.759
viewport size that's given as well so
 

00:49:08.759 --> 00:49:10.009
viewport size that's given as well so
there's probably probably a number of

00:49:10.009 --> 00:49:10.019
there's probably probably a number of
 

00:49:10.019 --> 00:49:11.269
there's probably probably a number of
different issues you have to really make

00:49:11.269 --> 00:49:11.279
different issues you have to really make
 

00:49:11.279 --> 00:49:13.069
different issues you have to really make
sure that when the system tells you know

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079
sure that when the system tells you know
 

00:49:13.079 --> 00:49:15.109
sure that when the system tells you know
rescale your viewport you really have to

00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119
rescale your viewport you really have to
 

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.059
rescale your viewport you really have to
go and redo those calculations yeah

00:49:17.059 --> 00:49:17.069
go and redo those calculations yeah
 

00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:18.890
go and redo those calculations yeah
that's very important as well so you

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900
that's very important as well so you
 

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.390
that's very important as well so you
have to remember that you're gonna be on

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400
have to remember that you're gonna be on
 

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.640
have to remember that you're gonna be on
a multitude of different devices and

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:22.650
a multitude of different devices and
 

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:25.219
a multitude of different devices and
this is actually where 3d games have a

00:49:25.219 --> 00:49:25.229
this is actually where 3d games have a
 

00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:27.499
this is actually where 3d games have a
real advantage because 3d games are sort

00:49:27.499 --> 00:49:27.509
real advantage because 3d games are sort
 

00:49:27.509 --> 00:49:30.259
real advantage because 3d games are sort
of used to having to do viewport

00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:30.269
of used to having to do viewport
 

00:49:30.269 --> 00:49:32.180

mappings are you mapping from your 3d

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:32.190
mappings are you mapping from your 3d
 

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:36.410
mappings are you mapping from your 3d
world into a what we call clip space but

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420
world into a what we call clip space but
 

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.599

2d games a lot of times haven't had to

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:38.609
2d games a lot of times haven't had to
 

00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:40.789
2d games a lot of times haven't had to
deal with that unless you're coming from

00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:40.799
deal with that unless you're coming from
 

00:49:40.799 --> 00:49:43.009
deal with that unless you're coming from
a background of games that were actually

00:49:43.009 --> 00:49:43.019
a background of games that were actually
 

00:49:43.019 --> 00:49:44.479
a background of games that were actually
written to be resized on let's say a

00:49:44.479 --> 00:49:44.489
written to be resized on let's say a
 

00:49:44.489 --> 00:49:46.549
written to be resized on let's say a
desktop PC yeah and there's no reason

00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559
desktop PC yeah and there's no reason
 

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:48.469

why a game like dominoes shouldn't be

00:49:48.469 --> 00:49:48.479
why a game like dominoes shouldn't be
 

00:49:48.479 --> 00:49:50.479
why a game like dominoes shouldn't be
you know resizable and scalable and

00:49:50.479 --> 00:49:50.489
you know resizable and scalable and
 

00:49:50.489 --> 00:49:52.910
you know resizable and scalable and
there's a lot of ways to to attack that

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920
there's a lot of ways to to attack that
 

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.160
there's a lot of ways to to attack that
so I think I think that's maybe that

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:55.170
so I think I think that's maybe that
 

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:56.870
so I think I think that's maybe that

that the second thing you can make sure
that you're actually you know filtering

an OpenGL es2 right um the second thing
 

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:57.590
an OpenGL es2 right um the second thing
you can do is to make sure is is if it's

a lot of games but if that are if you're
 

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.530

right and you can talk about polygon

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680
right and you can talk about polygon
 

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.530

throughput you could talk about raw

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540

vertex shader you can talk about memory

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:20.370
vertex shader you can talk about memory
 

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:24.440

of these things add up into something

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:28.710
of these things add up into something

of these things add up into something
that's even only partially the picture

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720
that's even only partially the picture
 

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.450
that's even only partially the picture
because you also have not only do you

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460
because you also have not only do you
 

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.460
because you also have not only do you
have different bandwidths and different

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:34.470
have different bandwidths and different
 

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.010
have different bandwidths and different
fill rates and different you know

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020
fill rates and different you know
 

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.330

arithmetic unit designs

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:38.340

you also have completely different

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:40.560
you also have completely different
 

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.320
you also have completely different
architectures so the main ones being

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:42.330
architectures so the main ones being
 

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:45.560
architectures so the main ones being
either tiled or well immediate mode and

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:45.570
either tiled or well immediate mode and
 

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:46.340
either tiled or well immediate mode and
there and there's actually two things

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:46.350
there and there's actually two things
 

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:48.880
there and there's actually two things
there's tiled deferred mode and there's

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:48.890
there's tiled deferred mode and there's
 

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:52.070
there's tiled deferred mode and there's
immediate mode which is sort of a yeah

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:52.080
immediate mode which is sort of a yeah
 

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.500
immediate mode which is sort of a yeah
and so so so basically the question the

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:54.510
and so so so basically the question the
 

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:56.420
and so so so basically the question the
question you have to ask yourself is you

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:56.430
question you have to ask yourself is you
 

00:52:56.430 --> 00:53:00.710
question you have to ask yourself is you
know one how many devices you so passed

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720
know one how many devices you so passed
 

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.210
know one how many devices you so passed
up an opportunity yeah

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220
up an opportunity yeah
 

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.550
up an opportunity yeah
the question you have to ask yourself is

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:04.560
the question you have to ask yourself is
 

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:08.450
the question you have to ask yourself is
do you feel lucky punk exactly do you so

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460
do you feel lucky punk exactly do you so
 

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.740
do you feel lucky punk exactly do you so
how many devices do you really want to

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:09.750
how many devices do you really want to
 

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.900
how many devices do you really want to
hit you know you know today you know I

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:11.910
hit you know you know today you know I
 

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:13.790
hit you know you know today you know I
think I think you're gonna want to hit a

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:13.800
think I think you're gonna want to hit a
 

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.830
think I think you're gonna want to hit a
pretty large cross-section of devices

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:15.840
pretty large cross-section of devices
 

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.150
pretty large cross-section of devices
but you might be limited because of

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160
but you might be limited because of
 

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.740
but you might be limited because of
memory you might be limited because of

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:18.750
memory you might be limited because of
 

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:22.340
memory you might be limited because of
just raw GPU power today on Google Play

if you're really limited by those things

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:24.690
if you're really limited by those things
 

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:26.210
if you're really limited by those things
and I you know might might and my advice

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220
and I you know might might and my advice
 

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.770
and I you know might might and my advice
to everyone just try to target as broad

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780
to everyone just try to target as broad
 

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.870
to everyone just try to target as broad
as possible you know you're gonna if

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880
as possible you know you're gonna if
 

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.340
as possible you know you're gonna if
you're running a 3d game you're gonna

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:31.350
you're running a 3d game you're gonna
 

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.980
you're running a 3d game you're gonna
you're gonna have a MIT map with

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:33.990
you're gonna have a MIT map with
 

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.540
you're gonna have a MIT map with
different versions of a texture for

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:35.550
different versions of a texture for
 

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:36.500
different versions of a texture for
things that are in the distance

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:36.510
things that are in the distance
 

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.870
things that are in the distance
typically take advantage of that and use

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880
typically take advantage of that and use
 

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.580
typically take advantage of that and use
different NIT map levels I'm gonna use

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:40.590
different NIT map levels I'm gonna use
 

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.250
different NIT map levels I'm gonna use
mine it biased you know back yeah you

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260
mine it biased you know back yeah you
 

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.500
mine it biased you know back yeah you
know I don't think there's anybody

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:45.510
know I don't think there's anybody
 

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:47.540
know I don't think there's anybody
that's - that's terrible at vertex

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:47.550
that's - that's terrible at vertex
 

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.760
that's - that's terrible at vertex
performance yeah so you can think in

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:49.770
performance yeah so you can think in
 

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:53.330
performance yeah so you can think in
terms of you know you you want to have a

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:53.340
terms of you know you you want to have a
 

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.550
terms of you know you you want to have a
certain number of vertices and you can

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:55.560
certain number of vertices and you can
 

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.200
certain number of vertices and you can
cut off you know like this year's or

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:57.210
cut off you know like this year's or
 

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.750
cut off you know like this year's or
last year's devices I don't actually

00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760
last year's devices I don't actually
 

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.190
last year's devices I don't actually
think there's even been that much

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200
think there's even been that much
 

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.540
think there's even been that much
progress in this but yeah Phil rate wise

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:04.550
progress in this but yeah Phil rate wise
 

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:06.410
progress in this but yeah Phil rate wise
you know what's the right thing to do

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420
you know what's the right thing to do
 

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.570
you know what's the right thing to do
well Dan's got a good idea I mean if

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:08.580
well Dan's got a good idea I mean if
 

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.170
well Dan's got a good idea I mean if
you're if you're bound by input you know

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180
you're if you're bound by input you know
 

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:15.140
you're if you're bound by input you know
doing doing omit bias would definitely

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:15.150
doing doing omit bias would definitely
 

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.570
doing doing omit bias would definitely
reduce the amount of memory the GPU is

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:17.580
reduce the amount of memory the GPU is
 

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.950
reduce the amount of memory the GPU is
consumed in hey that's me that doesn't

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960
consumed in hey that's me that doesn't
 

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.790
consumed in hey that's me that doesn't
reduce the amount the the Jeep

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800
reduce the amount the the Jeep
 

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.560
reduce the amount the the Jeep
he was producing that's great where you

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:22.570
he was producing that's great where you
 

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:24.420
he was producing that's great where you
would introduce your frame buffer sauce

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:24.430
would introduce your frame buffer sauce
 

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:26.310
would introduce your frame buffer sauce
so the second thing you can do you know

00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:26.320
so the second thing you can do you know
 

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.810
so the second thing you can do you know
if you're really targeting and we know a

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:27.820
if you're really targeting and we know a
 

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.670
if you're really targeting and we know a
lot of developers don't do this and I

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680
lot of developers don't do this and I
 

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.920
lot of developers don't do this and I
think it's partially cuz they don't know

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:30.930
think it's partially cuz they don't know
 

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.210
think it's partially cuz they don't know
it's kind of hidden but one thing that

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:33.220
it's kind of hidden but one thing that
 

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.620
it's kind of hidden but one thing that
you as a developer can do if you're

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:34.630
you as a developer can do if you're
 

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:38.490
you as a developer can do if you're
using OpenGL is you can actually set the

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:38.500
using OpenGL is you can actually set the
 

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:42.510
using OpenGL is you can actually set the
size of your viewport in our windowing

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520
size of your viewport in our windowing
 

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.240
size of your viewport in our windowing
system so not even in OpenGL we actually

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:45.250
system so not even in OpenGL we actually
 

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:47.310
system so not even in OpenGL we actually
offer this sort of hidden API which is

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:47.320
offer this sort of hidden API which is
 

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.860
offer this sort of hidden API which is
inside of surface holder called set

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:49.870
inside of surface holder called set
 

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.380
inside of surface holder called set
fixed size and if you do that it'll

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:52.390
fixed size and if you do that it'll
 

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:54.840
fixed size and if you do that it'll
actually automatically scale your

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:54.850
actually automatically scale your
 

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:57.350
actually automatically scale your
viewport up to the size of your window

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:57.360
viewport up to the size of your window
 

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.220
viewport up to the size of your window
so it's actually very very useful

00:54:59.220 --> 00:54:59.230
so it's actually very very useful
 

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.910
so it's actually very very useful
literally and and that's done inside of

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920
literally and and that's done inside of
 

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.980
literally and and that's done inside of
surface flinger and it may even be done

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:04.990
surface flinger and it may even be done
 

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.200
surface flinger and it may even be done
with a hardware composer so it may so

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:07.210
with a hardware composer so it may so
 

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.390
with a hardware composer so it may so
for a lot of reasons we definitely

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400
for a lot of reasons we definitely
 

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.650
for a lot of reasons we definitely
recommend doing that especially you know

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:10.660
recommend doing that especially you know
 

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:14.730
recommend doing that especially you know
if your choices are rendering to a pixel

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:14.740
if your choices are rendering to a pixel
 

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.090
if your choices are rendering to a pixel
buffer or actually rendering to using

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:18.100
buffer or actually rendering to using
 

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:19.140
buffer or actually rendering to using
this you should definitely use this

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:19.150
this you should definitely use this
 

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.850
this you should definitely use this
you're gonna get more performance a lot

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:20.860
you're gonna get more performance a lot
 

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.050
you're gonna get more performance a lot
of times when things are really just

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:22.060
of times when things are really just
 

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.520
of times when things are really just
heavily fill limited that's what you

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:23.530
heavily fill limited that's what you
 

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:25.230
heavily fill limited that's what you
should do obviously there's shader

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240
should do obviously there's shader
 

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.490
should do obviously there's shader
effects there's other things you can do

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:26.500
effects there's other things you can do
 

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.960
effects there's other things you can do
but my you know my general advice on

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:27.970
but my you know my general advice on
 

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:29.820
but my you know my general advice on
Android is try to make things scaleable

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:29.830
Android is try to make things scaleable
 

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:32.550
Android is try to make things scaleable
try not to cut off you know users if you

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:32.560
try not to cut off you know users if you
 

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.830
try not to cut off you know users if you
absolutely can avoid it you want as many

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:34.840
absolutely can avoid it you want as many
 

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.510
absolutely can avoid it you want as many
users as possible to see your game give

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520
users as possible to see your game give
 

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:38.760
users as possible to see your game give
yourself some knobs so that you can make

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:38.770
yourself some knobs so that you can make
 

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:41.370
yourself some knobs so that you can make
adjustments don't necessarily expose

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:41.380
adjustments don't necessarily expose
 

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.370
adjustments don't necessarily expose
those to the users but you know well one

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:44.380
those to the users but you know well one
 

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.510
those to the users but you know well one
of my favorite games is actor that does

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520
of my favorite games is actor that does
 

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.860
of my favorite games is actor that does
this is dead trigger you know I mean

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:46.870
this is dead trigger you know I mean
 

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:49.170
this is dead trigger you know I mean
like dead trigger has a slider and a lot

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:49.180
like dead trigger has a slider and a lot
 

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.970
like dead trigger has a slider and a lot
of with a lot of it a lot of GPUs it'll

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:50.980
of with a lot of it a lot of GPUs it'll
 

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.250
of with a lot of it a lot of GPUs it'll
detect and it'll say you're guaranteed

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:53.260
detect and it'll say you're guaranteed

to work at the lowest quality only but

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:54.970
to work at the lowest quality only but
 

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:56.820
to work at the lowest quality only but
you can slide it over and you can save

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:56.830
you can slide it over and you can save
 

00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:58.050
you can slide it over and you can save
and turn on effects and you can see what

00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:58.060
and turn on effects and you can see what
 

00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.490
and turn on effects and you can see what
happens and sometimes it may just crash

00:55:59.490 --> 00:55:59.500
happens and sometimes it may just crash
 

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.020
happens and sometimes it may just crash
the game you know when you when you when

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:01.030
the game you know when you when you when
 

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.250

you actually try to run the game with
 

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.840
you actually try to run the game with
everything turned on but at least the
