vaccinations and what do we do about it

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520
vaccinations and what do we do about it
 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.160

well first of all I think there's a gene

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
well first of all I think there's a gene
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.980
well first of all I think there's a gene
I think there's a gene for a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
I think there's a gene for a
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.820
I think there's a gene for a
superstition a gene for hearsay a gene

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
superstition a gene for hearsay a gene
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.790
superstition a gene for hearsay a gene
for magic a gene for magical thinking

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
for magic a gene for magical thinking
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.100
for magic a gene for magical thinking
and I think that when we were in the

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110
and I think that when we were in the
 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.560
and I think that when we were in the
forest that gene actually helped us

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
forest that gene actually helped us
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.010
forest that gene actually helped us
because nine times out of ten that gene

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020
because nine times out of ten that gene
 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.160
because nine times out of ten that gene
was wrong superstition didn't work but

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
was wrong superstition didn't work but

one time out of ten is saved your butt
that's why the gene is still here the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
that's why the gene is still here the
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.309
that's why the gene is still here the
gene for superstition and magic now
