00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:06.770
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.660
It's my great
pleasure to introduce

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.150
a good friend and former
neighbor Steve LeVine.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.940
Just to make sure
we're on the same page,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.050
this is Steve LeVine the
author, not the Steve Levine

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.530
the record producer, who
worked with the Beach

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.400
Boys, The Clash, and of course
who could forget Culture Club.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.460
He is not, of course, Steve
Levine the RE/MAX real estate

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.050
agent, nor Steve Levine the
professor of soil and waste

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.735
resources at Wisconsin.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.000
Go Badgers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.620
Or even the owner of Steve
LeVine's Exotic Dancers

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.680
in Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.410
No, we are here to
listen to Steve LeVine

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.220
the author, the war
correspondent, the Washington

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.240
correspondent for the
online news zine courts,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.950
the adjunct professor
at Georgetown,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.620
and dare I say, the
intellectual Steve LeVine.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.350
I believe I introduced
him the first time

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.310
he spoke here back in
2007 when he talked

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.960
to us about his first book,
"The Glory and the Oil,"

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.790
the story of how the oil
industry came into being.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.400
In a strange way, or
perhaps not so strange,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.170
this book about batteries
is very closely related

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.070
to some would even say
the same logical successor

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.560
to the first book.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.240
I'm anxious to hear more about
this very relevant topic.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.560
So without much
further ado-- wait,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.400
did I mention that he was
some sort of senior fellow

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.430
at the Hoover Institute?

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.350
No, I guess it was
just a visiting

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.920
fellow at the international
studies at Stanford.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.110
OK.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.220
I also know from
your Wikipedia page

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.580
that you're the Future Tense
Fellow at the New America

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.420
Foundation.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.280
Future Tense Fellow.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.600
Kind of makes it hard to
talk about history, isn't it?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.920
Anyways, without much
more further ado,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.385
I'd like to welcome back
to Google Steve LeVine.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:17.260
STEVE LEVINE: Thanks.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.200
Thanks, [? Carl ?].

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.950
Good afternoon.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.270
Thanks very much, again,
for having me at Google.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.330
It is true that there are
a lot of Steve LeVines

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.340
out there, including in
Bethesda, Maryland, where

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.840
I live.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.090
And there's a Steve
LeVine who has

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.990
the slot at the dry cleaner,
at the coffee shop, and so on.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.100
Google, in fact, has let
the other Steve LeVine have

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.480
the good Steve LeVine
email address, leaving me

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.280
with stevlevine.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.790
I hope after this, you guys
could do something about that.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.230
Why did I write a
book about batteries

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.020
is the first question that
I got the whole way along

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.090
and that I continue to hear.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.420
I came upon the topic in 2010.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.170
I got interested in
batteries, and I'll

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.680
tell you why in a second.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.810
But when I rolled out this
idea to my wife, to my agent,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.290
to my friends, first thing
I heard was from my wife

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.860
over dinner who said
what a boring topic.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.060
Hard B, insulting,
right there in my heart.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.870
And my agent, when I sent out a
proposal to him on this topic,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.460
didn't reply, didn't reply
to several emails, in fact.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.470
And my friends just said,
go do something else.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.320
It was just nothing there.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.380
But if everyone
can remember back

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.900
how they felt in
2010, remember, right

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.400
after the financial
crash, and a lot of us

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.810
were blindsided by the crash.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.586
Almost blew up the
global financial system.

00:04:18.586 --> 00:04:22.680
A lot of people lost their jobs.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.100
Remember, this reverberated
after the real estate crash,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.600
after the dot com crash.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.870
And there really
was this feeling,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.180
can the United States
create a real economy

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.800
not based on
shenanigans, not based

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.830
on a price bubble on an
exotic mortgage instrument?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.450
And there were
really some doubts.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.170
I had doubts.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.310
And remember, globally,
the United States system,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.910
the US system, suffered a
real black eye to this day.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.290
But then especially,
there's a lot

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.760
of doubt about the United
States and the US projecting

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.990
and exporting its system abroad.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.010
What is this system
that you are championing

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.710
that blows up the whole
global financial system?

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.580
In that atmosphere,
a lot of attention

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.450
came on to the
battery, the whole idea

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.290
that you might be able to
take the ordinary battery

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.090
off the shelf that we
buy in the supermarket

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.180
and create from it a
super battery, something

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.520
that would be three,
four, five times as

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.700
powerful, and from
that, enable a bunch

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.400
of other industries--
electric car industry,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.150
enable solar and wind.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.210
Obama said he
embraced the battery.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.920
We're going to put 1 million
electric cars on the road.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.890
China embraced the battery.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.202
Argentina France, Germany,
UK, one after the other.

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:12.160
And what I discovered--
I stopped at the number

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.990
20-- 20 countries.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.370
I started with the big ones and
worked my way down the list.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.090
All of these 20 countries
in one way or another,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.110
either in batteries or
in electric cars, hoped

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:35.630
to own the future of the lithium
ion battery, or electric cars.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.270
Their hopes, all of them
saw some future piece

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.290
of a new, real economy would
be occupied by batteries,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.570
or by the electric car.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.280
And this was a big thing for me.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.030
This was an exciting
find, something

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.060
that I knew, for example, that
I could sell to my editors

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.890
as a story.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.960
But then the other thing that
caught my attention about this

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.670
is that if the forecast were
accurate, if batteries did turn

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.320
into 10s of billions
of dollar industry

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.900
by 2020 or in the 2020s and
hundreds of billions of dollars

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.430
in the 2030s, these are
the size of companies

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.970
that drive the economies.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.570
This is the size
when you're selling

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.850
in the hundreds of
billions of dollars

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.830
that a moderate economy
can build itself on.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.930
And for the space that I work
in, which is geopolitics,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.530
I'm looking for how energy will
impact the power of nations,

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.140
the wealth of nations.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.550
That was a big thing.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:55.180
So you could see how if-- name
your country in that group--

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.590
really did capture, really
did invent a super battery,

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.190
really did enable electric
cars and solar and wind,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.900
you could see how geopolitics
could be impacted.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.160
In 2010, we didn't know what
that shale oil was going

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.880
to come upon us,
but look at what

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.700
we're watching right now, what
we've seen over the last eight

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.370
months.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.830
So we've seen 4
million barrels a day,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.660
4 million barrels a day of
shale oil come onto the market

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.900
and cut the price
of oil in half.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:35.530
As a result, Vladimir Putin,
Russia has been undercut.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.200
OPEC has been thrown into chaos.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.350
This is what I was looking
at in 2010, that batteries,

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.180
if you were able
to make this jump,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.075
then you would have
this impact on nations.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.590
One of the things I also
saw-- that captured me.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:01.690
That captured my attention,
and I wanted to do that book.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:07.440
Another thing that I saw
was that Exxon, Exxon Mobil,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.070
who produces every
year a forecast,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.500
25 year forecast of the future,
and their outlook, what was

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.660
coming 25 years down the road.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:26.050
So in Exxon's perspective,
in the year at that time,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.810
they were looking
at the year 2035,

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.180
electric cars made
up 1% of the sales,

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.360
1% of the sales of new
cars on the global market.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.590
And the reason was that between
now and then, over 25 years,

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:51.000
battery scientists would make
no progress, zero progress.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.320
And the same thing when
you little flip the pages

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.380
and looked at stationary, at
electricity, solar and wind

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:07.020
had exactly the same place
in the Exxon mobile forecast,

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.910
that by the year 2035-- they
use the term intermittency,

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.800
that because the sun
doesn't shine all the time,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.840
and wind doesn't
blow all the time,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.680
and you can't store the
electricity from solar

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.750
and wind, that in the year 2035,
solar and wind also would have

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.260
just this very slender slice.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.730
And I looked at that and I
thought, that's impossible.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:40.010
How is it possible that 25 years
from now, scientists working

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.670
on batteries makes zero impact?

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.150
And so what appealed
to me about that

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.655
was how the incumbents, the
gigantic incumbents like Exxon

00:10:52.655 --> 00:10:59.060
Mobil were taking this gigantic
risk that oil held exactly

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.920
its same place in our
society in transportation,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.830
other technologies-- batteries--
made no progress at all.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:16.639
So I was in-- this was a topic
that I was going to go after.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:18.180
What I didn't want
to do is, I didn't

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.550
want to present it
as a policy book,

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.890
as a wonk sort of
survey of batteries.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.170
I didn't want to, for example,
look at every electric car.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.260
I didn't want to do Elon Musk.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.910
What I wanted to do was, since
I understood that there was

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.170
a race among
nations, 20 nations,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.650
to make the big
break here, I wanted

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.870
to find who is America's
team in this race?

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.890
If there's a race on, then
there must be an American team.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.760
And I looked around, and
I found the closest thing

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.210
to that, which is at
Argonne National Lab.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.810
Argonne National Lab, it's
one of the 17 national labs.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.460
It's outside Chicago.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.230
This is the first one.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.200
This is where
Enrico Fermi in 1942

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.920
made the first self sustained
nuclear chain reaction,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.380
and that led to the
Manhattan Project.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.080
It's mostly a nuclear lab, but
they had-- around the world,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:29.200
there are 12, 20 certified,
recognized battery geniuses,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.490
and two of them are at Argonne.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.790
Their stuff is in
the Chevy Volt.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.730
So what I could see there is
that this was a place where

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.680
they weren't doing
just abstract stuff,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.290
that Argonne had
already commercialized.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.280
So I went over there.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.630
I flew out there.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.710
I did a magazine
story, and it coincided

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.890
with the visit,
exactly the same day,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:02.160
of China's minister of science
and technology Wan Gang.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:11.910
And so I witnessed the head
of China's battery team,

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.340
battery and electric car
team, and America's team

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.200
in the same room
at the same time

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.960
speaking, and going
around the lab,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.410
and interviewing
the American side.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.960
Jeff Chamberlain, who's the
head of the battery department

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.340
and the chief
character in the book,

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.820
described the competition to me
at that time, the competition

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:43.480
to be first to make the super
battery, as a battery war.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.810
Argonne, his team,
was at war with China,

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.930
and he was at war with Wan Gang.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.850
And I went to Wan Gang.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.040
And I asked him-- and I didn't
use the word war with him--

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.590
but I asked him, are
you in a battery race?

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.760
Are you in a race with
the United States,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.470
with other nations?

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:06.550
And he said that he was
too, that China was too.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:13.780
And so the way I frame this
is this is-- I ended up

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.400
spending two years in that lab.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:21.880
I ended up negotiating an NDA,
a non-disclosure agreement,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.120
with Argonne that
allowed me to sit

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.220
as a fly on the wall in
that lab for two years

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.650
and watch this team attempting
to create the super battery.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:41.080
And the idea was that
to take ordinary people

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.740
into the lives of battery
scientists, people who they

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.380
wouldn't ordinarily meet,
and make them understand

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.090
what are the challenges.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:55.420
And so why don't we
have a super battery?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.140
Battery was invented
in the year 1799.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.720
Alessandro Volta invented it.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.080
Why after more
than two centuries

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:11.830
have battery scientists failed
to create energy storage that

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.370
allows us to do away
with fossil fuels,

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:21.370
for example, to
store solar and wind?

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.390
There are a few reasons
that I discovered,

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.980
and maybe this is
the biggest takeaway

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.310
that I found when I
was there, and that

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:36.300
was how hard it is to
stuff more electrons safely

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.410
into a small space.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:46.500
We are accustomed after the
lives we've led to Moore's law.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.050
We think that every
year and a half,

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.280
the performance
of our technology

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.350
ought to double in performance.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.400
The reason we get that, the
reason that chips do that,

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.700
is that when silicon
engineers, when

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.630
they build the architecture on
a silicon wafer, when they come

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.120
back the next morning, the
atoms, the architecture

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.650
that they have put
in place at that time

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.590
aren't exactly
where they left it.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.090
The opposite with
battery scientists.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.400
So in the book,
what you find out

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.690
is that they're
dealing with chaos.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.290
So the idea, what
they're working on,

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.080
is to take that battery
that they put into the Volt

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.760
and to apply more voltage
to it, to zip it up.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.080
So they're dealing
with 3.3 volts,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.140
and they want to zip
it up to 4.7 volts.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.060
When they do that
at the cell level,

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:52.540
this creates the capacity of
that battery just balloons.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.430
They end up creating
the super battery.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:03.000
The trouble is, when they try to
scale that up, mayhem happens.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.280
The atoms inside the
cathode in that battery

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.630
just move everywhere.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.339
The manganese goes over here.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:12.640
The cobalt goes over there.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.660
The oxygen up.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:20.720
And the material utterly
and fundamentally changes

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.410
into something else.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:27.800
The battery scientists find
what they're having to do

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.450
is try to figure out how
to make those atoms stay

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:36.770
in the same place, a challenge
that silicon engineers never

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.680
face.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:49.110
And so their challenge
is how do you tame chaos?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:54.590
One thing, a big realization
that they make partway

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.370
through these two years-- and
this happens in the book--

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.910
is they discover that everything
they're doing is wrong.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.290
Every avenue that they're
trying to go down,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.030
every path that
they are going down

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.250
and that every battery scientist
they know of in the United

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.360
States and around the world,
every solution being tried,

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.000
at least publicly, is wrong,
and they need to start over.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.166
This is a moment that
I've never heard of.

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:30.880
I know of no other
case, at least

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.780
publicly, where a scientific
or a technological venture

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.670
basically announces publicly,
because it did become public,

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.320
that they failed.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.850
We failed.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.350
We recognize we
failed, and we're

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.530
going to start over again.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.780
And the way they
started over again

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.150
was-- it goes back
to Steven Chu.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.650
So Steven Chu, the
Nobel Prize winner

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:01.520
at that time, the Secretary of
Energy, and former Bell Labs

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:08.880
guy, he decides that he's
going to recreate Bell Labs.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.550
He calls them Bell Lablets.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:19.640
He's going to fund them, $120
million each, for five years

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.960
to undertake one big task.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:29.580
And one of these Bell Lablets
ends up established at Argonne.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.200
And the book then
takes you inside

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.030
as they go about, as
these scientists starting

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.450
from scratch at the
fundamental level,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.970
they discover that they don't
even understand the lithium ion

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.320
battery was invented in
1980, commercialized in 1991.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.460
It's been a long time.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.820
They don't even understand
at a fundamental level,

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.320
at the atomic level, what's
going on inside that battery.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.240
So they have to start
from scratch on that.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.820
Another thing that happens
in the book, a reality

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:10.060
of technology and science
but especially of batteries,

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.640
I don't have to tell you that
technology and science are

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.310
a preserve of
exaggerators, hypesters,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:26.730
folks who claim stuff,
performance breakthroughs, that

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.680
are not true.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.000
But batteries are a special
preserve of this fact.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.600
This goes back to
Thomas Edison, 1920s.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.020
He said that when he was trying
to master the electric car,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:48.160
and he's trying to hire battery
guys who will supply him

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.660
with a nickel based battery that
will enable his electric car,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.180
and throws up his hands after
a number of years and says,

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.520
there's something about
s rechargeable battery

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.385
that turns people into liars.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:12.100
I sat in that lab,
Argonne, for two years,

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.350
finished all that research.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.860
I had written 2/3 of
the book, embarked

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.880
on writing the last part.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.250
It's all mapped out.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.730
I know what the ending is going
to be, big Hollywood finish.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.690
And I get a phone call.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.350
One of the main sources on whom
I've been relying, especially

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:39.390
for the big Hollywood finish,
had been deceiving everybody.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:48.160
He had wildly exaggerated the
performance of his battery.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.730
And he totally
undermined my book,

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.560
for one thing, which
is what I cared about.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:02.690
But he messed up the plans of
a big commercial player, GM.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.960
And also, he
deceived Washington,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:13.240
the Department of Energy,
ARPA-E, everybody was shocked.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.290
I was shocked personally
and in disbelief.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.590
But this is just reality.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.660
When that happened, it ended
up making, once I recovered

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:32.950
and my heart stopped beating
so fast, this is reality.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.050
This, the fact
that that happened,

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:40.580
made this a more honest book.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:45.440
So I want to close with just
sort of the book itself, again,

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.490
is the story--
you're in this lab.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.954
But I want to just do a
little bit where are we going?

00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:52.120
What's going to happen next?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.380
Well What's possible next?

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.110
And just very, very short.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.500
So looping back to
that Exxon Mobil study,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.990
so they've produced
another study.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.750
They've updated.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.400
Now they're up to
2040 from 2035.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.310
And it's the same forecast.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.390
The same forecast.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.160
Again, electric cars,
plug-in hybrids, fuel cells,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:20.725
these all together by the
year 2040 make up less than 5%

00:23:20.725 --> 00:23:24.090
of new car sales, all
of them thrown together.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.760
And again, solar
intermittency is this problem.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.770
Solar and wind do
not make-- you end up

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.290
with 20 times the market.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.360
But again, they don't make
the big break into the market

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.570
because there's no battery
to store their stuff.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.150
So let me give you my take.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.950
First on electric cars.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.720
I think that what
you are doing here,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:55.580
the self driving technology
that's being developed,

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.760
Elon Musk, the construction
of the gigafactory,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.550
especially his announcement that
he's going to have a 200 mile,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:09.050
$35,000 car in the year 2018.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:14.070
And simultaneously, GM,
we're going to have the Bolt.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.460
Elon Musk's, called
the Model 3, and GM,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:23.410
we're going to have the
Bolt in the 2018 model year,

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.960
meaning we're going to come
out with it in the year

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.100
2017, also $35,000.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.650
This is an inflection
point for the electric car,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.030
and it is for a couple reasons.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.460
One, we don't know what's
the mental switch where

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.440
people lose range anxiety?

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.580
Is it that they can drive
100 miles on a charge?

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.450
Is it 200 miles?

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.140
Is it 300 miles?

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.880
Is it 350 miles?

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.980
We don't know that answer,
but 200 miles is pretty far.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.680
I think that that's
a good distance.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.800
BMW 3 Series, the low
end luxury car, this

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.800
is Elon Musk's target.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.730
I am going to go after
those 500,000 people who

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:18.210
buy a 3 Series every year.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.350
I'm going to sell them my Tesla.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.880
Well they're paying the
base price for that car.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.890
The 3 Series is $33,000.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.380
So this means that
in the year 2018,

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.590
if Musk can produce his car--
he's been late in the past

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.380
so probably will be late
again, say 2019, 2020.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.850
Somewhere in that time frame,
he produces this car. $35,000,

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.020
probably after subsidies.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.390
But it means that you,
everyone in this room,

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.930
can walk into a showroom
and agnostically

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:59.260
compare Tesla Model 3, all
electric, and the 3 Series BMW

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.180
side by side.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.690
You can pick electric or
combustion side by side.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.930
This is the sweet spot.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.090
This is where you want it.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.990
You want people choosing
to drive electric

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.870
according to taste.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.825
So I already saw that
as the inflection point

00:26:17.825 --> 00:26:19.480
for electric cars.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.420
But now, we have this word.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.540
"Wall Street Journal,"
"Bloomberg," "Financial Times,"

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.150
all of them have
reported that Apple

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.160
is producing an electric
car, is developing one.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.010
And we have the story
yesterday that they're

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:42.060
poaching engineers, top battery
engineers, and electric car

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.020
engineers from A123.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.020
It was a very important American
startup battery company.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.340
It was the biggest
IPO in the year 2009.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:00.380
We don't know whether Apple
incubates products and does not

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.920
always market them, but
they're serious about it.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.460
They've got hundreds of
people working on this car.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:14.000
I think that if Apple-- I think
it wants to take on Elon Musk.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.810
When you have Musk, when you
have the Tesla facing Apple,

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.740
this is its real competition.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.670
This is critical mass.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.810
It's, again, an inflection
point, an inflection point.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.660
That's the beginning of the
electric age on the car side.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.410
And then on the grid side,
on the power systems,

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.940
I've been doing a
number of interviews

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.440
around here in the Bay
Area with companies

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.470
that are creating large lithium
ion batteries for homes--

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:55.910
for your homes, businesses,
malls, factories, and the idea

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:03.310
being that you can cut your
power bill by up to 80%.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.200
They're forecasting that people
go entirely off the grid.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.960
And maybe some die
hards will, but I

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.380
think mainly, you
stay on the grid

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.055
but you cut your electricity
use by up to 80%.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.570
This is happening.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.960
This is happening
in live time now,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:30.840
and the forecasts are that
over the next 8 to 10 years,

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.050
the grid level storage,
utility storage,

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.710
you putting these
batteries into your home

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.480
in order to cut electricity
costs, not because you want

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.770
to be green, not
because you want

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:47.460
to look good to your friends,
but for financial reasons

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.000
that this takes off.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.610
And the forecast,
Citibank forecasts

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.900
that this business storage
for your home, for your homes

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.450
and for businesses, becomes
a $400 billion a year

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.130
business by the year 2030.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.570
This is very, very large.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.870
This is larger than
Exxon Mobil, for example.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:18.150
And just to close out
in this same forecast,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:23.060
Citi forecasts that
countries like Saudi Arabia,

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.130
like Japan that burn oil in
order to create electricity,

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.520
that they install batteries.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.480
They install these large
lithium ion batteries

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.540
in their electricity system.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.930
And they're using whatever.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.400
They're using solar, or
they're using nuclear,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.850
or they're burning
natural gas, but they're

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.470
storing what they're getting.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.810
They're cutting,
they're peaking.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:52.680
They're burning.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.560
Those countries are
burning, according to Citi,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:03.780
4 million barrels a day less
oil than they currently are.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.280
So therefore, global
daily demand for oil

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.150
drops by 4 million
barrels a day.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.380
That's precisely the volume
that has caused this turbulence.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.580
It's the volume of
shale oil that's

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.010
come on to the market
over the last three years

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.170
that's caused this
turbulence, this disruption

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.510
in global geopolitics.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.170
And so the next
thing, the last thing

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:34.400
to understand is that this
battery driven age that's

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.590
coming, that I think is coming
over the next few years,

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.800
is going to shake up
geopolitics in the same way

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.000
that shale oil has.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.540
And if shale oil
stays in the market,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.630
if it's not just a
blip, that you're going

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.540
to have this compound impact.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.150
And we're going to have a
thrilling coming decade, decade

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.127
and a half.

00:30:58.127 --> 00:30:58.960
Thank you very much.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.880
If anyone would like
to ask anything.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.380
AUDIENCE: So it's
kind of technical,

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.796
but I wonder if
you can answer it.

00:31:08.796 --> 00:31:11.940
When you were talking about
how the batteries, when they

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.360
amp them up to 4.7
volts, that the structure

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.070
inside the battery no
longer stays the same,

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.430
it's being torn by all these
electromechanical forces

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.770
inside, are you talking
about the structure

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.310
of the electrolyte
instead of the battery?

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:33.150
Is that the material that's
not maintaining its structure?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.550
It's the cathode.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:43.060
So in this case, they're using
NMC, nickel manganese cobalt.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.940
It's pretty stable chemistry.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.230
It's, again, it's
the stuff in the Volt

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:55.740
and it's the stuff that GM
is going to use for the Bolt.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:03.240
And what happens is that the
lithium begins to shuttle.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.950
The lithium leaves the cathode,
goes over to the anode,

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.910
leaving all that space open.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.660
And in that nanosecond
when that happens,

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.990
oxygen somehow is lost.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.910
They don't know how and why,
but the oxygen-- and they

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.520
don't know where it goes either.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.660
But when that happens,
the cathode goes haywire.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.220
And the way that I
explain this is--

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.690
the way of looking at this--
first, the thing that happens

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:38.700
is that in that moment, those
molecules-- the manganese

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.880
especially, but the nickel too--
become unhappy in the slots

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.920
where they are.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.810
And they just start
moving around.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:54.270
And just for those
trying to picture it,

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:59.680
it's as dramatic a move as
if you drove home tonight

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.220
and your garage is in the
attic, and the front room is

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:10.550
in the bathroom, and your
bathroom is in the backyard.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.030
Everything has
changed its place.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:17.470
And it's so serious
that it makes

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.370
the material at that
level-- and that's

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:23.625
the level where you want to
create the super battery.

00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:24.500
It makes it unusable.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:34.060
They need to figure out how to
be able to go beyond 4.5 volts

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.540
to juice it up to 4.7 volts
and to make those atoms stay

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.510
in place.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.110
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.570
AUDIENCE: So I can see
how a super battery would

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.310
have a big effect
on the car industry.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.280
I mean, increasing range,
decreasing weight, et cetera.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.330
But what would the advantages be
for storage for intermittency?

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.980
I mean, why can't you
just use lithium ion

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.670
that we have right now?

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:01.480
STEVE LEVINE: Yeah.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.250
This is a good question.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.250
You don't need
the super battery.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:12.489
The battery, what's believed
is that lithium ion batteries

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:16.679
off the shelf that have already
been invented technologically

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.630
are there, but their
costs need to be cut.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.969
But that is a challenge you
can do on the factory floor.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.329
Elon Musk can do that in
the gigafactory-- scale

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:25.870
the thing up.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.750
You've got to cut
the costs in half.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.120
But no, you're right.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.199
The technology's there.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:36.010
AUDIENCE: One of
the other challenges

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.888
with a battery in a
vehicle is that you

00:34:37.888 --> 00:34:39.429
want to be able to
charge it quickly.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:40.940
So I have an electric car.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.080
It has a range of about 190
miles, and that's pretty nice.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.969
But heaven forbid I
take this somewhere

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:49.489
where there is no charging
facility available,

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:53.800
because then 110 volt plug
takes just shy of 48 hours

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.259
to charge it up.

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.550
STEVE LEVINE: You have a Tesla?

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.840
STEVE LEVINE: Yeah.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.720
And how long does it
take to get up to 80%?

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.912
AUDIENCE: Well, on 110
volt plug, about 36 hours.

00:35:03.912 --> 00:35:04.870
STEVE LEVINE: 36 hours.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.240
And when you're
using a supercharger?

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.586
Then it's much better.

00:35:07.586 --> 00:35:09.374
Then around like four.

00:35:09.374 --> 00:35:10.415
STEVE LEVINE: Four hours.

00:35:10.415 --> 00:35:10.670
AUDIENCE: Four hours.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.590
It's not bad then.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:17.520
STEVE LEVINE: This is something
that they need to address.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.720
What are the challenges?

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.850
What are the challenges
of the battery you want?

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.570
In your car, what do we want?

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.800
Americans, we want to go fast.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.900
We want to go fast when
we want to go fast.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.960
So you want to be able to
get on the freeway fast.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.270
You want to be able to pass
that jerk on the freeway fast.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:40.000
And then you want to-- I
didn't mean to call anyone

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.380
in this room a jerk.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.620
And you want to get
where you're going.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:51.490
You want to get wherever you're
traveling, 200 miles from here,

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.060
and back.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.670
And when you charge it, you want
to be able to charge it fast.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.060
And you want to be able to
do all that without the car

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.140
catching on fire.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.540
But habits are changing.

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.362
Young people are
driving-- when I grew up,

00:36:07.362 --> 00:36:09.570
you were 16 years old, you
got your driver's license,

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.050
you had to buy a car.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:12.510
You had to impress the chicks.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.840
That was how you
did with the car.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.260
And now, young
people, they're not

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.190
getting their-- a
lot of them-- are not

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.360
getting their licenses at 16.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.860
When they're getting
their licenses,

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.210
they're not buying a car.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.260
When they get a car,
they're not driving as far.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.200
And the other thing,
I think, to keep

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:41.160
in mind that contributes to why
Exxon Mobil is wrong is taste.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.449
Over the last, say,
five or eight years,

00:36:43.449 --> 00:36:45.740
when I walk into the office,
when I walk into my office

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.610
at Quartz, I'm
carrying under my arm

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.810
"Wall Street Journal,"
"Financial Times," "New York

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.730
Times," "Washington
Post," the print.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.230
I'm the only one.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:00.354
Everyone else, they don't
say it, but you know.

00:37:00.354 --> 00:37:01.520
I mean, some of them say it.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.640
That's disgusting.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.840
What you're doing-- and then
you just throw them away.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.280
You only read them
for 30 minutes.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:16.160
So in that same way that
my mother, 85 years old,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.050
doesn't get the
newspaper anymore.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:20.510
This is a big shift.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.910
And a lot of that is a
distaste-- of course,

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.180
one thing is convenience.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.780
The other thing is dead trees.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:33.280
And I think that there is
going to be an inflection

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.820
point at which, especially
when electric cars reach

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.540
this agnostic
pricing stage, that's

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.380
going to be the point at
which-- it's going to start

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.950
with young people--
but are disgusted

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.370
about the idea of burning
fossil fuels in their car.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:55.300
And it's not going to be one
of these feel good things.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.420
It's going to be
like newspapers.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.434
It's going to be
normal, not ideological.

00:37:59.434 --> 00:38:01.850
It's just going to be like--
for the same reason you don't

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.000
throw garbage out of your car.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.720
It just seems alien
that you would do that.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.720
That's what's going to happen.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.360
And it's going to bring
on-- I think it's logical.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.507
I cannot say flatly.

00:38:15.507 --> 00:38:17.590
All of these things where
you can't say it flatly,

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:20.350
but I think it's logical
that this happens.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.850
AUDIENCE: So about a year ago,
I was just driving a new car.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:23.960
And I test drove a Leaf.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.369
And you go to accelerate
on the freeway,

00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:27.910
and like you were
just talking, zoom.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:32.780
In And my what was about an
85 mile range on that car.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.800
And then 10 miles of that range
just evaporated in seconds.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:41.550
And so I was wondering when
these distances are quoted

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.150
when you're saying 200 miles,
or 190 miles an hour-- or sorry,

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.506
not in an hour-- 190 miles.

00:38:48.506 --> 00:38:50.380
What if you have a little
bit of a lead foot?

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.338
Or like you say, you want
to get in the freeway

00:38:52.338 --> 00:38:54.320
and you want to
pass, do you still

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.050
have that 190 on your Tesla?

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.995
And what kind of number?

00:38:57.995 --> 00:38:59.370
My understanding
is they're going

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.270
to quote the most
optimistic number you

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.480
can if you're the most
feather footed gentle driver

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.069
in the world.

00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:06.610
STEVE LEVINE: But
it's not just them.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.270
I mean, combustion cars
exaggerate the mileage

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.460
that they get.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.490
What's the real distance?

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.910
AUDIENCE: Well, if I drive it
in a normal way, let's say,

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.660
then 190 miles is roughly
what I get out of it.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.190
So commuting, it's fine.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:28.241
If you really boot it,
then it's around half.

00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:28.990
STEVE LEVINE: Wow.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.341
STEVE LEVINE: Yeah.

00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:32.650
AUDIENCE: But the thing
that's really most notable

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.570
is that, for example,
let's say you enjoy air

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.470
conditioning in the summertime.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.550
The battery needs
cooling on the car.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.550
So if you exercise any
high performance maneuvers

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.300
on the car, the ability
for it to air condition

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.790
the interior of
the car diminishes.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.630
So it's another
noticeable impact.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.208
And these are all just
properties of the battery.

00:39:53.208 --> 00:39:54.840
STEVE LEVINE: Yep.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.570
Let's go right here.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
I'm just wondering,

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.900
what do you think of fuel cells?

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.960
Is it a viable alternative
to the ion based battery?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.050
STEVE LEVINE: So the
question is about fuel cells.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:15.670
Toyota has decided that
fuel cells are the future.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.990
I'm not so sure.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.670
I know that Wan Gang, this
figure who I told you about,

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.750
the Chinese minister of
science and technology,

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:30.050
has the idea of combining the
upside of fuel cells, which

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.035
is that they instantly charge.

00:40:32.035 --> 00:40:34.470
You can charge them
in three minutes

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:38.760
but somehow have a small
fuel cell and a battery,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.830
have the distance.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:46.960
And the expense is much lower
for a battery and a fuel cell.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:53.310
Fuel cells still at this
time cost $75,000 in a car.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.760
So the car, fuel cell car right
now-- the Mirai, Toyota Mirai,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.880
they're selling it for $57,000.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.190
Costs them an estimated
$100,000 to make.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.720
Anyway, so the idea is that you
can somehow combine these two.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.380
A pure fuel cell car, I
think, is an even longer shot

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.070
than a battery
driven, pure electric.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.590
But somehow, the jury is out.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.140
Can you somehow combine that?

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.180
Or you didn't mention
super capacitor.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.570
Can you install a super
capacitor with a battery

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.140
and get that
acceleration so you don't

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.880
need as large of a battery?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.110
When you want to lead foot it
to get around the jerk factor,

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:43.140
you can use that juice
from the super capacitor.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.320
AUDIENCE: Question about
the rare earth elements.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.910
Is that just a thing today
and that's not an issue,

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.180
or is that a real problem
for these batteries?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.910
STEVE LEVINE: Rare
earth companies

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:05.320
are selling themselves-- or
have been selling themselves--

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:10.220
as an electric car play, which
has misinformed a lot of people

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.882
about the role of rare earths.

00:42:12.882 --> 00:42:18.160
There's a little bit of rare
earths in an electric car,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.760
but it's really much-- so no.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.860
It's not an issue.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.285
And then lithium itself,
lithium is recyclable.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.360
So one thing that we don't
have with the electric car

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.615
is a challenge of where
do we get the minerals.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.820
Cobalt is very expensive.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.930
There is a challenge.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.090
Reduce the component
of the cobalt.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.785
Try to put in more manganese.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:51.110
So not an issue.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.530
Not an issue.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.620
AUDIENCE: So obviously,
big oil has a lot

00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:00.860
to do with the
advances that batteries

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.820
can have since they hold
a lot of their control

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.490
over the industry.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:11.280
What are your thoughts
on how that will change,

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.380
because obviously, they
have a lot of lobbying power

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.260
in Washington.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.990
So a lot of regulations
aren't going

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:23.720
to be set to encourage
further R&amp;D with batteries.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.470
STEVE LEVINE: OK.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.550
And then--

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.320
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering, if you're

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.860
talking about using
batteries for power supply,

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.840
do they actually take
a significant amount

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.137
of their output to produce
in the first place?

00:43:37.137 --> 00:43:38.970
Like, how much net yield
are you getting out

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:43.800
of these current
lithium ion batteries?

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.550
STEVE LEVINE: OK.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.840
So let me start here.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.760
Exxon Mobil invented
the precursor

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.950
to the lithium ion battery 1973
when the Arab oil embargoes

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.490
happened, and then
the nationalizations.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.090
Exxon was producing 8
million barrels a day of oil.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.510
With the nationalizations,
that production

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.030
went down to just over
2 million barrels.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.760
So it really lost its
confidence that it

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:19.570
could continue at least at
its scale as a going concern.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.700
And it hired a couple
of battery geniuses

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.990
from Stanford,
actually, and invented.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.240
And two of them invented
the lithium battery.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.215
But it kept exploding.

00:44:29.215 --> 00:44:34.260
It kept catching fire in the
lab, and that was one downside.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.284
And the other thing
that happened over

00:44:37.284 --> 00:44:39.575
the years-- this was going
on for several years-- there

00:44:39.575 --> 00:44:44.860
was a lot of-- there
was a fever over this.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.550
A lot of people
became captivated

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.800
by the idea of what it can do.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.360
And then Ronald Reagan
came into the White House,

00:44:51.360 --> 00:45:00.930
and the renewable age was--
the subsidies for renewables

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:02.560
and the research was reduced.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:10.890
What I'm getting at
is that big oil can

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.550
play a big part in this age.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:18.930
I don't think that it
plays a blocking role.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.110
If this is going
to happen, I don't

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:26.050
think that those
incumbents can hinder it,

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:30.380
even though they-- I don't
think they're quite delusional,

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.450
but I think that's the tension.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:35.800
This is the tension
in the equation.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.030
Is Exxon Mobil right?

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.160
Or are these battery guys right?

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.090
And incidentally, just to
add one more dimension,

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:45.490
is Elon Musk?

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.780
Elon Musk, the
irony is that he's

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.350
bet against the battery guys.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.800
His formula is that battery
scientists, the guys who

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.530
I profile in my
book, don't succeed,

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:07.620
that the way to create
an electric car,

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.969
a competitive electric
car, is to take

00:46:09.969 --> 00:46:11.260
the stuff that's off the shelf.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.990
And he uses pretty much off
the shelf Panasonic battery,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.050
a little bit larger
than a double A battery.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:23.220
8,000 of them are
in the Tesla S.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:30.360
And engineers-- this ingenious
energy management system

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.800
that makes that car work-- and
then designs this incredibly

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:42.740
cool body with every technology
gizmo you could imagine

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.090
or ever want, he's bet.

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.280
So is he right?

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.360
He's essentially bet
with Exxon on that front,

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.880
not that the electric
car won't take off,

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.720
but he's bet that the
battery guys won't succeed.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:03.550
Are they right, or
do we get a big leap?

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:07.490
I think this is
the tension there.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:11.550
If you use-- this
is the question.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.990
Basically, you're asking,
do you end up netting out?

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.650
Do you use more energy?

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:17.820
Yeah.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:18.740
Yeah.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.950
So if you're producing--
if the electricity going

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:27.160
into that battery is from solar,
then there's no percentage.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.240
It's 0%.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.780
The solar, the electricity
produced by the solar,

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:38.800
if you're producing-- and I
don't know the percentage-- how

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.760
does that balance out
the natural gas that's

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.281
burned to then produce
that electricity that

00:47:46.281 --> 00:47:48.530
then goes into the battery
that's stored that then you

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:49.530
use?

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:55.800
I do know that the estimates are
that your electric bill drops

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.740
a lot.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.800
But this would be an
interesting thing to get,

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.990
right the-- and I would guess
that the less efficient--

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:11.360
if you're burning coal, not only
would you get the pollution.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.450
So the whole process is in vain.

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.910
You're creating the same
impact with the environment

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:23.030
that you would anyway, but the
efficiency of coal is less.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:28.530
The logic tells me
that you would kind of

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:32.890
get very, very, very close to
a loss if you're burning coal,

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:34.084
but not with natural gas.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.380
Is that it?

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.140
All right.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.550
Thank you very much.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.050
[APPLAUSE]
