EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: First
off, I want to say, thank you

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.990
guys so much for coming today.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.690
I know it's getting
towards the end of the day,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.490
so thanks for coming to the
talk and having patience.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.395
My name is Eitan Marder-Eppstein
and I'm an engineering manager

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:20.280
on Daydream.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.500
And today, I want
to talk to you a bit

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.610
about virtual reality at Google.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.490
And what we're planning on
doing and, sort of, give you

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.850
a glimpse of the future.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.245
Unfortunately, the product
that I'm going to talk

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:34.953
about today isn't yet
available in China,

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:37.880
but it's something that
we want to make available.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600
And I want you guys to have
a preview of what's going on.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.840
So to get started,
this is Daydream.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.570
I guess, maybe, by a show
of hands, how many of you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.630
have seen Daydream before?

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.020
OK, pretty good.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.826
So Daydream is Google's
first mobile VR offering.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.520
It consists of a headset
paired with Google Pixel

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.830
put-ons in the controller.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
But it's going to be coming
to a lot more phones as well.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.210
So there's a Daydream compatible
spec that phones can meet

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.640
and they can come out.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.420
And compared to a lot of
offerings in the space,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.190
it's relatively cheap.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.243
So when you think about
buying a VR headset,

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:25.400
it can be very, very
expensive right now.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.840
And Google really wants
to bring VR to the masses.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.320
So we're offering
Daydream view, in the US,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
right now, as an add on to
the Pixel phone for $79.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.330
And it launched on November 10.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.750
So it's a relatively new
product in the space,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.900
but we're very excited
to see how it takes off.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.490
The rest of the
talk is going to be

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.590
about the platform, about
some of the developer tools,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.600
and about designing
for VR, which

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.800
I think is a unique challenge.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.290
And to start with,
you know, we've

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.607
already got a lot
of progress here.

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:02.815
There are already people
who have built applications,

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.940
and studios, and
close partners that

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.639
have released their applications
on the Daydream platform.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.980
So with Launch, we actually
have a number of apps out there.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.956
And I encourage you to go by
our booth and check some of them

00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:15.780
out.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.720
All right so, let's
start with the platform.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.720
I think Daydream
is unique in that,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.580
normally when we
talk about platform,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.590
we talk about some
piece of hardware.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.810
We talk about a new phone,
we talk about a new watch,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.340
we talk about a computer.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.060
But for Daydream, the
platform is really you, right?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.880
The entire point
of virtual reality

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.530
is to trick your
body and your senses

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
into believing that you're
somewhere that you're not.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.670
And when we do this,
one of the things

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.040
that's really,
really important is

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.180
trying to trick all of
your senses at once.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.890
So when you think about the
actual world, the real world,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.010
when I move my head
around, my inner ear,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.350
my vestibular system, actually
notices that I'm moving.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.780
There's fluid in
my ear that notices

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.060
that I'm moving my head.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.460
And, at the same time, my eyes
are tracking out in space.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.190
And my eyes also notice
that I'm moving my head.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.310
And the latency between
them, the delay,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.358
is zero milliseconds.

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:22.314
Right?

00:03:22.314 --> 00:03:26.167
As soon as I move my head, my
inner ear notices and my eyes

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:27.900
notice as well.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.700
But when you think about this
process for a cell phone,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.980
it's not quite the same.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.920
So, here, my inner ear
notices right away, again,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.460
that I'm moving my head.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.010
But now, before I
can update my eyes,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.650
before I can change what's on
the display in front of me,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.940
a bunch of stuff has to happen.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.600
So first there are inertial
sensors in the phone.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.460
Accelerometers and
a gyroscope, that

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.610
have to notice that the
motion is happening.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.520
Then I need to do some
processing on the CPU

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.720
to decide what
I'm going to draw.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.780
Then I need to actually
draw it on the GPU

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.730
and then that needs
to go to my eyes.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.050
And that all adds up.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.589
This is, sort of what you would
see on a traditional cell phone

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.240
processing pipeline.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.589
And here it's 85 milliseconds.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.470
So it adds up.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.080
What we know is that we
need to get this down

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.806
to below 20 milliseconds.

00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:31.320
So 20 milliseconds is
kind of that magic number.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.620
That time where your
inner ear and your eyes,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.750
even though there's a delay,
you don't actually notice it.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.990
It still feels good
and you don't get sick.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.951
And screwing this
up is really bad.

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:44.450
Right?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.850
Like we make people sick.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.520
Bad VR makes people sick.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.850
If you're sick in VR,
you're sick in real life.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.000
So we've done a lot of work
to get our motion to photon

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.480
latency, the time from when
you move your head to when

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.880
light enters your eyes, below
this magic 20 milliseconds.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.810
Another challenge that we
have in designing for Daydream

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.930
is that we have a mobile device.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.540
So on a mobile device you're
dealing with six or seven watts

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.670
of power draw.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.850
It's not a very powerful
desktop machine.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.440
You know, we're
competing, I guess,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.300
with these power plants
that draw over 600 watts.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.050
And so we have to
play a lot of tricks

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.190
and be very conscious in the
way that we develop applications

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.270
to make sure that we're hitting
these power requirements.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.050
And there's a lot
that we've done

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.990
there to help develop this out.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.460
So here are some of the things
that we've worked really,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.350
really hard on to
both reduce the power

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.080
requirements for Daydream as
well as to reduce the motion

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.910
to photon latency.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.590
So the first one is that
Daydream compatible phones

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.570
have low persistence displays.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.680
They have [INAUDIBLE]
displays that refresh very,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.030
very quickly.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.380
They also have very high
performance mobile CPUs

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.800
and GPUs.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.530
So the Pixel phone is using
Qualcomm's top of the line A20

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.810
processor.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.330
So we do as much
processing as possible

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.820
in a mobile form factor.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.800
And then the second,
or the third,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.910
piece is low latency sensing.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.620
So we want to know as
quickly as possible

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.820
when you've actually turned
your head to the left

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.280
or to the right, or up or down.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.780
And these are the
components that

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.280
make a phone Daydream ready.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.827
So we want to make sure
people don't get sick

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:35.440
when they use our products.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.180
And so we have this
specification where, you know,

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.397
you as a manufacturer need
to meet these requirements

00:06:41.397 --> 00:06:44.056
in order to build a
Daydream ready phone.

00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:49.370
The other thing that we've done
is we've worked really hard

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.270
in the Android N to
build into the platform

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.650
itself, mechanisms
for making sure

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.020
that Android is a really,
really high quality

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.130
platform for virtual reality.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.790
So the first piece of that is to
[INAUDIBLE] [? performance. ?]

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.560
Normally when you've got
your phone CPU, it spikes.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.020
It can go really high and
really high performance.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.720
And then it goes back low.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.660
And that's the normal way that
applications work on phones.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.920
They sort of need a
lot of performance

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.630
for a very short amount of time.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.810
But with VR, we're
changing that paradigm.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.030
And now you need
to be able to run

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.850
with a good amount
of performance

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.766
for a long period of time.

00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:34.890
And so we've introduced
sustained performance load,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.070
which throttles
the clock rate down

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.766
to give you overall more
performance than you

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:42.600
would have. and keep the
device from overheating.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.080
If you ran it at full
throttle all the time,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.930
the device would overheat
very, very quickly.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.390
And so we've built in mechanisms
to the operating system

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.180
itself to ensure
that you can run VR

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.252
experiences for a lot of time.

00:07:55.252 --> 00:07:58.770
The second piece that
we built into Android N

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.240
is very, very,
good head tracking.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.140
So again, very quickly
going from that sensor

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.850
to being able to give
your application a pose

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.730
of a person's head as it moves.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.470
And then the third piece is
that we've actually worked hard

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.027
with the Android team to build
a system UI that works in VR.

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:18.985
So when you think about
putting on a VR headset

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:22.530
with your phone, normal Android
doesn't make sense anymore,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.800
it's designed for 2D.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.860
But we've started to bring
pieces of Android into 3D.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:33.643
So that you can have a very
good and solid experience in VR

00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:37.506
in Android and we built
that into Android N itself.

00:08:37.506 --> 00:08:39.820
This took a lot of hard
work from the Android team

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.570
and our team and we're
excited to continue

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.640
this in future Android
releases as well.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.408
All right so here,
again, is the view.

00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:53.115
You take your phone to
use this, under the latch,

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.800
put the phone in
the view, there's

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.330
an NFC reader, in
the headset itself,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.800
that recognizes when
the phone is in.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.420
And then you're in VR.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.534
It also comes with a controller.

00:09:05.534 --> 00:09:07.710
And you can see
that this controller

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.720
has three buttons on it.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.790
So it's got a
clickable touchpad.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.230
So that's actually
touch sensitive

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.340
so you can swipe
and gesture on it.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.360
You can also press down.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.110
And then it's got these
two other buttons.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.390
So an app button that can be
used for application menus.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.200
And then a home button
that can get you

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.530
back to Daydream
home, which I'll

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.204
talk about in a little bit.

00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:32.940
The controller is also
really special in that it

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.835
provides a really
natural interface for VR.

00:09:35.835 --> 00:09:40.270
So it can track its
orientation as well.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.680
So inside of the
controller itself

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.040
are inertial sensors too.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.260
So there's a gyroscope
and accelerometers inside

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.890
of the controller.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.430
And this helps you understand
where it is in space.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.605
So you can use it
as a laser pointer.

00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:55.343
And we've also done
some work to hook it up

00:09:55.343 --> 00:09:58.762
to an [? arm ?] model to, kind
of, fake six degree of freedom

00:09:58.762 --> 00:10:01.660
motion in your applications.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.920
All right so, at that point,
you've got your controller.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.720
You put it on and you're
inside Daydream and--

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.115
slide changes.

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:14.300
This is what you see.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.795
So we've worked
really hard, again,

00:10:16.795 --> 00:10:20.830
to integrate Daydream
into Android itself.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.487
And we've got a deep
integration, also,

00:10:22.487 --> 00:10:26.986
with Google Play, so our store.

00:10:26.986 --> 00:10:28.820
And you can browse
content in VR.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.840
You don't have to leave
VR to browse content.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.220
You can decide which
apps you want to buy,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.140
you can see reviews from people.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.544
I mean, this all happens
without having to leave VR

00:10:41.544 --> 00:10:44.210
and it's all integrated to, sort
of, the same background that we

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.689
use normally at Google, which
is convenient for people.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.730
And then the other thing
that we've built into it

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.170
is in-app purchases.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.220
So we understand that
for a lot of developers,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.890
it's important not to just
follow a premium model where

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.470
you might get people to buy
your application upfront.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.660
But also to build
in-app purchases where

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.825
you can view premium models.

00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:09.200
And sort of take advantage of
the traditional monetization

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.750
techniques available
to you on Google.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.841
All right so that, in a
nutshell, is the platform.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.020
That's what we're delivering.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.713
Now I want to talk a little
bit about developer tools.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.380
All right, so for
Daydream, you're

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.440
inherently developing in 3D.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.670
It's an environment where you
have to create 3D content,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.240
offer it, and put it
out into the world.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.762
And so we offer a
couple of different ways

00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:41.830
to develop for the product.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.160
The first one is
Android, which is

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.620
what you're all familiar with.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.120
It's just stock
Android development.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.620
And this makes a
lot of sense if you

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.440
want to do your own 3D render.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.380
But we've also
work really, really

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.990
hard to provide integrations
with popular game engines.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.140
So the first one
is Unreal Engine,

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.390
and we've worked
with Epic on that.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.300
And the next one
is Unity Engine.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.600
And these engines allow you
to get very quickly started

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.730
with 3D content and
sort of bring it

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.396
into this virtual reality world.

00:12:11.396 --> 00:12:12.770
So I'm going to
walk through each

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.450
of these just really quick.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.020
And give you, like, the 30
second to a minute getting

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.633
started guide for all
of these different ways

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:23.170
you can develop for VR.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.140
So the first one
is the Android NDK.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.640
You'll want version 1.0.2 or
higher of Google's Android SDK.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.730
And you can get it on
GitHub right there.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.690
And this is kind
of how it looks.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.230
So here you can see we've
got our normal activity

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.810
in [? Java. ?] And we're
going to create a GL surface

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:51.080
view, the same way that we
would normally render open GL

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.910
contents in Androids.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.380
And above it, you'll see
there's something special where

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.160
we've created this GVR layout.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.030
So that's going to give
us access in native code,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.230
actually, to the
Google VR contents.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.890
And that's what
we'll use to interact

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.516
with the data-reading system
to get the information we

00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:10.578
need for virtual reality.

00:13:10.578 --> 00:13:12.420
Then the rest of it
is pretty standard.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.010
So on creation of
your service you're

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.070
actually going to call
through the JNI to native code

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.820
to hook it up to the rendering
engine of your choice.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.420
And then on draw
frame you're also

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.004
going to call through
the JNI to native code

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.770
to view the rendering work.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.272
And then at the bottom there,
there are just some settings.

00:13:30.272 --> 00:13:31.980
So one is setting scan
[? line raising ?]

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.710
to be enabled.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.480
So one of the things that we
can do to reduce the latency.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.400
Of VR is if you think
about how you write

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.840
pixels across the screen.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.560
It actually doesn't
happen all at once.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.190
There's kind of a line that
moves across the screen.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.060
And so we actually write
just after that line,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.590
so we're always following it.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.970
And writing directly
into that train buffer.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.120
And then we're just
going to say, OK,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.463
we're going to set this
surface view as the one we're

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:00.530
going to render.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.360
So then inside of
your native code,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.526
you'll remember there were
those two methods that we

00:14:04.526 --> 00:14:08.390
[? helped. ?] So, here, we
just initialize the GVR API.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.560
Google VR API.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.280
And then, you can see that it
will give you a recommended

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.520
render target size.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.100
So what this is doing is,
based on your configuration

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.420
of your viewer, it's
going to tell you what

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.760
size you need to render to.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.275
And this is important
because for VR,

00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:28.650
when you look
through the lenses,

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.690
you actually need to
see a distorted image.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.310
The lenses are really great
in that they sort of allow

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.630
you to see very far
away when the screen is

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.190
very close to you.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.220
But you have to apply
distortion to your image

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.580
in order to make it seem
like the world looks right,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.700
distortion-wise, when you
look through the lens.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.060
Then you just passed your render
target into your frame buffer

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.610
and then you're off and running.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.830
And then inside a
draw frame, you're

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.110
going to get the head pose,
again, from the GVR API.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.849
So you don't have to do any
work to get the head pose.

00:15:02.849 --> 00:15:03.890
You just get it for free.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.510
You know exactly where
the person is looking.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.260
You draw the left and
right eyes normally.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.430
You don't have to
apply any distortion.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.440
And then you'll
see, at the bottom,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.940
you actually call
this distort off

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.860
screen frame buffer to screen.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.870
So that, again, is using
the characteristics

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.900
of the lens based on the
rendered target size,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.000
as well, to view the
proper distortion.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.140
It just takes care
of things for you.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.950
It'll draw the image
properly on the screen.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.850
There are a couple
of initial settings

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.140
that you need to set
in your manifest.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.310
One is just to say, I
want to use VR mode.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.850
And the other one is to use
VR high performance mode.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.640
So before I talked about
sustained performance mode

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.860
in Android, this
way of throttling

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:51.650
the CPU to be able to get longer
running application times.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.670
And there are actually
two different modes.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.070
So one is high
performance, which

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.960
is good for games
and applications

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.140
where you're only going to be
running for 30 to 45 minutes,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.070
on average.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.790
And then the other one is
just sustained performance,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.626
and that will actually
run for an hour plus.

00:16:07.626 --> 00:16:09.792
So that's really, really
good for multimedia content

00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:12.319
and things like that.

00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.860
And then there's
one additional thing

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.620
that you can do in your
manifest, which is just to say,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.040
I am a VR app and I
am a Daydream app.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.560
and that will allow
you to show up in,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.660
sort of, the Daydream
home application.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.640
So that's Native.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.010
which is relatively
complicated, I

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.545
guess, compared to our
other integrations.

00:16:31.545 --> 00:16:35.230
So now, I'll talk about how you
get started with Unreal Engine.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.980
And this is much quicker.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.750
If you want, you can download
Unreal Engine 4.13 or later.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.330
And have Daydream built in.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.750
And you can go to the link
right there to find it.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.190
So in Unreal Engine,
you just select

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.690
that you want to use a plug-in.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.990
And then inside of
the plug-in's menu,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.680
you'll see that there are
a number of offerings.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.290
And you'll want to enable Google
VR and you'll want to, I guess,

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.739
deselect all of our
competitors that

00:17:05.739 --> 00:17:08.940
are also offered in Unreal.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.780
So you do that.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.255
And then you're going to
set, on your target hardware,

00:17:15.255 --> 00:17:18.720
you just want to make sure
that you select mobile tablets

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.720
and scaleable to the M3.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.670
And then there's
one setting that

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.619
is a little bit non-intuitive.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.950
So you're going to disable
the default touch interface.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.800
Because Unreal Engine has
a joystick, by default.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.170
And then you're going to
disable mobile HDR because it

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.090
interferes with the
stereo distortion

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.630
process that I described
in Native before.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.555
And then you just target
Android Level 24, so Android N,

00:17:44.555 --> 00:17:45.840
and you're off.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.680
That's it.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.030
Now you can use Unreal Engine
like you normally would.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.460
You place your camera and you
get VR rendering for free.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.660
Unity is equally simple.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.480
So for Unity there's a
technical preview that's out.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.415
And actually new versions of
Unity will have this built in.

00:18:04.415 --> 00:18:08.594
But you can find the technical
preview at this link.

00:18:08.594 --> 00:18:10.032
And for Unity--

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.380
So for Unity 5.6 or greater,
it will have this built in.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.380
So there you go to your
player settings menu,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.590
on the upper right.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.740
And you'll just select,
Virtual Reality Supported,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.420
there's just a check box.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.050
And then you select
Daydream from the drop down.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.180
And then there are some
additional parameters

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.680
you can set on your
[? desk buffer ?] format.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.660
You'll want to, again,
target the Android N APRs.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.670
And you're off.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.370
That's it.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.350
For Unity it's
very, very simple.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.730
You can build your application
as you normally would.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.780
And then you're off and running.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.790
So the next piece that I want
to talk about a little bit

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.560
is Designing for Daydream,
or for VR in general.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.996
I think that VR is a really
challenging and interesting

00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:08.650
space.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.215
And we actually have
more of an obligation,

00:19:12.215 --> 00:19:16.295
I think, to our users than
we do in other applications.

00:19:16.295 --> 00:19:18.980
I think in VR it's
very, very easy

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.005
to elicit an emotional
response from the people who

00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:23.130
are using your experiences.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.120
It's very easy to
frighten people

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.220
and it's also easy
to make people sick.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.000
So there are some
things to consider

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.290
when designing for Daydream
that I'll talk about.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.280
The first one is, I
think, you should really

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.390
forget that you're
using a phone.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.570
Normally, when
people use phones,

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.980
we think about them out, on
the go, at a coffee shop,

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.970
just very, very quickly checking
email or texting friends

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:54.060
or maybe playing a game on
the bus, something like that.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.965
But we actually have studies,
some early studies coming in,

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:01.820
about how people use VR.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.190
And, I think, that
what you'll see here

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:08.180
is that they're not actually
using their mobile VR

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.934
devices out at a coffee shop.

00:20:10.934 --> 00:20:14.185
They're using them in their
living room or their bedroom,

00:20:14.185 --> 00:20:15.710
they're using them at home.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.230
And then the other
thing to notice,

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.530
here, is that they're
actually using them

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.440
for a prolonged period of time.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.590
So you're not operating with
this couple of minute session.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.610
Now you're talking
about people using them

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.810
for 30 to 45 minutes, on
average, for playing games

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.190
or interactive experiences.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.360
And you're talking about people
using them for an hour plus,

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.860
when they're viewing
media content.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.740
So you actually have your users
in VR for a long, long time.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.096
And I think you should
almost think about VR as,

00:20:47.096 --> 00:20:49.860
sort of, reading a book
or telling a story.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.940
You have an opportunity
to engage with your users

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.390
for a long period of time.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.300
And that opens up different
possibilities for you

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.320
and sort of changes
how you design.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.510
It's not quite mobile design,
it's something in between.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.230
The second thing that I
think is really useful,

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.980
is that you should
use your hands.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.920
I think one of the
things that makes

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.105
VR so compelling, at least with
Daydream, is this controller.

00:21:17.105 --> 00:21:19.925
It really provides a
feeling of presence

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:22.897
to be able to interact with
your environment and point

00:21:22.897 --> 00:21:23.730
to different things.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.100
And again, you have a clickable
touchpad available to you,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.690
and you also have an app
button and a home button.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.200
You can actually make
use of the controller

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.730
and track how it's
moving through space

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.100
and change the interaction.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.290
And there are some
very, very clever things

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.610
you can do with the controller.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.278
So we've provided
some examples for you

00:21:45.278 --> 00:21:47.555
that you can download
off our developer site.

00:21:47.555 --> 00:21:50.750
But use the controller
to do things like scroll

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.500
through paginated
lists of image titles,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.570
if you want to do
video feedback.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.500
Or we've done a
number of experiments

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.840
about how we can actually
push the boundaries

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.039
in the [? key holder. ?]

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:05.830
So in the upper left,
you'll see that we're

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.942
using it to play mini
golf, just as a putter.

00:22:08.942 --> 00:22:11.180
In the upper right, we're
using it to navigate it

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.990
around the solar system.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.450
In the lower left,
we're, I guess,

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.800
flipping pancakes on the beach.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.150
And in the lower right, we were
hitting baseballs with a bat.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.932
So even though the controller
has relatively simple

00:22:22.932 --> 00:22:24.290
sensing in it.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.107
I think you can use it to create
really powerful and immersive

00:22:28.107 --> 00:22:29.377
applications.

00:22:29.377 --> 00:22:31.460
And it's something that
is a major differentiator,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.590
I think, for Daydream
over other VR platforms,

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.470
certainly in the mobile space
that are available to them.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.810
The other thing I want
to say about Daydream

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.500
is that you should really keep
your experiences comfortable.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.280
I was talking earlier
about how, you know,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.920
we have a great responsibility
when designing for VR.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.490
And Google has gone to
incredible amounts of effort

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.745
to make sure that the viewer
itself and the controller

00:22:57.745 --> 00:23:00.140
itself feels comfortable.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.390
So we realize that
this is in some ways

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.555
a mix between a phone
and apparel, in a way.

00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:07.180
And that is something
that you're going

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.660
to be wearing on your face.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.330
So we've taken great
care to design Daydream

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.665
with very soft materials that
feel good on your face, that

00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:17.900
fit over glasses,
as well, because we

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.681
know that a lot of
people wear glasses.

00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:21.055
And we've designed
the controller

00:23:21.055 --> 00:23:23.265
to fit in your
hands, to be light

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:25.610
and to be comfortable
in your hands.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.980
Another thing is that, I think,
a lot of us, when we work,

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.900
sit in chairs that
look kind of like this.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.240
And so it's very tempting to
design VR experiences that

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.975
are full 360.

00:23:39.975 --> 00:23:42.770
Because swivel chairs
are great for full 360.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.890
But the reality is
that most of our users

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.090
are sitting in chairs
that look like this.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.330
They don't actually
rotate around.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.330
And many people
use VR in bed and

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.120
in other comfortable settings.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.960
So when you're thinking about
designing VR experiences,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.290
then you kind of want
to think about a quarter

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.979
of a sphere in front of you.

00:24:01.979 --> 00:24:04.520
Like, what are the areas that
are comfortable for someone to,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.600
sort of, rotate around
in a seat and see.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.190
Rather than forcing them
to turn around awkwardly,

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:16.060
as if they're on a swivel
chair when they're not.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.780
And then there's motion.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.390
So this again gets
into this disconnect

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.625
between your inner
ear and your eyes.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:25.250
If you go into VR
experience and you just

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.770
start moving someone
very, very quickly,

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.010
it's a great way to
make them throw up.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.580
And so there are a few
different classes of motion

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.305
that actually are informing
users of when an app is

00:24:38.305 --> 00:24:39.320
submitted to the store.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.030
So the first one
is no motion where

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.400
you're just sitting in a chair.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.360
And you're, maybe, looking
at a screen in front of you

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.350
and you're not
moving very quickly.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.360
The second one is
moderate motion,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.036
maybe you're moving
at a walking speed.

00:24:52.036 --> 00:24:53.830
And this tends to be OK.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.360
People can tolerate this.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.466
But the third one
is extreme motion

00:24:57.466 --> 00:24:58.965
where you're flying
and moving very,

00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:00.530
very quickly through space.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.160
And I think that especially when
you get into the third piece,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.750
it's really important to apply
techniques like tunneling, so

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.350
teleporting from one place
to another or, sort of,

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.370
collapsing the field of view.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.510
So you just have one point in
front of you that's moving fast

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.640
and the rest of the
scene is stable.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.620
And we're working
to release tools

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.340
that will help you, as
developers, build experiences

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.820
that are comfortable, even
you're moving into these more

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.900
and more intense motion realms.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.800
And then another last
piece of designing for VR

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.270
is that you can make
people really afraid.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.380
I don't know how many
of you have been in VR

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.880
and tried to step off
the edge of the cliff.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.500
But many people have a fear of
heights and they just cannot do

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.159
it.

00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:46.200
They cannot step forward.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.750
So that's one.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.870
You can also feel
very, very awkward

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.220
when a virtual object
intersects your physical body.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.200
You look down and
you're very confused,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.510
it's just feels wrong.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.530
You can make people feel
very claustrophobic.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.333
You can make people
feel agoraphobic

00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:04.840
where there's a huge
space in front of you

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.980
and it's disconcerting.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.070
Being stabbed in VR is not fun.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.410
You actually feel a
response even though nothing

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.680
happens to you actually.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.800
And being crushed in VR is also
a very, very scary experience.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.061
So these are things
that might be

00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:21.560
fun to just try and experience
to see what your reaction is.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.450
But it's not something
that you want

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.720
you do to your ultimate user.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.782
And then the last
piece that I think

00:26:28.782 --> 00:26:32.300
everyone forgets with VR is
just how powerful audio is.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.314
So when you think
about rendering a tree,

00:26:36.314 --> 00:26:38.730
you can think about rendering
this very, very high quality

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:39.350
tree.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.840
You want to give the idea that
the tree is actually there,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.680
that the wind is blowing
through the tree,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.105
that birds are chirping.

00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:48.060
But another way to
render this tree

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.380
is to use, sort of a low poly
version of the tree-- oh,

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.060
sorry.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:59.090
And instead use audio to give
a feeling that you're there.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:03.610
And we have a spatial audio
SDK that I encourage all of you

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.000
to go look at and try out.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.650
That really allows you to
feel like you're there.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.576
You can listen to the wind
and hear the birds chirp.

00:27:10.576 --> 00:27:13.050
And give the illusion
that this tree

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.560
is real just through sound.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.150
And I think if you
think about sound

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.780
as, like, bang for your
buck, in terms of watts

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.920
per level of immersion.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.230
In terms of power per
level of immersion,

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.780
audio is really, really good.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.430
Because it doesn't take a
lot of power to generate.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.660
But it does give you the
feeling of being there.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.870
Our audio SDK also allows
you to change the sound

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.835
based on the environment
that you're in.

00:27:36.835 --> 00:27:38.710
So if you think about
walking though a forest

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.510
and what that sounds
like, relative to walking

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.210
through a spaceship and
what that sounds like.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.456
It's very different.

00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:47.990
It depends on the material
properties of space.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.530
And so our SDK will actually
model the material properties

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.890
of whatever space you
design in Unity or Unreal.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.720
And change the sound
that is played,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.710
based on the properties of
the space that you're in.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.330
We're still learning a lot.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:09.110
All of this came from a lot of
experimentation that we did.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.030
We have a group called
Daydream labs, that essentially

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.250
just tinkers with VR.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.300
We try new things, we try
to see if they'll work--

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.090
we see what breaks
and what doesn't.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.630
And we produce those learnings
and try to share them with you.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:32.810
And we actually have a
number of experiments

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:36.170
that we've released as
our controller playground.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.320
So we work a lot with the
Daydream controller to figure

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.250
out what felt good
and what didn't.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:46.830
And we have, I think,
16 different demos

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.020
that are available to you.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.370
So if you want to get started.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.940
If you want to play with what it
feels like to use the Daydream

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.080
controller, you know, [? view ?]
magic wands and swing bats

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.868
and flip pancakes, you
can do that all in VR.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:08.230
And the last thing that I'll
show, I guess, before I end,

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.020
is some work that's been
done by our partners.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.320
I think it's really
interesting to see

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.420
what other people have
produced for a given

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.300
product and platform.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.955
It's really early days here.

00:29:20.955 --> 00:29:24.100
But you can check
out some of the stuff

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.060
that people are
building already.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.048
So I'll play this.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:27.306 --> 00:30:31.240
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: OK,
so that, in a nutshell,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.140
is Daydream.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.450
Normally I would point
to the dot-com link.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:41.320
But actually we have also
launched our Chinese version

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.040
of our developer documentation.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.260
So if you go to
developers.google.cn/vr,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.880
you can find everything that
I've been talking about here

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.420
and more.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.020
Also you should make sure
to check out our booth

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.010
if you haven't already.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.010
So we're demoing a few
things at the booth.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.245
The first one is Daydream,
so you can actually

00:31:02.245 --> 00:31:05.460
try some of the applications
that I showed here.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.770
The second one is Google's built
VR products for the HTC Vive

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.500
as well.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.500
So you can try out Google
Earth and you can also

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.710
try out Tilt Brush, so
a painting application.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.629
They come really
highly recommended.

00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:20.770
And then right after this talk,
my colleague [? Manusan ?]

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.930
will be talking about
Project Tango, which

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.981
is Google's augmented reality
offering and augmented reality

00:31:25.981 --> 00:31:26.480
phones.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.235
And those are, actually,
coming to China very soon,

00:31:30.235 --> 00:31:34.490
so I encourage you to
listen to that as well.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.676
I think I do have some
time for questions.

00:31:37.676 --> 00:31:39.050
I wasn't going to
take questions,

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.758
but I'll take a couple
from the audience.

00:31:40.758 --> 00:31:43.614
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:50.904 --> 00:31:54.430
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.110
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: So
I guess the question was--

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.110
for Daydream, what's
the most important?

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:58.830
Is it the UI, user interaction,
or is it the graphic quality?

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.080
And it's a good question.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.760
There's no easy answer to it.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.950
I think it's actually both.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.860
I think first and
foremost, reducing

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.860
that latency, that motion to
photon latency I talked about,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.490
between when you move your
head to when your eyes actually

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.940
see the screen, is
the most important,

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.586
in that it keeps you
from getting sick.

00:33:17.586 --> 00:33:19.966
But then the UI
designed after that

00:33:19.966 --> 00:33:27.838
is also very, very
[? important. ?]

00:33:27.838 --> 00:33:29.806
OK, let's go, maybe, there.

00:33:29.806 --> 00:33:31.282
In the stripes.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.876
AUDIENCE: I have
tried Daydream today.

00:33:37.876 --> 00:33:41.540
[INAUDIBLE] and then I find
[? to ?] [? propose. ?]

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:50.080
[INAUDIBLE] it's an
[INAUDIBLE] for biographics.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:34:09.710
The programming is [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.670
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the two questions

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.110
were one, that Daydream is still
uncomfortable with glasses.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.679
And then, two, that you have no
context for what's around you

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.449
and so you can bump
into things and it's

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:22.750
sort of dangerous in that way.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.206
So, for the first one.

00:34:25.206 --> 00:34:27.090
One thing that
I've found, we did

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.070
work hard to try to make
it good with glasses,

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.830
but you have to tighten
it really tight.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.409
It's really important
to get the strap tight.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.429
I think that we are going to
be doing other iterations.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.929
We're going to be
learning from the design.

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:42.569
And so in future iterations
of the viewer, I think,

00:34:42.569 --> 00:34:45.800
you'll see us work even
harder for glasses.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.860
But one tip is to
really tighten it

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.210
a lot for when you
have glasses on.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.500
For the second piece,
which is, can you

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.300
be aware of your environment.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.690
So, for right now, we
suggest that people

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:04.680
use Daydream in a safe space
without moving around a lot.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.800
I think that you
will see, over time--

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.200
there are systems if you
look at what's going on

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.110
in the desktop VR space.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.530
You know, there's at
least Guardian from HTC

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.695
to keep you from hitting things.

00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:21.109
But I think it's a problem
that is going to need research.

00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:22.650
And need the community
to work on it.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.816
Like, I think, a lot of
people are thinking about it

00:35:24.816 --> 00:35:27.914
and realizing, OK, if
you use VR in your home,

00:35:27.914 --> 00:35:29.580
you need to understand
where things are.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.510
So I expect it's something
that we and also others

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:36.486
in the space, will be working
on in the next couple years.

00:35:36.486 --> 00:35:37.805
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:37.805 --> 00:35:38.971
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:54.420
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:34.597 --> 00:36:36.180
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the question

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.170
was about the space is
moving really, really fast.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:44.239
So as a developer, you want
to buy a Daydream device

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:45.530
and you want to develop for it.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.720
But you're worried
that your device

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.632
will be outdated at some time.

00:36:51.632 --> 00:36:53.580
And that could happen.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:58.150
I think that the space
is moving really quickly.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.920
I think you'll see
products come out.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.740
And in Google we have made a
commitment to Daydream devices,

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.870
like, we're working on
making more Daydream devices

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.230
and bringing this concept
to a lot of people.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.520
So it is a device
that we're planning

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.680
on supporting for some time.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.110
That's why we
launched the product.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:22.046
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:32.652 --> 00:37:34.110
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
The question

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.930
is when will the
platform be stable.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.060
I think it's actually
quite stable right now.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.330
Like, I think we
have a number of apps

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.380
that are production
apps that are going out

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.860
and have many, many users.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.060
And, I think, today is a good
day to start developing for it.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.500
We've worked really, really
hard over the last year

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.253
to get this ready and we put it
into a flagship phone for us,

00:37:57.253 --> 00:37:58.340
which is the Pixel.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.540
So I think today is a good day.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.040
Yeah.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.540
In the--

00:38:06.307 --> 00:38:08.390
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you for your speech.

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.900
And my question is, what is
the difference between Daydream

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.090
SDK or Qualcomm SDK?

00:38:16.846 --> 00:38:20.749
The advantage of
Google Daydream SDK?

00:38:20.749 --> 00:38:22.540
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the question was,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:27.327
I guess, the Google VR SDK
versus Qualcomm's VR SDK.

00:38:27.327 --> 00:38:28.410
AUDIENCE: Yes, absolutely.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:32.250
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: So,
I guess, the Google SDK

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.115
is deeply integrated
into Android

00:38:34.115 --> 00:38:38.160
and also includes our
controller and special tools

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.790
to actually use the controller.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:48.770
So Google VR SDK is integrated,
as well, into Unity and Unreal.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.960
So it's specifically made
for Daydream devices.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:01.095
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
advantages over video play?

00:39:01.095 --> 00:39:02.720
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Over video play?

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.752
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:03.752 --> 00:39:05.210
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So, I guess,

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.130
we support DRM video,
which is something

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.720
that a lot of companies want.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.650
It's secure video, I guess.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:17.720
But for playing
360 video, I think

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.690
we're similar in many ways.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.500
We support DRM video
and then we also

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.736
support use of the control.

00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:26.150
I think those are--
and we're targeting

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.800
our Daydream
platform which allows

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.500
us to have very low latency.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.500
AUDIENCE: OK, Thank you.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.472
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:39:36.472 --> 00:39:36.972
Yeah.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.680
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:08.186 --> 00:40:10.310
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: I
guess the question is that

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.105
how to build a Daydream app,
how to put it on Play right now.

00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:21.379
I think, for China, we still
are working on our strategy.

00:40:21.379 --> 00:40:23.420
For the Google Play store
elsewhere in the world,

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.420
it's just the normal processor.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.750
So the normal way you
would put an app on Play

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.052
is the same for any [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:37.314 --> 00:40:37.814
Yeah.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:42.220
One more--

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.720
AUDIENCE: Actually
just following up

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.540
on the previous question,
so can you elaborate more

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.715
on your China strategy?

00:40:48.715 --> 00:40:53.840
Is there a timeline and what's
the thing going to look like,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.830
if you catch here?

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.121
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: So
the question is, what is my--

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.334
our China strategy.

00:40:58.334 --> 00:41:00.000
I knew I was going
to get this question.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.410
I think it's a very
fair question to ask.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:06.050
Right now, I do not have
any details to share

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.460
about our China strategy.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.550
What I can say, is that we
do know China is important.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.485
We have a history of putting
[? pies ?] into China.

00:41:13.485 --> 00:41:15.193
Even in this space,
with the Tango phone.

00:41:15.193 --> 00:41:17.450
But that's all I
can say right now.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.800
I wish I had more for you.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.485
All right, one more question.

00:41:22.485 --> 00:41:23.475
All right.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:52.117
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:52.117 --> 00:41:53.700
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the question

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.300
is, what is the
difference between the HTC

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.700
Vive and Daydream?

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.280
How do we think about them
relative to each other?

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.590
So the main difference
between the HTC5 and Daydream

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.400
is Daydream is a
platform for mobile VR.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.606
So it's using phones.

00:42:08.606 --> 00:42:11.665
Whereas the HTC Vive is a
platform for desktop VR,

00:42:11.665 --> 00:42:13.713
so it's using a very
powerful computer.

00:42:13.713 --> 00:42:16.610
The HTC Vive is also
six degrees of freedom.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.065
So it tracks you
as you move and has

00:42:19.065 --> 00:42:22.030
controllers that do the same,
using this external tracking

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.870
system.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.430
Whereas Daydream
is three degrees

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:28.520
of freedom for both the
controller and the headset.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.800
I think, for Google,
we're excited

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.484
about the space in general.

00:42:32.484 --> 00:42:34.775
And that's why you're seeing
us build some applications

00:42:34.775 --> 00:42:37.350
for the HTC Vive as well.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.880
We want to make sure that
Google products work really

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.360
well across the ecosystem.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.640
So we're happy to build
applications for the Vive.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.020
We're also happy to build the
applications for Daydream.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.030
And we think that
Daydream has potential

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.936
to be really broadly adopted.

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:55.770
Like, a platform where a
lot of people can get on VR.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.310
Whereas some of
the desktop systems

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.580
are a little bit more expensive.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.710
I think that's all I
have time for right now.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.001
Thank you guys, again, so much.

00:43:04.001 --> 00:43:05.830
I'll be at the booth
or here afterwards.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.634
And please do check out
the Tango talk, as well.

00:43:08.634 --> 00:43:09.550
I think it'll be good.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:11.650
So thank you, again.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:15.000
[APPLAUSE]
