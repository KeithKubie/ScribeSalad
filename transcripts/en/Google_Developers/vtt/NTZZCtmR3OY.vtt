00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.640
Hello everybody.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.170
We've got a full house
Thank you all for coming

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.220
and welcome to this talk
about Project Tango and area

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.370
learning.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.950
So my name is Wim Meeussen and I
lead the Project Tango location

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.200
team.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.540
So today I will talk
about area learning,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.560
which is one of the core
technologies of Project Tango.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.200
And it's at the foundation
of almost everything we're

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.790
working on my team,
so it's something

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.930
I really deeply care about.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.160
And it's exciting that today
I can spend a whole session

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.560
on area learning.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.190
And if you have no idea what
area learning is, that's OK.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.580
We'll cover that in this talk.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.080
And so let's get started with
an overview of the key things

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.400
that you will
learn in this talk.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.410
So number one, by
the end of this talk,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.100
you will be able to build an
augmented reality application,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.690
where you can put virtual
objects in the world,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.300
and they will stay in place,
and they will not drift away.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.480
So if you have built
AR applications before,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.070
you know this is
a really big deal.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.180
And I'll have a live
demo where I'll show you

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.590
how I place these
objects and how they stay

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.260
in place in the environment.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.360
Number two, by the
end of this session,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.680
you will know how to build
multiplayer experiences, where

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.960
multiple Tango devices
interact with each other.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.860
And this is obviously
without any wiring,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580
without any infrastructure
in your environment.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.970
It just works with just
your mobile device.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.350
And then finally, I'll talk
about some future applications

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.310
where you could imagine that
you just never get lost anymore

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.560
in large buildings.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.730
So I always like to start
out with a quick poll

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.900
to get a little more
background about you.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.860
So by a raise of
hands, like how many of

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.570
you have heard about
Project Tango before today?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.010
All right, that's most people.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.080
How many people know
about area learning?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.144
That's just a handful.

00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:03.060
And how many of you are
here because it's just

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.520
really hot outside?

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.840
A few honest people.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.870
All right.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.980
So today I really
want you to come away

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.970
with a really good understanding
of what area learning is,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.340
how it works, and
also how you can

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.450
use area learning to
build new applications

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.340
and enable new user experiences.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.040
So I'll start out with a
quick, high-level overview

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.790
of what Project Tango
is, for those of you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.300
who are still new to Tango.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.160
So fundamentally, Tango is
about enabling mobile devices

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.040
to understand the
world around them.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.580
So Tango uses computer
vision for your device

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.720
to understand the
geometry of the world,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.700
but also to know its own
position and orientation

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.530
in that world.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.160
So in some sense,
it turns your screen

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.270
into an extension
of the real world,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.660
like your screen becomes
this magic window

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.640
into the real world.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.360
And if you look at
the example here,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.070
so think about this
device, if it understands

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.210
what the world
around it looks like,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.800
and it knows where
it is in that world,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.190
it can start displaying some
really interesting content

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.860
about the world.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.250
You could imagine you
can display directions

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.440
on how to get from
A to B. Or you

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.755
could display virtual
furniture in your house

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:23.880
and you can go look at it
from all different angles

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.870
to see how it would fit.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.660
Or you can imagine you can
have a game that just plays out

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.120
right in your living room.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.690
So Tango can enable whole new
range of applications that just

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.130
simply weren't possible before.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.800
So let's look at the three main
technologies of Project Tango.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.020
So there is motion
tracking, depth perception,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.880
and area learning.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.910
And if you have attended
talks about Tango before,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.480
you've probably heard a
lot about those first two.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.260
And today, we'll mostly
focus on the third one,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.600
on area learning.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.960
But let's do a quick overview
for all three of them.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.150
So motion tracking is all
about allowing your device

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.540
to know how it moves
through the world.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.370
So as a developer,
you can use motion

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.300
tracking to know how
your device moved

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.060
relative to where it started.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.150
So if, for example, I started
here, and I move one meter,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.370
I can ask the motion
tracking component

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.770
how far did you move relative
to where you started.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.510
If I move back to
my original place,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.860
I can ask motion
tracking where I am,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.010
and it will tell me that
I'm back where I started.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.110
So motion tracking is all
about allowing developers

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.945
to ask the device how
it's moving through space.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.620
Then depth perception.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.870
So every Tango-enabled
device or every Tango phone

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.620
has a special 3D camera.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.130
So with this 3D camera,
the Tango device

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.250
can sense the 3D geometry
of the world around it.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.460
So if I point my device
at the speaker desk here,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.410
it could sense this geometry
of the front of the desk.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.020
If I point it at the
back of the desk,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.880
it would sense the geometry
of the back of the desk.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.400
So wherever I point it, it
can sense the 3D geometry.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
And as a developer, you can
carry that 3D information

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.172
in the form of 3D point clouds.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.410
So then the last core
technology, area learning, this

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.210
is what really gives your
Tango device a memory.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.020
And it works in a very
similar way to how people

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.810
operate in the real world.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.880
So remember when you came
into this dome or tent thing,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.710
probably, in the
back of your head,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.380
you started building up a model
of what the space looked like.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.540
You saw a speaker desk.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.860
There's two big screens.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.500
There's a lot of chairs.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.860
And you take that mental
model and you store it

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.417
in your memory.

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:01.250
So imagine now, if you
would leave the room,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.240
let's say you go
to the restroom.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.020
And when you come
back later, you

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.490
would quickly recognize that
you're in the same space

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.930
because you recognize the desk
and the screens and the chairs.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.750
So you would recognize that
you're back in that same space.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.010
And Tango area learning
works in a very similar way.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.210
So when you bring a Tango
device into a new space,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.540
it will use its camera
to look at the world

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.610
and compute this mathematical
description of what

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.326
the world looks like.

00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:33.200
And it'll store that
mathematical description

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.180
in its memory.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.150
And when you then
bring that same Tango

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.030
device in the same
room at a later time,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.190
it will be able to compare
what it sees with its camera

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.660
to that mathematical
description it stored in memory.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.110
And when those two match
up, it recognizes space

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.960
and it knows exactly
where it is in that space.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.340
So let's dive a little deeper
into the details of how

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.360
area learning works and even
how Tango works under the hood.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.150
So Tango has this
wide angle camera

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.590
that it uses to
look at the world.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.760
So it's much like, in
this example, when you're

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.720
visiting a mall,
your Tango device

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.290
will look at a few key landmarks
that it sees in the world.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.420
So for example here,
on your left side,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.850
you see that vending
machine, in front of you

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.850
there are some restrooms,
and then there's

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.220
another landmark
on top of the roof.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.450
So now what happens,
when you start

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.430
moving in this
environment, and you

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.260
keep looking at those same
landmarks, what happens

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.890
is you see those landmarks all
of sudden in different places

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.330
in your field of view.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.700
So if you, for example, look
at that vending machine,

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.280
initially, it was
on your left side.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.130
And as you move, at the
end, the vending machine

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.560
is almost right in front of you.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.620
And this is exactly how
Tango motion tracking works.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.560
Tango will look at all
these landmarks in the world

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.060
and see how they move
as the device moves.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.180
And based on that motion, it
can compute its own motion

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.220
in space.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.560
So this is pure motion tracking.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.240
So this is still all
without any memory.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.490
So in this example,
if you're in the mall,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.380
if you would cover your eyes,
spin around, and open your eyes

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.410
again, you would
have no idea where

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.200
you are because you didn't
have any memory of that space.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.870
And the same-- every time you
start Tango motion tracking,

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:38.600
it doesn't have any memory, so
it always starts from scratch.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.150
So let's now think about what
if we add memory to this.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.580
So for a Tango
device, it doesn't

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.440
need to remember the entire
image of what it sees,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.600
it only needs to remember
those key landmarks

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.270
that it's tracking.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.150
So in this case, it would look
at the small square patch,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.800
like the little yellow
squares around each landmark,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.670
to store a mathematical
description of what exactly

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.750
that landmark looks like.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.170
So your Tango
device doesn't care

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.336
about the rest of the image.

00:09:12.336 --> 00:09:15.640
It just looks at
those landmarks.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.300
So Tango will store two
things in its memory.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.580
One is where it
saw that landmark.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.080
And the second is that
mathematical description

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.620
of what that
landmark looks like.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.830
And this is how Tango
can remember its space.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.880
So let's jump to a live
demo, so you can actually

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.700
see how this works
under the hood.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.100
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.996
So I'll first just start
up Tango motion tracking.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.630
So here, if you look at the
left side of the screen,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.860
you get to see how Tango
is looking at the world.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.120
You get to see yourself,
if you want to.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.730
And all those dots
on the screen, those

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.040
are the landmarks
that Tango is seeing

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.010
and that Tango is tracking.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.060
So instead of just looking
at like two or three

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.180
or four points in
the world, Tango

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.810
can look at 100 points
at the same time.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.120
And as I move, Tango keeps track
of how all those landmarks move

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.220
in the image.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.880
If you then look at the right
hand side of the screen,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.910
it's kind of a top down
view of where I am.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.270
So if I walk in a
big circle here,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.560
you can see that motion
tracking knows exactly

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.440
that I walked in that
circle, and that I

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.550
ended up back where I started.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.650
So this is motion
tracking under the hood.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.856
So let's now jump
to area learning.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.540
So initially, this
looks very similar.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.060
You just have Tango
looking out into the world.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.190
But now, Tango is actually
building up a memory

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.521
of what the space looks like.

00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:10.020
And once it has
created the memory--

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.720
so it has happened now-- you see
all these static yellow dots.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.980
Those are the landmarks
that Tango has remembered.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.740
So I can go look at them
from all different angles.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.820
They're literally physical
points in the world

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.160
that Tango has
stored in its memory.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.860
And on the right hand side,
you see these lines coming out

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.410
of the device.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.980
That is showing where Tango
recognizes a landmark that's

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.940
stored in its memory.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.040
So now we can do
something really cool.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.780
So let's say I cover
the cameras here,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.676
so my device has no
idea where it is.

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:51.090
I'll just go hide
it somewhere else.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.200
So now, it should
be completely lost.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.720
But if I point it back at
the area that it learned,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.909
you can see all those landmarks
popped back into place.

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:04.450
So it actually remembered where
it was, based on that memory.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.420
So let me just do
that one more time.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.770
So now, it doesn't
know where it is.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.040
And then you see it jump,
and all the yellow dots

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.730
are back in place.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.030
Yeah.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.190
It's pretty cool, right?

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.260
So this is really a
view under the hood

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.090
of how Tango operates,
for both motion tracking

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.180
and for area learning.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.660
So now let's look
a little bit at how

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.670
we can use area learning.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.620
So you have a pretty good
understanding of how it works.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.830
And let's see what
can it do for you,

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.305
like what kind of
new experiences

00:12:48.305 --> 00:12:52.000
can area learning enable?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.970
And let's first
cover an AR example.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.600
So let's say you want to put
a virtual chair in your dining

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.300
room.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.500
You want to see how it fits.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.880
The problem you're having
here is that that chair

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.650
will start drifting over time.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.880
And that is because if you
just have motion tracking,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.390
you'll have very
small errors that

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.850
slowly accumulate over time.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.610
And if you walk around
enough, your chair

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.700
might look something like this.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.329
So it'll slowly drift
and drift and drift.

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:26.120
So this is exactly the
problem that we want

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.640
to solve with area learning.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.360
You want your chair to
go back right there.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.090
So the way area
learning can help here

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.060
is it can build up a
memory of where you

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.010
placed a chair in the world.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.000
So it can remember where
exactly you placed that chair.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.270
So even though if
motion tracking slowly

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.000
drifts, because Tango remembers
where you placed that chair,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.714
it can always correct it
and put the chair right back

00:13:52.714 --> 00:13:53.505
in the right place.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.080
And I'll have a live demo of
this coming up a little later.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.310
So it's actually
pretty cool to see.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.590
So there's obviously a number
of other AR based examples.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.330
Like let's say you're
using the 3D sensor

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.300
to start measuring the
geometry of your world.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.690
If you have these nice yellow
annotations on your world,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.040
you want them to stay
exactly in the right place.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.230
You don't want them to
start drifting around.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.020
So this is, again, where
area learning can help.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.010
And even if you have an example
where your objects aren't

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.840
static-- for example, you have
these monsters running around--

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.020
you still do care that
your virtual world

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.090
and your real world stay
aligned with each other.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.392
Because if you would start
drifting, at some point,

00:14:40.392 --> 00:14:42.600
your monsters would start
running through the shelves

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.940
and you really want them to
stay in the center aisle.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.810
So even here, with
moving objects,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.110
you do care about
that alignment.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.970
So again, area
learning can help here.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.340
And now let's jump to
the second big use case.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.410
That is multiplayer experiences.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.170
So the problem here
is pretty obvious.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.440
You want to know where all the
other players are in the world.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.510
And it would be awesome
if you can do it

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.820
without needing to put in
cables or infrastructure

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.940
in your environment.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.020
So how can area
learning help here?

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.610
So the key for
multiplayer experiences

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.410
is to have a memory
of your space,

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.200
and to share that memory
between all the devices.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.815
So when all your devices have
the same memory-- so here,

00:15:35.815 --> 00:15:40.710
this is the display of what your
device could have memorized.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.890
If all your devices
share that memory,

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:48.560
they could all start recognizing
where they are in that space.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.960
And in some sense, you
turn the real world

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.800
in your way to tie all these
Tango devices together.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.770
We don't need any
special infrastructure.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.150
Like you're using your
couch and your carpet

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.930
and the poster on the wall.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.924
And they literally tie together
this multiplayer experience.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:17.090
So let's look a little bit at
how this actually turns out

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.310
in the real world because
the real world is always

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.770
a little more messy.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.650
So I'll give a
number of examples

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.010
where Tango will have some
challenges with area learning.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.640
And it will give you a bit of
a better understanding of where

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.320
to best apply area learning.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.770
So if you look at
these two images here,

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.459
the left side could be what
your room usually looks like.

00:16:39.459 --> 00:16:41.000
And on the right is
probably what you

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.100
want your room to look like.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.270
And if you and me
look at these images,

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.960
we can kind of recognize that
it's probably the same room.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.250
You see there's maybe
the same shelves.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.070
There are some hangers
that you recognize,

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.460
so pretty sure the same place.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.340
But for a Tango
device, those look

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.840
like two completely
different spaces

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.150
because Tango has built up
all these landmarks on top

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.260
of the clothes and everywhere.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.200
If all the clothes move, all
these landmarks have moved,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.510
and Tango would get confused.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.859
So it's kind of like--
imagine you're walking around

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.740
in San Francisco,
and you're looking

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.790
at some of the big
skyscrapers to kind of keep

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.899
yourself oriented.

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:22.190
And then someone comes in
and moves all the skyscrapers

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.220
around.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.569
You'd be pretty lost.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.689
So this is really what
happens to Tango when stuff

00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:28.980
in the environment moves a lot.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.160
So here's an example
where things didn't move,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.170
but one image was taken
in day and one at night.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.910
So even though your landmarks
are in the same place,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.410
they could actually
look differently

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.657
because of the lighting
and because of shadows.

00:17:46.657 --> 00:17:48.990
And something that everyone
that has played with cameras

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.730
will probably
recognize, if you have

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.210
a dark room and a
really bright window,

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.990
you have troubles
with your exposure.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.750
You either need to tune in
on the window or on the room,

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.330
but you cannot
have it both ways.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.850
And this should
be pretty obvious.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.600
If you have large crowds,
they can make a space look

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.220
very differently.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.360
And then another kind
of extreme example.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.420
Tango looks for visually
interesting things

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.670
in the world.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.719
And if your room is all
white or all one color,

00:18:19.719 --> 00:18:21.260
there's nothing
visually interesting.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.990
There's no landmarks
for Tango to recognize.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.200
So that will be a
challenging space.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.880
If you go outside,
you can imagine

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.530
a lot more different changes--
seasons, weather, sunshine,

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:37.400
shadows-- so outside gets
a little more challenging.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.740
So the question
now is, how do you

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.360
deal with all these challenges?

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.671
And the key point here is time.

00:18:45.671 --> 00:18:47.420
Like if you look at a
lot of these changes

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.880
that we talked about, those
happen slowly over time.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.890
And some environments
will change quickly

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.180
and some will
change very slowly.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.810
Like you could imagine a museum
that has the same exhibition

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.792
year round, and maybe it
has very constant lighting,

00:19:02.792 --> 00:19:05.000
there, your memory will be
good for months and months

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.650
at a time.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.660
And at the other
extreme of the scale,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.040
you could imagine
a subway station

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.010
with lots of people
running around.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.020
Maybe there's
advertisements that change,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.710
so there, your memory would
be valid for a lot shorter

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.480
of a time.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.180
So a really good strategy
to deal with this

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.730
is to build your applications
relying on a short-term memory.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.430
So if you think about
your AR application

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:35.030
where you want to show virtual
furniture in your house,

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.400
maybe you want to look at
it for like 20, 30 minutes.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.984
But then during
those 30 minutes,

00:19:39.984 --> 00:19:41.400
your house is not
going to change.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.840
So you're good there.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.790
But if you want to play a
multiplayer game in your living

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.850
room, maybe you want to
play for a couple of hours.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.580
But during that time,
your living room's

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.900
still going to be
your living room.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.160
If you rely on
shorter term memory,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.742
area learning can be a very
powerful and reliable tool.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:09.530
So let's get to the-- oh,
let's actually play this video.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:15.990
So this is a real world example
of area learning being used.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.090
So this video was recorded
in the Zurich train station.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.080
And if you look
at the video, you

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.710
can see a lot of the challenges
that we just talked about.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.830
There's some outdoors.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.170
There are some
shadows that you see.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.180
There's people walking around.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.640
You can see the floors
are kind of one color.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.360
But then still, area
learning can actually

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.910
work in this environment.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.910
So area learning can be
pretty robust to a number

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:49.879
of these changes.

00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:51.420
It's just, the
examples I showed were

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.410
kind of extreme to kind
of drive the point home.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.947
But you can see how it actually
operates in the real world.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.320
And I'll go a little
further in this video

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.880
because there's actually
something cool that

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.300
maybe isn't always obvious.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.910
Because Tango fully
works in 3D, you

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.230
can actually go
down stairs, and it

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.770
will tell you in
full three dimensions

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.895
where you are in the world.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.770
So let's look a
little bit at how

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.810
to build an application
with area learning.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.970
And again, I'll
cover two examples.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.500
I'll have the AR example
with drift correction,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.220
and I'll have the
multiplayer example.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.320
So first one, you want
to use memory here

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.190
to keep all your virtual objects
exactly in the same place.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:54.910
So this is where your learning
will help you build this.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:22:04.810
And for this example,
I will assume you have

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.550
an application that uses AR.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.730
And I'll tell you how to
transition it to area learning.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.710
If you don't yet know how
to build an AR application,

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.190
Friday morning,
Eitan Marder-Eppstein

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:22.550
has a really interesting talk
about how to build a full AR

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.380
end-to-end example using Tango.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.390
So if you're interested
in that, definitely

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.240
go check out his talk.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.860
But here, I will assume you
have your application already.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:36.840
And we're going to port it
to move to area learning.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.880
And the point of
this slide is just

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.610
to show you it is really easy.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.420
You need to change
literally two lines of code.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.540
In the first highlighted line,
you just tell Tango, please

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.646
enable drift correction.

00:22:52.646 --> 00:22:54.020
In the second
line, you will tell

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.320
Tango, instead of measuring
where your device is

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.790
relative to where you
started, measure it

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.970
relative to this memory
that we'll build up.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.560
With just those two lines,
you can transition an app

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.130
from regular AR to
area learning AR.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:13.880
Let me show you a demo
of how that works.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.490
So I'll show the same app,
first without area learning

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.770
and then with area learning.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.210
So this is a little
AR app that allows

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.090
me to place a really large
cube on top of things.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.450
So we are not using
area learning,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.090
but the cube is
pretty-- it stays

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.710
in place pretty reasonable.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.058
But now if I'm a little more
mean, and I move around,

00:23:50.058 --> 00:23:53.250
you can see it's still
more or less there.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.550
And if I did a little more
extreme, at some point,

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:01.355
I will lose my cube because it
just doesn't remember anymore

00:24:01.355 --> 00:24:01.855
where it is.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.840
So let's now do the
exact same thing,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.220
but with area learning enabled.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.920
So now in the background,
Tango is actually

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.970
building up that memory of what
this speaker desk looks like.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:26.237
So now let me place
the cube back.

00:24:26.237 --> 00:24:27.570
So now we can do the same thing.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.960
I can shake the device.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.930
And if I look back, as soon
as it recognizes the space,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.610
it can put the cube back
exactly in the right place.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.250
I can do my previous example
where I cover the camera.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.850
Let the app get completely lost.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.230
And then when I open it back,
as soon as it recognizes it,

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.210
it can put the cube back
in exactly the right place.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:58.090
So you can have applications
where your virtual objects will

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.510
stay where they are.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.750
Even if your session
breaks, even if your users

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.970
do something crazy,
your virtual objects

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.786
will stay in the same place.

00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:08.526
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.010
So let's jump to
the next example.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.840
How do we build a
multiplayer game?

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.610
So this is a little
bit more involved.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.730
It includes three
different steps.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.400
So first, we will create
a memory of, let's say,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.150
your living room.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.194
Then we will share that
memory with all the devices.

00:25:33.194 --> 00:25:34.360
And then you play your game.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.760
Let's first think about how
do you create that memory.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.120
So what that means,
in your shared space,

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.390
you want to build up,
literally, this memory

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.030
of what that space looks like.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.550
So how do you do that
in code in Tango?

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.090
Very simple.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.370
You tell Tango start
learning the area.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.930
And then when you're
done, you say save.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.430
And then you have
built up a memory

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.800
of what that space looked like.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.120
So now, how to share that memory
between your different devices.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.700
Again, pretty simple.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.010
Tango has an export and
an import functionality.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.960
So you can export your
memory from one device

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.100
and import it on all
the other devices.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.920
So once you have all
your devices set up,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.470
you're ready to go play.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.290
So what area learning has
done, or what building up

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.020
that memory has done, is
created this one reference frame

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.870
that can be used by all
the different devices,

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.820
because that entire memory
is all referenced from one

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.740
frame in your environment.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.170
So every single device
in your multiplayer game

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:56.330
can directly ask Tango where
am I relative to this memory.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.900
And if you have multiple
devices using the same memory,

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.210
they will all get a reference
relative to that same reference

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:03.710
frame.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.970
And this is how you
run that in Tango code.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.910
You just tell Tango
please use this memory.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.530
And then you start asking
Tango, where are you

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.240
relative to this memory.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.850
So the code all
looks pretty simple.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.676
So now I wanted
to share a video.

00:27:27.676 --> 00:27:29.550
But I wanted to introduce
the video a little,

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.690
because I think it's
easy to underappreciate

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.740
the awesomeness of the video.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.500
So the setting is exactly
this picture here.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.170
So we have three players
that have a Tango

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.450
device in front of their face.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.160
So they're completely
in a virtual world.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.260
They cannot see each other.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.210
And the video
you're going to see

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.300
is showing that virtual world
of one what one of the players

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.970
is seeing.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.960
And one of the key things
you should look out

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.420
for, in that video, you
will see a Tango device.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.230
And obviously, it's a
virtual Tango device

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.070
because it's a virtual world.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.720
But that device is
actually exactly a match

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.300
on a real device that's
in the real world.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.980
And you'll see different players
hand that device to each other.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.090
So think about how
awesome that is.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.670
The players can only
see their virtual world,

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.680
so only if they know exactly
where all the other players

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.940
are, and they know exactly where
that device is, only then can

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.650
they do this
comfortable handoff.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.000
So it's pretty amazing.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.050
So check it out.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.640
So this is filmed
from the third person.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.420
So even the third
person is moving around.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.800
And you see how the other two
are just casually handing off

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.040
the Tango device from
one to the other.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.675
So this is only possible
with registration between all

00:29:01.675 --> 00:29:02.800
those different components.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.187
So you have two players, you
have the person filming it,

00:29:08.187 --> 00:29:09.270
and then the Tango device.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.240
You have four different
devices tightly

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.422
coordinated with each
other, so pretty amazing.

00:29:14.422 --> 00:29:17.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.830
And then this is an
example of using VR.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:29.210
If you want to try something
like this for yourself,

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.240
tomorrow night in the
Project Tango after hours,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.800
we have an AR
multiplayer game set up.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.190
So you can go try it out.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.800
And also, if you want
to just try Tango demos,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.380
the sandbox is there
for all three days.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.760
So go test it out.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.370
We have a lot of
cool stuff going on.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.170
Now that I'm advertising
a number of things,

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.200
there's two more
Tango talks coming up.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.870
So tomorrow at
3:00 PM, Johnny Lee

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.400
will be talking about everything
that's new within Tango.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.640
So definitely go check that out.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.120
And then on Friday,
Friday morning, Eitan

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.700
will be talking about how
to build an AR application.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.070
So two more exciting
talks coming up.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.860
So what's next for Tango and
what's next for area learning?

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.390
What's coming up?

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.150
So I hope, by seeing the
demos, you have been wondering,

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.920
like, when can I try this?

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.440
And today I'm
excited to announce

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.370
that everything
you've seen until now

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:38.270
will be part of our release
coming out next month.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.140
So, yeah.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.952
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:49.270
So you'll be able to build these
drift-free, drift-corrected AR

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:50.100
experiences.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.510
And you'll be able to build
multiplayer experiences.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.430
And this release is just a
beginning for area learning.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.350
The Tango team will
keep improving,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:03.060
and we'll keep building better
and more robust algorithms.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.430
So this is just
the very beginning.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:09.360
And as developers, you're
getting a very early preview

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.690
in what area learning can do.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.250
So this is the start
of what will become

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.340
a pretty exciting journey.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.880
So let's take a little look
at where this journey could

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.530
take us next.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.370
Let's look a little bit
at future applications.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.440
So here, imagine
you're visiting a mall.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.490
And you're trying to figure
out where you are in that mall.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.880
So you pop out your phone,
you start up Google Maps,

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.670
and then you get
to see something

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.830
like the image on the left.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.250
So you get a really nice
floor plan of the mall,

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.570
and then you see this big blue
circle that tells you you're

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.750
somewhere here, but we don't
quite know exactly where.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.220
So now imagine what you
could do with area learning.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.080
So imagine if your device could
recognize exactly where it

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.520
is in that mall.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.900
You could pinpoint
your location.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.360
And your experience could
look a lot like the image

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.520
on the right side, where
you have an exact location,

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.030
you even know exactly which
direction you're facing.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.940
And if you take this
one step further,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.240
if you combine that
very accurate location

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.030
with augmented reality,
you can imagine

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.330
that you can get really
accurate directions on how

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.640
to get from where you
are to, let's say,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.960
your favorite store in the mall.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.190
All augmented in the real world.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:34.350
So I hope this
gives you some idea

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.790
of where area your learning
can take us in the future

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.350
and that you realize we're just
at the very beginning of what

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.890
this technology can do.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.910
And then obviously,
we're not only

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.410
at the very beginning of
technologies like area

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:53.620
learning, we're also at the very
beginning of the Tango device

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.110
ecosystem.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.060
So you have all seen
the Yellowstone devices,

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.890
which is our developer kit.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.780
There's like thousands of those
in the hands of developers

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.460
out in the world.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.520
Now Tango has partnered
up with Lenovo.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.080
So Lenovo will be releasing
the first consumer-facing

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.370
Tango-enabled phone.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.700
It will be coming out later
this year as a worldwide launch.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.090
So I hope-- I want
to end with this.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.110
I hope you realize
that this is actually

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.430
a really great and amazing
time to be part of Tango

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.020
and be a Tango developer.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.290
We have a lot of new
technologies coming out.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.300
There's new devices coming out.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.600
And I think that we really
have this unique opportunity

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.810
to redefine how people
interact with their phones,

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:53.130
and even how phones
interact with the world.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.580
So I'm pretty excited to see
what we can build together.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.080
Cool.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.180
Thank you.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.430
