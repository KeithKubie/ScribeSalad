MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.160
Welcome to Root Access, a show
on Google Developers Live

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.800
about startups.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.600
My name is Martin Omander, and
I'm joined here today by Don

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.720
Dodge, Googler, longtime
investor, and start up

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.370
evangelist.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.150
Don, today we're going to talk
about founders who say I have

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570
a great idea but--

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.190
so I'm sure you've heard
this many times.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.090
Founders who come and say, I
have a great idea but I don't

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.570
have any money.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.030
What do you tell founders
who say that?

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.930
DON DODGE: Well, first of all
they're not founders.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.100
If they just have an idea and
haven't founded a company,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.120
then they're like the rest of us
who have lots of ideas but

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.110
haven't executed.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.330
So to be a founder, you
have to take that idea

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.960
and execute on it.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.770
You have to convince other
people to join you and build a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.050
company and move forward.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.610
So I get those emails every day
about, I have a great idea

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.800
about something.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.180
And we're all consumers, so
consumer focused companies,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.160
everyone has an idea for a
consumer or social app or a

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.170
mobile app.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.670
Because we all have phones and
we all have mobile apps and we

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.580
all have ideas for
mobile apps.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.640
But those are just ideas, and
they don't become interesting

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.000
until you've thought about it
further, convinced other

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.170
people to join you, convinced
investors to put money in.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.850
So ideas are just ideas,
and they literally

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.500
are a dime a dozen.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.370
MARTIN OMANDER: So another thing
early founders say is, I

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.660
have a great idea but I won't
tell you about it because I'm

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.860
afraid that you or somebody
else might steal it.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.320
What do you say?

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.420
DON DODGE: Yeah, I
hear that too.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.080
Less now than in the past.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.840
But the reality is that if you
don't talk about your idea,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.020
you're not going
to get advice.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.470
You're not going to find
out if the idea is

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.720
reasonable or not.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.900
So you need to talk about the
idea with early users,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.670
potential customers, to get
their feedback to see if it's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.000
something that they're
really interested in.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.750
Quite often, we're delusional,
and we think an idea is great

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.270
because we're talking
to ourselves.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.170
You need to talk to other people
to see if it's really

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.270
an idea that has legs.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.470
You need to talk to people to
find your co-founders and get

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.830
them excited about the idea
and willing to join you.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.220
You need to talk to potential
investors to see if there's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.980
interest in this idea, talk to
potential customers or users

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.590
to see how they would use it.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.290
So you need to be out there
talking about your idea.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.680
The chances that someone
is going to steal

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.890
your idea are minimal.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.490
In fact, I've rarely ever
seen that happen.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.490
More often the case is that
people want to offer advice

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.240
and offer help.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.690
Very few people or very few
companies are going to drop

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.550
what they're doing to
steal your idea.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.480
That almost never happens.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.320
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.710
The couple of times I've seen
one company take on the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.740
business model of another, it's
they're going after an

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.130
established business.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.810
Not really a very early
stage start up.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.420
DON DODGE: That's right.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.390
And big companies have 100 other
priorities, and they

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.650
have established products and
road maps, and they have a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.380
hundred things that they
want to do on that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.150
product road map.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.490
They are likely not interested
in implementing an idea that's

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.170
not already in their road
map, so highly unlikely.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.010
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.970
OK, very good.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.240
So let's dig into that a little
bit because a lot of

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.780
founders have great ideas but
they don't want to hire a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.530
bunch of developers and spend
a lot of money and time

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.280
validating the idea.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.150
You spoke some about how can
they validate the idea early

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.070
on, soon, and with
minimal invest?

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.500
DON DODGE: Yeah, well, that's
the beauty of today.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.030
You can start a company
for almost no money.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.300
Because if you can code, if you
can build, then you can

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.910
start a company.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.050
Validation comes
in many forms.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.280
So if you were to take your
idea to some potential

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.040
co-founders and they're willing
to drop what they're

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.560
doing and come join you to build
this product, that's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.610
validation that this is
an idea that has legs.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.650
If you're able to talk to
advisors who have industry

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.300
knowledge, and they know the
industry and they agree, this

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.670
is an interesting idea, and
they're willing to help you as

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.170
an advisor, that's validation.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.320
If you talk to users and early
potential customers, they'll

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.970
give you advice and help improve
the idea, that's

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.530
validation that it's
something good.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.310
And then, early investors.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.600
Investors are looking
for that validation.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.560
They're looking to see that
there are other people who

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.770
will quit their jobs to come do
what you're talking about.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.320
They're looking for advisers as
validation, that yes, they

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.510
have domain experience, they
understand this and they're

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.920
willing to get involved.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.480
Early use cases from customers
or users, all of those things

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.340
create validation in the minds
of investors so that they're

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.320
willing to put their money in.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.910
MARTIN OMANDER: Because they
won't spend as much time as

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.970
the investor or the co-founder
understanding the idea, so it

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.270
helps them to see that the
adviser or the co-founder

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.520
thinks it's a good idea.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.120
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.410
So investors are looking
for validation from

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.880
all of those areas.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.400
And if it's missing, if it's too
early, and you don't have

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.530
co-founders, or you don't have
early users, or you don't have

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.810
advisers, then the investor is
going to be a little nervous.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.630
Unless they know you very, very
well, they're not going

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.390
to write a check.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.660
Or unless they know this
business and have had

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.650
experience in it, they're not
going to write a check.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.800
So they're looking for
that validate.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.240
MARTIN OMANDER: So get away from
your desk, get out there,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.330
sounds like the way to do it.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.020
DON DODGE: Absolutely.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.780
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.690
Thank you, Don.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.990
That's all for today.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.370
If you have comments or
questions, please leave them

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.770
under the YouTube video in the
comments, and we'll try to get

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.960
back to them in future
episodes.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.450
Thanks for joining us
and see you at the

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.920
same time next week.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.170
Bye.
