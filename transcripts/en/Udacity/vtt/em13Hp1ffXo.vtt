There are five places where you can add the this reference, for the instance

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.240
variable miles driven, for the instance variable miles per gallon and twice

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.250
again for the instance variable gas in tank. It is actually pretty nice. Right

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.910
now, you can clearly tell which ones are the instance variables, and which ones

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.440
are the local variables. So yeah, I kind of like it. then again, it does make

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.460
the code longer. That's not so good. I'm obviously conflicted about whether

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.200
it's a good idea or not. Some people really like it, some people don't like

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.250
that the code gets longer. Now, Sara will go over with you how the, this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.360
reference can be useful in a couple of other cases.
