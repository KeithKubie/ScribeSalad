00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.270
Our second main principle for CS7637 was that learning in KBAI agents is

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.710
often incremental. This means that information or data or

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.970
experiences arrive one at a time. This is one of the key differences between

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.970
knowledge based AI, and other forms of AI, like machine learning. In those

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.920
forms a large amount of information is often given right at the beginning. Here,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.000
our agents learn step by step, incrementally. We first encountered this with

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.390
learning by recording cases. Our agents learned each individual case one by one.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.350
The experiences themselves were the increments in this learning strategy.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.040
Case based reasoning also operated on individual cases, but

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.550
it organized them into much more complex knowledge structures.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.390
Like tagging them in an array. Or organizing the my discrimination tree. But

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.810
the fundamental object of knowledge were still individual cases that arrived one

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.250
by one. We did a complex exercise where one by one we added these new cases into

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.670
our discrimination tree. Incremental concept learning was, as the title suggest,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.450
incremental. Here were received positive and negative examples one at a time.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.870
Based on the difference between our current concept, and our new example, and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.760
whether or not the new example was a positive or negative example.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.700
We would change our concept. This is always done example by example,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.020
incrementally. Version spaces involved a very similar kind of knowledge.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.440
Here experiences came one at a time, and we generalized a specific model and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.810
specialized the general model to converge down to an understanding of

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.120
the concept. Finally, learning by correcting mistakes is also

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.470
deeply incremental. Here, the individual mistakes arrived incrementally, and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.600
based on the individual mistakes, our agent modified it's

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.798
knowledge base to repair the cause of the previous mistake.

00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:41.130
To take away here is that many of our methods in learning, reasoning and memory.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.510
All involve dealing with information that comes incrementally, bit by bit,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.880
instead of processing a large amount of data all at the same time.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.190
One can also see this connects more closely to human experience,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.830
where we're constantly experiencing the world experience by

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.450
experience instead of being given a lifetime of experiences all at once.
