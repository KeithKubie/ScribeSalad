technology helped provide answers to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900
technology helped provide answers to
 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.780
technology helped provide answers to
challenges that typically have suffered

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790
challenges that typically have suffered
 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.520
challenges that typically have suffered
from lack of technology that have

from lack of technology that have
 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.770

that voting works in the United States

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
that voting works in the United States
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.550
that voting works in the United States
there's a and I I think of this in three

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560
there's a and I I think of this in three
 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.680
there's a and I I think of this in three
distinct phases right there's the phase

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690
distinct phases right there's the phase
 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.410
distinct phases right there's the phase
before voting we're keeping track of who

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420
before voting we're keeping track of who
 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.960
before voting we're keeping track of who
is registered to vote and where they're

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970
is registered to vote and where they're
 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.780
is registered to vote and where they're
allowed to vote has seems it's been

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790
allowed to vote has seems it's been
 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.280
allowed to vote has seems it's been
harder than it should have been right we

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290
harder than it should have been right we
 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.750
harder than it should have been right we
have a lot of examples of people showing

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760
have a lot of examples of people showing
 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.790
have a lot of examples of people showing
up at polling places and being denied

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800
up at polling places and being denied
 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
up at polling places and being denied
the right to vote and it seems like

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810
the right to vote and it seems like
 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.390
the right to vote and it seems like
paperwork goes missing and people get

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400
paperwork goes missing and people get
 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.920
paperwork goes missing and people get
removed from voting rolls that sort of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930
removed from voting rolls that sort of
 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.280
removed from voting rolls that sort of
thing

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290
thing
 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.819
thing
a public ledger that tracked who is

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829
a public ledger that tracked who is
 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.800
a public ledger that tracked who is
registered to vote where and allowed

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810
registered to vote where and allowed
 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.360
registered to vote where and allowed
people to look at that from their home

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370
people to look at that from their home
 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.920
people to look at that from their home
machine and then confirm that when they

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930
machine and then confirm that when they
 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.930
machine and then confirm that when they
showed up at the poll would do a lot to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940
showed up at the poll would do a lot to
 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.470
showed up at the poll would do a lot to
reestablish trust in the process of

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480
reestablish trust in the process of
 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.750
reestablish trust in the process of
registering to vote and validating that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760
registering to vote and validating that
 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.790
registering to vote and validating that
everybody who is entitled to vote is

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800
everybody who is entitled to vote is
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.289
everybody who is entitled to vote is
able to do that right providing an

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299
able to do that right providing an
 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.899
able to do that right providing an
independent verification of that the

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909
independent verification of that the
 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.730
independent verification of that the
third there's a second phase I'll get to

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740
third there's a second phase I'll get to
 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.230
third there's a second phase I'll get to
in a bit but there's a third phase which

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240
in a bit but there's a third phase which
 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.120
in a bit but there's a third phase which
is after the vote when you're taking the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130
is after the vote when you're taking the
 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.919
is after the vote when you're taking the
totals that come from a polling place

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929
totals that come from a polling place
 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:14.940
totals that come from a polling place
that come from

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950
that come from
 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.160
that come from
you know vote by mail for example in

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170
you know vote by mail for example in
 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.800
you know vote by mail for example in
Oregon we have to kind of trust that the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
Oregon we have to kind of trust that the
 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.690
Oregon we have to kind of trust that the
system works right we have to hope that

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700
system works right we have to hope that
 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.429
system works right we have to hope that
everything's counted correctly at the

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439
everything's counted correctly at the
 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.649
everything's counted correctly at the
local level and then it's totaled up

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659
local level and then it's totaled up
 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.209
local level and then it's totaled up
correctly at the state level and then

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219
correctly at the state level and then
 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.149
correctly at the state level and then
reported nationally etc and we're

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159
reported nationally etc and we're
 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.410
reported nationally etc and we're
fortunately at a point where that that

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420
fortunately at a point where that that
 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.300
fortunately at a point where that that
the the rebase is of that trust hasn't

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
the the rebase is of that trust hasn't
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.889
the the rebase is of that trust hasn't
been violated yet but in many countries

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899
been violated yet but in many countries
 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.539
been violated yet but in many countries
it is in many countries there's not a

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549
it is in many countries there's not a
 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.519
it is in many countries there's not a
lot of confidence that the total from a

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.529
lot of confidence that the total from a
 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.580
lot of confidence that the total from a
polling place is actually I actually

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590
polling place is actually I actually
 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.519
polling place is actually I actually
some doubt right so using a distributed

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:44.529
some doubt right so using a distributed
 

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:46.440
some doubt right so using a distributed
ledger not to track the individual votes

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
ledger not to track the individual votes
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.899
ledger not to track the individual votes
but to track the totals from each of the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909
but to track the totals from each of the
 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.940
but to track the totals from each of the
polling places would be a way to allow

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
polling places would be a way to allow
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.550
polling places would be a way to allow
the public to understand okay the local

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560
the public to understand okay the local
 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.230
the public to understand okay the local
polling place I went and voted at is

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240
polling place I went and voted at is
 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.660
polling place I went and voted at is
reporting a thousand votes 500 for

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670
reporting a thousand votes 500 for
 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.969
reporting a thousand votes 500 for
candidate X 500 for candidate Y that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979
candidate X 500 for candidate Y that
 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.409
candidate X 500 for candidate Y that
seems about right I don't know if my

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:01.419
seems about right I don't know if my
 

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:03.389
seems about right I don't know if my
vote specifically counted but I know

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399
vote specifically counted but I know
 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.949
vote specifically counted but I know
that at least the polling place that was

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959
that at least the polling place that was
 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.480
that at least the polling place that was
that counted appropriately and they

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490
that counted appropriately and they
 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.190
that counted appropriately and they
didn't try to be pretend they were a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200
didn't try to be pretend they were a
 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.020
didn't try to be pretend they were a
hundred thousand votes right so at the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030
hundred thousand votes right so at the
 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.610
hundred thousand votes right so at the
beginning of that process and the tail

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620
beginning of that process and the tail
 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.080
beginning of that process and the tail
end of that process using a public

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
end of that process using a public
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.000
end of that process using a public
distributed ledger to record that makes

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
distributed ledger to record that makes
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.990
distributed ledger to record that makes
a lot of sense

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
a lot of sense
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.820
a lot of sense
but in the middle the actual act of

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830
but in the middle the actual act of
 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.400
but in the middle the actual act of
walking into a booth and cat registering

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
walking into a booth and cat registering
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.710
walking into a booth and cat registering
a vote or a lot of people want to do

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
a vote or a lot of people want to do
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.960
a vote or a lot of people want to do
voting by mobile device or by by

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970
voting by mobile device or by by
 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.050
voting by mobile device or by by
computer I'm very worried about that the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
computer I'm very worried about that the
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.000
computer I'm very worried about that the
digitization of that our computers fail

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
digitization of that our computers fail
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.280
digitization of that our computers fail
us all the time and malware and other

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
us all the time and malware and other
 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.710
us all the time and malware and other
other threats could really step in and

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720
other threats could really step in and
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.180
other threats could really step in and
make it so that I think I'm voting for

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190
make it so that I think I'm voting for
 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.949
make it so that I think I'm voting for
one candidate but ever it gets recorded

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959
one candidate but ever it gets recorded
 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.260
one candidate but ever it gets recorded
for another right and we have to think

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
for another right and we have to think
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.180
for another right and we have to think
in the United States we care quite a bit

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
in the United States we care quite a bit
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.920
in the United States we care quite a bit
about the confidentiality of our vote

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
about the confidentiality of our vote
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.199
about the confidentiality of our vote
even to the point where I get no receipt

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209
even to the point where I get no receipt
 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.880
even to the point where I get no receipt
right I can't go to a bar and prove that

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890
right I can't go to a bar and prove that
 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.440
right I can't go to a bar and prove that
I voted for somebody and get a discount

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
I voted for somebody and get a discount
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.640
I voted for somebody and get a discount
for it right that would be considered

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
for it right that would be considered
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.160
for it right that would be considered
bribery so we can't simply come up with

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
bribery so we can't simply come up with
 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.630
bribery so we can't simply come up with
a system that puts all the original

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640
a system that puts all the original
 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.729
a system that puts all the original
votes into a public ledger and provides

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739
votes into a public ledger and provides
 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.920
votes into a public ledger and provides
proof that somebody voted away a certain

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930
proof that somebody voted away a certain
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.600
proof that somebody voted away a certain
way or that becomes a corruptive process

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610
way or that becomes a corruptive process
 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.640
way or that becomes a corruptive process
so I think we still need voter verified

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
so I think we still need voter verified
 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.920
so I think we still need voter verified
paper ballots as a path to auditing but

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930
paper ballots as a path to auditing but
 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.170
paper ballots as a path to auditing but
with the the registration the beginning

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180
with the the registration the beginning
 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.970
with the the registration the beginning
and the summing at the end conducted by
