00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.980
The answer for which column is relatively straightforward. U goes from 0 to 1

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.537
and there are 512 columns starting at 0. I multiply the U of 0.02 by 512 and

00:00:11.537 --> 00:00:15.930
get 102.4. I drop the fraction to get the texel column. As you'll recall from

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.850
an earlier exercise, we drop the fraction. For the row, if I were to make the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.790
lower left corner to be texel 0,0, then we would simply multiply again and be

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.030
done. Row 358 would be the answer. However, counting from the upper left corner

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.299
is what we want. Think about the relationship. The lower corner's row 0 is the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.080
upper corner's 511, and vice versa. To convert from one to the other, we

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.620
subtract the row from 511. For example, row number 1 at the bottom is indeed

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.520
row number 510 when counting from the top. Subtracting 358 from 511 gives us

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.679
row 153.
