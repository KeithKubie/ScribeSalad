Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we're finally, at

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.200
long last, moving on from the structures and
branches of government and onto the structures

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.339
and branches of trees. This is a nature show
now.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.780
Okay, we're not moving on completely, because
we're still talking about courts, but today

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.960
we'll be discussing actual court decisions,
and the kind of things that courts rule on,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.780
rather than how they do it. That's right,
we're moving onto civil rights and civil liberties.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:33.780
[Theme Music]

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.420
Okay, first I want to talk about something
that I find confusing: the difference between

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.460
civil rights and civil liberties. Usually in America,
we use the terms interchangeably, which adds

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
to the confusion, but lawyers and political scientists
draw a distinction, so you should know about it.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.980
Then you can go back to calling civil liberties "rights"
and civil rights "liberties," and most people won't care.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.940
But I'll care. I'll be disappointed in you.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.489
So civil liberties are limitations placed
on the government. Basically, they are things

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.629
the government can't do that might interfere
with your personal freedom.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.199
Civil rights are curbs on the power of majorities
to make decisions that would benefit some

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.110
at the expense of others. Basically, civil
rights are guarantees of equal citizenship,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.100
and they mean that citizens are protected
from discrimination by majorities.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.280
Take, for example, same sex marriage. You
could think of it as a liberty, except that

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.250
not everyone is free to marry at any given
time. Six year olds can't get married, and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.590
you can't marry your sibling.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.740
But same sex marriage is a civil rights issue
because in the states that don't allow it, the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.360
majority of voters is denying something to a minority,
creating inequality in the way that the laws work.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.110
Now, just to make things more confusing, lawyers
often talk about the difference between substantive

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.730
and procedural liberties, but they usually
call them rights instead of liberties.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.540
That's a lawyer eagle. A legal eagle.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.060
Substantive liberties are limits on what the
government can do. For example, the first

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.000
amendment says that congress shall make no
law establishing religion. So this means that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320
they cannot create a national church or declare
that Christianity or Islam or Hinduism is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.859
the official religion of the US.

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.000
Procedural liberties are limits on how the
government can act. For example, in America

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.950
in courtroom dramas, there is a presumption
that someone is innocent until proven guilty.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.259
This presumption means that in criminal cases,
juries and judges have to act as though the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.380
accused is innocent until the prosecution
convinces them otherwise. If they are not

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.289
convinced, the accused person doesn't go to
prison.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.789
So now that we understand the difference between
civil rights and civil liberties perfectly

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.810
because of my amazing explanation, let's focus
on liberties and try to figure out what they

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.670
are and where they come from, with some help
from Thought Bubble.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.709
So civil liberties are contained in the incredibly
unhelpfully named "Bill of Rights," which

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.360
isn't even called that in the Constitution.
It's just a name that we give to the first 10 amendments.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.180
The 9th amendment is included to remind us
that the list of liberties and/or rights in

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.900
the other amendments isn't exhaustive. There
might be other rights out there, but the constitution

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.610
doesn't specifically say what they are. Thanks
constitution.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.019
In some cases, it's pretty clear. The first
amendment, for example, says that "congress

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.030
shall make no law respecting the establishment
of religion, or abridging the free exercise

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.290
thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech
or of the press to assemble or to infringe

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.950
the right to petition the government for redress
of grievances." Pretty straight forward.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.459
But other cases are not so clear.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.230
The second amendment says "the right to keep
and bear arms shall not be infringed," but

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.209
it doesn't say by whom. Same thing with the
5th amendment guarantees against self incrimination.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.260
Could congress force you to incriminate yourself?
How would they do that?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.879
And the 8th amendment prohibits cruel and
unusual punishments, like presumably shock

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.170
pens, but it doesn't say who is forbidden
from cruelly and unusually punishing. My mom

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.500
wasn't forbidden from keeping me from playing
video games.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.980
As usual, we might expect the Supreme Court
to sort out this mess, but initially they

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.480
were no help at all. In a case that you've
probably never heard of, called Barron vs.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.790
Baltimore, decided in 1833, the court said
that the Bill of Rights applied to the national,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.750
meaning federal government, not to the states.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.370
They said that every American has dual citizenship,
but not the good kind. They meant you are

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.090
a citizen of the US and of the state in which
you reside, and basically that the constitution

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.909
only protected you from the federal government.

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.669
In other words, if the state of Indiana wanted
to punish me cruelly or unusually, they could.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.819
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So Barron vs. Baltimore
left Americans in a bit of a civil liberties

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.750
pickle, and not the good kind of pickle.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.159
They were protected from the national government
doing terrible things, like quartering troops

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.730
in their homes, but not from the state doing
the same thing.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.180
And since the state was close to home and
the national government was far away and,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.430
compared with today, tiny and weak, these
protections were pretty weaksauce, so what

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.290
happened to change this? I hope something,
because I like a zesty government sauce.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.579
The 14th amendment &amp; the Supreme Court happened.
After the Civil War, as part of the reconstruction,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.420
the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments were added
to the constitution. Of these, the 14th is

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.420
the most important, probably the most important
of all amendments. What does it say?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.739
Well the first section, which is the one that
really matters, and I'm not going to read

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.610
the whole thing okay? It reads "all persons
born or naturalized in the United States and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.030
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens
of the United States and of the state wherein

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.720
they reside. No state shall make or enforce
any law which shall abridge the privileges

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.810
or immunities of citizens of the United States.
Nor shall any state deprive any person of

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.419
life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.050
the equal protection of the laws."

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.690
What this means is that the federal government's
like: "Listen states, you can't be dumb. Just

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.590
stop it. Okay? We're all in this together.
Alright?" It means states can't deny equal

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.130
protection, civil rights, or due process,
which in this case encompasses civil liberties.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.040
This in theory makes it impossible for states
to infringe upon the liberties and the Bill of Rights.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.280
But the legal system being what it is, it's
not quite that simple. Did you think it'd

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.030
be simple? The Supreme Court could have just
ruled that all the rights and liberties in

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.139
the Bill of Rights applied to the states,
which seems to be what the 14th amendment

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.220
implies, but they didn't. Instead they ruled
that each of the rights or liberties had to

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.910
be incorporated against the states on a case-by-case
basis.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.340
This is a concept called selective incorporation,
and it supposedly reserves more power to the states.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.860
What it really means is that when people
felt that the states were violating their liberties,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.440
they had to go to the Supreme Court, which by now
has incorporated almost every clause in the Bill of Rights against the states.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.310
You want examples? We've got them. In the
famous case of Gitlow vs. New York, the court

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.630
ruled that the first amendment protection
of the freedom of speech could not be violated

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.039
by a state. In this case, it was New York,
but once a liberty is incorporated against

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.169
one state, it's incorporated against all of
them. In Mapp vs. Ohio, the court ruled that

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.039
states couldn't use evidence gathered from
warrantless searches. In Benton vs. Maryland,

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.789
the right against Double Jeopardy, being tried
for the same crime twice, was incorporated

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.940
against the states. By now, almost all the
rights and liberties mentioned in the first

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.479
ten Amendments have been incorporated against
the states. This means that individuals are

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.319
protected from all their governments taking
away their liberties, and that's a good thing.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.610
I loves my liberties.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.569
So we'll be talking about civil rights and
civil liberties for a number of episodes,

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.220
and this topic, while confusing, can be lots
of fun. We might play liberties bingo, or

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.599
civil rights kickball. I don't know what those
things are, but they sound like fun. The main

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.479
thing to remember is that going all the way
back to the framers, Americans have been concerned

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.370
about a too powerful government taking away
citizens' freedoms. Yes, these liberties apply

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.580
mostly to citizens, although some do apply
to non-citizens, too. In order to put limits

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.569
on government, the Bill of Rights was added
to the Constitution in 1789, but this didn't

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.370
mean that those limits applied to the states,
probably because the founders expected states

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.919
to be the main protectors of rights, and in
fact, many state constitutions have provisions

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.449
that copy or in some ways, go beyond what's
in the US Constitution. Only after the 14th

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.190
Amendment was passed, following the Civil
War, did the national government get around

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.970
to addressing this issue of states denying
people's liberties. Even then, it took numerous

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.169
court cases for us to get to the point that
most civil liberties that we assume cannot

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.979
be taken away by the government have actually
been guaranteed through the process of selective

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.220
incorporation. It's taken a long time to get
where we are, and there's still a long way

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.970
to go. Protecting civil liberties requires
vigilant citizens to be aware of the ways

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.569
that government is overstepping its bounds,
but that's only half the equation. It's also

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.000
vital that our majority pay attention the
civil rights of others, and that we ensure

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that everyone is afforded the same protections
and benefits promised by our system of law.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.720
