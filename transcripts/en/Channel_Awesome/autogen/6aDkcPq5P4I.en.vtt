don't usually talk about but the sound

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
don't usually talk about but the sound
 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.319
don't usually talk about but the sound
design and the sound direction on this

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329
design and the sound direction on this
 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.960
design and the sound direction on this
was really good and I'm thinking

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970
was really good and I'm thinking
 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.449
was really good and I'm thinking
specifically when the guy with the eye

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
specifically when the guy with the eye
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.130
specifically when the guy with the eye
on his head I don't know his name but he

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140
on his head I don't know his name but he
 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.580
on his head I don't know his name but he
can make stuff explode with it he comes

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590
can make stuff explode with it he comes
 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.729
can make stuff explode with it he comes
out and this thing shoots from his head

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739
out and this thing shoots from his head
 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.490
out and this thing shoots from his head
and they do that wonderful trick where

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500
and they do that wonderful trick where
 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.949
and they do that wonderful trick where
they have this loud sound and then like

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959
they have this loud sound and then like
 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.229
they have this loud sound and then like
a half second of silence before the big

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239
a half second of silence before the big
 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.479
a half second of silence before the big
explosion and that's surprisingly very

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489
explosion and that's surprisingly very
 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.569
explosion and that's surprisingly very
effective and on top of that the sound

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579
effective and on top of that the sound
 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.660
effective and on top of that the sound
of it coming out it's not like a giant

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670
of it coming out it's not like a giant
 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.759
of it coming out it's not like a giant
shoe or anything really loud it's this

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769
shoe or anything really loud it's this
 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.680
shoe or anything really loud it's this
very piece very quiet little snaps

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690
very piece very quiet little snaps
 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.710
very piece very quiet little snaps
almost sort of like small fireworks and
