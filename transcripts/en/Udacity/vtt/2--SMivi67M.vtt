00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.024
Looking at our original inequality, and the signs of these different quantities

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:07.800
that we've come up with for these various intervals, I'd like you to check off

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.458
which of these intervals, or values of x, does seem to satisfy our original

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:15.394
inequality. Then I'd like you to write the solution as an inequality in this

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:15.665
box.
