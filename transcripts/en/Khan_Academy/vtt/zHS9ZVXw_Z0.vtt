00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.408
- [Voiceover] We're told Divya
is seated on a Ferris Wheel

00:00:02.408 --> 00:00:04.217
at time t equals zero.

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:06.683
The graph below shows her height h

00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:10.350
in meters, t seconds
after the ride starts.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.350
So at time equals zero, she
is, looks like about two,

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:17.551
what is this, this
would be one and a half,

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:22.290
so it looks like she's about
two meters off the ground

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.384
and then as time
increases, she gets as high

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:30.364
as, it looks like this is
close to 30, maybe 34 meters

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:34.284
and then she comes back
down, looks like two meters

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:38.434
and up to 34 meters again,
so let's read the question.

00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:43.249
So the question asks us,
approximately how long

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.484
does it take Divya to complete one

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:47.818
revolution on the Ferris Wheel?

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.018
All right, so this is
interesting, so this is when

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:52.351
she's at the bottom of the Ferris Wheel,

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:55.151
so then she gets to the
top of the Ferris Wheel,

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.617
and then she keeps rotating until she gets

00:00:57.617 --> 00:01:00.418
back to the bottom of
the Ferris Wheel again.

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:05.405
So it took her 60 and t
is in terms of seconds.

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:08.017
So it took her 60 seconds
to go from the bottom

00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:10.218
to the bottom again, and
in another 60 seconds,

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:12.817
she would have completed
another revolution.

00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:15.784
And so let me fill that in, it is going

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.650
to take her 60 seconds, 60 seconds,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.000
and we of course can check
our answer if we like.

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:26.084
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:29.484
So here we have,

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:31.950
a doctor observes the electrical activity

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.451
of Finn's heart over a period of time.

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.885
The electrical activity of
Finn's heart is cyclical,

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:39.718
as we hope it would be, and peaks

00:01:39.718 --> 00:01:41.985
every 0.9 seconds.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:43.385
Which of the following graphs could model

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.850
the situation if t stands
for time in seconds,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.517
and e stands for the electrical activity

00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:49.452
of Finn's heart in volts?

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.618
Over here it looks like
we peaked at zero seconds,

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:53.518
and then here we're peaking
a little bit more than one,

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:57.151
this looks maybe at 1.1,
maybe at 2.2 and 3.3.

00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:58.818
This looks like it's
peaking a little bit more

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:01.584
than every one second, so
like maybe every 1.1 seconds,

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:04.984
not every 0.9 seconds, so I'd rule out A.

00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:07.783
This one is peaking, it
looks like the interval

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:09.884
between peaks is less than a second,

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:11.417
but it looks like a good
bit less than a second.

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:13.251
It looks like maybe every three quarters

00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:16.185
of a second, or maybe every
four-fifths of a second.

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:18.118
Not quite nine-tenths,
nine-tenths this first peak

00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:20.017
would be a little bit closer to one,

00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:22.085
but this one is close.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:23.684
Choice C is looking good.

00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:25.508
The first we're at zero,
then the first peak,

00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:27.617
this looks pretty close to
one but it's less than one.

00:02:27.617 --> 00:02:31.351
It looks like a tenth less
than one, so I like choice C.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.784
Now choice D, it looks like we're peaking

00:02:32.784 --> 00:02:34.917
every half-second, so
it's definitely not that.

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:38.084
So this looks like a peak
of every 0.9 seconds.

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:41.185
This is the best representation that I...

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:43.552
This is the best representation
that I can think of.

00:02:43.552 --> 00:02:44.950
And you can actually verify that.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.150
If you have a peak every 0.9 seconds,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.484
you're going to have four
peaks in 3.6 seconds.

00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:53.954
So one, two, three, four, this looks

00:02:53.954 --> 00:02:56.118
like it's at 3.6.

00:02:56.118 --> 00:02:59.018
Over here, you have one, two, three, four,

00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:01.851
you've had four peaks in
less than three seconds.

00:03:01.851 --> 00:03:04.879
So this one definitely isn't 0.9.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.221
So instead of just even forcing yourself

00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.085
to eyeball just between
this peak and that peak,

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:10.985
you can say well, if
we're every 0.9 seconds,

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.017
how long would three
peaks take or four peaks,

00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:14.850
and then you can actually
get a little bit more precise

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.684
as you try to eyeball it.

00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:19.834
So we can check our answer and
verify that we got it right.
