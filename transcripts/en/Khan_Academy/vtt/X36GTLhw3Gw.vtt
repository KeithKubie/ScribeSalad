00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:02.695
- [Voiceover] Hopefully we
all remember our good friend

00:00:02.695 --> 00:00:06.571
the chain rule from differential calculus

00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.928
that tells us that if I were to take

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:10.146
the derivative with respect to x

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:15.146
of g of f of x, g of, let me write those

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:20.165
parentheses a little
bit closer, g of f of x,

00:00:21.117 --> 00:00:24.218
g of f of x, that this is just going

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:27.610
to be equal to the derivative of g

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.046
with respect to f of
x, so we can write that

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:33.338
as g prime of f of x.

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:37.592
G prime of f of x, times the derivative

00:00:37.592 --> 00:00:42.592
of f with respect to
x, times f prime of x.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.443
And if you want to see it in the other

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:48.653
notation, I guess you
could say, it would be,

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:49.851
you could write this part right

00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:52.736
over here as the derivative of g

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:57.643
with respect to f times
the derivative of f.

00:00:57.643 --> 00:00:59.995
The derivative of f with respect to x,

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:01.138
and that's going to give you the

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:03.899
derivative of g with respect to x.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.974
This is just a review,
this is the chain rule

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:07.854
that you remember from, or hopefully

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:10.663
remember, from differential calculus.

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:12.390
It's hard to get, it's hard to get too far

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.378
in calculus without really grokking,

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:18.243
really understanding the chain rule.

00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:20.481
So what I want to do here
is, well if this is true,

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.541
then can't we go the other way around?

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:26.109
If I wanted to take the integral of this,

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.377
if I wanted to take
the integral of g prime

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:35.377
of f of x, g prime of f of x, times

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:42.006
f prime of x, dx, well, this
should just be equal to,

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:46.979
this should just be equal to g of f of x,

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.841
g of f of x, and then
of course whenever I'm

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:52.603
taking an indefinite integral g of,

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:53.782
let me make sure they're the same color,

00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:56.777
g of f of x, so I just swapped sides,

00:01:56.777 --> 00:01:58.189
I'm going the other way.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.989
So if I'm taking the indefinite integral,

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.143
wouldn't it just be equal to this?

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:02.833
And of course I can't forget that

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:04.364
I could have a constant
here now that might

00:02:04.364 --> 00:02:06.085
have been introduced, because if I take

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.603
the derivative, the constant disappears.

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:11.238
And so this idea, you
could really just call

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:13.357
the reverse chain rule.

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:18.357
Reverse, reverse chain,
the reverse chain rule.

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:21.243
Which is essentially, or it's exactly

00:02:21.243 --> 00:02:23.339
what we did with
u-substitution, we just did it

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.174
a little bit more methodically
with u-substitution.

00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:26.924
And we'll see that in a second, but before

00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:28.834
we see how u-substitution relates to

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.700
what I just wrote down
here, let's actually

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.763
apply it and see where it's useful.

00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:34.902
And this is really a way
of doing u-substitution

00:02:34.902 --> 00:02:37.153
without having to do
u-substitution, or doing

00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:39.071
u-substitution in your head, or doing

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:42.201
u-substitution-like problems
a little bit faster.

00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.094
So let me give you an example.

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:46.498
So let's say that we had, and I'm going to

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:47.989
color code it so that it jumps out at you

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.000
a little bit more, let's say that we had

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.232
sine of x, and I'm going
to write it this way,

00:02:53.232 --> 00:02:56.820
I could write it, so let's say sine of x,

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.836
sine of x squared, and
obviously the typical

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:07.254
convention, the typical,
the sine of x squared,

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.024
the typical convention
would be to put the squared

00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:10.824
right over here, but I'm
going to write it like this,

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:12.669
and I think you might
be able to guess why.

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.231
Sine of x squared times cosine of x.

00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:17.998
Times, actually, I'll do this in a,

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.600
let me do this in a different color.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.600
Times cosine of x, times cosine of x.

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.413
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:03:27.413 --> 00:03:29.827
and think about, does it
meet this pattern here,

00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:33.090
and if so, what is this
indefinite integral going to be?

00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:35.760
Well let's think about it.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.383
If f of x is sine of x,
what's the derivative of that?

00:03:39.383 --> 00:03:41.666
What's f prime of x?

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.130
Well f prime of x in that circumstance

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.417
is going to be cosine of x, and what is g?

00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:52.222
Well g is whatever you
input into g squared.

00:03:52.222 --> 00:03:53.812
So what's this going to be if we

00:03:53.812 --> 00:03:56.066
just do the reverse chain rule?

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:58.594
Well this is going to be, well we take

00:03:58.594 --> 00:04:01.834
sorry, g prime is taking
whatever this thing is,

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:05.577
squared, so g is going
to be the anti-derivative

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:06.640
of that, so it's going to be taking

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.388
something to the third power and then

00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:11.783
dividing it by three, so let's do that.

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:15.680
So if we essentially
take the anti-derivative

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.989
here with respect to sine of x,

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.116
instead of with respect
to x, you're going to get

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:22.977
you're going to get sine of x,

00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:28.793
sine of x to the, to the third power

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.388
over three, and then of course

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:37.616
you have the, you have the plus c.

00:04:37.616 --> 00:04:38.902
And if you don't believe this, just take

00:04:38.902 --> 00:04:40.610
the derivative of this,
you'll have to employ

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.994
the chain rule and
you'll get exactly this.

00:04:42.994 --> 00:04:44.726
And you say well wait,
how does this relate

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:46.156
to u-substitution?

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:47.953
Well in u-substitution you would have said

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:51.076
u equals sine of x,
then du would have been

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:54.305
cosine of x, dx, and
actually let me just do that.

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:56.277
That actually might clear
things up a little bit.

00:04:56.277 --> 00:05:00.578
You would set this to be u, and then this,

00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:02.634
all of this business right over here,

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.723
would then be du, and then you would have

00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:08.858
the integral, you would have the integral

00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:13.858
u squared, u squared, I don't have to

00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:19.118
put parentheses around it, u squared, du.

00:05:19.562 --> 00:05:22.428
U squared, du, well, let me do that

00:05:22.428 --> 00:05:26.089
in that orange color, u squared, du.

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.471
Well that's pretty straightforward,

00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:31.464
this is going to be equal to u, this is

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.236
going to be equal to u to the third power

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:39.463
over three, plus c,
which is equal to what?

00:05:39.463 --> 00:05:41.146
Well we just said u is equal to sine of x,

00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:43.073
you reverse substitute, and you're going

00:05:43.073 --> 00:05:45.244
to get exactly that right over here.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.253
So when we talk about
the reverse chain rule,

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:51.120
it's essentially just doing
u-substitution in our head.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.056
So in the next few examples,
I will do exactly that.
