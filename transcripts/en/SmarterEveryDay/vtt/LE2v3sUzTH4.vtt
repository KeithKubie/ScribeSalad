[music]

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.080
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.100
I am crossing the street in Atlanta Georgia, you can see the dome in the background

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.190
and I'm at Georgia State University and I've got a box of butterfly wings. I'm trying to unravel

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.230
a mystery that I uncovered in the rainforest. We discovered that when we dropped

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.260
a butterfly and he started to fly off, pixie dust would fly off his wings.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.320
At least that's what I call it. Check it out.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.340
[music]

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:56.500
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.980
 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.580
So to figure out what this is we came to the Petit Science Center here at Georgia State University. We're going to the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
biological imaging center. Dr Simmons? Nice to meet you.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.650
- Good to meet you.
- I brought you some butterflies.
- Oh cool.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.680
(Destin) Ooh so this is where you work huh?
- This is where I live.
- Let's do it.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.710
- Come on in.
- So if you watched the last episode you're aware that these little dust particles are actually

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.740
scales coming off the butterfly's wings. What we don't know however is how

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.790
are those scales attached to the wing in the first place. Dr Simmons happens to

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.830
be an expert microscopist and he's agreed to give us a little lesson in scanning electron

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.850
microscopes. So Dr Simmons just drew all this and I'm gonna try

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.890
to summarize it. You tell me if I get this wrong OK?
- OK.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.930
- OK so we have tungsten up here. We start a flow of electrons here, and as it

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.980
comes out we go through what you're calling electromagnetic lenses?
- Yes.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.990
- OK and so we vary the beam and then we start to scan that beam across

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.020
whatever it is, in this case a butterfly wing.
- Butterfly wing.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.090
- Depending on where we are in the scan, we measure how many secondary electrons we get off

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.110
the sample, using our electron multiplier?

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.130
- It's sort of an electron detector.
- And then we run that through some filters and we're able to get

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.160
a grey scale image. Is that basically it?
- That's basically it.
- We are now experts

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.980
on scanning electron microscopes. Would you say that?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.250
- Oh yeah.
- [laughs] Alright, time for science. Goggle up. Probably the coolest goggles I've ever been given,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.260
not gonna lie. OK here's the question. We have three different types of butterfly wings here,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.290
we have a sunset moth which technically isn't a butterfly. We have a morpho

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.310
butterfly wing and then we have a cithaerius. What we're gonna do is Dr Simmons

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.400
is gonna use the scanning electron microscope to show us the difference in the wings.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.420
Now what I think is interesting about the cithaerius is that it goes from

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.470
a scaled wing to a transparent wing.
- The unfortunate thing here is that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.510
this is destructive testing.
- It is what it is man. We gotta do it.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.580
[music]

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.350
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.690
(Destin) On the scanning electron microscope we're gonna be bombarding it with electrons and you're gonna have this huge

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.740
charge difference, but the problem is butterfly wings are insulators,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.750
am I saying this right Dr Simmons?
- You got it.
- Alright. So we have to discharge that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.800
voltage, or I guess it's just potential, we have to discharge that back to ground

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.820
and the way we do that is we have gold all over the butterfly wing so that it has a path

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.880
to ground. Can you give me a countdown to science?
- OK. 3.. 2..

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900
1.. I'm gonna hit start.
- Cool.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.910
So that's a gold cloud?
- These are golden and palladium

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.960
atoms flying around in an ionized argon atmosphere.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.020
-Looks a little different.
- Looks a little different. That's got a fairly heavy coat on it.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.040
- So that's gold.
- 60% gold, 40% palladium.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.080
(Destin) Alright here we go. It's taken Dr Simmons years of experience

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.120
in biology, physics and optics to create.. this.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.170
 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.220
[music]

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.470
 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.300
Check it out. You can see that these two butterfly scales right next to each other have different textures.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.320
The little holes in the one on the right are less than a micron across.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.350
Now I've heard that butterfly wings are colored by holes in them, so you'd think that the one on the right is colored

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.400
right? Well I did a little cross check and I figured out that the ones with the open lattice

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.420
structure are actually black. Because SEM uses electrons instead of

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.440
light, it can't provide color, so it's common for scientists to create false color images

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.460
to help people understand what they're looking at. Check it out again, this time with false color.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.070
 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.520
OK Let's look at the morpho. You can see that the tops of the wings are blue, but the bottom has some kind of

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.540
brownish-tan color. If we scan it we can see that these tan scales have small holes

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.560
in them but the blue scales have some kind of ridge in them. Now if we measure the width of these

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.600
ridges it turns out that it's at the exact same wavelength as yellow light. White light

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.660
minus yellow light is equal to blue light, so somehow

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.700
these ridges are removing the yellow light and making the wing look blue. If we were to take this scale

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.740
and cut it right here and go look along those ridges, kind of like we're looking through a canyon,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.750
you would see a baffled nanostructure that's amazing. As white light

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.760
comes in, this nanostructure is the perfect size to interact with the

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.780
wavelength of visible light and strip out the yellow. That leaves blue left

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.810
and that's where the morpho gets its color. On this goliath birdwing butterfly

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.890
those baffled nanostructures strip out the red and the blue which leaves you with

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.960
green. After thinking about this I realized that if I were to somehow fill up these baffles

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.010
so that they couldn't interact with the light, I should be able to see the pigment of the wing as it really

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.020
is, instead of this pseudocolor. So here we go. When I coat the wings with

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.070
isoproponol you can see that the wing loses its irradiance because these nanostructures fill up.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.110
But as soon as it evaporates off, these brilliant colors return. So there you have it.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.160
Butterflies use nanotechnology to lie about their color.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.170
But we still haven't answered our question. How are these scales attached to the wing?

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.230
Like this. It's almost as if someone deliberately planted trees in a

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.290
nice evenly spaced row. I think it's beautiful. Through normal wear and tear,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.310
even aerodynamic drag along the wings, these scales are somehow plucked out of these roots

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.330
leaving these hollow stumps. So every time you rub a butterfly wing that's what you're doing.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.380
You remember that cethaerius I was talking about right? It's got scales on one side and it gradually

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.420
fades to a transparent wing. So I took some photos under my microscope to figure out

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.480
exactly what colors we should use for the false color, and I discovered that not only are there scales

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.520
but there appears to be some type of hairs. When I took this to Dr Simmons I learned two things.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.540
Number one, I know the color of the scales are pink because I took a picture of it,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.560
but they have those hole structures like we saw earlier. That's weird. So it looks like there's

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.600
actually pigment involved. And number two, the hairs are not hairs.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.650
I mean look at this thing. That is crazy. What is going on and why?

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.660
I mean there's a nanostructure but it doesn't appear to be an optically driven

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.680
phenomenon because this is on a transparent part of the wing. Why would the butterfly need

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.710
this? I mean, the information required to build something like this

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.840
and the energy that goes into something like this is incredible. So why does he need it?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.860
For just a second, let's all agree on this. Something as simple

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.880
as a butterfly contains complicated mysteries that you and I will never understand.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.980
And that.. that's beautiful.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Wow. That's awesome.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.020
So thank you very much for your time. A video like this is very hard to put together and often it requires

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.030
a lot of people, like Dr Simmons for example, genius.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.080
There is also Larom who colorized all the SEM images, which are on the Facebook page

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.140
if you'd like to download them yourself. Also Henry from Minute Physics. He took the time to make that

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.170
zoom animation for me. I couldn'ta done that myself, that was great. Gordon wrote the music,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.200
just a lot of people. But probably most importantly is audible.com,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.260
because they provide money for me to do things like

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.290
drive to Atlanta, so they are sponsoring Smarter Every Day. So if you would consider

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.340

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.450
Biomimicry and how nature is inspiring innovation. There's some biomimicry

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.480
stuff here I'm gonna talk about in the next episode that I think you'll like, but anyway more importantly

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.600
you're getting Smarter Every Day. Thanks for your time. Have a good one.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.620
(Destin) Did she not just say she wanted to be on the video?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.660
- You want to get the maximum likes, you need to put me on your video.
- Really? You have no idea.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.680
There's nothing on this little caterpillar that looks even remotely

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.720
like a butterfly scale, but somehow he gels, inside

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.760
of his cocoon and his pupa, and he creates nanostructures.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.800
Oh, he's moving. So here he is...

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.840
Oop! [laugh]

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.860
(Destin) What are you drawing down there?
- The butterfly's scales.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.900
- Where are the scales at?
- On the wing.
- How do you know that?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.950
- Because you're making a video.
- [laughs]

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.010
(Destin) Right now?
- Yes.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.050
[laughs] Alright, so obviously I get maximum likes now because

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.070
"Princess" is in the video right?
- Byeee!
- Byee!
