00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.590
Selling the right to broadcast a television
or radio program to independent stations,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.390
syndication has enabled the modern system
of 24/7 broadcasting by providing producers

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.180
of content with a consistent revenue stream,
and stations with enough programming to satisfy

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.750
their eager audiences.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.760
There are a variety of syndication types,
including movie packages and public broadcasting,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.120
although perhaps the two most common, and
lucrative, are first-run and off-network (re-runs).

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.620
First-run syndication refers to shows that
have never been aired previously and common

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.620
examples today include Wheel of Fortune and
Judge Judy.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.120
Off-network syndication refers to shows that
were first aired on network television, and

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.160
are being broadcast again (aka: re-run); common
examples today include The Big Bang Theory

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160
and Modern Family.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.989
Note that when these programs were first aired
by the networks, they were shown through either

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.160
stations that were owned-and-operated by the
network (O&amp;O) or network affiliates, with

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.519
which the network has a special contractual
agreement that covers programming as well

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:04.949
as other issues.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.930
So how did this system get setup?

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.270
Syndication of entertainment programs has
been around since the 1930s, when syndicated

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.659
radio shows were being distributed throughout
the United States.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460
These first radio programs were distributed
on transcription disks (similar to old LPs,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.340
but with higher audio quality for broadcast).

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
This format was eventually replaced by phonograph
records, then tape recordings, cassettes and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.479
CDs, and while the practice of buying and
selling radio shows is ongoing, today they

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.290
are likely to be downloaded.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.619
In any event, early popular syndicated radio
shows included The Chevrolet Chronicles and

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.360
the wildly popular Amos ‘n’ Andy.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.330
A cultural phenomenon at the start of the
Great Depression, the 15 minute show aired

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.490
six nights each week and boasted upwards of
40 million listeners.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.510
Throughout the 1940s, syndicated radio shows
remained popular due in no small part to programs

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.530
such as The Adventures of Superman, which
ran through 1949.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.381
(And if you’re curious about how Superman’s
curious underwear choices started, see: Why

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:06.479
Superheroes Wear Their Underwear on the Outside)

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.390
While televisions were made and some limited
television broadcasting was done in the late

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.790
1930s, large-scale, commercial broadcasting
didn’t appear in the United States until

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.510
the late 1940s.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.450
Taking a page out of radio stations’ books,
independent televisions stations soon realized

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.209
they were desperate for additional programming
to fill the hours in between their original

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.209
productions.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.480
Capitalizing on that need was Frederick Ziv,
who had cut his teeth in advertising in the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.040
1930s, developing slogans for the burgeoning
radio market, including “The Freshest Thing

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.840
in Town,” for Cincinnati’s Rubel’s Bakery.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.510
The ad campaign was so popular that Ziv was
able to transform it into a full-fledged,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.260
15 minute, five-day each week radio program,
which he soon syndicated across the South

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.470
and Midwest.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.769
Realizing he had found a new market, within
a decade Ziv had built a successful syndication

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.849
company, selling shows such as Favorite Story
and Bold Venture, this last starring Humphrey

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.180
Bogart and Lauren Bacall, to stations across
North America.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.220
Jumping with both feet into the fledgling
television syndication market, Ziv’s first

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.590
television show, Fireside Theatre began airing
in 1949.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.870
It was soon followed by others including Easy
Aces (1949-1950),The Cisco Kid (1950-1956),

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:28.060
I Led Three Lives (1953-1956) Highway Patrol
(1955-1959), Whirlybirds (1957-1960), Bat

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.670
Masterson (1958-1961) and Sea Hunt (1958-1961).

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.450
With such a large and early contribution to
syndication, it is no wonder Frederick Ziv

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.830
earned the moniker, the “father of syndicated
television.”

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.190
Over the years, syndication has become even
more popular, and lucrative, and those in

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.239
the highest demand in recent years include
NFL regular season games, The Big Bang Theory,

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.620
Modern Family, Judge Judy, Wheel of Fortune
and Jeopardy.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.209
Between the two game shows alone they average
more than 22 million viewers daily which helps

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.030
to explain why they are among the longest-running
syndicated shows in history.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.820
Another notable syndicated champion is Seinfeld.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.120
Between 1998 and 2013, Seinfeld has generated
more than $3 billion in syndication fees,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.260
and its co-creators, Larry David and Jerry
Seinfeld, themselves have each raked in as

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.260
much as $400 million from selling the show
as re-runs.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.720
There appears no end in sight either; only
a few days ago, Hulu announced it had acquired

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.140
the online streaming rights for the show,
with a deal valued at around $1 million per

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.770
episode (a total of 180 episodes).

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:38.159
Note that programs that are still in first-run
can be syndicated as well once they reach

00:04:38.159 --> 00:05:00.339
the 85-100 episode threshold; for example,
Modern Family recently went into syndication

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.640
on USA, costing the network $1.4 million per
episode.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.450
Syndicating a current show can offer other
benefits as well.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:16.950
After the popular show, The Big Bang Theory,
went into syndication, its audience for first

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.700
run episodes rose by 21%.
