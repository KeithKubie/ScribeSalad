00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:02.997
Congratulations, you have made it to end of unit 4

00:00:02.997 --> 00:00:04.997
and you have a working search engine.

00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:08.479
For the problem set for unit 4 you are going to make some improvements for the search engine.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.864
What we will do in unit 5 is look at how to make the search engine scale.

00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:15.247
The search engine you have so far works fine as long as the index is small,

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:18.347
but would be really slow if we have too large an index.

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:21.397
In unit 5 we will look at a way to make that index much more efficient.

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:23.090
Hope to see you back soon!
