00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.270
What I have here in yellow is
the graph of y equals f of x.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.350
Then here in this
mauve color I've

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.310
graphed y is equal to
the derivative of f

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.870
is f prime of x.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.580
And then here in
blue, I've graphed

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.740
y is equal to the second
derivative of our function.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.380
So this is the
derivative of this,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.550
of the first derivative
right over there.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.830
And we've already seen
examples of how can we

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.345
identify minimum
and maximum points.

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:27.220
Obviously if we have
the graph in front of us

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.850
it's not hard for a
human brain to identify

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.950
this as a local maximum point.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.530
The function might take
on higher values later on.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.540
And to identify this as
a local minimum point.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.242
The function might take on
the lower values later on.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.700
But we saw, even if we don't
have the graph in front of us,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.347
if we were able to take the
derivative of the function

00:00:45.347 --> 00:00:47.180
we might-- or even if
we're not able to take

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.638
the derivative of
the function-- we

00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:51.501
might be able to identify these
points as minimum or maximum.

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:53.000
The way that we did
it, we said, OK,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.070
what are the critical
points for this function?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.360
Well, critical points are
where the function's derivative

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.099
is either undefined or 0.

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:01.515
This is the
function's derivative.

00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:04.170
It is 0 here and here.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810
So we would call
those critical points.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.530
And I don't see
any points at which

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.590
the derivative is
undefined just yet.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.590
So we would call here
and here critical points.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.740
So these are candidate points
at which our function might

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800
take on a minimum
or a maximum value.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.550
And the way that we
figured out whether it

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.220
was a minimum or
a maximum value is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.320
to look at the behavior of the
derivative around that point.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.320
And over here we saw the
derivative is positive

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.715
as we approach that point.

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.210
 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.800
And then it becomes negative.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800
It goes from being
positive to negative

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.500
as we cross that point.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.760
Which means that the
function was increasing.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.679
If the derivative
is positive, that

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.970
means that the function was
increasing as we approached

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.310
that point, and then decreasing
as we leave that point, which

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.544
is a pretty good way
to think about this

00:01:58.544 --> 00:01:59.460
being a maximum point.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.765
If we're increasing
as we approach it

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:02.630
and decreasing as we
leave it, then this

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.490
is definitely going
to be a maximum point.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.330
Similarly, right
over here we see

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.630
that the derivative is negative
as we approach the point, which

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.420
means that the
function is decreasing.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.780
And we see that the
derivative is positive

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.940
as we exit that point.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.710
We go from having a
negative derivative

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.530
to a positive
derivative, which means

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.930
the function goes from
decreasing to increasing

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.680
right around that point, which
is a pretty good indication,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.590
or that is the indication,
that this critical point is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.710
a point at which the function
takes on a minimum value.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.150
What I want to do
now is extend things

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.270
by using the idea of concavity.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.365
 

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.740
And I know I'm
mispronouncing it.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.740
Maybe it's concavity.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.630
But thinking about
concavity, we could

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.380
start to look at the second
derivative rather than kind

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.990
of seeing just this transition
to think about whether this

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.280
is a minimum or a maximum point.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.300
So let's think about
what's happening

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.030
in this first region,
this part of the curve

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.540
up here where it looks like
a arc where it's opening

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.290
downward, where it
looks kind of like an A

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.716
without the cross beam
or an upside down U.

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:15.090
And then we'll
think about what's

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.950
happening in this kind of upward
opening U part of the curve.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.790
So over this first
interval, right

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.700
over here, if we start
over here the slope

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.484
is very-- actually let me do
it in a-- actually I'll do it

00:03:26.484 --> 00:03:27.900
in that same color,
because that's

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.210
the same color I used for
the actual derivative.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.210
The slope is very positive.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.640
Then it becomes less positive.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.790
Then it becomes
even less positive.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.840
It eventually gets to 0.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.160
Then it keeps decreasing.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.260
Now it becomes slightly
negative, slightly negative,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.250
then it becomes
even more negative,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.200
then it becomes
even more negative.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.409
And then it looks like it stops
decreasing right around there.

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.450
So the slope stops decreasing
right around there.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.380
And you see that
in the derivative.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.380
The slope is decreasing,
decreasing, decreasing,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.970
decreasing until that point,
and then it starts to increase.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.920
So this entire section
right over here,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.575
the slope is decreasing.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:18.550
 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.950
And you see it right over here
when we take the derivative.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.070
The derivative right over
here, over this entire interval

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.287
is decreasing.

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:29.620
And we also see that when we
take the second derivative.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.720
If the derivative
is decreasing, that

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.750
means that the second
derivative, the derivative

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.050
of the derivative, is negative.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.320
And we see that that
is indeed the case.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.190
Over this entire interval,
the second derivative

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.821
is indeed negative.

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:47.570
Now what happens as
we start to transition

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.250
to this upward opening
U part of the curve?

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.150
Well, here the derivative
is reasonably negative.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.250
It's reasonably
negative right there.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.570
But then it's still
negative, but it

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.850
becomes less negative and less
negative and less negative,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.670
less negative and less
negative, and less negative.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.980
Then it becomes 0.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.000
It becomes 0 right over here.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.170
And then it becomes more
and more and more positive.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.890
And you see that
right over here.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.720
So over this entire interval,
the slope or the derivative

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.430
is increasing.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.745
So the slope is increasing.

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:25.870
And you see this over here.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.560
Over here the slope is 0.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.950
The slope of the
derivative is 0.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.220
The derivative itself isn't
changing right at this moment.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.089
And then you see that
the slope is increasing.

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.630
And once again, we
can visualize that

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.900
on the second derivative, the
derivative of the derivative.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.530
If the derivative
is increasing, that

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.680
means the derivative of
that must be positive.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.240
And it is indeed the case that
the derivative is positive.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.320
And we have a word for
this downward opening

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.640
U and this upward opening U.
We call this concave downwards.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.120
 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.560
Let me make this clear.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.920
Concave downwards.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.030
And we call this
concave upwards.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.400
 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.330
So let's review
how we can identify

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.670
concave downward intervals
and concave upwards intervals.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:25.840
So if we're talking
about concave downwards,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.780
we see several things.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.340
We see that the
slope is decreasing.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:37.590
 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.430
Which is another
way of saying that f

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.290
prime of x is decreasing.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.720
 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.840
Which is another way of saying
that the second derivative must

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.590
be negative.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.090
If the first derivative
is decreasing,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.460
the second derivative
must be negative,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.350
which is another way of saying
that the second derivative

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.160
over that interval
must be negative.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.010
So if you have a negative
second derivative,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.220
then you are in a concave
downward interval.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.480
Similarly-- I have
trouble saying

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.640
that word-- let's think
about concave upwards,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.630
where you have an upward
opening U. Concave upwards.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.510
In these intervals, the
slope is increasing.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.030
We have a negative slope, less
negative, less negative, 0,

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.040
positive, more positive, more
positive, even more positive.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.780
So slope is increasing.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.240
 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:50.690
Which means that the derivative
of the function is increasing.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.680
And you see that
right over here.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.240
This derivative is
increasing in value,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.150
which means that the second
derivative over an interval

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.490
where we are concave upwards
must be greater than 0.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.450
If the second derivative
is greater than 0,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.950
that means that the
first derivative

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.310
is increasing, which means
that the slope is increasing.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:14.630
We are in a concave
upward interval.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.000
Now given all of these
definitions that we've just

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.150
given for concave downwards
and concave upwards,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.210
can we come up with
another way of identifying

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.820
whether a critical
point is a minimum point

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.490
or a maximum point?

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.420
Well, if you have
a maximum point,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.500
if you have a critical
point where the function is

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.130
concave downwards, then you're
going to be at a maximum point.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.210
Concave downwards, let's
just be clear here,

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.263
means that it's
opening down like this.

00:08:42.263 --> 00:08:44.179
And when we're talking
about a critical point,

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.304
if we're assuming it's
concave downwards over here,

00:08:46.304 --> 00:08:48.784
we're assuming differentiability
over this interval.

00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:50.200
And so the critical
point is going

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.350
to be one where the slope is 0.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.810
So it's going to be that
point right over there.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.640
So if you're concave
downwards and you

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.250
have a point where f prime of,
let's say, a is equal to 0,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.730
then we have a
maximum point at a.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:11.500
 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.210
And similarly, if
we're concave upwards,

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.340
that means that our function
looks something like this.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.210
And if we found a point,
obviously a critical point

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.600
could also be where the
function is not defined,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.800
but if we're assuming
that our first derivative

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.510
and second derivative
is defined here,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.260
then the critical point
is going to be one

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.380
where the first derivative
is going to be 0.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.090
So f prime of a is equal to 0.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.130
And if f prime of
a is equal to 0

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.900
and if we're concave
upwards in the interval

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.250
around a, so if the second
derivative is greater than 0,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.010
then it's pretty
clear, you see here,

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:53.610
that we are dealing with
a minimum point at a.
