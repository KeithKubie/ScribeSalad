MELISSA ECCLES: We thought to
ourselves, how can we reinvent

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.200
the shopping process?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.790
How can we reinvent the
experience that people are

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.500
having when they try
to buy a new car?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.990
How does everybody look
into their car?

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.270
They go to the manufacturer's
website.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.590
They start to investigate.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.760
And maybe if they get far enough
along in the process,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.260
they decide that they want
to configure a car.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.470
BO GUSTAVVSON: Seeing how many
different options you had for

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.550
this car, and you could go
through this computer.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.230
We had about 500 different
videos that we could piece

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.480
together in many versions.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.230
MEGAN BETTOR: In essence, we
wanted it to feel like one

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680
extended performance, theatrical
performance.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.970
MELISSA ECCLES: And we wanted
to do this in a way and on a

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.310
platform where our target
already was.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.340
And that platform was YouTube.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.580
We've got a longstanding
30-year-plus relationship with

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.500
our client.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.540
And they said, all right, if
this is what your consumer

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.570
insights are telling you, if
this is where your users are,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.620
then we're willing to take
that risk with you.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.120
And it paid off with the
time of engagement.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.800
We had people spending about 22
minutes in the experience.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.490
BRIAN MOROZ: Whoa!

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.680
MELISSA ECCLES: One
team, one dream.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.580
It sounds cheesy,
but it's true.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.670
And everybody really believed
that we were doing something

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.825
innovative and something
groundbreaking.

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:26.160
So It's easy for people to
collaborate when they're

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.430
really excited about the idea
they're collaborating on.
