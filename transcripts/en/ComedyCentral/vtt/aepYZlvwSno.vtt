00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.437
Hello, my name is Randall Park,
and you are about to hear

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.742
a story about Frank Emi.
Uh...yeah.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:12.311
 [bright music]

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:15.248
 So Frank Emi was born
 in Los Angeles,

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.651
 and he worked for his parents'
 produce market.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:23.790
 And when Frank became of age,
 the parents were like,

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.259
 "Okay, it's time for you to
 take over this fruit market."

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:30.296
 And Frank was like,
 "Sweet, because I got plans.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.532
 I'm gonna live
 the American Dream."

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.836
Then on December 7, 1941,
Frank Emi was listening

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.672
 to the radio, and he hears...
 [mimics static]

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.708
 "Hey, everybody,
 this is the radio,

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:45.078
 "and I have news for you.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:49.816
 "It's breaking news--the Japs
 have bombed Pearl Harbor.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.551
"Don't be offended
this is what--how--

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.519
"this is how what we
call them right now.

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:56.155
 "We call them 'Japs.'
 It's all good.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:59.158
 And they just bombed
 Pearl Harbor."

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.326
 [mimics static]

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.529
[chuckling]

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:08.468
So--so he was like, "Oh, shit.
This is crazy,

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.138
 "but probably won't affect me.
 I'm an American citizen,

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.840
 "and I've been here
 all my life.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.608
 It'll be fine."

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:18.244
 And then a couple months
 later from the bombing

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:21.247
 of Pearl Harbor,
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.552
 basically said,
 "The Japanese are officially

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:30.523
 "a national threat
 to the national security.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:34.160
 And, yes, I used 'national'
 twice in the same sentence..."

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:36.162
[belches]
Excuse me.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:40.867
 "Therefore, we must put them--
 round them up and put them

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.238
 in internment camps because
 they're too dangerous."

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.675
And then--and then, uh...
and then--

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.711
Sorry.
I lost my train of thought.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.913
I was onto something.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.750
Oh, man, I'm, like, gone.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:01.787
So, like, basically Frank
was like, "Is this for real?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.222
 This is mind-blowing."

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.524
 And the next thing you know,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:05.691
 it's, like, a knock
 at the door.

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:07.360
[knocking]

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.863
 "It's the--it's
 the United States of America."

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:13.666
 "Uh, yeah, what do you want?"

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.202
 "Well, it's time for you
 to go to your--

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.803
 to your internment camp."

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.805
- They were a bunch
of Jeff Foxworthys?

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:22.508
- Yeah, yeah, and they were
like, "You know you're

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:26.379
 "a redneck if you're walking
 people into trains to get

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:30.416
 sent off into internment camps
 and you don't give a [bleep]."

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.953
[laughter]

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:37.490
And then they got rounded up
into these trains,

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.859
 and they head off to Wyoming,
 and then they get to

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:42.962
 this internment camp
 called Heart Mountain.

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.897
 What a name, right,
 for an internment camp.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.532
 - How much heart was there?

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:49.402
- No heart, no heart, no love.
- Just a mountain.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.436
- Just a mountain.
They should've just

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.738
called it Mountain.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:56.576
So here's this Japanese phrase,
"Shikata ga nai."

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.578
It basically means
"It can't be helped."

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.513
 - Shikata...
 - Ga nai.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:01.981
 - Ga nai.
- Ga nai, yeah.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:05.518
 - Shikata ga nai.
- Yeah, that was right.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:08.421
So Frank is like, "No, this is--
we got to do something

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.656
 "about this.
 We're Americans.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.559
 This is completely
 in--unconstitutional."

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.395
 And that's when a soldier
 comes up to him and is like,

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:18.631
 "Fill out this loyalty oath."

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:21.334
 And on it, it has a bunch
 of just questions.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.971
"Do you like hamburgers?"

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.440
- Do you like hamburgers?
- Dumb questions, right?

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:30.610
- Well, do--I know, I'm asking
you, do you like hamburgers?

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:31.978
- Are you questioning
my loyalty right now?

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.780
- No, I'm just asking
if you like hamburgers.

00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.249
- Cheeseburgers.
- Of course.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.817
- Yes, okay.
- You're a [bleep] asshole

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.286
if you want a hamburger.
- Yes, if you had the choice.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.021
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:44.624
 And then he comes to this
 question "Are you loyal

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:45.992
 to the United States?"

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.294
 And he's like, "Whoa,
 wait a minute.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:52.698
 "You just, like, stripped us
 of our rights and privileges

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:54.800
 "as citizens of this--
 of the United States,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.570
 and now you're asking us
 if we're loyal?"

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.705
So Frank stood up,
and he's like,

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:02.275
 "Under the present
 circumstances,

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:06.345
 I cannot and will not answer
 these questions."

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:09.048
- That's so cool.
- Boss move.

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:12.918
 So he starts posting flyers
 all around the camps.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:17.323
 "Hey, everybody, like,
 don't check these boxes.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:20.960
 Come with me and
 defy this order."

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:24.664
 And as he was hammering
 this thing on a post,

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.999
 this dude comes up to him
 and is like, "Hey, man,

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.068
 I'm coming with you."
 Frank Emi was like,

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.469
 "What's your name?"
 He was like,

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:31.937
 "I'm Frank Inouye."

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.639
 and they were like,
 "Oh, shit, Frank.

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:34.940
"We're both--
that's kind of cool.

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.742
 But this sucks."

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:41.447
So why don't we meet and figure
 out what to do about this?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.383
 And then the government was
 like, "We need more troops.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.986
 We're gonna start drafting
 Japanese Americans

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.654
 to fight in the war.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:51.791
Take it from a drunk guy
on, you know, on a comedy show

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.561
on Comedy Central,
this is [bleep] ridiculous.

00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:57.563
 So at that point,
 Frank Emi was like,

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:59.532
 "Oh, hell no.
 No, no."

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:03.903
This is when The Heart Mountain
Fair Play Committee was born.

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:07.473
 And their mantra was
 "No shikata ga nai."

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:09.875
 And they would say this.
 No shikata ga nai.

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:13.679
both: No shikata ga nai.
No shikata ga nai.

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.648
 No shikata ga nai.

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.950
- They were now
this unified group that--

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:22.388
and their main tactic
was to resist the draft.

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.924
 During these mandatory
 recruitment sessions,

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:28.027
 the first thing they'd do is
 send this pre-draft physical--

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.428
 don't even touch it.

00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:31.364
 Just return it empty.
 - Yeah.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:34.400
 - And then they, well, they
 won't be able to do anything.

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:37.470
 And then these U.S. Marshals
 with guns, and they're like,

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.806
 "You guys are under arrest.
 Come with me."

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.908
 So they came.

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.910
"Comed"?
- They "comed" to the court.

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:46.545
- They "comed" to the court.

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:48.681
 They were 63 of them
 in this trial,

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:50.149
 and at this point,
 these guys were, like,

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:52.017
masters of the Constitution.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.753
 So they were like,
 "We're gonna be okay."

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.654
 And then this judge comes up.

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:59.425
 The first thing he refers
 to them as is "You Jap boys."

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:02.628
 Then they all realize,
 like, "We're done."

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.931
 And they ended up
 going to prison.

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:09.535
 So when all was said and done,
 almost 500 men throughout

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:14.140
 all the internment camps
resisted the draft in some way.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:18.411
 So eventually the war,
 like, ends.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:20.946
 So Frank Emi ended up
 spending 18 months

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.483
 of his four-year sentence
 in prison,

00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:27.653
 and then in 1947,
 President Truman

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:30.856
 officially apologized
 to Frank Emi.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.125
 Sorry we kind of screwed up.

00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:37.730
 And he basically said,
 "Thank you."

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:39.799
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 - Let's help each other.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.200
 - [mumbles]
 We're all the same.

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:43.102
- Come.

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:45.538
- I mean, not--
- We come the same color.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:46.539
 - Let's come together.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.507
- [laughs]

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.508
- I came twice.

00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:50.943
[laughter]
