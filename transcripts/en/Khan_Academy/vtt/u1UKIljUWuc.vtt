00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:04.254
- [Voiceover] Let's explore
a bit the infinite series

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:09.254
from n equals one to infinity
of one over n squared.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.301
Which of course is equal
to one plus one fourth,

00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:16.535
that's one over two
squared, plus one over three

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:19.737
squared, which is one
ninth, plus one sixteenth

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.427
and it goes on and on and on forever.

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:24.810
So there's a couple of
things that we know about it.

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:29.044
The first thing is that all of
the terms here are positive.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.244
So all of the terms here are positive.

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:37.100
So they're all positive and
that they're decreasing.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.608
It looks like they're
decreasing quite quickly

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:44.023
here from one to one fourth
to one ninth to one sixteenth,

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.544
and so they're quickly approaching zero,

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:48.523
which makes us feel pretty good that

00:00:48.523 --> 00:00:51.983
this thing has a chance of converging.

00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:54.370
And because they're all
positive we know that

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.188
this sum right over
here, if it does converge

00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:00.059
is going to be greater than zero.

00:01:00.142 --> 00:01:04.503
So the only reason why it
wouldn't converge is if

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:07.685
somehow it goes unbounded
towards infinity,

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:09.522
which we know if this was one over n

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:11.481
it would be unbounded towards infinity.

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:14.187
So this says that's a possibility here.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.493
So if we could show that this is bounded,

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.051
then that will be a pretty
good argument for why

00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.673
this thing right over here
converges because the only

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:24.240
reason why you could
diverge is if you went to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.024
either positive infinity
or negative infinity.

00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:27.572
We already know that this
thing isn't going to go

00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:29.602
to negative infinity because
it's all positive terms.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:31.534
Or you could diverge if
this thing oscillates,

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:32.976
but it's not going to
oscillate because all of these

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:36.114
terms are just adding
to the sum, none of them

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:39.019
are taking away because none
of these terms are negative.

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:42.286
So let's see if we can make
a good argument for why

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:44.856
this sum right over here is bounded,

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:47.181
especially if we can
come up with the bound,

00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:48.907
then that's a pretty good argument that

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.656
this infinite series should converge.

00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:55.168
And the way that we're going to do that is

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.342
we're going to explore a related function.

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:00.326
So what I wanna do is I wanna explore

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:04.135
f of x is equal to one over x squared.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.636
You could really view this right over here

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:11.636
one over n squared as f of n
if I were to write it this way.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.967
So why is this interesting?

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.192
Well let's graph it.

00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:20.739
So that's the graph of
y is equal to f of x.

00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:27.646
And notice this is a
continuous, positive, decreasing

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:32.282
function, especially
over the interval that

00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:33.546
I care about right over here.

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:38.034
I guess we could say for
positive values of x,

00:02:38.034 --> 00:02:43.034
it is a continuous, positive,
decreasing function.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:47.959
And what's interesting is
we can use this as really

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.625
an underestimate for this
area right over here.

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:51.742
What do I mean by that?

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.510
Well one, this first term right over here,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.719
you could view that as the area

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.688
of this block right over here.

00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:05.955
That is f of n or I guess
you can say f of one high

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:08.346
and one wide, so it's going to be

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:12.115
one times one over one squared or one.

00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:16.822
Let me make sure I'm
using different colors.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.960
This term right over
here, that could represent

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.960
the area of this block,
which is one fourth high

00:03:24.547 --> 00:03:29.547
and one wide so it is going
to have an area of one fourth.

00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:33.143
What could this one represent?

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.552
Well the area of the next
block if we're trying

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:38.391
to estimate the area under the curve.

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:40.852
And this might look
familiar from when we first

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:43.392
got exposed to the integral
or even before we got

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:45.509
exposed to the integral and
we were taking Riemann sums.

00:03:45.977 --> 00:03:48.106
So that right over here, that area,

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:49.954
is going to be equal to one ninth.

00:03:50.827 --> 00:03:53.912
So what's intriguing about
this is we know how to

00:03:53.912 --> 00:03:58.449
find the exact area, or
the exact area from one

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.414
to infinity, from x
equals one to infinity.

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.255
So maybe we can use that somehow.

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:06.668
We know what this area is right over here,

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.761
which we can denote as
the improper integral

00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:16.453
from one to infinity of f of x dx.

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:19.531
We know what that is and I'll
figure it out in a little bit.

00:04:19.638 --> 00:04:20.959
And if we know what this
is, if we can figure out

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.741
the value that's going
to be an upper-bound for

00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:24.328
one fourth plus one ninth plus one

00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:26.780
sixteenth on and on and on and on.

00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:29.425
And so that will allow
us to essentially bound

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:34.425
what this series evaluates
to and as we said earlier

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.828
that would be a very good
argument for its convergence.

00:04:37.828 --> 00:04:39.692
So the whole point here,
I'm not doing a rigorous

00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:42.543
proof, but really getting
you the underlying

00:04:42.543 --> 00:04:46.279
conceptual understanding
for a very popular test

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.996
for convergence or divergence

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.649
which is called the integral test.

00:04:51.468 --> 00:04:53.408
Let me just write that
down just so you know

00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:57.145
what this is kind of the
mental foundations for.

00:04:58.108 --> 00:04:59.545
So what do I mean here?

00:04:59.564 --> 00:05:02.215
So let me write this sum again.

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:03.505
Let me write it a little bit different.

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:07.961
So our original series from n equals one

00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:11.058
to infinity of one over n squared.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.897
It's going to be equal
to this first block,

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:17.306
the area of this first
block plus the area of

00:05:17.306 --> 00:05:19.213
all the rest of the
blocks, the one fourth plus

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:20.851
one ninth plus one sixteenth,

00:05:24.202 --> 00:05:25.544
let me do this in a new color.

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:30.821
Which we could write as
the sum from n equals two

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.937
to infinity of one over n squared.

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.832
So I just kind of expressed this as a sum

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:41.646
of this plus all of that stuff.

00:05:42.086 --> 00:05:45.967
Now what's interesting
is that this, what I just

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:50.131
wrote in this blue
notation that's this block

00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:53.554
plus this block plus the next block,

00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.734
which is going to be less than

00:05:55.734 --> 00:05:57.940
this definite integral right over here.

00:05:58.058 --> 00:06:00.048
This definite integral,
notice it's an underestimate

00:06:00.048 --> 00:06:02.635
it's always below the
curve, so it's going to

00:06:02.635 --> 00:06:04.095
be less than that definite integral.

00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:07.922
So we can write that this
thing is going to be less

00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:12.908
than one plus instead of writing this

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.269
I'm gonna write the definite integral.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.472
One plus the definite integral from one

00:06:17.472 --> 00:06:22.472
to infinity of one over x squared dx.

00:06:25.444 --> 00:06:26.679
Now why is that useful?

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:28.957
Well we know how to evaluate
this and I encourage

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:31.602
you to review the section on Khan Academy

00:06:31.602 --> 00:06:33.877
on improper integrals if
this looks unfamiliar,

00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:37.300
but I'll evaluate this down here.

00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:41.701
We know that this is the
same thing as the limit as,

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.133
I'm going to introduce a variable here,

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:46.727
t approaches infinity
of the definite integral

00:06:46.727 --> 00:06:49.259
from one to t of and I'll just write

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.191
this as x to the negative two dx.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.188
Which is equal to the limit
as t approaches infinity

00:06:57.188 --> 00:07:02.188
of negative x to the
negative one, or actually I

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.145
could write that as negative one over x.

00:07:06.698 --> 00:07:09.659
And we're going to evaluate
that at t and at one,

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:14.659
which is equal to the limit
as t approaches infinity

00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:19.702
of negative one over t
and then minus negative

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.870
one over one so that
would just be plus one.

00:07:23.302 --> 00:07:25.462
And as t approaches infinity
this term right over here

00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:26.532
is going to be zero, so this is

00:07:26.532 --> 00:07:28.108
just going to simplify to one.

00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:32.468
So this whole thing evaluates to one.

00:07:33.067 --> 00:07:35.156
So just like that we were able to place

00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:37.619
an upper-bound on this series.

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:41.894
We're able to say that
the series under question

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:45.448
or in question, so the
infinite sum from n equals one

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:48.221
to infinity of one over
n squared is going to be

00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:53.221
less than one plus one or it's
going to be less than two.

00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:03.084
Or another way to think about
it, it's going to be the two

00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:05.580
is this area, that's one right over there

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.021
plus this area right over here.

00:08:08.358 --> 00:08:10.461
So we're saying that this
sum is going to be less

00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:12.768
than two so we have bounded it above.

00:08:12.768 --> 00:08:15.589
So we know that it cannot
go to positive infinity.

00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:18.018
Because all the terms are
positive it's definitely

00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:19.411
not going to go to negative infinity.

00:08:19.556 --> 00:08:21.364
And because all the terms
are positive we also know

00:08:21.364 --> 00:08:23.195
that this isn't going to oscillate between

00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:25.963
two different values, so
this gives us a pretty

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:30.963
good sense that this series converges.

00:08:32.305 --> 00:08:36.946
And the logic we just
used here to argue for why

00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:39.385
this converges, once again
not a rigorous proof, but

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:44.206
this is the underlying
logic of the integral test.
