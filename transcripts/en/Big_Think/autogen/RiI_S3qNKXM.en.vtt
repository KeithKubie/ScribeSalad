Anthony I often get asked this question
if scientists actually knew that there

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240
if scientists actually knew that there
 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.450
if scientists actually knew that there
was an impending catastrophic collision

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460
was an impending catastrophic collision
 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.460

would they tell you and the answer is

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260
would they tell you and the answer is
 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.790
would they tell you and the answer is
yes we actually study the sky every

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800
yes we actually study the sky every
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.320
yes we actually study the sky every
night we're looking for objects that

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330
night we're looking for objects that
 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.610
night we're looking for objects that
might be on a collision course with

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620
might be on a collision course with
 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.440
might be on a collision course with
earth and if we find anything that even

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450
earth and if we find anything that even
 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.069
earth and if we find anything that even
looks risky we inform lots of people the

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079
looks risky we inform lots of people the
 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.049
looks risky we inform lots of people the
other thing is that the sky is available

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059
other thing is that the sky is available
 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.819

to anybody on the earth no one

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829
to anybody on the earth no one
 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.799

government owns the sky there are

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809
government owns the sky there are
 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.209

course with the earth
 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.849
course with the earth
so one of the things that I find very

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859
so one of the things that I find very
 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.060
so one of the things that I find very
difficult as a scientist is people often

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070
difficult as a scientist is people often
 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.309

ask the question would scientists tell

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319
ask the question would scientists tell
 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.169
ask the question would scientists tell
us if something really bad was about to

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179
us if something really bad was about to
 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.110
us if something really bad was about to
happen and he think about that sentence

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120
happen and he think about that sentence
 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.119
happen and he think about that sentence
and you have to ask the question who is

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129
and you have to ask the question who is
 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.440
and you have to ask the question who is
the US here am I not part of us I

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.450
the US here am I not part of us I
 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.810
the US here am I not part of us I
remember back I think it was in in 2012

the news and I actually got a phone call

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050
the news and I actually got a phone call
 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.750
the news and I actually got a phone call
from somebody I was sitting at my desk

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760
from somebody I was sitting at my desk
 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.520
from somebody I was sitting at my desk
at NASA and somebody asked me the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530
at NASA and somebody asked me the
 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.050
at NASA and somebody asked me the
question you know is the world going to

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060
question you know is the world going to
 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.870
question you know is the world going to
end next week and I thought about that

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880
end next week and I thought about that
 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.880
end next week and I thought about that
because of course we knew that the world

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890
because of course we knew that the world
 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.860
because of course we knew that the world
was not going to end there was nothing

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870
was not going to end there was nothing
 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.360
was not going to end there was nothing
happening astronomically that we could

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370
happening astronomically that we could
 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.850
happening astronomically that we could
tell but I realized this person didn't

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860
tell but I realized this person didn't
 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.320

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.690
think of me as an actual human being
that if I knew the world was going to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700
that if I knew the world was going to
 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.360
that if I knew the world was going to
end in a week I would be at work at my

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370
end in a week I would be at work at my
 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.610
end in a week I would be at work at my
desk I don't think so

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620
desk I don't think so
 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.770
desk I don't think so
the day you have all the scientists buy

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780
the day you have all the scientists buy
 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.210

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450
credit cards and disappear then you
 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.120
credit cards and disappear then you
might want to worry but even that's not
