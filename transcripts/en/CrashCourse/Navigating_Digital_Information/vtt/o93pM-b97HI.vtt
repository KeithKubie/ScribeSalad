00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.070
Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
Navigating Digital Information.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.240
So here at Crash Course, we work hard to bring
you entertaining and educational videos on

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.179
everything from science to literature, but
how do you know that we’re like telling

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.379
you the truth?

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.590
And is our work invalidated by the fact we
sometimes make mistakes?

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.910
I would say often.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.560
The thing is, unless you’re an expert in
every subject we make videos about, you don’t

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.560
know.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.939
And that is precisely what makes it so easy
to be misled, both online and off.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.380
None of us has the time or the talent to become
an expert in everything.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.840
I made this helpful Venn Diagram of people
who could debunk myths about climate change,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.640
myths about victorian literature, and conspiracy
theories about the illuminati, and as you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.640
can see there is nobody who can do all three.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.020
So we have to trust information from outside
of ourselves.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.870
We have to find a way to accredit and trust
experts, even though they will be wrong some

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.870
of the time.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.489
So today, we’re going to think about how
to do that especially online.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.479
INTRO
So whenever you open an app or a website,

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.770
you see information and content that was made
somewhere by someone.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.479
With lateral reading -- or, leaving a site
to find out what others say about it -- you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.860
can learn who that someone or group of someones
is.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.799
But when we try to learn more about a person
or organization, what should we be looking

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.799
for?

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.280
Well, before putting your trust in a source,
you need to explore two more things:

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.049
The authority of the person or organization
presenting the information

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.329
And their perspective.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.220
When I say “authority” I mean one’s
recognized knowledge or expertise on a topic.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.380
Famed primatologist Jane Goodall is an authority
on chimpanzees.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.509
Dwayne The Rock Johnson is an authority when
it comes to lifting heavy objects repetitively,

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.219
and also he is the greatest actor of his generation.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.950
Slight sidenote, I once met Dwayne The Rock
Johnson and I know he looks ripped in movies

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.170
and stuff but in real life he is so ripped!

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.670
What were we talking about?

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.670
Right authority.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.899
If you want to tell if a source is an authority
on a topic you need to leave the source.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.980
Because nobody is going to be like, “I am
not an authority on this topic.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.980
Here.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.980
Listen to me bloviate.”

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.750
Look you’re going to hear me say that a
lot during this series.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.590
You need to leave sites to understand them.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.370
I know that sounds counterintuitive, but it’s
always a good idea to leave a source to understand

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.930
if it is a good source.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.660
Vertically reading a website or article only
gives you the information that the source

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.910
wants you to see.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.520
As we talked about in our last episode, it’s
really easy to make a website or social media

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.200
account look authoritative.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.110
While using lateral reading techniques to
investigate a source’s authority, you want

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.270
to consider several factors:
The author or authors’ professional background

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.870
The process they used to produce that information
And the systems that are in place to catch

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.250
mistakes and correct them
An author’s professional or educational

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.610
background can indicate whether they are actually
qualified to speak knowledgeably about a topic.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.570
Generally speaking, those who work professionally
in a field or have done lots of work within

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.640
it, are better equipped than you know random
people off the street.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.780
That doesn’t mean that experts are always
right of course but they are more likely to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.380
be right than the random people off the street.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.130
So, a scientist who has published studies
on climate change in prominent journals is

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.900
a much more reliable source on climate change
than a blogger with no formal science training.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.540
My neighbor who has been gardening for 40
years definitely knows more about growing

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.010
plants than I do, as they like to remind me
every time they see me toiling in ignorance

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.410
in my new vegetable garden.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.220
And an agriculturalist who has spent years
studying the growth of plants will know even

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.220
more than my neighbor.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.520
I don’t want to go on a rant here.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.760
But failure to believe in and trust expertise
is a big problem on the internet.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.400
Also, probably off the Internet, but I live
here.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.010
Another good indicator of whether a source
is reputable is the process that source used

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.950
to produce or gather information.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.540
If you’re reading an article on, like, my
favorite celebrity becoming the first pop

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.060
star to sing on the moon and there are no
sources listed -- yeah, no, that’s just

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.410
fan fiction I’m writing.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.030
And also you can’t read it yet it’s not
done.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.240
Actually, you can read it, but it’s really
rough so just be gentle.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.010
ANYWAY, the process a source used to gather
information is often right there in their

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.010
work.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.930
A reporter might attend a protest and talk
to some protesters, and then describe those

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.600
conversations in a story.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.380
Or a professor might explain in their new
study that they asked 5,000 people whether

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.500
they liked chocolate or vanilla best.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.390
An Instagrammer tagging the person they’ve
re-grammed is also citing their process.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.820
Some news organizations even publish their
journalistic ethics, philosophies and methodologies

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.820
for the public.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.130
The New York Time, Wall Street Journal, and
Washington Post all have their lengthy handbooks

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.180
on editorial standards, which are available
online.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.640
The system in place to catch mistakes is just
as important as the process a source uses

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.980
to collect information.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.420
As I’ve mentioned in previous videos, news
publications often employ fact checkers and

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.660
professional journalists and editors also
take part in fact-checking efforts during

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.260
the process of writing articles.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.140
And sometimes another force steps in to help
point out mistakes: the public.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.750
They might write a letter to the editor or
leave a comment.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.780
They’ll definitely tell you when you’re
wrong.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.880
But you already know that, you’re on YouTube.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.880
Hello commenters!

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.880
It’s me John Green.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.820
I’d like to thank all 3.7 million of you
who’ve pointed out the Nile River flows

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.980
North in that Crash Course World History video.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.980
We know!

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.590
That’s why we published the correction in
the annotations, which I guess you didn’t

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.590
read!

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.500
But actually, seriously, thank you for pointing
out that mistake.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.740
In response, we issued a correction.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.650
We work hard not to make mistakes or spread
inaccuracies, but we don’t always succeed,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.600
and corrections are a way for trustworthy
institutions to acknowledge their failures.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.150
Now they aren’t perfect, because of course
by the time the correction has been posted

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.060
the misinformation has already spread, but
what are you going to do?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.060
We’re human.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.430
When very serious corrections are made, sometimes
a publication’s editor in chief, public

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.050
editor, or ombudsman will step in to explain
what went wrong.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.220
Here at Crash Course when those situations
arise, we sometimes make separate videos devoted

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.889
to the mistake or mistakes and how they came
to happen.

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.710
Let’s head to the Thought Bubble for some
news gathering and corrections.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.770
In 2018 the Drudge Report,
a right-wing news aggregation site with a

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.870
lot of followers,

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.300
tweeted, “REPORT: OBAMA PLEADS WITH JAY-Z
TO PREVENT OTHER HIP HOP ARTISTS MEETING WITH

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.370
TRUMP”
The tweet linked to InfoWars,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.780
a website known for spreading conspiracy theories

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.900
that has been banned from social media sites[1]
for using hate speech.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.700
And the InfoWars story was based on one Twitter
user’s tweet,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.050
which claimed sources said that Obama and
Jay Z were discussing this.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.240
But that user is not a journalist,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.930
and though they said the story was “developing,”

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.650
they never provided any other evidence for
this claim.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.580
But regardless, InfoWars wrote an article
about it and Drudge Tweeted it.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.010
But the report did nothing to explain how
or if InfoWars had confirmed the story.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.639
In fact, the only evidence they gave was that
Donald Trump Jr. had liked the tweet in question.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:05.810
What I’ve just described is not a reliable
or responsible news gathering process.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.139
Nonetheless, At the time we filmed this video

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.460
the article was still up on InfoWars with
no corrections issued.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.090
For comparison, consider this ProPublica report.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.990
ProPublica is a respected nonprofit newsroom
that focuses on investigative journalism.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.770
They published a story in 2017 that said CIA
officer Gina Haspel oversaw the secret base

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.370
where a suspected Al-Qaeda leader was subject
to waterboarding.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.460
That was wrong.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.620
When the publication discovered this mistake,
they issued a correction.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.700
In nearly 1,000 words, they explained the
error, how it was made, and how they got their

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.600
initial information.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.160
That was added to the top of the incorrect
story, ensuring that anyone who found that

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.570
page would see it.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.570
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.490
So obviously ProPublica made a big mistake
with that article and that mistake did lead

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.540
to lots of people being misinformed, some
of whom will unfortunately never see the correction.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.320
That’s why it is so important to only try
to share verified information.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.610
But the issuing of the correction, and the
exploration of how the mistake came to be

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:11.320
made, does allow readers not only to understand
that the reporting was wrong, but also how

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.830
it came to happen and what changes are being
made internally to decrease the likelihood

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.050
of such mistakes.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.290
So in addition to varying backgrounds and
processes for gathering information, every

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.700
source also has its own perspective or point
of view.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.530
You’ll notice I am not using the word “bias”.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.960
These days we tend to associate bias with
anyone we disagree with.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.120
Like if a sports writer named Steph Curry
the best NBA player instead of LeBron James,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.669
a fan might say “She’s so biased against
LeBron because he’s so popular.”

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.710
But bias means favoring something in a way
that’s unfair.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.510
I don’t think everyone unfairly preferences
some things over others.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.270
But everyone does wake up each morning with
a particular perspective on the world due

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.110
to their lived experiences.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.910
Rather than dismiss a source because their
background might make them supposedly biased,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.310
use the knowledge you learn about them to
understand their perspective.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.020
Consider their reason for sharing that information.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.600
How might their perspective influence what
they’re sharing, and how they do it?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.910
Basically, I am proposing a radical idea for
the Internet called empathy.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.350
Like take for instance the American Enterprise
Institute and the Center for American Progress.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.370
They’re think tanks, or groups of experts
that provide analysis and research on various

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.560
topics and policies.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.930
Slight sidenote, the term think tank does
come from actual tanks.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:37.100
It originates from military jargon used in
WWII to denote a safe place to talk about

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.100
strategy.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.100
But right, the American Enterprise Institute
is a conservative think tank.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.830
Many of its leaders are well known conservative
figures.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.810
The Center for American progress on the other
hand is a liberal think tank.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.330
Its similarly tied to well-known liberal figures.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.680
They both clearly have different political
perspectives.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.560
But that doesn’t mean we should immediately
reject any report or research they release.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.800
We just have to take the perspectives into
account when we receive their information,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.320
and consider how it might influence the content
they produce.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.570
Perspective extends to other sources too,
like news organizations.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.130
Opinion pieces are typically written with
a specific perspective by people outside a

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.630
news organization.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.450
And when reading an opinion, we should carefully
consider that author’s perspective while

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.110
examining their arguments.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:26.050
But one can’t confuse the opinion pages
of a newspaper with its reporting, even though

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:31.190
that is really difficult online, because there
are no physical “sections” of a newspaper.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:36.300
But if a piece is marked “Opinion, or “Analysis,”
or “Perspective,” or “Viewpoint,”

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.100
it is meant to be persuasive, not just informative.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.620
When the New York Times or the Wall Street
Journal publishes an opinion piece that is

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.210
not their reporting, it’s an opinion.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:50.300
News articles don’t have that same explicit
perspective, but some news websites do have

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.770
varying political orientations.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.870
If we’re familiar with an organization’s
political tendencies, we can take those into

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.750
account when thinking about their work.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.649
For example, take a look at The Daily Kos
and the Daily Wire.

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:04.840
The Daily Kos is a hyper-partisan left-leaning
website.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840
How do we know?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.620
If we head to the Masthead page, which lists
their staffers, you’ll find they call themselves

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.830
a progressive community site.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.400
Also, their founder has written a book explicitly
about “fighting” President Trump.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.910
Plus, their coverage often asks readers to
take action via signing a petition or protesting

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.100
against particular causes, usually in favor
of liberal policies.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.430
This tells us their perspective is strong,
and it will almost certainly influence how

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.740
they present the news.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.279
On the opposite side of the spectrum, the
Daily Wire, is a hyper-partisan right-leaning

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.279
site.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:40.970
It describes itself as an “irreverent news
and commentary site for a new generation of

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.270
conservatives.”

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.090
On his YouTube channel, founder Ben Shapiro
calls himself a conservative political pundit

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.570
and his podcast is described as “savagely
irreverent conservative.”

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.300
They may not ask their audience to take direct
action as frequently, but they’re very clear

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.840
on their political bent.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.589
This tells us that their perspective is also
strong, and and it will also almost certainly

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:02.880
influence how they present news.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.770
When reading articles from either website,
we must take their views into account and

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:11.600
remember they may be presenting information
in a way that aligns with their political

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600
beliefs.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.970
And if you think about it, considering other
people's perspectives should not feel like

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.589
revolutionary because you do it all the time
in real life.

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:23.440
When a new Mountain Goats album comes out
and I call my brother to tell him that the

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.029
most important piece of music in human history
has just been released, he knows I am speaking

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:32.580
to him from a particular perspective… a
correct one.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.790
He’s not going to dismiss my enthusiasm
for the mountain goats’ brilliant lyrics

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:41.050
or artful musical storytelling, but he will
dial it back to what a normal person might

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.610
think--and maybe even check to see what reviewers
thought of the album.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.740
As if Pitchfork knows anything about the Mountain
Goats.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:52.589
I am the world’s leading Mountain Goats
expert… is a good example of how not to

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:53.589
act.

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:54.589
That’s what this is all about.

00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:59.180
There’s so much information online, both
good and bad, that in order to sort through

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.080
it all we need to stop, think, and look around.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.959
We read laterally to find out who is behind
information.

00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:10.339
And then, we seek out specific information
about those sources, their authority, and

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:11.370
their perspective.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.090
And each bit of information we get about a
source is like a piece of stained glass.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.950
Once it’s all put together, it becomes a
lens through which we view their claims and

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.950
arguments.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.110
That makes us better at understanding what
information is reliable and what information

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.209
in turn we should pass on.

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:32.510
Not only to the people who are here now, but
to the people who will come after us.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.160
It’s also makes your life more colorful.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.610
We’re going to be diving into a very colorful
place next time on Crash Course Navigating

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.740
Digital Information… well figuratively colorful…

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.230
literally it’s quite black and white -- Wikipedia.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:51.339
I’ll see you then.

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:54.640
For this series, Crash Course has teamed up
with MediaWise, a project out of the Poynter

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.190
Institute that was created with support from
Google.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.060
The Poynter Institute is a non-profit journalism
school.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.990
The goal of MediaWise is to teach students
how to assess the accuracy of information

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.440
they encounter online.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.100
The MediaWise curriculum was developed by
the Stanford History Education Group based

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.790
on civic online reasoning research that they
began in 2015.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.920

MediaWise and fact-checking, you can visit
