00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
You would think that drawing every frame of
animation, or creating entire digital movie

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.630
sets one pixel at a time would make it easier
to avoid mistakes or accidents.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.470
But some of the most well-known animated movies
have incredible mistakes that fans probably

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.550
never noticed… until now.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.450
We’ve done a couple of Movie Mistakes videos
and if you’re a fan stick around until the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.210
end for links to those other great videos!

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.000
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Biggest Movie Mistakes
You Missed In Disney Films.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.320
Toy Story 2

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.909
When two of the starring toys of Pixar's flagship
series have a conversation in front of a TV

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.609
screen, a mistake on the animators' part left
fans with two strange explanations.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.659
Either the animators forgot to put the toys'
reflections in the TV screen, or the movie

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.870
has been following the ghosts of long dead
toys this entire time.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.539
We'd like to think it was a mistake, but the
second answer is obviously more exciting.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.699
Frozen

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.870
Considering the awards it racked up for its
soundtrack and singing, you would think that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.530
Frozen was flawless when it came to music.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.670
Instruments were a different story.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.870
Kristoff's four string guitar gives fans a
funny song, but with only three tuning pegs

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.050
to match, the missing peg is a mistake no
musician could miss.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.000
Cinderella

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.980
Even Disney princesses aren't immune to wardrobe
malfunctions, or stealthy costume changes

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.660
without explanation.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.950
Cinderella's long sleeve wedding dress is
hard to forget - especially since a similar

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.490
design was used in the real royal wedding.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.710
But after the wedding, Cinderella's dress
suddenly becomes sleeveless.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.450
Apparently two different animators are to
blame, since the color of the carriage's drapes

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.660
changes color to make the mistake even easier
to spot.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.090
Tangled

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.440
Nobody could have guessed that Eugene would
make the ultimate sacrifice, slicing off Rapunzel's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.980
magical hair to keep her from saving his life.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.670
Apparently, even the animators were a little
caught up in the scene to pay attention to

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.690
detail.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.009
There's clearly a large metal shackle attached
to his wrist throughout the scene.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.750
But when he raises a hand to give Rapunzel
one last touch, it's magically disappeared.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.130
It's not a massive mistake, but in a movie
without many, it's easy to spot.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.130
Pocahontas

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.690
We're going to skip over the historical inaccuracy
of this Disney story, since one small mistake

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.980
is still enough to make viewer's heads hurt.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.090
Shadows can be tricky things in animated and
CG movies, since they can bend, distort, or

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.340
overlap in tricky ways.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.611
But one thing's for sure: when Pocahontas
and Nakoma are walking holding hands, the

00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.860
shadows that precede them should definitely
be doing the same.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.450
Maybe there was more magic going on in this
story than we ever realized....

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.220
Wreck-it Ralph

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.650
The story of a bad guy turned hero ends on
a sweet note, with Ralph letting us know that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.280
the best part of his day is being tossed off
a building, when its tenants lift him up high

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.430
enough to see his friend Vanellope in the
game Sugar Rush.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.720
It's a touching idea to wrap up the story,
but it isn't exactly true.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.560
Earlier in the movie, it's made pretty clear
that Ralph can see the entire Sugar Rush game

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.690
from farther down the apartment building.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.440
Maybe it's the thought that counts.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.440
Frozen

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.099
A missing peg is one thing, but how about
a disappearing sword?

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.959
When Hans tells Elsa that her sister has been
killed by her magic, it's obvious he doesn't

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.990
have any weapons with him out on the ice.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:37.390
But just moments later, you can hear the sound
of a weapon being drawn - a massive sword

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.240
- that wasn't there before.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.410
And he still isn't wearing a sheath that would
have made the sound to being with.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.250
Ice isn't the only magic at work.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.910
Monsters, Inc.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.260
It's one thing to claim that monsters can
use closet doors to travel across the globe

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.270
in a few seconds, but something else to say
they have mastery over time itself.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.260
The chase scene through the warehouse full
of doors is exciting, but take a second look

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.590
at the locations the stars travel.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.000
For starters, it's night time when they start
in Nepal, then again when they head to Florida.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.760
If that wasn't enough of a problem, it's also
the middle of the day in Paris, the South

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.680
Pacific, and Japan.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680
Ratatouille

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.750
There's plenty of actual culinary expertise
for the food fans underneath the action of

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.380
this Pixar hit, and even some chef humor thrown
in for good measure.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.710
When food critic Anton Ego remembers his last
review of Gusteau's restaurant, he uses one

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.780
of the world' most famous chefs to insult
the establishment.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.139
Audiences are meant to take it as a slam against
the face of American canned pasta and sauce,

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.160
but Hector Boyardee wasn't just a mascot for
the brand, but an award winning chef at New

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.990
York's Plaza Hotel, years before he started
selling his food to the public.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.410
He would even receive special honors from
both the USA and Russia for feeding troops

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.350
during World War 2.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.330
Which means Ego's insult... would actually
be a massive compliment.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.690
Now THERE's some food for thought.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.280
Wreck-it Ralph

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.620
There's also a much bigger oversight later
in the movie, when Vanellope and Ralph succeed

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.550
in getting the candy-speckled girl across
the finish line, resetting the game to the

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.660
way it should be, with Vanellope now a princess,
and King Candy's invading influence wiped

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.660
clean.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.800
It's a happy ending, but the artists must
have missed the memo: King Candy's logo and

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.820
face can still be seen just as they were when
he was ruling.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.040
Those are some of our favorite mix-ups, mistakes
and errors in Disney films, but which ones

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.320
have we missed?
