00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.910
Problem 143.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:15.960
3.003 divided by 2.002 is equal
to-- well, this already

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.920
looks suspicious.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.930
It looks like 3/2, but just to
confirm that, this is the same

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.880
thing as 3 times 1.001.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.680
And this is the same thing
as 2 times 1.001.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.860
So you cancel those out, and you
get 3/2, which is the same

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.970
thing is 1.5.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.430
And that's choice E.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.700
Problem 144.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:57.290
If 4 minus x over 2 plus x is
equal to x, what is the value

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.200
of x squared plus 3x minus 4?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.710
Let's see if we could simplify
this little bit.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.080
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation times 2 plus x,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.430
so you get 4 minus x is equal
to 2 plus x times x

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.450
is 2x plus x squared.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.030
Let's subtract x from both--
no, add x to both sides, so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.130
you get 4 is equal to
3x plus x squared.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.530
Subtract 4 from both sides,
and you get 0 is equal to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.990
minus 4 plus 3x plus x squared,
which is just

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.110
rearranging that, which was the
same thing as x squared

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.820
plus 3x minus 4, so that is
equal to 0, which is C.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.140
Next problem, 145.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140
They've drawn us a trapezoid.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.935
Let me see if I can draw
the trapezoid as well.

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:09.699
So they have the base, one
side, and then they have

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.820
another side that looks
something like that, and they

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.040
connect the two lines
like that.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.800
And then they labeled this side
as 2 feet, this side as 5

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.320
feet, and they say this
is a, and this is b.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.420
All right.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.800
The trapezoid shown in the
figure above represents a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.720
cross-section of the
rudder of a ship.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:45.930
If the distance from a to b is
13 feet, what is the area of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.510
the cross-section of
the rudder in feet?

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.920
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.805
Let's see if we can figure
out this area.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.490
So this area right here
is easy to figure out.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.430
If this is 13, this is
5, what is this side

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.180
going to be equal to?

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.270
We can use the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.770
If we call this x, we could say
x squared plus this side

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.020
squared, plus 25, is equal
to 13 squared.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.060
13 squared is what?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.420
169?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.780
I want to say that,
but let me check.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.160
I haven't memorized my
13 times tables.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.460
3 times 13 is 39.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.330
130.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.680
Yeah, 169.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.930
Subtract 25 from both
sides, you get x

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.540
squared is equal to 144.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.800
That's tells us we're
on the right track.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.755
We got a perfect square.

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:45.070
So x is equal to 12.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.020
So it's very easy to figure out
the area of this part of

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.770
the trapezoid, right?

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.160
It's just the base times
the height times 1/2.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.110
So it'd be 12 times 5, which
is 60, times 1/2, so this

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.570
would be 30, this area here.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.900
But this is a little
bit trickier.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.150
Well, let's think about
it this way.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.580
Let's extend this trapezoid
into a rectangle.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.649
So if you did that, then you
can view the area of the

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.620
rudder, so the original problem
that I have in magenta

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.290
there as the area of this entire
rectangle minus this

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.960
green area right here.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.580
So let's do that.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.510
First of all, what's the area
of this green area?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.810
So this side is what?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.960
If this is 2, this side is 3.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.650
And we already figured
out this width is 12.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.730
So the green area is 3 times 12
times 1/2, that's the area

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.810
of a triangle.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.320
So 3 times 12 is 36
times 1/2 is 18.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.510
Do it in a different color.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.830
So the area of this
green area is 18.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.010
So the area of our rudder, this
whole magenta area that

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.430
I'm shading n, is equal
to the area of the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.570
rectangle minus 18.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.190
So the area of the rectangle
is 12 times 5, which is 60.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.420
And then let's subtract out
the green area minus 18 is

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.150
equal to 60 minus
10, that's 42.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.510
And that's choice C.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.830
Problem 146.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.340
If 0 is less than or equal to x,
which is less than or equal

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.810
to 4, and y is less than 12,
which of the following cannot

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.030
be the value of xy?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.080
Let me going to write down
all the choices.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.380
A, minus 2.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.510
and y is less than 12, I don't
see why not. x could be 2 and

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.810
y could be minus 1.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.470
y could be arbitrarily small.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.760
So that's not true,
it's not A.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.770
B, 0.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.460
Well, x and y actually can
both be zero, so if you

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.320
multiple them, no reason
why you can't get zero.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.810
C, 6.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.840
Well, if x is 2, and y is
3, I can easily get 6.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.370
And they don't even
tell us that x and

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.320
y have to be different.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.940
They don't even tell us they
have to be integers.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:40.110
24, Well, the largest number
that x can be equal to is 4,

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.110
and x can't be a negative, so
if x is 4, times y is 6, you

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.950
get 24, so I'm already guessing
the answer is E

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.500
without having looked at it.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.900
E, 48.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.650
Because the largest value of x
is 4, and so you'd have to

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.380
multiply 4 times 12 to get to
48, but you can't get there.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.460
So the answer is E.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.160
Problem 147.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.410
Turn the page.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.180
I'll do it in blue since
it seems to be

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.550
dealing with water.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.960
147: In the figure above-- let
me draw the figure above.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.270
So I have a V-axis, then I have
this other axis, and then

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.950
they've drawn what looks like
water, at least before reading

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.886
the problem.

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.630
I've drawn that.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.490
They say this is V.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.360
They say that this distance
is 5 feet.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.660
They say that this distance is
10 feet, and they label us a

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.430
couple of points.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.700
It's R and that's S.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.030
In the figure above, V
represents an observation

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.830
point at one end of a pool.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.710
From V, an object that is
actually located on the bottom

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.700
of the pool at point R, so an
object that is actually here,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.170
appears to be at point S.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.480
The light goes from here, but
then refracts, and goes like

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.840
that, so if you just follow the
path, it would go straight

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.990
to point S.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:24.100
If VR is equal to
10 feet-- what?

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.190
Oh, VR is equal to 10 feet,
so let me draw VR.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.230
VR is equal to 10 feet.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.870
What is the distance RS, in
feet, between the actual

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.610
position and the perceived
position of the object?

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.350
So they want to know this
distance right here.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.020
Well let's think about
it a little bit.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.840
If we can figure out this
distance, then we subtract

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.790
that distance from 10, we'll
have this distance.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.330
So what's this?

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.840
Let's call this x.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:09.230
This is a right triangle, so
you have x squared plus 5

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.230
squared, plus 25, is equal to
this hypotenuse squared, is

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.880
equal to 100, which is the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:22.780
x squared is equal to 75, so
then x is going to be equal

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.180
to-- let's see, square
root of 75.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.820
That's someplace between
8 and 9, right?

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.570
8 is 64, 9 is 81, so
x is greater than 8

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.750
and less than 9.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.340
Oh, actually, they write it in
terms of square root of-- let

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.180
me simplify this a
little bit more.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.590
So I can write that as-- the
square root of 75, I can write

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.740
as 3 times 25.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.960
Square root of 25 is 5,
so that becomes 5

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.860
square roots of 3.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.940
So this distance right here
is 5 square roots of 3.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.330
So if I want to figure out this
distance, I just subtract

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.250
that from 10.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:06.090
So 10 minus 5 square roots of
3, and that is choice A.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.050
See you in the next video.
