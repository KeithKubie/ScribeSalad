00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.600
IN AN AUDITORIUM,
A WOMAN SPEAKS AT A PODIUM.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.133
Black: So welcome all.
Thank you for coming.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.500
My name is Naomi Black,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
and I'm a member of the
Accessibility Engineering Group

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.666
here at Google.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.266
And today,
I'm very pleased to invite

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.400
our speaker,
Dr. Silvia Pfeiffer.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.733
Silvia is a member
and an invited expert

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.333
on the W3C HTML
Accessibility Task Force.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.200
And she's also
the author of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.833
"The Definitive Guide
to HTML5 Video."

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.500
So Silvia's here
to talk to us--

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.833
come on up.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.533
Silvia's here to talk to us
today about WebVTT,

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.500
which is one of the standards
for timed text

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.433
which is under consideration
by the W3C.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:46.566
Thank you, Silvia.

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.600
Pfeiffer: Thank you.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.166
Describer:
SILVIA TAKES THE PODIUM.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.966
Pfeiffer: Thanks for inviting me
to come and speak

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.333
about this
important topic today.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.633
We know there are a lot
of discussions going on

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:59.066
about formats
for captions,

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.500
and we want to standardize them
for the web.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.566
But standardizing it
for the web

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.166
has a much larger
impact these days

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.833
than just on web browsers,

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.033
just on the web itself.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.766
It goes into many
different devices.

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.366
So we're very interested
and very keen

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.866
to give a broad coverage
of available technology,

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.033
and this is what we're trying
to do here today.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:24.600
So I'll be talking mostly about
WebVTT, the file format.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.866
But I'll also be talking
a little bit about

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:31.200
how to plug that into
the web browser into HTML

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.866
so that in the future,

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:36.333
we have a very simple way
of displaying captions

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.066
in web browsers on videos

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.966
without having to do
much more than authoring a file

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:46.200
and giving a link to
the web browser for that file.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.633
So it will be very simple
for people in the future

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:50.100
to create more captions.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.400
Describer: SYLVIA CUES
A NEW SLIDE TITLED

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
"REQUIREMENTS
OF A WEB TEXT FORMAT."

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.066
HEADINGS BELOW READ
"CAPTIONS OR SUBTITLES"

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.133
"TEXT VIDEO DESCRIPTIONS"
"NAVIGATION OR CHAPTERS"

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.666
AND "METADATA."

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.333
Pfeiffer: All right,
let's dig right in.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.233
As we were looking
at requirements

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:08.166
of such a text format,

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.866
a web text format
for video,

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:14.933
we looked at the different
types of content

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:18.133
that can be time-aligned
with video.

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.766
And captions and subtitles
are the obvious ones,

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:24.866
but text video descriptions
are also an important use.

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.866
These are for blind users

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:29.500
and can be read out
by screen readers

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.133
in parallel to the playback
of the video.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:37.266
This may well not be
the most usable way

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:38.866
of doing
audio descriptions,

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:40.933
but it is a much easier
way to publish

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:44.766
audio descriptions
for blind users.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:46.466
And, in fact,
for a lot of blind users,

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.633
it may well be
all they need,

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:51.133
because they already have
their screen readers set up,

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.533
and it works really well
for some people.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:55.900
Further to that,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.833
we're also talking about
navigation or chapters,

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:01.066
which is also
very important

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:04.766
for blind and,
in fact, any user.

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:07.033
If you want to go through
a video quickly

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:08.466
and find out
what's in there,

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:13.500
you want to jump to what we now
know as chapter markers.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.100
We can call them
navigation markers.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.300
This can be also covered
with the same kind of format.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.366
And more generally,
metadata.

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.100
This is something
that archives

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.100
are particularly
interested in,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.666
to attach metadata
to sections in the video.

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:33.000
It can also be done with such
a time-aligned text format.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.800
So what we have
discussed for browsers

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.366
is a very simple format.

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:41.966
It's called WebVTT,
Video Text Tracks.

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:43.966
WebVTT.

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:47.866
Describer: A NEW SLIDE TITLED
"WebVTT OR VIDEO TEXT TRACKS."

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:51.700
A SAMPLE FILE IS HEADED "WEBVTT"
WITH TWO ELEMENTS BELOW.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.366
EACH ELEMENT CONTAINS
THREE LINES OF INFORMATION:

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.633
CAPTION NUMBER,

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:57.300
TIME CODE START
AND TIME CODE END,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.633
AND CAPTION TEXT.

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:01.533
BELOW THE TEXT, A STILL PHOTO
OF A MAN SEATED IN A WORKSHOP

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.200
IS CAPTIONED "I HEARD ABOUT
THIS ARDUINO PROJECT,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.033
AND I SAW IT ONLINE."

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:08.733
Pfeiffer: This is one
of the very simple files

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:10.033
that we can think about.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.933
Just a marker
at the beginning of the file

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:15.466
that identifies
the file format.

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:20.366
The captions or subtitles--
let's call them cues--

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:23.500
then have an individual
identifier.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.433
In this case, it's
the number one and number two.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.666
Could be any string, however.

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:31.433
And then we've got start times
and end times

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:32.800
on each one of these cues,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.300
and a piece of text
in there.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.566
It turns out in--

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:40.966
as we all know how captions
are displayed on screen

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:43.400
in something like this

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.766
if it's automatically
created by the browser.

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:49.133
Describer: THE CAPTION DISPLAYS
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:53.066
IN WHITE LETTERING
OVER A SHADED GRAY BOX.

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:57.766
Pfeiffer: That was the very
simplest way of doing subtitles.

00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:59.933
Now, we want to do more
than just the simple captions.

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.433
In particular,
if we want to achieve

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:04.633
all the functionality

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:07.800
of, for example,
the CEA-608 captions,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.533
then we need to do a bit more
than just text.

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.633
We also want to have
some formatting in there.

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:15.866
Describer: ANOTHER SLIDE, TITLED
"WebVTT FORMATTED SUBTITLES,"

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:18.800
DISPLAYS THE SAME STILL IMAGE,
WITH THE CAPTION IN GERMAN.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.966
THE WORD "ARDUINO" IS WRITTEN
IN ALL CAPS AND COLORED RED.

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:27.700
Pfeiffer: Here is an example
on how to do bold.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.900
I'll point to it.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.133
There's a bold tag in here,
so that will be bold text.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.366
Here is some italic text.

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:36.500
Describer: IN THE SAMPLE FILE,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.500
THE SECOND CAPTION CONTAINS
THE WORD "WOW!"

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.733
SURROUNDED BY THE HTML TAG
FOR BOLD,

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:43.033
THE LETTER "b" SURROUNDED
BY ANGLED BRACKETS

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:44.066
BEFORE THE WORD "WOW,"

00:05:44.066 --> 00:05:47.100
AND "/b" IN ANGLE BRACKETS
AFTER THE WORD "WOW."

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.300
ANOTHER PHRASE IS ENCLOSED

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.166
IN THE TAG FOR ITALICS,
"i" AND "/i".

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:54.033
Pfeiffer: And up here
we've got a general way

00:05:54.033 --> 00:06:00.100
to associate style or a class
to a piece of text

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.466
and give it a meaning.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.733
In this situation,

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:06.433
we've turned a piece of text
into red text

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:07.933
and capitalized it.

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:09.100
Describer: THE WORD "ARDUINO"

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.066
IS PRECEDED BY THE TAG
"c.red.caps"

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:13.800
WITH A "/c" TO CLOSE.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.666
IN THE CAPTION, IT APPEARS RED
AND CAPITALIZED.

00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:20.000
Pfeiffer: Of course,
if we're using this format

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.466
also for subtitles,

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:25.066
we need to be careful to cover
internationalization issues.

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:27.600
WebVTT is very clear here.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.566
It requires UTF-8
character encoding.

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:52.500
Pfeiffer: It has a ruby tag,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.866
which supports
Asian languages in particular.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:59.166
Describer: ANNOTATED ASIAN

vertical and horizontal

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.500
rendering of text.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.366
Again, possibly one of the most
important ones

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:21.800
are Asian languages,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.966
and I think there are
a few other languages

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:26.266
that are also
rendered vertically.

00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:29.266
And we need to make sure
we get the alignment right.

00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:34.200
Sometimes text is read
from the right to the left,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.433
so therefore it needs
to be aligned on the right

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:37.900
rather than on the left.

Pfeiffer: Now, positioning
is another requirement

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:48.866
and, again, something
that traditional captions,

00:07:48.866 --> 00:07:51.400
TV captions,
are able to do.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.266
It's possible to position cues
anywhere in WebVTT.

00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:00.266
There are basically
three important ways

00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:01.700
to position text.

T, TEXT POSITION
A, ALIGNMENT."

00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:31.866
Pfeiffer: There are
line positions.

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:38.266
So the concept of display lines
exists in WebVTT.

00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:40.600
So the line position
allows people

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.666
to directly address
a specific line.

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:49.966
It can be done with
a line number or a percentage.

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:53.633
Then we have
the text position.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:57.266
This means we're placing
the text either on the left,

00:08:57.266 --> 00:09:01.366
in the middle,
or on the right.

00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:03.533
No, hold on.
That's the alignment, sorry.

00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:05.800
Alignment is
left, middle, and right.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.100
And the text position is...

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.233
so when we have text
like this,

00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:16.533
it's in the middle,
and it's centered.

00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:18.100
So we can also do a centering,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.600
and we can do
a left alignment

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.900
and a right alignment.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.300
But we can also move
that whole text elsewhere.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.666
So the text position
is where we move the text

00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:32.833
and the alignment is
where we align it at.

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:34.733

00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:05.400
Pfeiffer: We also have
speaker semantics

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.000
included into WebVTT,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
which is interesting
because it allows us

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.133
to put some semantic information
into our markup.

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:14.200
Describer: IN THE SAMPLE FILE,

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.766

THE TAGS ARE NOT CLOSED.

00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:25.300
Pfeiffer: Here, for example,
we have two people speaking.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.466
We know their position
on the left and on the right.

00:10:29.466 --> 00:10:34.133
And the speaker markup

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.166
can tell us where we want
to position it

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:39.333
and can also, for example,
help us always use

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:42.400
the same styling
for the same speaker.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.800
So, for example, we want
to use the same font,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.233
the same font color,

00:10:46.233 --> 00:10:49.500
maybe a specific outline
or something for a speaker.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.766
We can define that

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:54.133
and then apply that always
for that speaker.

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:09.900
Here is one

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:15.633

00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:27.233
THE SLIDE GIVES
THREE SAMPLE DESCRIPTIONS.

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:30.666
SAMPLE ONE, "THE ORANGE OPEN

SAMPLE THREE, "TITLE:

Pfeiffer: I'm not gonna
go there;

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.466
I just want to mention it,

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:47.866
because we want to focus
on captions today.

00:11:47.866 --> 00:11:52.500
But what happens here is,
we've got text that's aligned

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.700
with a start and end time
as well.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.733
And for a typical word rate
of a screen reader,

00:11:59.733 --> 00:12:03.166
it will fit into that space,

00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:05.933
and it will be read back
by the screen reader

00:12:05.933 --> 00:12:07.333
during that time.

Pfeiffer: And here is
the navigation example.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:19.066
As I mentioned, WebVTT can also
be used for navigation.

00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:21.033
Here we have three chapters,

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:25.166
and we can directly jump
from chapter to chapter.

00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:29.966
There needs to be extra controls
on videos to support this,

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:31.700
but this is something
we're working towards.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.033

controls and input
into web pages

00:12:51.266 --> 00:12:52.966
and automatic rendering,

00:12:52.966 --> 00:12:55.000
we need to know
how we're going to do that.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.600
And there is markup
in HTML5

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.766
for associating captions
and formats like this

00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:04.866
with videos.

00:13:04.866 --> 00:13:10.300
In this example,
I've got all of the VTT files

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.900
that we've used before.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.766
I've included them here.

00:13:13.766 --> 00:13:17.666
And what we're using for it
is called a track element,

00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:19.400
and this track element
is included

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.466
underneath the video element
in the HTML5 markup.

00:13:23.466 --> 00:13:26.966
It links through
the VTT file.

00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:29.800
And there is some description
possible

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.566
for the type of file it is,
so we have a label.

00:13:33.566 --> 00:13:36.333
In this case,
it's an English caption.

00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:38.733
We have a kind,
which gives us a means

00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:45.933
to group all the tracks
of the same type together.

00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:47.800
Describer: A CODE SAMPLE LISTS

Pfeiffer: And we identify
the language.

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:14.566
Because, of course, when we have
user settings in browsers,

00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:19.500
we want to automatically
make certain tracks

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.833
available to the user

00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:22.533
if the user has,
for example,

00:14:22.533 --> 00:14:24.300
said that they always
want captions

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.100
or they always want subtitles
in their language being shown.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.566
So the browser can
look through this markup

00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:35.666
and identify which ones
it has to turn on by default.

Pfeiffer: Now, in this case,
I've used only WebVTT files.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:54.433
The track layout, the way that
we've defined track in HTML5,

00:14:54.433 --> 00:14:56.200
is actually generic.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.400
It can be used for other types
of files as well,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.833
TTML or SRT
or any other formats

00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:07.133
that will be implemented.

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:19.166
that track
works is in this way.

THE REST OF THE CAPTION
IS BLACK AND MIXED TYPECASE.

00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.466
Pfeiffer: Now, once we've got it
in the browser,

00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:40.166
we can actually support more
than what is directly possible

00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:42.900
as markup
in the WebVTT file,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.700
because now we've got the text
in the browser,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.733
and we can make use

00:15:46.733 --> 00:15:48.866
of all the functionality
of the browser,

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:51.700
which has styling

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.100
and the concurrent style sheet
functionality

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.366
available to it.

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:58.100
So this kind of styling
is also available

if used in a browser,
to these cues.

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:09.133
And the way in which
this is being done

00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:12.133
is that there's
a pseudo-element in CSS

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:14.533
called ::cue.

00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:16.433
And with that pseudo-element,

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:19.200
you can address,
for example,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.333
classes in the cue markup.

Pfeiffer: And you can override
the formatting

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:34.300
that by default
would be given.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.633

well, in this case,
it's been turned red,

Pfeiffer: Now, we've
spoken a lot.

00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:11.200
We want to see a little bit
of a demo here,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.633
and I've made a little bit
of a demo

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:17.366
which shows that we can
do more than what's typically

00:17:17.366 --> 00:17:18.933
being used for captions
right now.

00:17:18.933 --> 00:17:22.866
Most captions that are
being used are pop-on captions,

00:17:22.866 --> 00:17:25.466
which are captions
that don't overlap in time.

00:17:25.466 --> 00:17:26.900
There's one piece of caption,

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.600
one cue shown;

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.566
it disappears, and the next cue
is brought up.

00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:31.866
That's pop-on.

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:36.333
And that is the default way
of rendering it.

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:39.500
But we may have
a very different style

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.366
of providing captions
as well,

00:17:42.366 --> 00:17:44.466
which has traditionally
been used

00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:47.400
mostly in live captioning.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.100
It's called roll-up.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.266
So the cues will actually
be added at the bottom

00:17:52.266 --> 00:17:54.900
and roll up as the--

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.666
and the old ones
will disappear.

00:17:56.666 --> 00:17:58.266
So I've made a little example

00:17:58.266 --> 00:18:00.433
that shows how that
can be done as well.

00:18:00.433 --> 00:18:01.633
Describer: A VIDEO PLAYS.

00:18:01.633 --> 00:18:03.233
AS THE MAN IN HIS SHOP SPEAKS,

00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:04.966
TWO LINES OF LEFT-ALIGNED
CAPTIONS

00:18:04.966 --> 00:18:07.300
APPEAR TO ROLL UP
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.633
WITH EACH NEW CAPTION,

00:18:08.633 --> 00:18:10.366
THE BOTTOM CAPTION MOVES UP
TO THE TOP LINE,

00:18:10.366 --> 00:18:12.666
AND THE TOP CAPTION DISAPPEARS.

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:14.033
Pfeiffer: Let's hope this works.

00:18:14.033 --> 00:18:15.800
Man: I heard about
this Arduino Project,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.300
and I saw it online,
and I said, "Wow,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.233
"a lot of people are starting
to talk about this.

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:21.666
I should check it out."

00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:24.333
Second Man: 'Cause we wanted
to make a tool

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:27.200
for our student
that was more modern

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.900
than what was available
on the market at the moment.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.133
Third Man: For me,
it was a case

00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:35.600
that this is a tool
that I could see using myself,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.966
and therefore
I could believe

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:39.366
in actually helping to get it
out to a wider world.

00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:41.633
Fourth Man:
[speaking foreign language]

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.566
Pfeiffer: So you could see

00:18:48.566 --> 00:18:51.700
that the captions
were being pushed up

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.700
as they were being displayed.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.500
This is a very simple way

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:06.333
of doing
this kind of roll-up.

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:08.233
So as we're moving on,

00:19:08.233 --> 00:19:10.333
the next caption
gets added to the bottom.

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:13.800
This can be improved.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.366
This is just
a very crude demo.

00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:16.566
But this can be improved

00:19:16.566 --> 00:19:18.800
with a bit more CSS
in the browser.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.800
We can, for example, transition
the text more slowly,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.800
and then it would be
more readable,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.166
rather than it
jumping there directly.

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:31.300
There's a whole swag
of CSS functionality

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.766
available to us
in the browser

00:19:32.766 --> 00:19:34.733
to make this look very nice.

00:19:34.733 --> 00:19:40.700
And the functionality is there
and possible to be used.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.666
Describer: A NEW SLIDE,
"EXOTIC: PAINT-ON CAPTIONS."

00:19:43.666 --> 00:19:48.566
Pfeiffer: I've mentioned
paint-on and roll-up captions.

00:19:48.566 --> 00:19:51.866
I've mentioned pop-on
and roll-up captions.

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:54.766
I want to briefly also mention
paint-on captions,

00:19:54.766 --> 00:19:57.666
even though that's a bit more
of an exotic use case.

00:19:57.666 --> 00:20:02.366
But it's possible to be used
in CEA-608 captions,

00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:05.500
so we need to make sure
that it's also possible

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.933
to be represented in WebVTT.

00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:10.866
And what we've introduced
for this kind of application

00:20:10.866 --> 00:20:14.100
is cue timestamps.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.466
These cue timestamps
are basically just a timestamp

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:22.533
that is being included
into the text

00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:26.000
and says when the text
that comes afterwards

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.666
will be activated.

00:20:51.266 --> 00:20:52.633
[coughs]
pardon me--

00:20:52.633 --> 00:20:54.200
at the word level.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.833
I've put cue timestamps in
for every word,

00:20:58.833 --> 00:21:01.266
so every word would come up
one after the other

00:21:01.266 --> 00:21:02.966
on the screen.

00:21:02.966 --> 00:21:05.300
However, the resolution
is arbitrary.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.600
We could do that
on every character if necessary.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.366
Interestingly enough,

00:21:11.366 --> 00:21:15.966
that can also be used
for styling through CSS.

00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:23.000
There are the past and future
pseudo-selectors.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.266
And these selectors allow us,
for example,

00:21:26.266 --> 00:21:30.700
to do something like
paint the old text in yellow,

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.700
the new text in white.

Pfeiffer: With a text shadow,

00:21:45.866 --> 00:21:48.300
and as it goes over,
everything goes yellow.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.366
And we know this kind
of application, obviously,

00:21:50.366 --> 00:21:51.766
from karaoke,

00:21:51.766 --> 00:21:57.166
which bridges into
these applications as well,

00:21:57.166 --> 00:22:00.966
into more modern
time-aligned text applications.

00:22:00.966 --> 00:22:03.733
We can cover
all of these use cases

00:22:03.733 --> 00:22:07.466
with the same approach.

00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:11.466

I think most of them;
I haven't analyzed in detail.

But most of the 708 features
will be supported as well.

It's a simplicity
of editing,

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:55.866
which we like
about the WebVTT format.

00:22:55.866 --> 00:22:57.966
It's readable.
You can read it here on screen.

00:22:57.966 --> 00:23:03.200
There's not too much busyness
as you're looking at it.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.366
And that means also
that it's easy to edit

about WebVTT,
please step up to the mic.

very quickly,

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:52.266
so if somebody wants
to go back

00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:55.066
and explore any of the features
in more detail,

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:57.833
this is probably
the opportunity.

00:23:57.833 --> 00:23:59.633
Steinberg: Hi,
I'm Daniel Steinberg at Google.

00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:01.566
A couple questions.

00:24:01.566 --> 00:24:05.266
When you had the line number
specification,

00:24:05.266 --> 00:24:10.000
how does that apply
when you have vertical text?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.700
Pfeiffer:
Let me just find that.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.733
Here, this one?

00:24:13.733 --> 00:24:14.666
Steinberg: Yeah.

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:17.033
Describer: SILVIA CUES
THE "CAPTION POSITION" SLIDE

00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:19.266
THAT HIGHLIGHTS LINE POSITION,
TEXT POSITION,

00:24:19.266 --> 00:24:20.933
AND ALIGNMENT FEATURES.

00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:26.100
Pfeiffer: So the line numbers
are basically done in--

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.166
for horizontal text,

00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:29.266
obviously from the top
to the bottom.

00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:32.800
And for vertical text,
they are turned around.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.466
So they apply in the same way.

00:24:35.466 --> 00:24:40.966
Steinberg: Okay, and you have
a lot of the underpinnings

00:24:40.966 --> 00:24:44.200
for interactive text,
but not the actual--

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.833
I didn't see anything
actually there.

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:49.233
So the ability to say
this particular tag is live,

00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:52.066
and clicking on it might give
a link or something like that.

00:24:52.066 --> 00:24:54.866
Have you considered
interactivity?

00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:56.566
Pfeiffer: Interactivity--

00:24:56.566 --> 00:25:00.500
you particularly talking
about hyperlinks in this case?

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.700
Steinberg:
In this case, yes.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.700
Pfeiffer: Yes, so hyperlinks

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.733
is something of a bit
of a controversial issue.

00:25:05.733 --> 00:25:07.466
We've discussed this.

00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:10.866
It is obviously something
that can easily be added.

00:25:10.866 --> 00:25:12.766
We've got the markup
in HTML5.

00:25:12.766 --> 00:25:18.433
We could easily put a "a" tag
in there and a hyperlink.

00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:21.366
It's not something
that's currently part

00:25:21.366 --> 00:25:26.500
of the specification simply
because people don't believe

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.066
that it's a very good
experience.

00:25:28.066 --> 00:25:30.466
When you're watching captions,
they stay on the screen

00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:32.000
only for a very short
amount of time.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.500
By the time you've decided
that you want to follow a link,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.766
it's already gone.

00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:37.533
That's the reason.

00:25:37.533 --> 00:25:41.100
So I'm obviously not fully
subscribed to that reason.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.300
I would actually like to have
hyperlinks in it as well.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.500
What I look at in this format
is that it's easy to extend it,

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.966
and if somebody
was to support it,

00:25:50.966 --> 00:25:54.933
then it is not a problem
to put that in as well.

00:25:54.933 --> 00:25:57.166
Steinberg: Yeah, something
to consider with the hyperlinks

00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:59.366
is that, because
you have the ability

00:25:59.366 --> 00:26:02.633
to author
different kinds of files,

00:26:02.633 --> 00:26:05.100
you could have a description
that had a longer time

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.433
and had a longer duration.

00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:08.200
It wouldn't
have to disappear

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.733
when a caption line
disappeared.

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:13.033
Pfeiffer: In fact,
I should actually add something.

00:26:13.033 --> 00:26:17.800
We've got, as I mentioned,
we've got kinds of text

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.600
that we're expecting
in a WebVTT file.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.866
I've talked about
captions and subtitles,

00:26:23.866 --> 00:26:25.733
I've talked about
text descriptions,

00:26:25.733 --> 00:26:27.133
and I've talked about
navigation.

00:26:27.133 --> 00:26:28.866
I've only mentioned metadata,

00:26:28.866 --> 00:26:31.066
but metadata actually
solves that problem.

00:26:31.066 --> 00:26:33.833
Metadata means that

00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:36.500
you're allowed to put anything
into a cue:

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.133
any markup you want,

00:26:38.133 --> 00:26:39.633
any non-markup you want,

00:26:39.633 --> 00:26:41.400
any text, anything at all.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.500
It just means that the browser
can't do anything with it.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.100
It decides--it sees that
it's of the kind "metadata"

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.600
and goes,
"I'm being hands-off.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.466
"I'm just gonna hand it on
to the JavaScript,

00:26:52.466 --> 00:26:54.866
and the JavaScript can do
with it whatever it likes."

00:26:54.866 --> 00:26:57.200
So this would be one way
to have interactivity in it.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.900
You could just
grab it through JavaScript

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.466
and then put it into a div
on your page,

00:27:04.466 --> 00:27:07.800
and then there would be
a hyperlink.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.200
And anything else
that you can come up with

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.166
that's time-aligned would
work in a similar way as well.

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:15.200
Steinberg:
And one last question.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.033
You showed
the different formats--

00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:19.533
captions and descriptions
and whatnot--

00:27:19.533 --> 00:27:22.933
as essentially the same
VTT format,

00:27:22.933 --> 00:27:26.933
distinguished only
by the track tag.

00:27:26.933 --> 00:27:31.300
And I wonder if there's
enough semantic difference

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:35.166
that you'd want to be able to
distinguish it in another way.

00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:36.500
Like, for instance,
would you build a--

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.700
could you build a file

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.633
that had captions
and descriptions in it?

00:27:40.633 --> 00:27:46.700
Or might you want to have
some identifier in the file say,

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.233
"This is a description file,"

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:51.966
rather than count on
the track tag?

00:27:51.966 --> 00:27:56.200
Pfeiffer: Mixing content
in one track

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.766
is of course possible.

00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:02.900
Like, you could concatenate,
for example,

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:09.033
a caption file with
an audio description file.

00:28:09.033 --> 00:28:12.066
Then you would basically
have two tracks available

00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:13.566
through one file.

00:28:13.566 --> 00:28:17.933
It's not a very easy way
to deal with,

00:28:17.933 --> 00:28:21.566
and it would require a lot
of additional implementation.

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.033
So, for example,

00:28:23.033 --> 00:28:27.566
if that concatenated case
was to be handled,

00:28:27.566 --> 00:28:29.433
the browsers
would need to find out

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:31.600
where the second file starts
and so on.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.566
We actually like to keep
the semantics separate.

00:28:35.566 --> 00:28:39.933
And HTML markup is built
on keeping semantics separate.

00:28:39.933 --> 00:28:42.633
So this is why we introduced
the "kind" attribute.

00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:45.000
And so therefore,
in one file,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.800
you will only find captions
of one type.

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:52.866
Thank you.

00:28:52.866 --> 00:28:53.966
Foliot: Hi, Silvia.

00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:56.033
John Foliot
from Stanford University.

00:28:56.033 --> 00:28:59.233
When you gave
the code example of the CSS,

00:28:59.233 --> 00:29:01.300
it's not clear where
the CSS actually lives.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.100
Is it embedded
in the WebVTT file?

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.733
Can you have an external file
and link it?

00:29:06.733 --> 00:29:10.200
Can you just maybe get into that
a little bit further?

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.566
Pfeiffer: Yeah, let me
just find it. Sorry.

00:29:12.566 --> 00:29:17.766
So I've deliberately just
put that there as a snippet,

00:29:17.766 --> 00:29:19.966
because it actually
doesn't matter where it lives.

00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:21.133
Describer: SYLVIA PULLS UP

00:29:21.133 --> 00:29:23.366
THE "USING CSS
FOR RICHER STYLING" PAGE,

00:29:23.366 --> 00:29:25.666
WITH THE ::CSS PSEUDO-ELEMENT

00:29:25.666 --> 00:29:28.766
IN A SEPARATE TEXT BOX
FROM THE WebVTT FILE.

00:29:28.766 --> 00:29:32.800
Pfeiffer: At the moment,
because we're doing the CSS

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.300
through the HTML page,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.833
that includes
this file up there...

00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:42.800
that HTML page could
either have this CSS piece

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.300
directly in the HTML page
and address it--

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.033
so an in-band CSS.

00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:50.500
Or it could be in
an external CSS file

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.300
and be pulled into
the HTML page

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.000
together with
the WebVTT file.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.966
Foliot: So it always sits
outside of the VTT file.

00:29:58.966 --> 00:30:00.400
Pfeiffer: It can.
Yeah, well...

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.000
So we're currently
under discussion

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.233
whether this
is a functionality

00:30:04.233 --> 00:30:06.966
that we'd want to add
to WebVTT as well.

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:10.966
So whether you want
a WebVTT file

00:30:10.966 --> 00:30:13.533
that links
to a style sheet.

00:30:13.533 --> 00:30:17.733
We're careful about that
because we--

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:21.733
this comes from
a very web point of view.

00:30:21.733 --> 00:30:24.500
We don't really want to pollute
the WebVTT file

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.866
with this web functionality,

00:30:26.866 --> 00:30:30.100
because there are applications
outside the web browser

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.300
that do not want to have
to implement,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.300
for example,
all of CSS style sheets

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.400
in order to display
captions properly.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.966
So it probably
makes more sense

00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:39.866
to have this
as a separate file.

00:30:39.866 --> 00:30:42.800
And if people do want to have
this additional functionality,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.966
they can use
the WebVTT file

00:30:44.966 --> 00:30:47.100
and the CSS file together

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.500
and parse them, and use them
in their style sheet engine

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.500
to come up
with the proper display.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.733
Black: I actually,
I have a practical example

00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:01.266
of why you would want
the CSS.

00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:02.300
Is this on?
Can you hear me?

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.333
Pfeiffer: Yes.

00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:04.700
Black: I have
a practical example

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.900
of why you would want
the CSS to be outside the VTT.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.500
I work currently with people
who are producing caption files

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.066
for the UK market

00:31:11.066 --> 00:31:13.933
and who are then redistributing
that same video here in the US,

00:31:13.933 --> 00:31:16.566
and they have to basically
redo the entire caption file

00:31:16.566 --> 00:31:19.133
because UK audiences
are expecting, for instance,

00:31:19.133 --> 00:31:22.500
to see a particular speaker
marked up in a particular color.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.400
Here in the US,
we're not expecting that.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.633
So you could imagine
if you had one format

00:31:26.633 --> 00:31:28.966
where you marked up
the content semantically

00:31:28.966 --> 00:31:31.666
that, depending on whether
you showed it in a player

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:34.100
here for the US
or there for the UK

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.433
with the same caption file,

00:31:35.433 --> 00:31:36.966
you could display it
differently

00:31:36.966 --> 00:31:39.266
according to different users'
regional preferences.

00:31:39.266 --> 00:31:41.733
Foliot: I would also add
that user style sheets,

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:44.133
the user could actually
increase the font size

00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:46.700
to their
specific requirements.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.833
Pfeiffer: Yes.

00:31:47.833 --> 00:31:49.233
Foliot: A second,
really minor question.

00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:50.466
On the alignment,

00:31:50.466 --> 00:31:53.733
you said it could be
left, right, or--

00:31:53.733 --> 00:31:55.033
was it
middle or center?

00:31:55.033 --> 00:31:57.766
Can you actually
have it justified as well?

00:32:00.766 --> 00:32:02.166
Pfeiffer: No.

00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:05.666
I don't think we have
a means to justify the text.

00:32:05.666 --> 00:32:08.733
But I also think that,
actually--

00:32:08.733 --> 00:32:14.433
so from all the quality captions
literature that I've read,

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:15.733
how to do quality captions,

00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:20.266
I think justification
has never been proposed

00:32:20.266 --> 00:32:22.533
as a readable way
of doing it

00:32:22.533 --> 00:32:26.533
because it changes
the spacing between characters

00:32:26.533 --> 00:32:28.700
and so therefore makes the text
actually harder to read.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.133
Foliot: I agree.

00:32:30.133 --> 00:32:32.033
Pfeiffer: I don't think we
actually need that feature.

00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:34.100
But it is
a good point, yeah.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.766
Foliot: Well, it just wasn't
specifically declared

00:32:35.766 --> 00:32:36.766
one way or the other.

00:32:36.766 --> 00:32:37.766
I agree with you.

00:32:37.766 --> 00:32:39.066
Pfeiffer: Yeah, okay, fine.

00:32:39.066 --> 00:32:41.466
Excellent.

00:32:41.466 --> 00:32:44.300
Have we got
any more questions?

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.700
Well, thank you very much.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.300
I suppose if anyone
has any more questions,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.700
we're always here
to answer more questions.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.733
There's the Accessibility Group
at Google,

00:32:55.733 --> 00:32:59.000
through which Naomi
can be reached.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.666
And I'm very active
at the W3C.

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:05.266
Feedback can be sent also
to the WHAT Working Group.

00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:08.966
There's plenty of ways
to get to us.

00:33:08.966 --> 00:33:10.300
I should have probably put

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.666
a contact slide in there
as well.

00:33:12.666 --> 00:33:14.866
I'm also on Twitter
and Facebook and so on.

00:33:14.866 --> 00:33:16.900
But just Google my name,
Silvia Pfeiffer.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.966
You'll find me.

00:33:17.966 --> 00:33:19.566
Thank you very much.

00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:22.866
[applause]
