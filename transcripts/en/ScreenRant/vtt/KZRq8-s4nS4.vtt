00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.811
With so much attention given to the cast,
costumes, action and special effects of a

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.509
superhero blockbuster, movie fans have a hard
enough time taking in the movie as a whole.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.500
That means it's almost impossible to catch
all of the tiny details, nods to the fans,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.230
and comic book easter eggs slipped in by the
cast and crew.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.080
But not anymore.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.740
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Hidden Details in
Superhero Movies.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.000
Batman V Superman
When Zack Snyder announced that his Superman

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.640
sequel would pit the Man of Steel against
Batman, he did it with a speech pulled right

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.440
out of Frank Miller's famous comic, The Dark
Knight Returns.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.340
The influences run deep, as the first trailers
for the Justice League lead-in showed Ben

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.199
Affleck's Batman lit up by lightning while
firing a grapple gun - perfectly recreating

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.549
the iconic cover art of the graphic novel.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:55.040
After planting a nod to his previous comic
book movie, 300, in Man of Steel, Zack Snyder

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.460
went even bigger for the sequel.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.540
The sequence involving Superman saving a Russian
rocket from an explosive launch shows the

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.439
numbers 003 on its side - flip them around,
and it's literally the biggest 300 easter

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.930
egg he could probably fit into the picture.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.430
Guardians of the Galaxy
Audiences never find out exactly how Peter

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.110
Quill came to pick his own spaceship, but
the orange and blue Milano is destroyed and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.250
completely rebuilt over the course of the
movie.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.080
In case fans were wondering where the name
came from, director James Gunn has confirmed

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.180
that Quill named his ship after actress Alyssa
Milano - his childhood crush when he was whisked

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.840
away from Earth in 1988.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.480
It isn't just 80s icons that get referenced
in Marvel's space team-up, but their Earthbound

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.590
heroes, too.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.420
Even though Iron Man never makes an appearance
in the movie, one of his best lines does.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.690
When the new Stark Tower is revealed in The
Avengers, Tony gives Pepper Potts "12% of

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.690
the credit."

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.420
It doesn't go over well, and it's the Guardians
of the Galaxy who actually explained why a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.290
few years later.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.190
The Avengers: Age of Ultron
When the villain of the movie goes looking

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.510
to build a new body out of Vibranium, he finds
a massive batch aboard a beached transport

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.330
ship in Africa, called the Churchill.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.350
The name isn't just a nod to the former Prime
Minister, but to Marvel mythology.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.819
In the comics, it was Churchill who sent the
famous explorer Shackleton to find Vibranium

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.819
in the first place.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:20.120
Making this one nod to the comics all but
the hardcore will miss.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.969
Ant-Man
After Scott Lang loses his job at Baskin Robbins,

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.560
he heads home to the apartment he shares with
the rest of his gang.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.769
The room is shown to be inside The Milgrom
Hotel - a name that carries serious weight

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.769
for comic fans.

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.409
The building is a clear nod to comic book
writer, artist, inker and editor Al Milgrom,

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.510
who lent his talents to a number of Marvel
titles before taking over as publisher, including

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.799
“The West Coast Avengers”.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.049
X-Men: Days of Future Past
The movie version of Wolverine may be a different

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.989
one than comic fans are used to, but the crew
on the movie are obviously big fans of the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.360
comic book Logan - and some of his most iconic
stories.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.510
When Logan first wakes up in his 1970s apartment,
it's shown that his love for a brown and yellow

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.799
costume is because those are two of his favorite
colors, judging by the interior.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.090
Fans can also spot samurai swords and a painting
of Mount Fuji - all a nod to his famous Japan

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.379
Saga storyline.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.959
Deadpool
These days, Kevin Feige is best known as the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.730
man in charge at Marvel Studios, but he didn't
start out building the MCU alone.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.889
the producer cut his teeth on other comic
book adaptations like Daredevil, Blade Trinity,

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.650
The Punisher, and X-Men.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.659
It earned him some fans in the crew of the
Deadpool movie, too - the pizza that Wade

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.480
Wilson eats in one of his first scenes is
delivered from Famous Feige's Pizzeria.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.290
To confirm that Deadpool's solo movie would
officially be given an R-Rating, the studio

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.409
came up with an amazing way to make the announcement:
arrange an April Fool's Day PG-13 announcement

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.219
in an interview with Extra's Mario Lopez.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.319
The host played along, getting killed by the
movie's star.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.469
But it wasn't his only gag.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.430
In the actual movie Ryan Reynold's hero can
be seen intently reading from Lopez's memoir,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.900
"Just Between Us."

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.939
The worlds of Fox's X-Men and Marvel's Avengers
are completely divided, but that doesn't stop

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.569
a guy like Deadpool from referencing his MCU
friends.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.249
The biggest example is the movie's final fight,
taking place on a massive, dry-docked aircraft

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:58.249
carrier.

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.370
But it's only in the final shots where audiences
can see that it's actually a heli-carrier,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.950
but just different enough from the version
used by SHIELD in the Avengers movies.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.391
Those are just a handful of details that prove
the people working behind the scenes are often

00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:11.080
even bigger fans than the ones watching the
finish movies.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.900
What are some of your favorite, easy-to-miss
easter eggs in superhero movies?
