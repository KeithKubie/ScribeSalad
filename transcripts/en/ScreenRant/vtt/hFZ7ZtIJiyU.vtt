00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.290
No matter how much the movie industry may
change, some rules will never be broken: the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.770
hero gets the girl, good triumphs over evil,
and nothing guarantees big screen tension

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.410
and over-the-top stunts like a car chase.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.419
Thrilling audiences since the first time a
movie character put the pedal to the metal,

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.740
there are too many memorable chase scenes
to name - but some stand out above the rest.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.800
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Most Epic Car Chases
In Movies.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.080
The French Connection

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.780
You can't mention classic car chases without
bringing up Steve McQueen's "Bullitt."

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.860
But when that chase was hailed as the greatest
ever seen, producer Philip D'Antoni set out

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.200
to top it just three years later, in "The
French Connection."

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.670
With star Gene Hackman in pursuit of a suspect
on an elevated New York train, the filmmakers

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.559
determined that the only way to raise the
stakes was to do it for real.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.010
That meant no police, no permits, and most
importantly, no warning to the public.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.430
Knowing they had just one shot, director William
Friedkin took a camera into the backseat,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.320
and stunt driver Bill Hickman hit the gas,
careening through traffic for over 20 city

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320
blocks.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.299
Their efforts paid off, with every close-call
just dangerous as it seemed, and even an unaware

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.600
driver smashing into Hackman's car.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.149
On lunacy alone, that guarantees it a spot
on our list.

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.149
GoldenEye

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.950
Named for Ian Fleming’s Jamaican Beach house,
1995’s Goldeneye marked Pierce Brosnan's

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.170
first appearance as James Bond.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.130
And to celebrate, director Martin Campbell
had one heck of a chase up his sleeve.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.969
Forget Aston Martins, this version of 007
would take an armoured tank into hot pursuit.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.299
The idea of a stealthy spy went out the window,
as Bond went smashing through buildings, traffic,

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.159
police, military, statues, and even a trailer
full of Perrier in search of his kidnapped

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.330
cyber-genius wing-woman, Natalya.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.330
As insane as the action may be, it was wisely
set to the original 007 theme, telling viewers

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.330
that even if a new age of Bond was dawning,
it did so in the spirit of those that came

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.330
before it.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.560
There are more than a few chases in Goldeneye,
but this is the only one deemed entertaining

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.579
enough for the wildly successful video game
released with the film.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.510
And as serious or slick as Brosnan's films
would become, this chase proved Bond just

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.020
isn't Bond without a little over-the-top action.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.020
Ronin

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.120
Another film that must be mentioned when talking
big screen car chases, "Ronin" has become

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.510
more famous for its climactic car scenes than
its twisting tale of espionage and international

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.510
intrigue.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.599
And it's not surprising: to give the film's
extensive chase added drama, the studio employed

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.300
over 300 stunt drivers, piloting not just
the starring vehicles, but the rest of the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.540
cars on the road.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.420
Set on the actual streets of Paris, France,
the final chase is a showcase for driving

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.340
skills over special effects.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.940
But when the chase has already left other
European pursuits in the dust, the real action

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.260
begins, as the two cars dive into oncoming
traffic.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.930
It may still be movie magic at work, but showing
what two skilled drivers could really do on

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.930
any city street results in a chase that's
impossible to forget.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.209
Furious 6

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.240
It would be impossible to ignore the current
blockbuster juggernaut that is "The Fast &amp; Furious"

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240
for our list, even though recent films have
strayed more into superhero territory than

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.240
classic car movies.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.240
But in the series' sixth instalment, fans
got a bit of both.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.900
When Dominic Toretto's crew is sent to hunt
down villain Owen Shaw, he escapes police

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.900
and takes to the streets - with the film's
stars in pursuit.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.599
They're soon introduced to Shaw's own team,
fighting them with tech, speed, gunfire, and

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.799
even open-wheeled racers able to send cars
flying through the air.

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.409
The film and sequels would go on to embrace
CG on entirely new levels, but this chase

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.739
delivers practical thrills fans expect, and
reminds us that it was a passion for the chase

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.569
that turned these racers into a family.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.580
The Rock

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.069
Of all the films Michael Bay has made, he
names The Rock as his favourite.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.430
It’s not hard to see why, since it features
one of the most satisfying car chases in his

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.430
entire filmography.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.430
It’s as if the director woke up one morning
and wondered how much destruction could fit

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.310
into the six-minute section of the movie,
sending Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage (along

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.980
with what appears to be the ENTIRE San Francisco
police force) ripping through the city’s

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.340
streets on a multi-million dollar chase, destroying
everything they pass Connery shows the worst

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.939
regard for property, smashing through trucks,
taxis, power lines, and even one of the city’s

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:50.939
historic streetcars.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.720
When Cage’s pursuit is cut short, he simply
swaps one stolen vehicle for another and continues

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.090
the destruction.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.189
The sequence’s many quick cuts and energetic
shaky-cam would be used in nearly every one

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.010
of Bay’s films, including the cherry on
top of this destructive sundae: Bay’s trademark

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.159
hero shot, making Connery and Cage seem as
cool as humanly possible although the cars’

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.209
owners would probably disagree.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.510
Deathproof

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.410
When she’s not busy filling in as a body
double for the likes of Lucy Lawless, Uma

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.580
Thurman or Sharon Stone, Zoe Bell takes the
spotlight in her own way, performing death-defying,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.020
manual stunts in an age heavily dominated
by CG effects.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.370
Quentin Tarantino has a passion for old-school
cinema, and an obsession with badass ladies;

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.050
both go to work in this extended car chase
from his "Grindhouse" car movie, "Death Proof".

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.889
The chase picks up when a leather-clad Tracie
Thoms uses her Dodge Challenger to get the

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.880
drop on Kurt Russell’s murderous Stuntman
Mike.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.009
Real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell adds even more
drama to this cat and mouse chase, spending

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.000
most of the scene slipping and sliding on
the car's hood while the drivers play high-stakes

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
bumper cars.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.570
Just as it appears to wind down (Stuntman
Mike getting shot clip) it's the girls who

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.570
take over the pursuit.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.570
Tarantino’s ability to step back and let
the professionals do what they do best sets

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.570
him apart from other directors; in this case
trusting Bell to take point on all her own

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.570
stunts, with the audience enjoying the result.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.570
The Fifth Element

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.570
Bruce Willis steals the show as a renegade
cab driver in this flying car chase set on

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.570
a future Earth.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.490
The chase begins when Leelu, played by Milla
Jovovich, crash-lands in his back seat.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.160
Audiences see what gridlock will look like
in the future as Willis races along at breakneck

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.419
speeds, weaving through traffic in every direction.

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:15.419
Every roadblock, metaphorical or otherwise,
is met with an angry one-liner from Willis,

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:16.419
many of them ad-libbed on the spot.

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.400
Endlessly entertaining, the flying cars add
a novel elements to the tried and true car

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400
chase formula.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.419
Including a futuristic McDonalds drive-thru,
and too many gags and impressive stunts to

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.419
count.

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.940
The film is a cult classic, and this chase
is one of the main reasons why it entertains

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.419
to this day.

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.419
Jack Reacher

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:32.419
This novel adaptation placed most of its spotlight
on its star, Tom Cruise.

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.419
It's a shame, since the action and attitude
of the film was criminally underrated.

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.700
But buried deep within this murder mystery
was one of our favourite throwbacks to the

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.280
classic road movie.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.270
When Jack discovers he's being framed for
a murder, he peels out to track down the men

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.789
responsible, with the police hot on his tail.

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.130
Once the chase is one, not a single line of
dialogue or musical note interrupts, letting

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.960
the sirens, scraped metal, squealing tires
and relentless throttle of Reacher's Chevelle

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.050
tell the story.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.979
Easily the most underrated on our list, this
chase is a perfect example of how classic

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.380
car films can be made new again - and deliver
more attitude and excitement than CG-filled

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.380
action.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380
Drive

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.380
Despite not having a drivers license or an
interest in cars, Nicolas Winding Refn was

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.380
handpicked by Ryan Gosling to direct 2011’s
Drive.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.259
True to its title, the film opens with a silent,
unemotional Gosling playing it cool as the

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.460
toothpick-chewing stuntman-turned-mechanic-turned-getaway
driver.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.389
As a professional with knowledge of every
corner of his city, the dashboard-lit "Driver"

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.580
maintains the upper hand throughout his entire
getaway.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.690
Anticipating their every move, he dodges police
cars and helicopters as quickly as they spot

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.319
him, melting into the shadows of Downtown
L.A.. With nothing but the radio and police

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.319
scanners to listen to, the audience sits alongside
Gosling in his Chevy, trusting he knows what

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.319
he's doing.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.070
The beauty of this chase is its simplicity;
the police come close to catching their target,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.130
but by keeping a cool head, the "Driver" is
able to disappear completely.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.539
Proving that you don't need music, dialogue,
or even traditional action to put audiences

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.330
on the edges of their seats.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.470
The Matrix Reloaded

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.360
To make the extended car chase of The Matrix
Reloaded a reality, the filmmakers spent 48

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.380
days filming on a freeway they constructed
specifically for the shoot.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.380
Its ambition is its biggest trademark.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.360
As the film's ghostly villain twins float
from vehicle to vehicle, The Wachowskis perfectly

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.509
blend car chases, knife fights, and more to
create one of the most memorable scenes in

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:03.650
the entire sci-fi franchise.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.650
Despite the story’s hero being absent for
most of the chase, the audience can't look

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.650
away once the chase begins.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.650
Any void left by Neo is forgotten as Morpheus
cuts a car in half with a sword, and the movie's

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.650
most memorable song pounds in our ears.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.069
Keeping track of Trinity becomes a game in
itself, switching directions, weaving in and

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.949
out of traffic, and swapping vehicles with
ease.

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.580
Because every obstacle is the result of a
computer program, there is no limit to the

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.110
amount of carnage.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.360
The result is a flashy, tense, thirteen-minute
saga in which every car is expendable, and

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.080
every explosion is guilt-free.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.419
When Neo finally arrives, he does so in a
spectacular fashion; manipulating the rules

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.050
of gravity to save the day.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.610
That's it for our picks of the "Most Epic
Car Chases in Movies, are there any we missed?
