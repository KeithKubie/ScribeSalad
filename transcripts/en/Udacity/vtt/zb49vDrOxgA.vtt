00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:02.464
The supercomputer architect Seymor Cray

00:00:02.464 --> 00:00:04.088
used to say, would you rather plough a field

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:06.723
with two strong oxen or a 1,024 chickens.

00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:08.477
Cray preferred computers with fewer, more

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:11.293
powerful processors. He liked the oxen.

00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:12.573
In this class, we will take the side of the

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:15.041
chickens.Modern computing products are like

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.574
the chickens. They have hundreds of

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:18.049
processing minds harnessing that power

00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:19.583
requires a different way of thinking than

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.797
programming a single processor.

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:23.376
In this class, we will teach you how to program

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:25.459
the GPU. More importantly, we will teach you to

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:28.346
think about programming through a parallel lens

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:29.881
I am John Owens and I will be teaching this

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:32.688
class with Dave Luci from Nvidia. In this class

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:34.388
we will learn about parallel programming by

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:36.224
coating up a series of image processing

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:37.983
algorithms such as you might find in Photoshop

00:00:37.983 --> 00:00:40.367
or Instagram. And we will be able to implement

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.015
these on high-end GPUs, even if you do not

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:44.995
have one at home yourself. I am looking forward

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:48.549
to seeing you in class.
