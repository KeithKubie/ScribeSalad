00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.280
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the
universe, thanks to it being simply one proton

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.250
paired with one electron.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.660
Here on Earth we usually see it bound to oxygen
to form water, and very rarely hydrogen atoms

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.650
pair up and exist as a gas in our atmosphere.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.340
But theoretically in the right conditions
hydrogen alone can act as a liquid metal,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.070
and learning more about it could answer some
mysteries about planets in our solar system.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.779
We know Jupiter and Saturn are mostly Hydrogen
based on their densities, which is why they’re

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.289
called the gas giants.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.210
But they’re not puffy clouds all the way
down as the name might suggest.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.050
Only the thin outermost layer is gaseous.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.100
Under that, the pressure compresses the hydrogen
into a liquid state, and further down still

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.829
the hydrogen takes on metallic properties.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.220
Most elements in the periodic table are metals.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.961
Their defining characteristic is they pass
electrons freely amongst each other, like

00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.080
a shared pool of electrons.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.640
This makes them good conductors of heat and
electricity.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.559
Normally the Hydrogen we see on Earth doesn’t
behave like a metal, but at about 13,000 km

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.130
below Jupiter’s gaseous surface, things
are different.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.569
Like a substitute teacher, with enough pressure
those hydrogen molecules snap.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:15.450
In fact the hydrogen atoms dissociate entirely
into free electrons and protons.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.909
The pressure inside Jupiter gives it the properties
of a metal: those electrons can flow freely

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.840
from proton to proton, making the hydrogen
conductive.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.340
We think this metallic hydrogen could account
for the magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.139
and Saturn, instead of a molten iron core
like inside Earth.

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:36.090
But to understand metallic hydrogen better
we have to make it, and that’s no easy task.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.789
It’s not like we can scoop some up from
deep inside Jupiter, instead we have to recreate

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.469
those conditions somehow here on Earth.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.179
I am very happy to report that one leading
method involves giant lasers.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.920
The lasers, all 168 of them, are used to send
shock waves through a sample of ultracool

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.789
liquid deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with
one neutron.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.059
The waves compress the deuterium to six million
times earth’s atmospheric pressure while

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:07.889
keeping the sample below 1,700 degrees celsius,
or what physicists call “cool.”

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:12.349
At least they think it’s that cool, because
measuring the temperature inside the shock

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.599
wave isn’t possible and instead is inferred
through computer simulations.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.860
Still, the scientists concluded liquid deuterium
becomes metallic at 2 million times the pressure

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.599
of Earth’s atmosphere.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.970
That contradicts another lab’s findings
that the transition happens at around 3 million

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.400
atmospheres of pressure.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.769
Each lab politely and professionally says
the other one must have incorrect temperature

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.370
estimates, and that their own results are
the true and correct ones.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.030
That’s about the closest scientists get
to reality show drama and I for one am living

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.030
for it!

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.109
There’s been even more drama around a 2017
Harvard experiment’s attempt at making metallic

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.230
hydrogen.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.870
Using the tips of two diamonds like a vise,
scientists claimed they crushed a hydrogen

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.650
sample to nearly 4.9 million atmospheres until
it wasn’t just metallic, but solid as well,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.140
a world first.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.010
They were going to send it to another lab
for study, but wouldn’t you know it, just

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.660
before shipping it they decided to check the
pressure with a laser one more time for good

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.019
measure, and the diamonds shattered to dust.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.439
The sample was lost.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.060
This has lead other scientists to speculate
that it didn’t actually… happen.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.489
Still, the Harvard scientists think the lost
hydrogen could still be in a solid state,

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.739
even with the pressure lifted.

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.760
It might even be a room temperature superconductor,
which would revolutionize materials science.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.349
But finding the 10 micrometer wide sample
in a pile of diamond dust is next to impossible.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.430
Darn.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.519
Funny, we go through all this trouble to create
a speck of metallic hydrogen, but thanks to

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.629
Jupiter and Saturn’s vast sizes it’s the
most common form of hydrogen among all of

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.629
our planets.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.340
Sometimes there are drawbacks to living on
Earth.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.629
While you’re here subscribe for more videos,
like this one about how Jupiter could be the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.790
reason for life on Earth.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.879
Some scientists don’t believe the Harvard
experiment made solid metallic hydrogen because

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.670
at a high enough pressure the hydrogen can
diffuse right through the diamond!

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.849
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next time
on Seeker!
