00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.340
JOHN STOSSEL: Do your
kids have a good teacher?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.495
How do you know?

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:13.180
Maybe the teacher
next door is better.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.985
Maybe there's a better
teacher in another state.

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:19.680
Maybe there's a world's
best teacher, or several.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.910
Wouldn't it be great if your
kids could have that teacher?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.810
Well today, yes you can.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.980
SPEAKER 1: Yay, I got it.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.600
JOHN STOSSEL: These kids are
this excited about a math

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.280
website.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.280
SPEAKER 2: It's amazing.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.622
SPEAKER 3: Negative 4
minus 4, and we are done.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.205
SPEAKER 1: It taught
me lot of things.

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:44.150
JOHN STOSSEL: Five years ago,
hedge fund analyst Sal Khan

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.914
created videos like these
to tutor his cousin.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.330
SALMAN KHAN: That
worked out well.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.750
So then I started tutoring
her brothers and more cousins,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.380
and all the rest.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.588
And I had to do the same
lecture over and over again.

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:55.340
So I had a friend
who said, hey Sal,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.470
why don't you put some of
your lectures on YouTube?

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.460
I decided to give it a shot.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.970
SPEAKER 3: Welcome to this
presentation on basic addition.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.457
JOHN STOSSEL: Soon, thousands
watched his lectures.

00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:07.040
SALMAN KHAN: I started
getting letters

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.430
from people and
comments on YouTube.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.670
And they're not
like, hey, I think

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.740
this kind of might have
helped my math exam.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.615
They're like, I failed
calculus the first time.

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:19.990
I've started
watching the videos,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.625
now I'm acing the class.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.710
JOHN STOSSEL: The YouTube
numbers kept rising,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.905
and he got letters from
the Middle East, Africa.

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:29.550
BILL GATES: What Sal
Khan has done is amazing.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.750
JOHN STOSSEL: Now Khan
is funded by Bill Gates,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.050
and he offers web lectures
on everything from history

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.870
to economics to
computer science.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.015
His videos are viewed
millions of times.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.390
SALMAN KHAN: Not only is it
reaching millions of students

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.270
right now, but even if, God
forbid, I got hit by a bus

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.500
when I walked
outside, it'll still

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990
be able to reach
millions and maybe

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.323
eventually billions of students.

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:51.750
JOHN STOSSEL: You just happen
to be good at teaching?

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.386
SALMAN KHAN: Well, I'll
take that as a compliment.

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:55.760
JOHN STOSSEL: It
is a compliment.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.250
He's a great teacher.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.760
SPEAKER 3: I hope that helps.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.166
See you in the next video.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.290
SPEAKER 4: It's really
helping us learn a lot more.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.748
JOHN STOSSEL: It's
exciting that he

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:07.180
gets kids so excited about math.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.160
In most parts of life, things
have gotten much better-- cars,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.020
computers, cell phones.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.920
Education?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.439
Not so much.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.230
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.000
You rewind 80 or
90 or 100 years,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.120
and you would have
the local band--

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.420
if you had a party, that
was the only gig in town.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.246
JOHN STOSSEL: Each village might
have a storyteller or singer.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.120
SALMAN KHAN: Exactly.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.840
But then once you have
mass media coming out,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.800
then people say, wait.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.660
Why don't we take the best
musician, the best actor,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.770
the best storyteller,
whatever way, and record it?

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.750
And put it out on radio, put
it out on records, or whatever?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.275
And I think, in
theory, that could

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:43.870
have happened with
education before.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.036
JOHN STOSSEL: But it hasn't.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.570
Even for basic math,
multiplication tables,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.790
I thought they'd be
using video games.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.590
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.506
JOHN STOSSEL: Why not?

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.820
SALMAN KHAN: There's a huge
bureaucracy, most of which

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.157
wants to say no to
change the system.

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:57.990
JOHN STOSSEL: It's the
blob, people call it.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.115
SALMAN KHAN: It's the blob.

00:02:59.115 --> 00:02:59.670
And it is.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.270
And I think what's fun
from our point of view

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.586
is that we are able to reach
students outside of the blob.

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.460
JOHN STOSSEL: This
California school district

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.570
started using Khan's videos
in fifth grade classrooms.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.900
The teachers were
skeptical, but now they're

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.707
impressed at what it
does for the kids.

00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:16.790
KAMI THORARDSON: They're
happy to walk in the door

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.200
every morning.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.340
They're excited about math.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.170
It isn't, oh, we're doing math.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.211
It's like, oh my gosh, we
have math this morning.

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.240
That's great.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.062
SALMAN KHAN: We assume that
most people on their own

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:28.645
don't want to do,
don't want to learn,

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:30.770
or don't want to get
engaged in mathematics.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.870
And--

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.880
JOHN STOSSEL: Yeah, they didn't.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.755
SALMAN KHAN: I think
they're just frustrated,

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.490
because most of them
are in classrooms

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.474
that are not catering to them.

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:39.140
JOHN STOSSEL: At
first, teachers worried

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.960
that the online instruction
could replace them.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.514
But--

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.180
SANDRA McGONAGLE: I
think it's so wrong,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.680
as my teachers would tell you.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.040
They have taught more math than
they've ever taught before.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.754
JOHN STOSSEL: Now teachers
can tutor kids one on one.

00:03:51.754 --> 00:03:53.295
SPEAKER 5: Colleen,
I notice you were

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.186
having some issues
with fractions.

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:58.920
SPEAKER 6: You can
go at your own pace.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.620
JOHN STOSSEL: And because kids
can go at their own pace--

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.995
KELLY RAFFERTY:
I've got students

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:05.000
who are still working
on easy multiplication.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.820
And then I've got
students who are

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.360
working in high school math.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.690
JOHN STOSSEL: Some kids
enjoy Khan's lessons so much,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.482
they study at home.

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:12.648
KELLY RAFFERTY: Some of
them are doing two and three

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:14.930
hours a night at home when
I'm asking for 15 minutes.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.374
SPEAKER 7: When I'm at home
and I have some time, I just

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:17.915
log on, and--

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.809
SPEAKER 8: It's way
more fun to do math.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.100
JOHN STOSSEL: So finally,
after all these years of kids

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.810
being bored in school and not
learning math, that's over?

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.624
SALMAN KHAN: I
think it might be.

00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:28.540
JOHN STOSSEL: Hope so.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.810
If it happens, it'll
be thanks to those

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.660
of online classes, or
the charter schools,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.620
or other experiments
that break out

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.850
of the union-dominated
government monopoly.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.560
Let 1,000 flowers bloom.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.100
It's competition that's
given us better medicine,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.040
transportation,
technology, everything.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.770
Don't our kids deserve that too?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.710
That's our show.
