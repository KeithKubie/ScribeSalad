00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
to understand how closely related we are

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
to understand how closely related we are
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.110
to understand how closely related we are
to chimps and bonobos we're more closely

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
to chimps and bonobos we're more closely
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.740
to chimps and bonobos we're more closely
related to them than an Indian elephant

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
related to them than an Indian elephant
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.259
related to them than an Indian elephant
is to an African elephant so whether you

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
is to an African elephant so whether you
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.580
is to an African elephant so whether you
look at in terms of DNA or how long it's

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
look at in terms of DNA or how long it's
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.470
look at in terms of DNA or how long it's
been since the lines the evolutionary

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
been since the lines the evolutionary
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.929
been since the lines the evolutionary
lines diverged and it's important to

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939
lines diverged and it's important to
 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000
lines diverged and it's important to
know that we're equidistant from chimps

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
know that we're equidistant from chimps
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.029
know that we're equidistant from chimps
and bonobos so anytime you read that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
and bonobos so anytime you read that
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.419
and bonobos so anytime you read that
chimps are the closest non-human primate

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
chimps are the closest non-human primate
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.080
chimps are the closest non-human primate
to to us or conversely that bonobos are

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
to to us or conversely that bonobos are
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510
to to us or conversely that bonobos are
the closest they're both false chimps

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
the closest they're both false chimps
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520
the closest they're both false chimps
and bonobos are equidistant from humans

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
and bonobos are equidistant from humans
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340
and bonobos are equidistant from humans
as close as your left hand and your

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
as close as your left hand and your
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.720
as close as your left hand and your
right hand are to your head they're

right hand are to your head they're
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.080
right hand are to your head they're
exactly the same distance so it's very

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
exactly the same distance so it's very
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.549
exactly the same distance so it's very
important to understand that now on one

aggressive there's evidence of warfare

between groups murder is relatively

sorts of aggressive behaviors is rampant
in societies but on the other side you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
in societies but on the other side you
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.980
in societies but on the other side you
have bonobos who are very highly

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
have bonobos who are very highly
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.179
have bonobos who are very highly
sexualized and in which over forty years

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
sexualized and in which over forty years
 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920
sexualized and in which over forty years
that they've been observed in the wild

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
that they've been observed in the wild
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560
that they've been observed in the wild
and in captivity not a single case of

combat between groups has ever been
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.460
combat between groups has ever been
observed not in zoos not in the wild so

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
observed not in zoos not in the wild so
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560
observed not in zoos not in the wild so
they're sort of the light in the dark

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
they're sort of the light in the dark
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600
they're sort of the light in the dark
side of human nature we could say and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
side of human nature we could say and
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.429
side of human nature we could say and
it's important not to fall for this line

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
it's important not to fall for this line
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.899
it's important not to fall for this line
that we're closer to chimps and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
that we're closer to chimps and
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.359
that we're closer to chimps and
therefore the the nasty aggressive dark

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
therefore the the nasty aggressive dark
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149
therefore the the nasty aggressive dark

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.580
side of man is one book puts it is more
deeply embedded in us than the other

that's born now you think about how many

about intercourse think of all the types

about intercourse think of all the types
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.050
about intercourse think of all the types
of sex we have they can't possibly

result in conception it's a very small

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760
result in conception it's a very small
 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.909
result in conception it's a very small
percentage of our sexual behavior that

chimps and bonobos we split from them

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
chimps and bonobos we split from them
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.360
chimps and bonobos we split from them
about 7 million years ago so according

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
about 7 million years ago so according
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.369
about 7 million years ago so according
to conventional thinking and

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379
to conventional thinking and
 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.740

between these 3 species that separated 7

6 to 7 million years ago it's very

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.169
6 to 7 million years ago it's very
 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.220
6 to 7 million years ago it's very
likely that that trait was shared also

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230
likely that that trait was shared also
 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.459
likely that that trait was shared also
by the last common ancestor so we can

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469
by the last common ancestor so we can
 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.009
by the last common ancestor so we can
look back 6 to 7 million years and say

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019
look back 6 to 7 million years and say
 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.500
look back 6 to 7 million years and say
that has been 6 to 7 million years of

that has been 6 to 7 million years of
 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.349
that has been 6 to 7 million years of

advent of monogamy so that gives you a

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159
advent of monogamy so that gives you a
 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.920
advent of monogamy so that gives you a
sense of why it's so difficult for most

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
sense of why it's so difficult for most
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.929

this the same path for so long and then

this the same path for so long and then
 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.670
this the same path for so long and then
suddenly we're told no no that's not the

suddenly we're told no no that's not the
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.830
suddenly we're told no no that's not the
way we behave anymore and in fact that's

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840
way we behave anymore and in fact that's
 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.499
way we behave anymore and in fact that's
not natural so if you behave that way or

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:37.509
not natural so if you behave that way or
 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.210
not natural so if you behave that way or
you want to behave that way or you

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220
you want to behave that way or you
 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.610
you want to behave that way or you
fantasize about behaving that way or you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620
fantasize about behaving that way or you
 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.409

get off on watching other people behave

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419
get off on watching other people behave
 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.789
get off on watching other people behave
that way there's something wrong with

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799
that way there's something wrong with
 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.710
that way there's something wrong with
you you're sick there's something wrong
