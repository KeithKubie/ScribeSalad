- FEELS GOOD? I'M STIFF
AS A BOARD, YOU FREAKY BASTARD!

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.440

YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE HER,

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.109
BUT SHE WON'T GIVE ME
THE TIME OF DAY.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.444
NOW SHE'S DATING
THE CEO OF SKYMALL.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.914
WHAT DOES HE HAVE THAT I DON'T?

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.717
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.920

WHEN THEY'RE DOWN.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.755
THAT'S WHAT I DO, LITERALLY.

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.690
I GET LIFE ALERT

YOUR PANTIES OFF.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.163
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.200
- IT MAY LOOK LIKE AN ORDINARY
FAN-COOLED SOLAR SAFARI HAT,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.768
BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTER BOX.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:09.603

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.807
I WAS JUST TELLING A FRIEND
THAT I WISH I HAD A HAT

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.410
THAT A CAT COULD SHIT IN.
- SKYMALL!

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.246
- LISTEN, I KNOW WE'VE ONLY
BEEN ON A COUPLE OF DATES,

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:21.915
BUT I SEE A REAL FUTURE FOR US.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.352
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.
THAT'S WHY I GOT YOU THIS.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.689

THE ANSWER IS YE--

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.792

WHITE NOISE MACHINE.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.627
- WHAT?
BUT WHAT ABOUT US?

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.762
- WE'RE DONE.
I'M NOT READY TO SETTLE DOWN.

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:37.497
BUT YOU CAN SET THIS
TO HEAVY RAIN

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.499
TO MASK THE SOUND
OF YOUR TEARS.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.702
- YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH ME?

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.103
[rain pattering]

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.005

- GIVE ME THAT!

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:48.575
- STEVE, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.744
ETHEL'S LOWER
THAN ABE VIGODA'S LEFT NUT.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.746
- HER NEXT BOTTLE'S ON ME.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.182
- NO, I'LL CALL YOU,
I PROMISE.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.852
WE JUST [bleep] IN THE BATHROOM.
I'M OUT!

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.521
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY TO DRIVE?

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.824
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY TO
MIND YOUR OWN GODDAMN BUSINESS?

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.325
I'M FINE.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:07.995
YOU'RE DOING GOOD, JOHNSON.

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:09.796
JUST KEEP IT BETWEEN THE LINES.

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.466
[water bubbling]

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.235
OH, CRAP. MALLOY, QUICK!
