Do you remember
for Bumping Mics

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.302
I said I was gonna bring
in some hats for you guys?

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:04.504
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Hell yeah.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.738 line:92%
Here's some.

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.173
Fuck yeah, dude.
It was so funny.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.408 line:92%
Jeff Ross, Dave Attell.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.642 line:92%
Very limited amount.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.878
This is for Christine,
this is for you Dan, I'm sorry.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.079 line:92%
I have shirts, too.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.681
Black Lou, you know
I can't fit that hat.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.216
Maybe you guys want
some of these.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.451 line:92%
I have fetal alcohol syndrome,

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:19.819
which means that hat
does not fit my head.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.020 line:92%
Dan, if you put it on the-

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.457
Put it on the last hook.
This will be the best.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.025
God dammit, this always
happens to me in my life,

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.660
and it's always embarrassing
enough.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:28.895
It is, because
that's ridiculous.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.129 line:92%
Wow, now I feel horrible.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.065
No, now I have to do it in front
of Dave Attell, this sucks.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.234
No, it's good, put it
in the very last one.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:36.769 line:92%
You're right.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:39.372
God dammit, it doesn't even go
to the last one.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.606
Did it break open?
Yeah.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:41.841
Your head split open
the last hook?

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.109 line:92%
Yeah.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.610
Man, Black Lou really got
a kick out of that.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:45.845 line:92%
That would be-

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.046 line:92%
Look, watch, I'll try to go ...

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.383
snap it.
Jesus, man.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.086
Yeah, but if this was Shark
Tank, that would be your thing.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.353 line:92%
"Here's a proposal-"

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.588 line:92%
Yeah. I go

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.391
"Now, a hat for people
with fetal alcohol syndrome.'

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.563
Did you guys watch a lot of TV?
I see you both as more-

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.764 line:92%
I did.

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:05.998 line:92%
Sports oriented, like hey,

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:07.233
let's go out
and throw the ball around.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.468
No, we didn't have dads.
I did that, too.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.669 line:92%
Oh.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.937
Well, I did that
with my friends,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.138 line:92%
same as you, as I got older.

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.706
No, when I was a kid,
it was very TV,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.943
so I watched a lot of TV shows
that people my age

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.712
are not that aware of and
Christine knows some of them,

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.648
she knows those shows
from Nick at Night,

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.951
she said, but I would watch them
just late night on TV,

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.720
and that would be anything
from the Honeymooners

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.356
to Carol Burnett Show
I used to watch a lot.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:31.557
-Really?
-Really?

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.093
Yeah. With Tim,
what was his name, Tim Conway.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.361 line:92%
Tim Conway.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:36.596
-And Harvey Korman.
-Yeah.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.499
I used to watch that show a ton.
Taxi, like-

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.100 line:92%
I used to watch Mama's House.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.436
She used to end every show
with a Q&amp;A with the audience.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.239
They'd always have like
"I'm from Missouri."

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.608
She'd meet her crowd.
It was kind of frightening.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.909 line:92%
The worst was when Tracey Ullman

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.410
would do the thing
with the crowd at the end

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:54.547
and she'd go "Oh, go home,
get out of here, go home."

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:56.782 line:92%
That stupid voice.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:00.653
"What are you doing? Go home."
She does 1,000 characters

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.922
and they're all an old,
weird, English witch.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.324 line:92%
That was my, you go to school

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.760
and you can't wait to get home
to watch some TV,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.464
and eat really bad food.
My mom would make me sandwiches.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.467
Like in South Park,
I was the fat kid-

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.801
-Cartman?
-Cartman?

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.937 line:92%
Like "Mom, make me a sandwich."

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.740
These kids now,
they don't even need that,

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:21.974 line:92%
because they have the phones,

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:23.743
so they can just do it
whenever they wanna do it,

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.144 line:92%
but we had to race home.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:26.946
Dude, racing home
from the bus stop,

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.848
I knew if I got home
at a certain time I could watch

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:31.784
two Saved by the Bells,
and two Brady Bunches.

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:33.186 line:92%
You're absolutely right.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.722
Izabella, if you guys got rid of
cable, it wouldn't matter much.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.091
Yeah, really, you watch
everything on Hulu,

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:40.359 line:92%
and Netflix, and stuff.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.461
Yeah, and everything's
on demand.

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.497
It is a crazy thing
to live through,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.767
and every year
I get a new technology

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.802
that I'm willing to believe in
and give in to.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:51.070 line:92%
What is it now?

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:53.573
I'm trying to think
what next year's is gonna be.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.107 line:92%
I didn't believe in ...

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.344
Online payment was a big one
for me, now I'm okay with it.

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:00.146
Are you-
I'm not into that either.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.747
Yeah, you have a flip phone,
you're still like-

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.482
Yeah, I have a flip phone,
I don't Uber,

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.717 line:92%
I don't do any of that stuff.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.385
You don't Uber?
It's just all yellow cabs?

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:07.587 line:92%
I don't.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.622
What if you're on the road
and you need-

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.794
Then I guess I have to walk,
good man. Like Kwai

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.462
Chang Caine in Kung Fu,
I'm just walking through the-

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.697 line:92%
Good god.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.465
No, when I was out in LA,
I was just out there,

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:20.800
and I told this to Nikki
Glaser earlier,

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.134 line:92%
because we both were out in LA

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:24.904
doing shows,
and I took regular cabs.

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:28.708
It was really weird to be
the only guy hailing a cab.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:31.310
I was there to solve
the Black Dahlia murder,

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:32.912
I'm like
"Take me to Hollywood and Vine."

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.080 line:92%
Don't you understand?

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.615
The guy that was behind
the first Superman

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:36.882 line:92%
is linked to this murder,

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:38.818
and I can prove that it goes
all way up to the studios.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.052 line:92%
Those guys, those cab drivers-

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:41.287 line:92%
It's actually significant-

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.190
Are not our cab drivers.
It's like a small club.

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:46.525
Definitely there's
some kind of initiation.

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:47.793 line:92%
Really?

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:52.198
It's an Armenian, some kind of
burn a card with a dove feather.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.700
Some kind of weird ...
Blood in, blood out.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:56.669
Yeah, if you borrowed a cab
driver's car

00:03:56.702 --> 00:03:57.970
and showed up,
they'd be like

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.139
"Did you not do
the walk of fire?"

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:03.643
They don't know any places
outside of their little world.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.078
"Take me to
the Melrose Improv."

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:08.814
"Improv?"
They just repeat it in a weird-

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.483 line:92%
I'm telling you, I was off,

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.118
I didn't do Uber
for a long time, either.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.220
I stayed away from that one,
too, and just did cabs.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.123 line:76%
However, once you buy the new
technology, it is way better.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.324 line:78%
It is.

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:19.558 line:92%
It's significantly better,

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:20.826
because you don't
have to say anything.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.095
You get in, and he's got a map
to where you're going already.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:24.329
-Let's play a game.
-Okay.

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:26.932
You ready? Let's try and guess
how many people in this room

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:29.468
have ridden on
an electric scooter.

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.702 line:92%
I'm gonna say-

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:34.073
I'll be, since it's my game,
I'll say right away I have not.

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:35.274
You have not?
Okay. I-

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:37.010 line:92%
I'm gonna say you have.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:38.844 line:92%
Have not.

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:40.379 line:92%
Really? I'm down one.

00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:42.081
Down one.
You're up. Electric scooter.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:43.316 line:92%
I've never been on one.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.517
-No.
-No.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.718
-No.
-Never.

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.019
Never.
Absolutely not.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.254 line:92%
Well, here's what happened.

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:49.989 line:92%
Oh.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.558
Of all the people in the room,
I thought Jay was not-

00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:53.893
Yeah, you were waiting for Jay
to be like

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.428
"Nah, bro,
I'm ..."

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.331
I was in San Diego, and I saw
them lying around all outside,

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.901
and where I had to go,
I walked it every time,

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.070
but it was a half mile
or so walk.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.438 line:92%
Then I saw them lying around,

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.672
they look like
they're kind of fun.

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:07.573 line:92%
Yes.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:08.207
They do look like
they're kind of fun.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.408 line:92%
In fact-

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:11.744
So I got the whole app,
and loaded it up,

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:15.915
and then I got on it,
and I put one foot on it,

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.483
and pushed the button
to see what kind it does,

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:19.318
I'm like "Oh, yeah,
look at that, it goes."

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:20.519 line:92%
Then I got on it,

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:22.822
and it says you're supposed
to kick a few times,

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:26.359
then it will start catching.
I think I was too heavy for it,

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:29.529
so I didn't ever really
caught the motor part.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.831
Then I just didn't want
to be embarrassed

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.165
and get off it
with like an angry

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:34.567
"Stupid thing
doesn't even work."

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.435 line:92%
So I just foot cranked myself

00:05:36.468 --> 00:05:38.404
the whole way there
like an idiot.

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:41.674
I looked like an asshole.
This Asian kid is just cruising,

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:43.642
Tokyo Drifting
through everything.

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:44.910
Yeah, probably like
"Move, analog."

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:48.180
I was a fat kid, yeah I'm like
"Hey, I'm sorry everyone."

00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:49.648 line:92%
"I'm too big for it."

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.550
Yeah.
"I have to get to Big and Tall

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.519
before it closes,
I gotta party."

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:55.254 line:92%
A big and tall scooter.

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:58.624
When I was in Spokane,
It was Halloween,

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:00.359
so right away
everyone's costumed up,

00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:02.061
but they're all still
on the scooters,

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:03.562 line:92%
so it's really weird to see.

00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:06.265
They're like drunk,
and they're going no helmets,

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:08.634
just dressed up
as The Little Mermaid

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:12.038
going right into the bar,
wiping out everywhere.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:15.207
I think that's cool, I'm sure
these guys have all done it.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.475
Electric scooter?
Never.

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:17.710
No?
Cory, electric scooter?

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:18.911 line:92%
What am I, I thought I was-

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:20.479
Well it's not in New York
really yet.

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:21.680 line:92%
No, no I know.

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:23.015 line:92%
It won't. It shouldn't be.

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:24.283 line:92%
I really hope they don't.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:27.787
They should do a one two punch
of pot is legal and scooters.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.155 line:92%
Grid lock.

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.890 line:92%
What? Holy shit.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.591
Grid lock. Scooter grid lock.
All the way,

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:34.827
I mean, there will be 1,000
scooter deaths a year if it's-

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.162
In New York?
You can't have it.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.563
-In New York? I'm sure, yeah.
-It's impossible.

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.498
Oh, dude, when they found out
how to pop the governor

00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:41.967
off those things and just
take him without using it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.669
-Mm-hmm.
-What about-

00:06:43.702 --> 00:06:46.906
It is a weird rule that it's
just like drop it on the street

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.374
wherever you found it,
who gives a shit?

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:50.610
Whatever, we don't care.
What are we, nerds?

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:53.579 line:92%
We really are designing jobs.

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:57.683
I talked to an Uber driver
about this the other day,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.420
and Dave Smith used to have
a pretty great joke,

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:03.956
but he used it as being
on a desert island.

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:05.157
But we always make
all the jokes,

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.792
we talk about it
on the show a lot,

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:08.294 line:92%
our part in the apocalypse,

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:11.297
like what it's gonna be
when we're walking dead life,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.799
and I think we have to
really start

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:15.000 line:92%
making our way to the Midwest.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:16.268 line:92%
Really?

00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:18.437
That's what I've decided,
because what skills do we ...

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.140
Forget all the technology,
we have no technology,

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:22.675 line:92%
we have no electricity,

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.778
and I feel like we're in
a pile of web designers,

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.448 line:92%
and fucking fashion buyers.

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:31.116
Who of us in this room
right here-

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:32.618 line:92%
media market.

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:40.059
Is gonna kill, skin, cook,
dice up and cook fucking deer?

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.727
I couldn't even
do the process of,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.162 line:92%
I don't know if I could kill it.

00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:44.396 line:92%
Yeah, that'd be real tough.

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:47.099
That's weird, because New York
is known for its chefs,

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:48.968
but yet we have
very few hunters.

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.236
That's really
gonna be tough here.

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.171
Yeah, we got Gordon Ramsay
but we got-

00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:54.039
Yeah, we're all gatherers.
No hunters.

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:57.343
We got so many guys
who know fusion food recipes.

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.178
I know, that's great. He goes
"Let me get on the plane,

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:02.014
I'll give you a nice
Asian fusion deer with-"

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:04.750
It is funny, as soon as
this shit goes haywire,

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:07.786
the people you're gonna be
right next to are wild

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:11.090
Trump supporters. Everybody
who everyone says they hate,

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.958
you're gonna wanna buddy up
to that guy real quick,

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:14.393
because he knows
how to kill an elk.

00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:16.729
Those are people
that you called dumb.

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.230
You'll be like
"You guys are dumb,"

00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:20.166
and they're like
"I know how to farm."

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:24.437
"Well, Hillary
had some good ideas."

00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:29.275
I just realized
as a 41-year-old,

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.877 line:92%
I lack almost all skill

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.546
that doesn't involve technology
to survive.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:34.747 line:92%
Dave-

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.315 line:92%
Did you ever go camping?

00:08:36.348 --> 00:08:37.516 line:92%
Real camping, never.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.751
-Did you?
-No, I was in Boy Scouts though.

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.019
-You were?
-Yeah.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.487
I was too, but I feel like
we're all gonna-

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.988
So follow me.
How many badges?

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.824
I would say I was somewhere,
I was not really ...

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.760
Remember, this was right
after the Vietnam war,

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.595
so being in a uniform
was really tough.

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:50.930 line:92%
It was really tough.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.565 line:92%
Did they call you baby killers?

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:55.034
I was spat on many of time
coming out of an airport,

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.335 line:92%
but it was funny-

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:57.770
Dave's going to
get ice cream ...

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:01.340
It's funny, it was more of a get
high in the woods kind of scene,

00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:04.577
because there was no helicopter
parenting, it was more like

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.146
"Okay, you guys, you're out
there, you're camping,

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:08.647 line:92%
Tang and all that kind of stuff,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.883 line:76%
and making fires
that you don't need,

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:12.384 line:76%
and just having good times,
you know?

00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:13.719
You wouldn't hear from
your parents

00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:14.954
or contact them
the whole time you were gone

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:16.255
because you couldn't.
There was no way to.

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:17.690
Not at all.
If something happened to you at

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.525
Boy Scout Camp,
which did happen to me,

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.327
I was hit on the head
with a log,

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.662
they would have
to send a runner.

00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:25.264
They would have
to send the fastest ...

00:09:25.297 --> 00:09:26.465 line:92%
That's so funny.

00:09:26.498 --> 00:09:27.733
Skip-
Take this.

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:29.435 line:92%
Run it down to the fire trail.

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:30.636 line:92%
You must run.

00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:33.105
I'm pretty sure the only
Boy Scout camping trip

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:37.476
I went on was a set up for a
couple guys to molest all of us,

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:39.945
but I just think
he wasn't attracted to me.

00:09:39.978 --> 00:09:42.281
I can only guess that
because we went to,

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:44.951
in the middle of the woods,
I mean an abandoned ...

00:09:45.684 --> 00:09:47.319
We all slept
in an abandoned house

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:48.621 line:92%
in the middle of the woods.

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:49.922 line:92%
Did you guys all have-

00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:51.490 line:92%
To call it a cabin wasn't fair.

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:53.759
It was a place where crack heads
would sleep

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.662
if this was in a city.
It was a boarded up weird thing

00:09:56.695 --> 00:09:58.364
that that they put a fire
in the fireplace.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.665 line:92%
Pretty bad ass.

00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:00.899 line:92%
Everyone slept on the floor,

00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:03.035
it was freezing cold,
like leaves inside.

00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:04.303 line:92%
That's not the Boy Scouts.

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:05.504 line:92%
And I'm tell ... Yeah.

00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:06.972
That's the caravan.
That was the Blair Witch.

00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:08.240 line:92%
Part of the caravan.

00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:09.541
It was the Blair Witch.
No, I'm telling you,

00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:12.011
that's what it felt like,
the whole vibe was very bizarre.

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.746
You guys just went in
this old house and-

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.381
Yeah, I swear to you,
something like that.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:16.649 line:92%
That's pretty bad ass.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.183
-No, it's not, Dan.
-Wow, that is cool.

00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:19.418 line:92%
No it's not, guys.

00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:20.653
And freaky.
It's terrifying.

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:23.055
Yeah, it's terrifying, but
that's what makes it so cool.

00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:24.690
You have fans all over the
country, so let me tell you,

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:27.292
I was in LA and I had nothing
to do, so I went downtown LA.

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:28.761
They have this thing
called the Death Museum.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:29.962 line:92%
Have you guys heard of this?

00:10:29.995 --> 00:10:31.263
-No.
-No.

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:32.898
It's pretty cool, it's got
all of the serial killer

00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:35.801
stuff in it,
it's got just weird Polaroids

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:38.137 line:92%
of just weird deaths,

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.006
and car accidents from the '60s,
and all this crazy stuff.

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:42.741
You know the guys from
the Heaven's Gate, that cult?

00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:43.942
Yeah.
Mm-hmm

00:10:43.975 --> 00:10:45.310
-Oh, yeah.
-They bought the bunk beds,

00:10:45.343 --> 00:10:48.981
so you can look in at these
dummies in the bunk beds,

00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:50.783
and even that's
kind of creepy.

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.317
That's so Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame a bit.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.552 line:92%
Yeah, that's so weird.

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:55.788
I said it was kind of a hot
topic for adults,

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.056 line:92%
it's this weird ...

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:58.924
And they're all goth people
in there,

00:10:58.957 --> 00:11:00.592
the goth kids of LA
are in there.

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:02.161
I was walking around
this old man,

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:04.663
and I was waiting for one
of the goth kids to go like

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:06.965
"Do you want to take me home
and do that to me." Like "Whoa."

00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:08.300 line:92%
Yeah, you just look and you go

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:09.702
"I'm just looking
at this skin lamp shade."

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:10.936 line:92%
You should have sold individual-

00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:12.204 line:92%
It was all that kind of stuff.

00:11:12.237 --> 00:11:13.405
You should have sold
individual-

00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:14.640 line:92%
Crazy stuff.

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.275
Razor blades outside
for all the sad girls.

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:19.044
"Here you go, you let some of
that pressure out of your thigh,

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:20.279 line:92%
you'll feel better."

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:21.547
Here's-
But the best part-

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.015 line:92%
Here's a Dixie Cup for a drip.

00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:25.617
They go "Hey, can we get a ..."
They have my headshot.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.820
They just downloaded it,
and they go "Can you sign this?"

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:30.556
I go "You gotta put it up on
the wall like 'Dead Careers.'"

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.858
That would be great.
A new wing.

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:35.094
Put me right next
to the Toys "R" Us.

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:36.361 line:92%
Jeffrey.

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:37.663
Is it very graphic,
the stuff they show

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.165
Yeah, it was more
than you thought.

00:11:40.198 --> 00:11:43.135
It's also, they had
a whole tape of an autopsy,

00:11:43.668 --> 00:11:45.404
you got to see
from beginning to end.

00:11:45.437 --> 00:11:46.739
I don't know
who was sitting there.

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:49.475
Then of course
the CG Allen stuff,

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.376 line:92%
all that kind of stuff in there.

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:53.178
They said they have
another one in New Orleans,

00:11:53.211 --> 00:11:55.614 line:92%
which I assume is more spicy.

00:11:55.647 --> 00:11:57.416 line:92%
That's all gator bodies.

00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:59.017
Oh you want to see
how a gator ate a man?

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.252
You walk through
a gigantic gator head.

00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:01.587 line:92%
Yeah.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.789
You gotta walk into the belly
to see all the good shit.

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:05.057 line:92%
It's all reptile deaths.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.361
Yeah, all this is serpentine
related death.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:12.698
Everything in here got killed
or is a lizard.

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.299
I tell you what, I used to say
that I think

00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:15.834
I want to see those things,
but I really don't want to.

00:12:15.867 --> 00:12:17.035 line:92%
No, man.

00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:18.370
It's too much for me.
Oh, I tell you what, though-

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:19.705
Banned From TV, when I was
spending the night

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:21.907
at a friend's house,
he put on the tape Banned

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.542
From TV, and I remember
the girl getting-

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:24.777 line:92%
The bus, or the train.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.011
Hit by the train.
Yeah, that was crazy.

00:12:26.044 --> 00:12:27.246 line:92%
I was like "Fuck."

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.448
And then there was the one
right after that,

00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:31.383
and this actually links
into the story

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.584 line:92%
we wanted to bring up for Dave,

00:12:32.617 --> 00:12:35.554
but in Brazil,
there was a hostage situation

00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:38.624
and the guy took his stuff off,
and tried to act like a hostage,

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.159
and one of the Federales
knew it was him,

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:41.360 line:92%
and right when he comes through,

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:43.495
they just fucking catch him
with a shotgun in the chest.

00:12:43.528 --> 00:12:44.830 line:92%
You see it.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:47.065
Yeah, you watch him slowly go
down on his knees and stuff.

00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:48.901
It's like 
and then he goes down, he's like

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:52.004
It also had a student getting
shot in the chest or something.

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.939
Yeah, and the guy
fucks up the suicide.

00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:55.574 line:92%
Yeah, but there was that one,

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:59.244
it was a Philadelphia
politician years ago

00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:01.180 line:92%
that killed himself on live TV

00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:02.681
That's right, yeah.
But I mean, when you see that-

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:04.349
They have that in the museum.
They do have that.

00:13:04.382 --> 00:13:07.319
Yeah, but the thing is,
I've actually almost gotten,

00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:11.323
almost without even meaning to,
desensitized to so much stuff.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.193
The first beheading I watched,
I think a beheading

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.460
I'd still have
a hard time with,

00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:16.695
but that first one
that came out,

00:13:16.728 --> 00:13:17.930 line:92%
the one that everyone saw.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.431 line:92%
Yeah, that Yahoo put it on.

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:21.433
Daniel, I forget his name,
now I feel terrible.

00:13:21.466 --> 00:13:22.668 line:92%
Not Daniel Pearl?

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:24.036
-Was it?
-Mm-hmm

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:25.470
Yeah, Daniel Pearl
was the journalist.

00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:26.905 line:92%
Yeah. When they fucking ...

00:13:26.938 --> 00:13:29.441
No, this guy was a contractor
or something,

00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:31.543 line:92%
the first one they killed.

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:33.412
The video came out,
and it was like "Do not watch."

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:34.613 line:92%
And I really,

00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:36.381
it was one of the only things
ever when it was over,

00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:38.717
I was like "I wish
I didn't see that."

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.453
But then we watched that video,
I felt like a weirdo,

00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:43.255
we watched the video
of the girl

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:44.656
hanging out the window
of the car

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:45.891
showing her tits,
then a fucking-

00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:47.292 line:92%
Oh, I never saw that.

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:49.561 line:92%
It hits a pole, and I can-

00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:51.263
Is he beheaded?
I mean, yeah, it's gone.

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:52.865
You can't see it in the video,
so it's a little-

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.099
You can't see it,
but you can hear it.

00:13:54.132 --> 00:13:55.567 line:92%
You can see a

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.570
like her body is like limp,
and it ends right there.

00:13:58.603 --> 00:14:01.206
I can watch that now
without grimacing, almost.

00:14:01.239 --> 00:14:02.407
It's very weird.
I don't know-

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.876 line:92%
You just watch

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.477
You get desensitized,
and you don't mean to,

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.879
'cause I'm like
"It's a horrible thing."

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:08.080 line:92%
Yeah.

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:10.682
Yeah, but later
when you go to sleep,

00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:12.584 line:76%
then the images
come into your head,

00:14:12.617 --> 00:14:15.754 line:76%
when you lower your filter,
that's when it will just pop in.

00:14:15.787 --> 00:14:18.891
When I go into hotel rooms,
I, do you ...

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.026
There it is.
When you go to a-

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:22.361 line:92%
Is she dead?

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:23.562
-Yeah.
-Okay.

00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:24.763 line:92%
She's a dead woman.

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:26.431
When you go to sleep
in hotel rooms,

00:14:26.464 --> 00:14:27.699 line:92%
and we're in hotel rooms a lot,

00:14:27.732 --> 00:14:30.769
I think, Dan, you said you're
all lights off, TV off, right?

00:14:30.802 --> 00:14:31.970 line:92%
Yeah, everything's off.

00:14:32.003 --> 00:14:33.706 line:92%
Do you go to bed everything off?

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:36.174 line:92%
It really depends on the room.

00:14:36.207 --> 00:14:38.610
If it's a suite, and I'm not
saying that I rate a suite

00:14:38.643 --> 00:14:40.112 line:92%
but sometimes you play Vegas,

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.114
and they give you
that conference room area,

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.715
that creeps me out
more than when it's ...

00:14:43.748 --> 00:14:45.984
I always go
"I just need a little room."

00:14:46.017 --> 00:14:47.219 line:92%
I don't need that extra,

00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:49.822
where I'm gonna have,
planning Oceans 11.

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:51.857
I don't know
what that is there for,

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.792 line:92%
like I'm having a peace treaty.

00:14:53.825 --> 00:14:55.394
You go "Some of the world
leaders are getting

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:56.628 line:92%
in tomorrow at seven."

00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:58.730
I have a meeting with the legion
of doom or something.

00:14:58.763 --> 00:15:00.666
I went to a hotel with you once
where had you

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:01.967
a weird board room
attached.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.235 line:92%
Yeah.

00:15:03.268 --> 00:15:04.836 line:92%
I remember that, that was odd.

00:15:04.869 --> 00:15:06.805
It's really funny to eat
a Subway sandwich

00:15:06.838 --> 00:15:08.206 line:92%
at this gigantic table.

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:09.441 line:92%
Viking dinner.

00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:10.776 line:92%
The loneliest boy in the world.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:12.077
You go "Look
at all this sandwich

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.345 line:92%
for none of my friends."

00:15:13.378 --> 00:15:14.546
But, yeah, no,
if I had that room,

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:16.114
then I'd have to keep
a light on or two,

00:15:16.147 --> 00:15:17.616
just because I want to know
what's going on.

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:20.619
I always keep a light on.
I keep the TV on with no volume.

00:15:20.652 --> 00:15:21.853 line:92%
Weird.

00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:24.023
I keep a light
on by the front door of it.

00:15:24.956 --> 00:15:28.894
The TV with no volume,
and I watch cartoons,

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:30.796
the Family Guy type cartoons
on my computer.

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:32.197
What would happen
if you turned off all-

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.398 line:92%
All night long?

00:15:33.431 --> 00:15:35.233
You just need that all night
long just to keep you from-

00:15:35.266 --> 00:15:37.602
When I fall asleep, eventually
the computer will just,

00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:39.271
it kind of does that
"Are you still watching this?"

00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:40.772
Acknowledge it, so I don't care
when that happens-

00:15:40.805 --> 00:15:42.007 line:92%
But the TV stays on.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.242
But if I wake up for five,
not even.

00:15:44.275 --> 00:15:45.444
If I just wake up
and open my eyes

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:47.879 line:92%
and I see that screen like

00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:49.614
"Continue watching
or leave it off."

00:15:49.647 --> 00:15:50.916 line:92%
I always hit continue watching,

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.284
and it comes back on,
and I go back to sleep.

00:15:52.317 --> 00:15:53.518
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:54.753 line:92%
Weird.

00:15:54.786 --> 00:15:56.922
Christine had to learn
to sleep with ...

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:58.490
You were a sleep
in the dark person.

00:15:58.523 --> 00:15:59.691 line:92%
She had to learn to sleep-

00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:01.193
Even at home you have
to keep a light on?

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:02.427
Not a light.
TV.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.661 line:92%
TV, though.

00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:05.597
You keep the TV on while you
sleep the entire time at night?

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.865 line:92%
It goes off eventually.

00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:08.266
You know that's really bad
for you.

00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:09.634
-I feel like I'm fine.
-Is it?

00:16:09.667 --> 00:16:11.169
Yeah, they're saying
for your sleep cycle,

00:16:11.202 --> 00:16:13.338
they think it's really bad
to sleep in a room-

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:15.975
Well how else am I gonna watch
Hell Raiser Judgment-

00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:17.843 line:92%
Well that's the thing, yeah.

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:19.244
I can only watch
horror movies late,

00:16:19.277 --> 00:16:21.513
and Christine falls asleep,
and for whatever reason,

00:16:21.546 --> 00:16:23.348
her sleeping presence
is the only thing

00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:25.084
that will save me
from monsters.

00:16:26.017 --> 00:16:27.486
You're very powerful
in your sleep.

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.820
I'm telling you,
it's very weird.

00:16:28.853 --> 00:16:31.923
I would never watch a horror
movie late night on the road.

00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:33.091 line:92%
Never in a million years.

00:16:33.124 --> 00:16:34.659
Yeah, that's tough.
It wakes me up.

00:16:34.692 --> 00:16:37.496
I get that fear, sometimes
I walk a little fast

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:41.066
getting out of the elevator,
a Club Quarters hotel in San

00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:42.968
Fran where you stay,
it has windy hallways.

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.202 line:92%
That's terrifying.

00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:45.437
Something like that
when you get off an-

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.671 line:92%
That's The Shining.

00:16:46.704 --> 00:16:50.042
It's just quiet, and empty,
and you're just walking.

00:16:50.575 --> 00:16:51.977 line:92%
All you hear is your footsteps,

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.279
and your bag swinging,
or whatever, and it's-

00:16:54.312 --> 00:16:55.781
And you're like
"This is haunted, it has to be.

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:56.982 line:92%
Look at this hallway."

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:58.450
It wigs me out.
I get very wigged out.

00:16:58.483 --> 00:17:00.185
Then the ice machine goes,
and you're like "What?"

00:17:00.218 --> 00:17:01.853
But I pissed my pants
and started crying.

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:04.689
You've switched rooms
because it was haunted.

00:17:04.722 --> 00:17:05.991 line:92%
Dude, straight up. Vancouver.

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:07.225
I've been in a haunted room,
too.

00:17:07.258 --> 00:17:08.427 line:92%
Vancouver at Comedy MIX.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.628
Do you move?
Did you ask to move?

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:10.862 line:92%
Oh, absolutely.

00:17:10.895 --> 00:17:12.197 line:92%
I've asked to move

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.865
During the Comedy MIX,
I don't know what it was,

00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:15.967
I was trying to go to bed,
and I was lying there,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.504
and it sounded like a pipe
was dripping, then I walked,

00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:22.107
and then the noise moved,
and it was fucking with me,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.309
and I called downstairs,
I was like "Can I move?

00:17:24.342 --> 00:17:25.710
I'm hearing something,
can I move?"

00:17:25.743 --> 00:17:27.579
They're like "Yeah, sure,
of course."

00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:29.781
Then I moved rooms
and slept great.

00:17:29.814 --> 00:17:31.249
Did they tell you
it was haunted?

00:17:31.282 --> 00:17:34.386
No, I never found that out.
I kind of just ran.

00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:36.188
I don't know, I bet you
there's a lot of people

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.856
who were into that who would
want to stay in the room

00:17:37.889 --> 00:17:39.057 line:92%
'cause it's haunted.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.492
That's really weird to me
when people are like

00:17:40.525 --> 00:17:42.527
"Yeah, no, let's go to
this haunted house and stay.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.364
You pay 600 bucks, some lady got
raped and murdered downstairs."

00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:48.066 line:92%
You're like "I'm good."

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:51.136
That's a weird ... People travel
around to these sites.

00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:52.370 line:92%
Yeah, that's a weird-

00:17:52.403 --> 00:17:54.072
Would you take a great deal
on an apartment

00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:55.674 line:92%
if a junkie died there?

00:17:55.707 --> 00:18:00.045
Nope. I've actually had
apartments where people did die,

00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:01.680
and all that kind of stuff,
and they just-

00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:04.683
Now they have to tell you,
that's part of it,

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:05.917
they have to tell you
the record.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.053
Does it matter to you
if it's someone just died

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:09.387
in their bed of old age
or heart attack?

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.655 line:92%
That's fine, that's fine.

00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:12.023
You're okay with that
but a murder you wouldn't?

00:18:12.056 --> 00:18:13.291 line:92%
Yep. Nope.

00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:15.794
I would rather it be someone
cooler than an old aged person.

00:18:15.827 --> 00:18:17.129
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.464
If they go "This guy died
getting his dick sucked

00:18:19.497 --> 00:18:21.099 line:92%
and doing crack and heroin."

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:22.501
That would be good.
I'd be like "Ooo."

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:23.768 line:92%
That's a bad ass.

00:18:23.801 --> 00:18:25.270
If he's haunting me,
that guy's a party.

00:18:25.303 --> 00:18:27.005 line:92%
Can I sleep in sunglasses?
