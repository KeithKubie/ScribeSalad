00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.210
I wouldn't be much of a teacher if I didn't tell you that life is tough and that everyone's looking out for themselves in this world.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.480
That's just the way it is, people.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.170
You know how I always say that biology is
ultimately about sex and not dying?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.799
Well both of those things are more difficult
than we'd like them to be, because of competition.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.299
There's a finite amount of resources on this
planet, so evolution drives us to compete for them

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.220
so that we can survive long enough to spread
our genes all over the place

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.420
And naturally, competition is a really important part of how different species interact when their habitats overlap.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.260
These interactions between species are what
define ecological communities.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.040
So it makes sense that community ecology studies
these interactions anywhere they take place,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.750
from a tide pool to the whole ocean,
from a rotting log to an entire forest.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.589
But just because inter-species interaction
is mostly competitive doesn't necessarily

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.900
mean that community ecology is all about big, bloody, tooth-and-claw scenes like from cable-TV nature shows.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.089
Actually, a lot of it is, but we're not going
to get there until next week.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.480
For now, let's just note that competition,
while prevalent and important,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.679
is also pretty dangerous, kind of a hassle,
and can, like, really hurt.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.180
So a lot of inter-species interaction is actually
about sidestepping direct competition

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.900
and instead finding ways to divvy up resources,
or otherwise let species just get along.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.620
Can you feel the love?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:26.840
[Theme Music]

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.220
Careful guys! Because right now we're surrounded potentially lethal interspecific competition going on all over the place.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.560
Since we're animals, we usually think of competition
as going on between animals,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.360
but really it happens between almost all members
of the four kingdoms of life.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.399
Whenever species compete, they're going after
the same resources that they need for their

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.719
survival and continued population growth.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.500
In this garden, the weeds are competing with the sunflower, the corn and the dill for nutrients and water in the soil.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.640
So these resources, because they're finite in this area, are the limiting factors that we've talked about.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.270
The population can only get as big as these
factors will allow.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.290
Now, a particularly nasty weed could, over
time, eliminate the veggies entirely.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.780
Such elimination is known as competitive exclusion,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.260
and it's one of the most fundamental properties
in community ecology, and also, like, life.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.920
Because the fact is, when two species are
competing for the same resources,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.970
one of them is eventually going to be more
successful and eliminate the other.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.080
This bitter truth is known as the Competitive
Exclusion Principle,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.340
and it was first identified in 1934 by Russian
ecologist G. F. Gause

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.560
in a study of two closely-related species
of microscopic protists.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.550
When he was only 22 years old, Gause made
a name for himself by conducting experiments

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.370
that pitted one species of protist, Paramecium
aurelia, against another, Paramecium caudatum.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.270
First, Gause grew each species separately
with the exact same resources,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.790
and found that each developed rapidly and
established stable populations.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.240
But, when he grew them in the same container, P. caudatum was soon driven to extinction by P. aurelia.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.460
Paramecium aurelia gained a competitive advantage because its population grew slightly faster than P. caudatum's.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.700
So Gause's experiment showed that, in the
absence of another disturbance,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.750
two species that require the same resources
cannot live indefinitely in the same habitat.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.860
The inferior competitor will be eliminated.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.690
Makes sense, but if competitive exclusion
is the natural law of the land,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.780
then why isn't all of earth just a crazy crap-circus
of constant competition, predation, and ultimately,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.300
extinction of all those losers?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.760
Well, for a couple of reasons:
first, not all resources are limiting.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.880
Two species of sharks may compete for water
in the ocean, but the ocean is, you know, gigantic.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.910
So that's not what limits their population
growth.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.010
Rather, the amount of food, like a specific
fish that they both eat, could be limiting,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.820
while other resources are plentiful.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.260
Second, as the overwhelming diversity of life in almost any community shows us, most species --

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.320
even ones that are almost identical to each
other -- are adaptable enough to find a way

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.260
to survive in the face of competition.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.760
They do this by finding an ecological niche,
the sum of all resources, both biotic and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.680
abiotic, that a species uses in its environment.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.020
You can think of an organism's niche as its job in the community that provides it with a certain lifestyle.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.290
We tend to keep jobs that we can do better
than anyone else in our community,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.020
and if we're desperate, we do a job that nobody
else wants to do.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.480
But no matter what job we have, what it pays
in terms of resources dictates our lifestyle.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.000
So finding a nice, comfy niche that you have
pretty much to yourself not only provides

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.289
a steady income of food and other stuff,

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.789
it also allows a species to avoid competitive
exclusion, and this, in turn, helps create

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.909
a more stable ecological community.

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.940
It's and elegant and peaceful solution, I wish that we humans could figure out something as good,

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.020
but as with anything in life, this relative
security and stability comes at a price.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.770
The bummer is that it prevents some species
from living the lifestyle that they could

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.909
have if nobody else competed with them at
all.

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.610
This ideal situation is called a fundamental
niche, and it's just that, an ideal.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.409
Few, if any species ever get to live that
way.

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.680
Instead, because of the need to avoid competitive
exclusion in order to survive,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.300
many species end up with a different job,
and hence lifestyle.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.300
It's not necessarily the job that they studied
for in college, but it makes a decent living,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.240
and that's called a realized niche.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.469
This, my friends, is how nature does conflict
management.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.939
But it sounds kind of unnatural, doesn't it?

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.540
I mean, Gause taught us that competition, and winning the competition, was the natural order of things.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.480
So how could it be that part of the natural order actually involves letting everyone compete and win just a little bit?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.660
And how did we ever come to discover that
things actually worked this way?

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.560
Well, it took a special kind of person, and to to tell you about him, I'm going to need a special kind of chair.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.499
Canadian born ecologist Robert MacArthur was
in his late 20s when he made a discovery

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.320
that made him one of the most influential
ecologists of the 20th century.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.960
While researching his doctoral thesis at Yale
University in 1958,

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.749
he was studying five species of warblers that live in coniferous forests in the northeastern United States.

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:53.080
At the time, because there were so many different species of warblers that lived, fed, and mated in such close quarters,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.040
many ornithologists thought that the birds
occupied the exact same niche

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.890
and thus were an exception to Gause's competitive
exclusion principle.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.880
But MacArthur was not convinced.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.189
A mathematician by training, he set out to
measure exactly how and where each kind of

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.640
warbler did its foraging, nesting, and mating.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.249
In order to do this, he studied each tree the birds lived in, dividing them into zones, 16 zones to be exact,

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.080
from bare lichen at the base of the trunk, to new needles and buds at the tips of the branches.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.160
After many seasons of observing many birds
in many trees,

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.400
he found that each species of warbler divided its time differently among the various parts of the tree.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.360
One warbler, called the Cape May, for example, spent most of its time toward the outside of the tree at the top.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.979
Meanwhile, the Bay Breasted fed mostly around
the middle interior.

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.779
MacArthur also found that each of the warblers
had different hunting and foraging habits

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:49.059
and even bred at slightly different times of the year, so that their highest food requirements didn't overlap.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.000
These differences illustrated how the warblers
partitioned their limiting resources,

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:58.270
each finding its realized niche that allowed
it to escape the fate of competitive exclusion.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.970
The phenomenon he observed is now known as
resource partitioning,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.639
when similar species settle into separate
niches that let them coexist.

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.550
Thanks in part to this discovery, MacArthur
became known as a pioneer of modern ecology,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.250
encouraging curiosity and hypothesis driven research, championing the use of genetics in ecological study,

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.390
and collaborating with biologists like E.
O. Wilson and Jared Diamond.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.670
Sadly, he died of renal caner at the age of
42,

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.819
but his study of northern warblers remains a classic example of community ecology that is still taught today.

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.819
So, if organisms can do this, if they can
behave in ways that help minimize competition

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.939
while increasing their odds for survival,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.260
it follows that traits associated with this
behavior would start being selected favorably.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:46.180
After all, that's what natural selection is for. When this happens, it's known as character displacement.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.050
To demonstrate, let's go back to some other
famous ecologists,

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.669
our favorite couple of evolutionary biologists
and love birds, Peter and Rosemary Grant.

00:07:54.669 --> 00:08:00.109
I told you before about how they observed the process of speciation among Darwin's famous Galapagos finches.

00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:05.120
Well on the same island, Daphne Major, in 2006, they witnessed character displacement in action.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.340
For a long time, a small population of finches
had the island to themselves,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.319
where they ate a variety of seeds, including
seeds of the feverplant,

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:17.580
which were bigger and more nutritious than
the smaller seeds that were available but

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.770
were harder for the little finches to open.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.809
Then in 1982, a group of much bigger finches
showed up on the island,

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:28.229
and they began to commandeer the island's
abundant supply of feverplant seeds.

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:32.760
Within just 20 years, the Grants found that
the small finches' beaks shrunk to allow them

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.210
to specialize in eating only the smaller,
less nutritious seeds.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.070
But now the little finches had those seeds
all to themselves.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.940
The traits of the two populations had actually diverged to help facilitate the partitioning of resources.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.240
See? Competition can be hard on us, but it
also can make us better people,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.830
or you know, finches or warblers or kangaroo
mice.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.180
But there are also kinds of interspecies interaction in which species actually join forces in the fights for survival.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.400
This is the ultimate in conflict-avoidance.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.790
In these cases species in a community actually
manage to avoid competition altogether

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:07.720
by forming downright tight relationships that
benefit one, if not both, of the parties involved.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.820
You may have heard of both of these cases:
First, mutualism, where both species benefit,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.020
and commensalism, where one species benefits
and the other is kind of like, "Whatever."

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.780
Mutualism abounds in nature, and for those
who've been paying attention to Crash Course,

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.880
you've heard me talk about it many, many times
before.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.060
A prime example [of mutualism] are mychorrhizae, the fungal root that we talked about a few weeks ago,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:32.380
where fungi and plant roots get tangled and essentially rub each other's backs for nutritious favors.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.660
Others you may have heard about include flowering
plants that produce nectars to attract pollinators,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.840
and that bear fruit to attract animals to
help spread the seeds inside.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.400
Oftentimes these relationships become rather
needy, like in the case of termites --

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.290
they can't break down the cellulose in the
wood they eat without the enzymes produced

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.030
by the microorganisms that live inside their
digestive systems.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.570
Without the little critters, the bigger critters
would die.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.580
Such a needy relationship is called obligate
mutualism.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:01.960
By contrast, commensalism is where one species definitely benefits and the other isn't really hurt or helped.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.300
Such neutrality, of course, is difficult to prove because even a seemingly benign interaction probably has some effect.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.640
Barnacles, for example, hitchhike on gray
whales, getting a free ride through swaths

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.810
of plankton-rich water for feeding.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.340
While clearly a benefit to the barnacles,
the relationship is often considered commensal

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.490
because the whales probably don't really care
whether the barnacles are there or not.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.030
Or do they? The barnacles might slow down
the whale as it swims through the water,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.610
but on the other hand, they might also serve as a type of camouflage from predators like orcas,

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.400
in which case they confer an advantage.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.650
So it probably comes down to "meh" for the
whale.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:40.120
And when you consider all the other possibilities out there when species interact, "meh" isn't such a bad option.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.720
Especially considering that next week, we're
going for the throat,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.720
by which I mean we'll be investigating the
kill-or-be-killed world of animal predation

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:54.100
and all of the fantastic evolutionary changes it can trigger that lead to even greater diversity in ecological communities.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.220
There probably is going to be a lot of blood
though, so you might want to bring your poncho.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.440
