00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.680
You know what’s the worst part about being
sick?

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.050
I mean besides the aches and chills and stuffy
nose?

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.050
Taking medicine.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.190
Seriously, a spoonful of sugar doesn’t do
anything.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.840
Why isn’t there a better way to take medicine?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:30.029
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.800
But what if there was a way to deliver drugs
into your body, molecule by molecule.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.770
Well, scientists are working on it.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.160
A new device, created by a team in Sweden
could inject medicine directly into the spine

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.740
using just 1% of the dose typical drug delivery
methods use.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.840
The device works like an ion pump, which sends
out the medicine one molecule at a time.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.890
The research, published in the journal Science,
reduced pain in rats by releasing GABA, a

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.370
pain-reducing chemical the body naturally
produces, directly into the spine.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.789
While the technology is still at least five
to ten years away for use in humans, it has

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.440
the potential to change the way we take medicine.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.250
A lot of our current drug-delivery strategies
have been around since ancient times.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.090
People in ancient cultures soaked herbs in
water making tea, others inhale smoke particles

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.229
from the burning of medicinal plants.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.219
Ancient Persian practitioners sniffed or snuffed
medicine directly into the nose.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.789
The nose is filled with blood vessels, covered
by only a thin membrane, so it’s an easy

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.869
place to get drugs into the bloodstream.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.869
A method we still use today, from decongestants
to vaccines, nasal delivery is quick and easy.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.610
Pills are pretty ancient too.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.529
The first pill poppers date back to Ancient
Egypt, where plants, ground into powders were

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:35.829
mixed with honey, clay, or dough or other
things then rolled into little balls.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.759
Ancient romans made long strings of clay which
they chopped up into little discs, like making

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.249
cookies with a cookie cutter.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.689
Some form of pill making like this existed
for centuries.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.801
Then in the 1800s, pills became coated in
sugar or gelatin.

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:52.389
In 1834 a French drug manufacturer invented
the soft gel pill, where gelatin molds are

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.709
injected with oils or medicine dissolved in
oils.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.249
Then a few years later in 1847, an English
drug manufacturer James Murdock invented the

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.569
two piece capsule, which is filled with powder
or pellets.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.979
You know those 24 hour pills, or time-release
pills?

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.269
They were developed in the late 1940s and
early 1950s, and use the GI tract to release

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.509
a drug over time.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.120
Basically the pills are covered what’s called
an enteric coating, that dissolves only under

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.700
certain acidic conditions..

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.030
And different places in your GI tract have
different acidity levels, so as the pill moves

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.530
through your guts, it releases doses depending
on the different levels.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.530
So it might be able to get through the highly
acidic stomach, but dissolves in the less

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.400
acidic small intestine.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.390
Controlled delivery systems like implants
started to hit the scene in the past few decades.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.510
These devices can deliver doses of medicine
for a really long time, like over the course

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.819
of a few years.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.290
The most popular of these include some forms
of birth control like the IUD or the implant

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.420
that goes in your arm.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.170
The Norplant® system, the one that goes in
your arm, was introduced in the 1980s.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.400
It works because the hormone is wrapped in
silicone capsules.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.219
And it takes awhile for the hormone to slowly
diffuse through the silicone coating, like

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:56.219
three years.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.450
But because the silicone doesn’t biodegrade
in the body, it has to be taken out when it’s

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.450
finished.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.629
And those advances were really within the
last 30 years.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.519
I can’t wait to see the medicine of the
future.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.370
But for now, it seems the best way to get
your medicine, is to take a chill pill.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.379
Do you ever have trouble taking your pills?

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.830
Joe Bereta shows you the best way to swallow
them, in this video.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:25.760
What’s your favorite way to take medicine?
or least favorite, cough syrup.. yuck.
