RICK KLEFFEL: Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.150
joining us here this
afternoon.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.170
My name is Rick Kleffel and I
have a website called The

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.840
Agony Column at agonycolumn.com.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.260
And I have the great privilege
to have with me as my guest

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.470
and yours, Lee Child.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.440
He's the author of 17 Jack
Reacher novels, from "Killing

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.920
Floor," his very first novel--
in first edition hardcover--

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.470
to his latest novel, "A
Wanted Man." Thank you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.720
for joining me, Lee.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.430
LEE CHILD: My pleasure,
although this is very

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.740
intimidating.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.240
Not only am I the best-dressed,
which is

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.065
completely unusual--

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:39.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.320
LEE CHILD: Because I had a very
smart event last night,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.690
and I don't carry a bag.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.230
And so what you see
is what you get.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.080
I'm almost the oldest person
here, and the dumbest person

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.770
here, probably.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.130
So this is all very unusual.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.610
RICK KLEFFEL: Lee, I'd like to
have you read this little

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.480
paragraph here from the very
first book, which I think will

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.130
give our audience a good taste
of how you write and who this

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.860
man is you write about.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.750
LEE CHILD: Yeah, this
was obviously--

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.070
this was probably written in
1995, I would think, this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.880
part, when I was trying
to establish the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.330
character or Reacher.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.630
Told in the first person,
and this is how it goes.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.470
"The coming storm chased me
all the way back east.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.560
I felt I had more than
a storm after me.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.040
I was sick with frustration.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.250
This morning I had been just
one conversation away from

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.410
knowing everything.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.595
Now I knew nothing.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:39.730
The situation had suddenly
turned sour.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.800
I had no backup, no facilities,
no help.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.860
I couldn't rely on
Roscoe or Finley.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.080
I couldn't expect either of them
to agree with my agenda.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.780
And they had troubles of their
own up at the station house.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.120
What had Finley said?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.120
Working under the
enemy's nose?

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.820
And I couldn't expect too
much from Picard.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730
He was already way
out on a limb.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.810
I couldn't count on anybody
but myself.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.590
On the other hand, I had no
laws to worry about, no

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.630
inhibitions, no distractions.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.430
I wouldn't have to think about
Miranda, probable cause,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.180
constitutional rights.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.700
I wouldn't have to think
about reasonable

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.930
doubt or rules of evidence.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.930
No appeal to any higher
authority for these guys.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.310
Was that fair?

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.320
You bet your ass.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.630
They were bad people.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.520
They'd stepped over the
line a long time ago.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.600
Bad people.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.020
What had Finley said?

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.140
As bad as they come."

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.550
And that gives you, in a
nutshell, Lee's main character

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.370
in these novels, Jack Reacher.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.010
And I think that
these novels--

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.480
I was thinking about it today.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.630
These novels and this character
are an absolute

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.310
monument to the appeal and
the power of pragmatism.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.140
Because I think that Jack
Reacher is the ultimate

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.630
pragmatist.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.670
LEE CHILD: Yeah, he is.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.440
Absolutely.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.650
Inasmuch as the character in
the book, he's a total

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.350
pragmatist.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.040
He will do whatever
needs doing,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.820
whichever way it will work.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.340
As a wider issue, I think it
goes beyond pragmatism to a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.930
kind of consolation
for people.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.070
Because what Reacher does,
Reacher is the judge, the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.620
jury, and the executioner.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.150
And people say to me, don't
I worry that I am somehow

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.680
setting a bad example?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.410
That you shouldn't really walk
up to somebody and shoot them

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.880
in the head?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.640
And so am I not suggesting
that this is

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.950
something that is not good?

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.050
And I say no.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.620
Because actually, I worked in
television for a long time and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.880
I've been a writer for
a long time now.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.280
And the thing that you
eventually learn is that even

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.040
the most ordinary people, the
mass audience as a whole, is

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.510
very sophisticated at a kind
of instinctive level.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.320
And they understand completely
that we live in a civilized

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.560
society where we do need to have
rules and laws and rights

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.290
for the accused and
procedures.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.180
We absolutely need to
have those things.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.510
People understand that, and they
do not disagree with it.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.450
But at the same time, it's
intensely frustrating.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.750
So they turn to fiction
for an alternative,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.910
an alternative view.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.440
Where you catch the bad guy in
real life, obviously, yeah,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.840
you arrest him, you read the
Miranda rights, he has a fair

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.210
trial, and so on and so forth.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.770
People understand that's
necessary.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.870
But it's boring, so for fiction,
they want to see the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.380
guy shot in the head.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.730
But the very fact that it's
fiction means that they

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.360
understand that they can't
have it in real life.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.590
They understand these are not
textbooks for how to live.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.810
They are kind of consolations
for how

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.520
frustrating real life is.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.100
RICK KLEFFEL: But I think one of
the appeals of these books

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.560
is the textbook-like manner in
which you immerse us in Jack

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.450
Reacher's thought process.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.470
It is so much fun to read the
prose that you write to be in

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.930
Jack Reacher's head.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.990
And he's like a ticking--

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.310
tick, tick, tick.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.350
He's like an instruction
manual for how

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.550
to get back at people.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.310
LEE CHILD: Oh, he sure is.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.590
I mean, these are basically
revenge stories.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.070
Because I love revenge.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.840
I think that if somebody stepped
out of line, then you

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.580
go get them.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.080
And so I love that kind of
story, and Reacher is really

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.500
good at that.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.070
But Reacher--

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.710
I mean it's real funny being
here at Google, because

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.950
somebody said to me not long
ago, Reacher is a very analog

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.810
guy in a digital age.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.950
And he really is.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.420
He sticks to his old-fashioned
routines, his old-fashioned

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.100
notions, and there's no
gray with Reacher.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.160
It's all black or white.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.920
And as far as that goes, he's a
real throwback, hundreds if

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.080
not thousands of years.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.940
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, I think
that kind of a primitive

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.060
nature to him is, again, a big
part of this appeal, because

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.460
it cuts to our own kind
of reptilian reaction.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.600
And I'd like you to talk a
little bit about just creating

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.960
that prose voice.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.210
Because you did this in the
first person in the first

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.440
book, and then leapt
to the third person

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.830
in the second book.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.870
Talk about just finding
that right voice.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.455
That isn't something that came
to you easily, I'm guessing.

00:06:21.455 --> 00:06:25.760
LEE CHILD: Well, it was a
conscious decision, really.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.860
The prose had to create
the character,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.950
to a certain extent.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.310
And I was imagining a character
who is intelligent,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.225
who is knowledgeable,
and so on.

00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:35.530
But he's very antisocial.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.960
He's very isolated.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.320
And he doesn't talk a lot.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.130
And I've met one or two people
like that, and their manner of

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.140
talking is very fractured,
very fragmented, because

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.190
they're not accustomed to
having conversations.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.670
And so they're somewhat
incoherent, somewhat

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.220
stop-start in the way
they communicate.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.200
So for the purposes of creating
the character, I

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.000
wanted that kind of naive
style, as if this is an

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.040
inarticulate intelligent
person talking to you.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.690
I also wanted, frankly, to be
distinctive commercially,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.700
where I wanted a style that
was identifiably mine.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.550
So I developed that very
terse, stripped down--

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.090
I use a lot of sentence
fragments.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.270
I ignore most of the
rules of grammar.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.130
Just to try and make
it a unique voice.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.850
Because voice is what
storytelling is all about.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.280
And if you go to a MFA or some
kind of university class, and

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.530
people talk about voice, what
they tend to mean is just a

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.060
vague concept about style.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.960
Voice and style become almost
interchangeable.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.400
And it's really not
that at all.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.190
Voice is literally a voice.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.240
Because one of the things that
fascinates me is the history

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.210
of storytelling, which is one
of those things that we

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.770
actually don't know
anything about.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.740
Because as soon as language was
developed amongst humans,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.700
which is several hundred
thousand years ago, as far as

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.350
we can tell, at some point after
that, then storytelling

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.880
was evolved.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.890
And we don't know when that
happened, either.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.180
It's perfectly reasonable to
think it could have been

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.480
100,000, 150,000 years ago
that we started using

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.840
syntactical language abilities
to start talking about things

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.669
that had not happened to people
that don't exist.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.679
In other words, making
up fiction.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.720
But of course, as soon as that
first happened-- there's no

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.560
record of it, there's no audio
recordings, we don't know

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.430
anything about it.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.950
But what we do know is that it
was clearly, for almost its

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:58.850
entire history, up until
possibly about 170 years ago,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.310
storytelling for most people
was mostly oral.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.890
It's really only the middle of
the 19th century where most

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.570
regular people started
to read off the page.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.310
And so almost 99.99% of

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.430
storytelling's history was oral.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.130
And the bestsellers, so-called,
of their day were

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.170
people with a compelling
delivery, with an attractive

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.540
voice and a compelling style.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.520
Would be sitting around telling
a story, and they had

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.090
maybe 30 people listening, and
the next guy along had 10

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.580
people listening, so this guy is
the bestseller of his day.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.920
So storytelling is totally about
voice, and voice is a

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.500
very literal and
specific thing.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.880
It's the voice of the person
telling you the story.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.580
The more attractive it
is, the more into the

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.940
story you will be.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.415
So I felt that developing a
voice was absolutely key.

00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:52.730
And I think you can tell
that subliminally.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.780
The books that you like, the
writers that you like, are

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.520
likely to have some kind of
distinctive delivery to their

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.330
story, rather than just a sort
of bland normality to it.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.210
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, what you say
is so true, because humans

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.400
are a narrative species.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.700
We define ourselves
through stories.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.980
If I ask you, who are
you, you're going

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.780
to tell me a story.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.460
Maybe some fiction
or fact in there.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.800
LEE CHILD: Yeah, I mean,
that's true.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.670
There's a movement, actually,
amongst anthropologists, Homo

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.260
sapiens is what they call it.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.990
They want to call
it Pan narrans--

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.290
in other words, the
storytelling ape.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.290
And it does seem absolutely key
that we do tell stories.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.160
RICK KLEFFEL: Now the stories
in your books are

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.540
driven by this man.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.960
One of the things I think is
very interesting about these

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.410
stories, they're very America.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.180
You obviously are less so.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.430
LEE CHILD: Can you tell?

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.430
RICK KLEFFEL: But you do a great
job of incorporating, I

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:55.530
think, the British contribution
to the mystery

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.380
genre and incorporating it into
your American character.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.720
I know I'm not the first person
to comment on how

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.880
Jack's a walking Sherlock
Holmes.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.730
And everything he does--

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.100
the plots of the books are
affected by the fact that

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.090
everything he looks at,
everything he sees, he starts

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.180
making deductions about.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.520
LEE CHILD: Yeah, I mean, it's
fascinating that people say,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.600
this is a quintessentially
American character.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.300
And that's only true
in passing.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.290
I mean, Reacher is a mythic and
legendary character that

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.550
has been around in fairly
similar form for literally

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.390
thousands of years.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.380
Every culture that we know about
that has a narrative

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.370
tradition has invented this
character over and over again

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.490
over the centuries--

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.510
the mysterious stranger, the
noble loner, the knight

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.450
errant, the person of some kind
of odd nobility who is

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.900
banished from his milieu and
sentenced to wander the land

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.770
to do good, either as an
imperative or just as a

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.840
product of his nature.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.270
That happens in Japan, the ronin
stories where a samurai

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.420
is disowned by his master and
then just wanders as an

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.070
independent.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.250
It happened all through the
Middle Ages in Europe, the

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.080
knight errant.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.890
Various key components, the
idea of fallen nobility.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.680
And Reacher was a West Point
graduate and a major in the US

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.040
Army, and that was supposed to
give that hint of some status

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.790
from which he's fallen.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:39.040
And so he is American, only in
the sense that that character

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.110
has to have an empty, dangerous
frontier feel in

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.460
which to operate.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.550
Which was fine in Europe
700 , 800 years ago.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.230
Europe was an empty, dangerous
continent with a frontier.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.540
But of course, over the
centuries, Europe became no

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.130
longer that.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.740
So that character was
essentially forced to migrate

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.710
to somewhere where there still
was emptiness and a frontier.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.090
And suddenly, those myths
started to show up in

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:09.100
Australia and the US,
especially in

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.210
19th-century Westerns.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:15.665
That character, the classic
character from the Westerns,

00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:19.190
you see him all the time
in Zane Grey's stories.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.810
The rider that comes in off
the range at exactly the

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.420
crucial time.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.070
In exchange for a woman-cooked
meal, he unsheathes his rifle,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.090
takes care of the problem, and
rides off into the sunset.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.170
Now, that character seems
so American, but

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.910
it's actually not.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.820
It was a direct import
from medieval Europe.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.030
And it wasn't invented in
medieval Europe, either.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.350
Is was there a direct import
from Scandinavian sagas and

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:48.140
legends and even older
Anglo-Saxon legends.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.140
Clearly, there's a need amongst
the audience to have

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.420
that character, quite clearly
because we would like to have

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.140
that character.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.920
If we're in deep shit, then it's
great if we could imagine

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.290
that somebody will show up in
the nick of time and solve our

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.420
problem for us.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.130
So we've invented that
character repeatedly.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.380
And all I did was to give it
a kind of reality-based

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.430
plausibility in the
21st century.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.480
RICK KLEFFEL: Now one of the
things that I think does make

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.980
your work really convincing is
you have a great vision of

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.180
America, in that you look at
the places that most people

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.400
don't look at.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.950
And I'm wondering, you know--

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.400
the suburbs, the kind of empty
parts of the bad cities, the

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.760
sin city in the latest book,
the unky part of the cities

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.190
where people don't go.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.920
And I'm wondering, when you
create these places, do you

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.760
create them with an idea of, I'm
going to have to stage a

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.370
scene here?

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.230
Are you like an architect
and a city planner

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.510
as well as a writer?

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.600
LEE CHILD: Yeah, kind of.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.830
Although a lot of that is just
fascination generally.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.710
Being an outsider, I see
everything with a fresh eye.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.905
And that is so valuable,
I think.

00:15:03.905 --> 00:15:07.520
I gloss over nothing, because
I've never seen it before.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.200
Any place I go to, I'm seeing
for the first time, probably,

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.610
and it makes an impression.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.010
And I see the parts that other
people no longer see.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.710
And I think that really
comes through.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.730
I think that's very important.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.710
But yeah, I love the
whole thing.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.730
I love every scuzzy little
thing, every big thing.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.180
I was in Vegas one time,
and we were in

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.420
this terrible hotel--

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.000
actually, I liked the hotel, but
everybody else thought it

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.990
was terrible.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:39.500
But across the street was this
bar that was nothing but a

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.570
sort of rectangle made out of
cinder blocks, painted dirty

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.190
white, probably painted
white 18 years ago,

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.290
and it was all filthy.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.670
No windows or anything
like that.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.190
It had a door-- it had no
sign at all, but it had,

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:58.170
hand-painted with a fat
paintbrush on the wall was its

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.120
advertisement.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.460
Four words--

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.590
"Cold Beer,

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.820
Dirty Girls." [LAUGHTER]

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.320
LEE CHILD: What a place!

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.034
That's the sort of place
that I love.

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.600
RICK KLEFFEL: Now I'd like you
to talk a little bit about

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.500
plotting these books.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.790
How much of this--

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.520
each of these books, what's so
much fun is that we know

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.870
pretty much what to expect
going into every book.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.710
Yet you manage to, for 17 books,
write books that each

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.740
book feels fresh.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.370
They're fun, they're enjoyable,
there's a really

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.090
powerful vision of America and
a gut connection for the

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.670
reader there.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.080
It seems like, as a writer, you
must have a kind of Jack

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:50.650
Reacher nature, just to adapt
to what you have to do.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.100
LEE CHILD: Well, they're fresh
because I took one key

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.610
decision at the very beginning,
which was really

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.950
because I did not want to jump
into the same river that

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:00.930
everybody else was in.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.900
I saw no point in going
head-to-head with established

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.109
people, in terms of the
shape of their series.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.790
And everybody else who writes
a series, I think literally

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.450
everybody else at that time
anyway, was writing a series

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.619
that was, broadly speaking,
a soap opera--

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:21.970
either location-based or
employment-based or both.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.260
And typically, you would have a
cop in LA or you would have

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.460
a private eye in Boston, or
you would have a police

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.270
lieutenant in Chicago, and
that was the series.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.150
And it seemed to me that they
were being done so well, why

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.720
compete with that
head-to-head?

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.523
Plus, it also seemed to me the
one smart thing I ever did,

00:17:41.523 --> 00:17:45.610
the one inspired piece of
thinking that I ever did, is

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:46.630
I'd looked ahead.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:52.380
And you can't ever say, yeah,
I'm going to write a book, and

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.420
18 years later, I'm still
going to be doing it.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.900
Because that's ridiculous.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.320
That's very unlikely
to happen.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.090
But you have to take into
account, maybe you will.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.010
Maybe it might work, and maybe
you will get 15 or

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.460
20 years into it.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.830
How are you going
to feel then?

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.740
And I felt that if I had
done something that was

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.140
specifically based somewhere,
in something, it would've

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.790
gotten very boring after,
say, 10 books.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:19.870
So if he had been a cop in New
York, that would have limited

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.510
me to cop stuff in one
particular city.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.350
And I foresaw a problem with
that, so I decided he would

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.860
have no job and no location, so
that he could be anywhere

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.620
and do anything.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.840
And that's what keeps
it fresh for me.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.150
And that also then liberates
me to do the method that I

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.140
use, which is not to
plot anything.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.630
I don't plot, I don't outline,
I don't think about it.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.960
I just start him out somewhere
and see what happens.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.250
RICK KLEFFEL: Really?

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:47.800
LEE CHILD: Yeah.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.130
I have literally no concept of
what the story is going to be

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.550
about or what the thing
is going to be or how

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.190
it's going to end.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.420
People say, what, you don't know
how it's going to end?

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.670
I don't know what's going to
happen in the next line.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.160
And I don't want to know.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.640
Because for me, the story
is the magic.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.440
And if I outlined it, which
lots of writers do--

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.410
you know, they make an outline
of varying degrees of detail.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.870
If I did that, then I would have
told myself the story.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.450
I would know how it came out.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.470
And I would be bored with it,
and I would want to go on to

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.220
the next story.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.500
If I then had to sit down and
type out 500 pages worth of

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.250
that story, I would
be bored, because

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.950
I know how it finishes.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.050
It would be like
doing it twice.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.150
I only want to do it once.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.540
So I start at the beginning with
some kind of good idea

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.150
for the beginning, and then
I see what happens.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.300
And what happens is
like real life.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.890
We don't know.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.870
We have no idea what's
going to happen.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.350
You don't know what's going to
happen in one hour from now.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.280
And that's how I write.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.700
Page by page, it's
all new to me.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.800
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, one of the
things I think you do very

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.970
well, too, is in the characters
who appear, the

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.140
one-book characters, you do
a great job of giving us

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:07.480
characters who have different
levels of their faults.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.120
They're incomplete.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.140
In the latest book, we have
Sheriff Goodman and we have a

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.640
couple of agents, and they
all have problems.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.840
They say, oh man, I
made a mistake.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.760
These are kind of flawed
characters.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.870
And I'd like you to talk about
just crafting a novel where

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:29.640
the flaws of your characters
help create the plot.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.670
LEE CHILD: Well, we're very,
very weird, writers, because

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.440
I'm not making up a
character at all.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.540
I'm meeting people.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.640
These are real to me.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.600
And that's the admission
that you have to make.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.730
You're sitting there at the
computer, dealing with people

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.600
that are real.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.450
To me, anyway, the
events are real.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.600
And often, my editor will say to
me something like, wouldn't

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.970
it be better if this happened
after that?

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.530
And I say, well, yeah,
it probably would be

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.855
better, but it didn't.

00:20:59.855 --> 00:21:01.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.190
LEE CHILD: Because it's
really happening.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.530
For the six months I'm writing
the book, this is real.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.580
And so these characters are
just real people to me.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.840
I sort of dream them up, but
then there they are.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.020
And I describe them, I let them
do whatever it is they're

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.230
doing, and yeah, they're
regular people.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.460
They're good at some things,
not good at other things.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.300
And the flawed stuff-- you know,
I try and stay away from

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.790
"flawed," in terms
of, you know, how

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.660
literary theory goes.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.120
You've got to have these
flawed characters.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.520
I don't like flawed
characters.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.370
I don't like miserable
people with defects.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.000
So as far as possible, I make
the characters good at their

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.290
jobs, decent people.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.740
But they do, they make errors,
they make mistakes, they have

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.600
blind spots.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.550
And that then creates
opportunities

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.630
for the story, yeah.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.320
RICK KLEFFEL: One of the things
you've done very well,

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:59.870
too, is move through all sorts
of different kind of genres, I

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.050
think, within your books.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.900
The first book has, I think, a
distinct element of the horror

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.540
genre in it.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.380
It's the small town
with a secret.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.750
And you've had other
books where they're

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.460
more a military slant.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.980
Some are more a mystery slant.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.390
And I'm wondering, is that
something you just

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.450
discover as you write?

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.920
Or do you think, maybe it's time
to do this kind of novel.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.130
LEE CHILD: No, I'm fairly
impatient about genre.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.820
I think that this endless
passing of genre--

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.370
is this suspense or is it
romantic suspense or is it

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.500
horror or is it this or that--

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.000
I pay no attention
to that at all.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Because for me as a reader--

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.380
and everything I do is based
on how I feel as a reader.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.200
For me as a reader, there are
only two kinds of books.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.460
There's the kind that will make
you miss your stop on the

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.100
subway and the kind
that don't.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.080
It's that simple.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.070
And the kind that make you
miss your stop can be

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.850
nonfiction, could be history,
could be politics, sociology.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.420
If it's an engaging argument
well told, then

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.690
you're in that book.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.460
So I have no patience at all
for, oh, I better do something

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.050
that's slightly more horror
or slightly more mystery.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.550
Like I say, just start
at the beginning and

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.560
see what comes out.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.060
And the image that I use to
explain it is, you're like a

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.310
movie stunt man.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.920
You've got to fall off
that high building.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.930
And out of sight of the camera
in the street, there's a fire

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.615
department airbag that you're
going to land on, or hopefully

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:30.350
you're going to land on it.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.310
And it's a large airbag.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.400
And in one corner it's marked
"thriller," in one corner it's

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.630
marked "mystery," in one corner
it's marked "suspense,"

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.120
in one corner it's marked "crime
fiction." You're going

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.560
to land on that bag, but you
don't know exactly where.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.580
You might be nearer one corner
than the other, but you only

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.160
know that retrospectively.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.900
I don't set out thinking,
OK, I'm going to write a

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.850
sociologically gripping
crime fiction book.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.150
I just write a book.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.350
And somebody else reads it
and says, oh, this is a

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.300
sociologically gripping
crime fiction book.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.080
And I say, OK, fine, whatever.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.900
RICK KLEFFEL: As a keen observer
of American society

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.210
and mores, I think one of things
you do is really give

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.240
us a raw feeling for the way we
look and the way we live.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.950
And I think that's really part
and parcel, that's probably

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.850
why your books are described as

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:24.580
quintessential American books.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.360
LEE CHILD: Yeah, probably.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.180
It probably takes a foreigner to
observe this stuff in that

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.400
kind of detail or with that
kind of perspective.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.140
I don't know.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:38.460
But you mentioned Sherlock
Holmes earlier on, and that's

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.940
indicative of the relationship
that a writer has with the

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.990
apparent effect.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.770
Because Sherlock Holmes,
I love Sherlock Holmes.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.870
But from a writer's perspective,
it's just the

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.190
most outrageous con
trick of all time.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.555
Because you've got Sherlock
Holmes, who's whatever he's

00:24:57.555 --> 00:25:01.440
doing, smoking his pipe, he's
looking out the window of

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.890
Baker Street, and he sees this
guy walking towards his door.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:09.610
And he says to Watson, ah,
Watson, clearly this is a

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.480
baker from Shoreditch whose been
out of work for exactly

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.580
nine months.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.310
And sure enough, the guy shows
up in the living room, and he

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.780
says he's a baker from
Shoreditch whose been out of

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.380
work for nine months,
and Sherlock Holmes

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.660
looks like a genius.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.130
Except it's Conan Doyle who's
writing both ends of that

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:26.800
transaction.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.940
Of course he's right.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.950
In reality, the guy would come
up and say, no, I'm not.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.190
I'm a bricklayer from
Islington, or

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.130
something like that.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:45.800
So with all of this so-called
perception, it looks great,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.420
because I'm defining both
ends of the deal.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.810
So it's largely an illusion,
more than anything else.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:57.375
RICK KLEFFEL: Oh, that's, I
think, the real key to being

00:25:57.375 --> 00:26:00.700
an effective writer of anything
is the release of

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.000
information.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.880
And one of the things that you
do very well, especially in

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.640
the latest book, is we see this
set of events and we know

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.980
this, and we see that set of
events and we know that, and

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.760
we know everything
that's going on.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.200
And as readers, part of the
fun for us is to see the

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.690
characters catch up with us.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.980
LEE CHILD: Yeah, there's
two ways of doing it.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.960
You either state the
circumstances and let the

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.840
reader be more powerful than the
characters, or vice versa.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.470
You have a kind a confusing
mystery and the characters

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.850
lead the reader through it.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.750
Both ways work really well.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:44.420
Because there's really only one
technique that works in a

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.920
book of this type, in my
opinion, a suspense book.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.780
I mean, suspense is a strange
word to use for a book,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.640
because all books have
suspense in them.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.300
Otherwise, why would anybody
ever finish one?

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.740
There's got to be some reason
why you keep going to the end.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.370
But I suppose what we call
suspense fiction emphasizes

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.300
the suspense.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.190
And you get into
all kinds of--

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:08.880
there are dozens of classes
and dozens of courses, and

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.820
they all have--

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.890
one of their modules
is entitled, how

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.540
do you create suspense?

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.510
And my feeling about that is
that the very form of that

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.690
question immediately leads
you down the wrong path.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.440
Because the form of the
question, how do you create

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.780
suspense, is a kind of active
question, similar to how do

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.520
you bake a cake?

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.700
And we all know how to bake
a cake, or at least,

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.760
theoretically we do.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.350
Not that I've ever baked one,
but I've seen it done.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.500
And what you do with baking
a cake is you have some

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.310
ingredients and you have the
clear implication that the

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.360
higher quality the ingredients,
the better the

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.550
cake is going to be.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.590
You've know you've got to mix
these ingredients together,

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.330
again with the clear implication
that the more

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.940
thoroughly and conscientiously
you mix them together, the

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.460
better the cake will be.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.400
You then put it in the oven,
with the implication that the

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.300
more exact the temperature
and timing, the better

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.140
the cake will be.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.700
So you immediately start
to think of that

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.420
as a process question.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.260
And it's the wrong question
for suspense.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.800
The real question is not
how do you bake a cake?

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.650
It is, how do you make
your family hungry?

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.900
And the way you make your family
hungry is you make them

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.550
wait four hours for dinner.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.820
And that's what you
do with a book.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.440
You imply a question, and then
you do not answer it until the

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.870
end of the book.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.720
And you do that, as you go
along, in miniature.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.730
You imply a question and you
don't answer it until the end

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.800
of the chapter or the end
of the paragraph.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.840
Or even your sentence
construction, you flip it

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.580
around so that the first half of
the sentence is answered by

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.920
the second half of
the sentence.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.570
And that creates this
unstoppable momentum.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.190
Because if there's one thing
that humans are hard-wired to

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.480
do, it is to wait around for
the answer to a question.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.360
We learned that in television
a long time ago.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.020
I worked in television from
the end of the '70s to the

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.950
middle of the '90s, and a huge
revolution went on in

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.240
the way we did it.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.720
There was something that
nobody had in 1980 that

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.000
everybody had in 1990 that
absolutely revolutionized the

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.310
way that we worked.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.240
And you notice I haven't
said what it was.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.320
You're now thinking, well, what
did nobody have in 1980?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.110
Because I've implied a
question, and I'm not

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.820
answering it.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.320
And you want to know, right?

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.970
What nobody had in 1980 and they
did have in 1990 was a

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.950
remote control.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:38.090
So in the old days, your
sequencing of programming, you

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.130
could get away with a lot.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.140
Because if somebody wanted to
change the channel, they'd

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.170
have to get their ass off the
sofa and go and do it.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.270
And you could rely on the fact
that they probably wouldn't.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.640
By 1990, it was dead easy
to change channels.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.210
They would be flipping around
to see if anything stopped.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.220
The end of a part, a commercial,
anything, they

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.530
would be changing channels
like mad.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.700
And we had to work out a
way of defeating that.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.480
And we started out, we invented
a process that still

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.380
exists in sports now.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.820
Its last remnant is visible in
sports, particularly baseball,

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.420
where during the fourth inning,
typically in the

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.570
fourth inning of baseball,
people have got some idea of

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.340
the way the game is going.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.300
Their initial impulse to watch
baseball is fading away.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.010
So at the end of the top
of the fourth, you

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.270
ask a trivia question.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.390
Like, who was the pitcher who
gave up Lou Gehrig's first

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.960
grand slam?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.460
And then you do the commercials,
and then you

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.290
answer the trivia question at
the beginning of the bottom of

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.520
the fourth.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:42.730
And even if you know who gave
up Lou Gehrig's first grand

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.490
slam, even if you don't care,
even if you've never heard of

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.050
Lou Gehrig, even if you don't
know what a grand slam is,

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.290
there is something that makes
you want to stick around for

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.390
that answer.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:55.300
And that's very powerful
with humans.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.120
And that's the way to
create suspense.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.180
You ask a question, and then
you refuse to answer it for

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.600
hundreds of pages.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.890
And people will stick
around for it.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:11.340
And the key text in that area
is a book by John Grisham.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.730
You know, John Grisham's a very
popular author, often

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.160
overlooked in terms
of quality.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.270
But he's a very smart guy,
Grisham, I think, and

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.260
underestimated in terms of
how experimental he is.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.130
And he did this one book called
"The Runaway Jury." And

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.870
none of the classic elements
are present in "The Runaway

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.760
Jury." People tell you you've
got to have sympathetic

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.240
characters that you care about,
so you follow them

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.120
through their perils, and
all that kind of stuff.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.490
"Runaway Jury" has got no
sympathetic characters.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.810
It has bad guys and
worse guys.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.540
It has nothing in it whatsoever,
except what is the

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.990
verdict going to be
in this trial?

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.960
And that's the only question.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.530
And you read that book like a
locomotive, because you need

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.830
the answer.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.840
RICK KLEFFEL: Now, what
shows did you work on?

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.190
LEE CHILD: When I was
in television?

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.360
I worked for Granada Television
in Manchester,

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.730
England, which was at that
time a tremendous drama

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.480
producer, also documentary
producer.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.390
But drama-wise, you saw it all
over "Masterpiece Theatre." We

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.100
did "Brideshead Revisited,"
"Jewel in the Crown," "Prime

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:19.085
Suspect," "Cracker," all those
great British shows.

00:32:19.085 --> 00:32:21.820
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, that
explains that.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.010
Now one of things that I think
makes these books really fun

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.420
to read, too, is you have
a very absolutely

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.180
deadpan sense of humor.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.670
I mean, it's just smashed to the
ground and so flat we can

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.760
barely see it, but it's
really there.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.890
And your books, they're
hilarious.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:41.790
LEE CHILD: I think so, yeah.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.890
I mean, a lot of people
wouldn't--

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.040
you know, humor is not the first
thing people think about

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.010
when they think about a Reacher
book, but I think he's

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.700
very funny.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.020
But yeah, very subliminal
stealth humor, very sardonic.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:58.150
And I like those parts a lot.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:01.210
I liked writing them, yeah.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.880
RICK KLEFFEL: As you've been
creating the character, one of

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.900
things that's nice about him is
that even though he lives

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.480
entirely outside of society,
and he's I guess what you'd

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.930
call off the grid, he has none
of the kind of unsavory taint

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:20.420
of a survivalist or somebody who
claims to be off the grid.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.270
And that's a delicate
balancing act,

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.475
I think, for you.

00:33:23.475 --> 00:33:25.975
LEE CHILD: Yeah, I mean, off
the grid does imply that

00:33:25.975 --> 00:33:30.695
you're some kind of weirdo or
you are planning secession,

00:33:30.695 --> 00:33:32.470
you know, you want
to make Montana a

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.690
separate country or something.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.430
And he's not that kind of
off the grid person.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.090
He just doesn't want
to live anywhere.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.340
He doesn't want the hassle
of owning a house or

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.410
dealing with anything.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:45.020
So he takes advantage of the
available infrastructure,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.470
which is fantastic in America.

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:51.820
You have a constant parade of
diners and motels and little

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.430
stores and diners and motels.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.180
Why would anybody do
it any different,

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.670
is Reacher's opinion.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.920
For $20 a night, you can
find a place to stay.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.430
You can buy a new outfit
for $25, $30.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:05.800
You can eat in a diner
for $4 or $5.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.780
Why would he want a house?

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.270
He has this rigorously
logical approach.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.270
What would a house bring
him that he wants?

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.560
And the answer is nothing.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.350
So it's not so much that
he's off the grid.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.080
He is just a wanderer.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.540
RICK KLEFFEL: Yeah, that's true,
because it's not like

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.480
he's opposed to government
or the rules of society.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.510
LEE CHILD: No, he was
respectful of the

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.870
hierarchy in the Army.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.250
He's got no problem with
hierarchy in general or

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.489
government or anything
like that.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:38.380
It's purely utilitarian
for him.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.860
Why doesn't he carry
a cell phone?

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.860
Well, who would ever call him?

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.159
There's no point in it.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.944
So he won't do anything that
there's no point in.

00:34:45.944 --> 00:34:50.230
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, of course if
you told everybody here 20

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:55.429
years ago the government's going
to strap a radio control

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.090
device so we can locate
you at any moment?

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.520
And I think that's in
this book, too.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.320
LEE CHILD: Yeah, I think that
is fantastic, actually.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.150
You know, think back
20, 25 years.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:08.010
If a bill had gone to Congress
saying that every American

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.410
must wear a wireless transponder
so they can be

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.650
tracked everywhere all the time,
there would have been

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.460
total outrage.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.110
But of course we've done it to
ourselves voluntarily, which

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.120
is very strange.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.780
RICK KLEFFEL: Along
with ubiquitous

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.270
surveillance, too, since--

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.910
LEE CHILD: Yeah, but
not as bad as it is

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.210
in London, for instance.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.170
I mean, that really is a
surveillance society.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:35.660
One quarter of the entire
planet's CCTV

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.650
cameras are in London.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:43.970
And any person, anyone of you
goes to London for some

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.150
reason, you are on some camera
all day and all night.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.770
It's really bizarre.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.470
RICK KLEFFEL: Now,
do we have any

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.720
questions from the audience?

00:35:54.336 --> 00:35:54.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.950
So this is not quite about your
writing style, but more

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.140
about sort of your opinion.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:03.250
So as you know, there's a movie
coming out, and I was

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.350
curious to know your thoughts
of the casting.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.290
I bring this up because,
obviously, Jack Reacher is

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:13.070
6'5" and he's fair-haired
and blond-eyed.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.960
And then in the movie,
he's not quite

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.830
depicted the same way.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.370
He's a lot shorter, and
darker-haired, et cetera.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.870
So I also saw his face on one of
your books at the airport,

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.830
and so I was like, oh my god,
that's like totally not

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:24.840
representative.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.090
So I was just kind of curious
of your thoughts on that.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.300
Like did you have any say?

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.590
Or was it just kind
of like, surprise!

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:34.900
LEE CHILD: No, not
contractually, not legally,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.060
because typically, a movie
contract is very, very

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.350
restrictive.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:43.300
And a movie contract is a
hilarious thing, legally.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.740
It's, generally speaking,
longer than the book.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.480
And it has all kinds
of bizarre clauses.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.350
By the time you reach page 400,
you realize what it is

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.510
you're actually selling.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.750
And What you're selling is
a license for a dramatic

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.380
production to be shown anywhere

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.340
in the known universe.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.680
And then there's a rider saying,
"or parts not yet

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.040
discovered."

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.980
It's an immense, it's
a huge, binding

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.020
thing, a movie contract.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.950
Really, if an author asks for
approval or veto or anything

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:17.520
like that, that's the same thing
as just not selling it.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.640
Because they won't do it.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.990
Because it needs to be done--

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.310
it can't be done by committee.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:22.560
This is their project.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.520
But having said all of that,
the people that made this

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:33.890
movie are out and out
crazed Reacher fans.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:37.390
They totally are.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:41.410
They know as much as he
does about the books.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.520
They have read the books
obsessively.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.550
They love the character.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.800
So they were very,
very nice to me.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.430
They included me at every step
of the way, I bet more than

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.240
any author has ever
been included.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.830
And of course, there were
two key points.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.600
People say, did I have a say?

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.540
And I say, yes I did.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.890
I had 100% total control.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.750
Because it was my choice whether
to sell it or not.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.900
If I sold it to the movies,
that's one decision.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.480
If I didn't, that's
another decision.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.640
So there is 100% control.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.240
And then what happened, the
movie took a long time to get

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.940
off the ground.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.380
Because it's complicated
making movies.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.140
Everybody's got to say
yes on the same day.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.580
And then the odds against that
happening are like winning the

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.490
Power Ball.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:28.020
So it takes years and
years and years.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.440
And of course during those years
and years and years, the

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.780
books were doing very well.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.940
The books were growing bigger
and bigger and bigger as a

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.280
book franchise.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.780
So by the time the movie
actually went into production,

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:42.790
the books were important enough
in the world that they

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.720
had to approach it very
respectfully.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.060
Not that they wouldn't have
wanted to, because like I

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.550
said, they were big
fans of the books.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.710
But it did mean I was
included more.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.110
Not so much because they needed
my input on anything,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.070
because they were completely
sure about how to do it.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.270
It wasn't that they
wanted my input.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.600
They just wanted to kind
of celebrate with me.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.710
Look, we're doing this.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.100
This is happening,
it's working,

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.730
it's going to be here.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.180
So I was very involved.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:13.170
And again, there was a point
where the financer was there,

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.200
the whole thing was rolling,
it was just about the cast,

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.760
who was going to be cast.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.000
And we went to dinner, and they
said, we want Tom Cruise

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.665
to play Reacher.

00:39:22.665 --> 00:39:26.080
And I know for a fact that if
I had freaked out at that

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.420
point, they would have abandoned
it, I'm certain.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.370
But I didn't freak out.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:34.100
Because in a wider sense--

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.300
and this is something, again,
that fascinates me, that a

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.290
book exists entirely in
the imaginative realm.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.760
And I honestly believe that a
book is a two-way transaction,

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.590
that my imagination,
specifically, and your

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:51.500
imagination, specifically,
together create the book.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.930
I've put something into it.

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.370
The act of reading, you've
put something into it.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.450
Then the book exists.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:01.100
And it can be incredibly vivid
and incredibly detailed and

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.380
hyper-real.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.390
But it's in the imaginative
realm.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.600
There is no reality to it.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.020
Then if you want to make a movie
out of it, even though

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.890
the movie is, again, fiction and
it's a story and it's full

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.910
of magic and tricks and all
that kind of stuff,

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:20.650
fundamentally a movie exists
in the physical world.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.500
It's no longer purely
imaginative.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.700
It's in the physical world,
because you've got to have

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.130
real people and they're
acting in real spaces.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.340
And so you jump from the
imaginative to the physical.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.740
And as soon as you do that, the
physical reality starts to

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.080
define things.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.680
In terms of the casting, for
instance, the physical reality

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.940
is that the actor
has to exist.

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.830
It's that simple.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:51.330
You've got to choose one of the
pool of existing actors.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:56.580
And so yeah, Reacher is 6'5" in
the books, and he's ugly,

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:01.030
and he's got scars, and he's
generally speaking a little

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:05.100
bit sort of beat-up-looking
and huge and so on.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.020
So you think, fine.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.790
So you go to Hollywood,
and you start to

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.200
look for that actor.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.720
You're not going to find that
actor, because that

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.510
actor does not exist.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:16.230
There's something about the
technology of film, and

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.420
cameras in general--

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.325
and again, I learned this years
ago on television--

00:41:20.325 --> 00:41:24.560
there is something odd about
the lens that will not

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.010
accommodate big people.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.520
Which is really why there
are no big actors.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.410
There are literally no big
actors, none at all.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:35.470
And so if you're going to make
a movie, you've got to deal

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.380
with the existing pool of real
physical actors, and you've

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.820
got to pick one.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.070
And therefore, it becomes
immediately apparent that

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.820
there's no way we're going to
get an exact physical match

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.140
for Reacher, because that
actor does not exist.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.190
And you can say, well, yeah,
but what about this guy?

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.010
What about that guy?

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.170
What about this other guy?

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.495
And that conversation has
been going on for

00:41:55.495 --> 00:41:57.220
a year and a half.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.130
What about this guy?

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.240
Well, that guy's dead.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.340
LEE CHILD: What about
this guy?

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.030
Well, that guy's
103 years old.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.910
And so it goes back and forth,
and you end up with a kind of

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:12.060
short list of potential
suggestions, all of whom are

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.080
not very big.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.780
Because as I said, there
are no big actors.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.620
You're talking about this guy
who's two inches bigger than

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.880
this other guy, and they're both
eight inches shorter than

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.890
Reacher, so why worry
about it?

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:27.670
So what I wanted to do,
ultimately, in that

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.600
split-second that I had to
think about it in that

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.220
restaurant when they told me
that they want to cast Tom

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.290
Cruise, is it was clear that we
were never going to get the

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:39.940
outside of Reacher, because that
is just not available.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.300
So what I wanted to do was to
get the inside of Reacher, as

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.250
close as possible.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.770
And again, I know actors.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.370
I've worked with them
all my life.

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:55.270
When I was 22 years old, almost
23 to be fair, I worked

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.420
with four actors--

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.250
Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud,
Alec Guinness, and

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.860
Ralph Richardson, who were
pretty heavyweight actors.

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.800
And so I'm familiar
with actors.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.760
I know what they can do.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.460
You can sort of look at their
past body of work and you can

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.040
figure out what are
they capable of.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.870
And I felt that Cruise was
absolutely 100% capable of

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.200
doing the inside of Reacher, the
stillness, the quiet, the

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.410
menace, the intensity--

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.160
he could do that.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.090
And therefore, I was really
happy about it.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:28.700
Really happy about it.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.930
And I've seen the movie twice,
and he absolutely nails it.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.550
So it's this very
strange thing.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.430
It's like looping the loop
in a small airplane.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.550
You have to go away from
the book in order to

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:42.030
come back to it.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.540
And you know, the casting has
caused a lot of consternation.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.670
And I'm deeply grateful about
that, frankly, because the

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.970
idea that I've created this
character that people actually

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.560
care who plays him in the movies
is a wonderful thing.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.200
That's the biggest possible
compliment.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.720
I'm thrilled by it.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.260
But we are in this awkward
situation at the moment where

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.630
the movie comes out
December 21st.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.130
And I sincerely hope you go see
it, because if you do see

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.820
it, you're going to think,
you know what?

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:16.010
That was pretty good,
because he nails it.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.040
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, one of the
things that struck me when you

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.590
were talking was how vivid
your books are as reading

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.410
experiences.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:27.360
And I think that's one of the
things that makes them so

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.240
powerful to us.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.600
And I think this kind of work
stands right next to any

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.280
kitchen-window epiphany piece
of literature, I think, in

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:43.350
terms of connecting to our
narrative reading instincts.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:48.260
So I'd like you to talk a little
bit about connecting

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:52.820
with readers on that level of
language, that kind of reptile

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.330
level of experience.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:45:00.420
LEE CHILD: Yeah, well, I think
that part of the answer to

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.360
that is what I said earlier, at
the beginning of the movie

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.750
answer, which is that it
is a two-way street.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.210
I don't think we can
underestimate that.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.950
I don't mean in terms
of the work done.

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.240
I do all the work.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.500
You have all the fun.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.660
But your imagination is just as
crucial in this transaction

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.160
as mine is.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.710
It's a collaborative exercise.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:25.230
RICK KLEFFEL: It's what
you leave out.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.520
LEE CHILD: Yeah.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:31.480
And therefore, actually, if you
leave stuff out, if you

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.710
leave the characters and the
situation as an empty vessel,

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.440
to a certain extent, that leaves
room for the reader's

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.920
imagination to swarm in there
and fill in the details with

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.300
their own convictions.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.500
And I think that's what makes
a successful reading

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.510
experience.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:51.310
Give the reader enough room to
do some of it themselves.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:57.110
Because Reacher, for instance,
is never really described

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.380
other than very vaguely.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.040
His general shape and size,
his general hair color or

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.070
whatever-- he's not really
described at all.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.100
And yet everybody has a very
specific image of what he

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.980
looks like, and that's because
they're investing.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:15.110
You know, the room is there, and
they're occupying it with

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.460
their own projection.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.945
And I think that
is what makes--

00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:21.490
it's my reptile brain connected
to theirs, and

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.390
together, we're creating
the story.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.590
And I think the sort of books
that don't work are the sort

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:30.100
of books that over-specify
everything and try and

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.300
dominate the reader, try and
command the reader, rather

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.110
than give the reader room
and opportunity.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.430
RICK KLEFFEL: Now, one of the
things that we like about

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:44.090
these books is the way, from
book to book, we never know

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.950
what's going to happen
with Reacher and the

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.080
women in the books.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.530
And I think you seem to have a
little bit of a devil in you,

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:53.210
with regards to that.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.150
LEE CHILD: Well, you know, the
women in the books, there's

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:58.430
been a couple of books where
he does not get laid.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:03.380
And you know, that is
a tragedy, really.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.626
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:04.626 --> 00:47:07.270
LEE CHILD: But like I said,
I don't plan it.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.760
And it got to the fifth
book, I think, and

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.030
there was this lawyer.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.860
I think she was called Alice.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.020
She was a lawyer
down in Texas.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.580
She was from New York, and
she's representing

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.310
disadvantaged people in Texas.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.620
And she was this really
nice character.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.430
So I was imagining, sure,
OK, here we go.

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:28.140
This is the love interest
in this book.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.080
But then she sort of turned
out to be gay.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.160
There was this little exchange
where she just, she was gay,

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:34.780
and that was that.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:40.000
And so he was unrequited
in that book.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.780
But generally speaking, yeah,
you know, think about it from

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.510
my point of view.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.750
Like I said, these people
are real to me.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:49.160
So I'm sitting there in my
office, and I'm going to spend

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.020
five or six months with
a made-up woman.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.960
And you'd better believe
she's going to be cute.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.780
LEE CHILD: I mean, why
would I make up a

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.460
woman that was a dog?

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.590
You know?

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.480
I want to have a good
six months.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:09.640
So I'm sitting there with this
made-up person, and yeah,

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640
she's going to be cool.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.330
Absolutely.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:15.830
And so I'm into her, Reacher's
going to be into her.

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.260
RICK KLEFFEL: I believe
that our time

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.010
is up for this afternoon.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.130
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been
privileged to have with

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:25.180
us one of America's, and
the world's, foremost

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.160
writers, Lee Child.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.950
And you can buy his books.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.290
He'll sign them.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:33.040
I'd say buy this one.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.370
If you've never read him before,
you have 16 fabulous

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.826
books to read.

00:48:39.826 --> 00:48:42.080
It's the thrill of looking
forward to

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.000
stuff, to these books.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.100
You'll find out.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.090
You will find out.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:48.700
LEE CHILD: Thank you.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.130
RICK KLEFFEL: Thank
you very much.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:56.467
[APPLAUSE]
