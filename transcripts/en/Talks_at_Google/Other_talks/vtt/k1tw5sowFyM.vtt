00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:09.061
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Now I would like to share you
a little bit about some meditation techniques.

00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:20.830
What we call- there's two things: wisdom,
wisdom and second is experience. Technique,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:31.800
meditation technique. Should I tell you wisdom
first or experience first? Direct meditation

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.519
experience first or the wisdom aspect first?
Wisdom first, raise your hand...okay. Meditation

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.499
first raise your hand...okay.
[laughing]

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:57.340
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Most people like wisdom. Okay.
And this wisdom what we call "finding balance,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.850
finding balance." So anything when you meditate
first important is you have to know the balance.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.930
Sometime what we call inner-balance. And the
balance is not being too tight, not being

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.120
too loose. That's the balance. And this is
the balance not only with meditation, also

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:27.180
important in your life in your daily life.
And special here, you guys working in company,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.820
Google, and in any work, any job you need
balance. If you have balance, then you can

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:46.490
do much better. You can do easily, happy,
and the effect and actually is more powerful,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:55.100
more- effect, effective. You can achieve your
goal more quick and more easy, okay.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.981
The first I would like to show you some kind
of like magic show...

00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:04.350
&gt;&gt;audience member: hehehe

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.350
[everyone laughs]

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.869
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Would you like to learn some magic
show?

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.979
&gt;&gt;audience member: Yes.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:19.550
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: No, no, no, not the magic but
any way. Let's say, water here, yeah, water?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.420
In order to drink this water, you need balance.
So that's just a simple example. I'm saying

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.819
that balance, balance is important in daily
life, yeah. Okay let's say there's three style,

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:44.980
three style, to drink this water. The first
style is: OKAY! I have to drink this water.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:03:05.280
Grrrr. WATER! Haha. Oh, water spill out. Whew!
That's first style, yeah.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:15.940
And the second style: Gosh, I have to drink
this water, you know. I'm going to drink this

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.000
water, awe, yawn, maybe tomorrow.
[laughter]

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:33.261
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: I have to drink water you know,
whew, the water, yawn, maybe next week. Next

00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:38.880
week become next year. And that's the second
style.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:48.580
Now third style: Relax your hand, your arm,
just relax, and then grab it. Grab the cup,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:04:01.709
bring close to your mouth, and drink water.
Mmm, that's a bubble water.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.080
Three style, which one you like?
[laughing]

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:24.380
Third style? How many of you like third style?
First style? Second style? Why most of you

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.380
like third style?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.240
&gt;&gt;female #1: inaudible

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.680
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Pardon?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.570
&gt;&gt;female #1: It's efficient.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.010
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Efficent?

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.169
&gt;&gt;female #1: Afficient.

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.650
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Afficient. Why first style, you
don't like?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.400
&gt;&gt;male #1: Stress.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:49.430
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Stress. Too tight, yeah. There's
a lot of extra effort, extra tensions. No

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:58.910
need, but then it's too tight. In order to
reach your hand from here to here, need a

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:08.380
lot of effort, yeah. So too tight. So you
cannot drink your tea, your water very well.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.900
Second too loose, you know. Tomorrow, maybe
next day. So you're not making any effort.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.380
So you're not making any effort, there's no
result. The third style: Relax, just relax,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:28.510
you know, relax your arm, Don't grab it too
tight, And I grab the cup and I drink, you

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.979
know. Bring close to your mouth. Yeah, this
one "How to have balance" now.

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.390
[clears throat]
The balance is you have to set in your mind

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.900
first. So it what we call "inner-balance".
How to set this balance in your mind. First

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:59.160
important is- try your best- with anything,
because we all have good potential. Everybody

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:15.949
has wisdom, capability, special talent-talent,
skills, powers, love, compassion, maybe you're

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:23.440
not good at that but you're good at others.
So everybody has good things, actually. Scientists

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:32.800
said, if we have ten qualities within us,
one of them is a negative and nine of them

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:45.711
is positive. But what we see's only one negative,
and we don't see nine good qualities. We just

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:56.721
deny nine good qualities and exaggerate one
bad quality and make'em all. That's why it

00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:02.620
very important to recognize, we all have good
things within us.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:12.370
Do you believe? Somehow yes, but you cannot
recognize, yeah? Do you have love and compassion?

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:19.710
Everybody has that, should I introduce you?
Your basic love, basic compassion. For example,

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.221
you come here, yeah. Why you come here?

00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:28.911
&gt;&gt;female #2: Stressed out.

00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.660
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: [laughing]
Stress out.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.180
&gt;&gt;male #2: Because it's free.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.180
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Pardon?

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.180
&gt;&gt;male #2: Because it's free.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.180
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Because it's free.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.180
[laughing loudly]

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.040
&gt;&gt;male #3: Because you need to learn to drink
water.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.570
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: You want to drink water.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.810
&gt;&gt;male #3: Gain wisdom.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.251
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Gain wisdom. It's like, actually,
you come here- Why? Looking for something,

00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:59.229
yeah. To achieve your wish and your desire,
your goal, and want to be happy. So, you all

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:04.069
come here looking for happiness. I don't know
how much happiness you can get from here,

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:15.620
but anyway, you all want to achieve something.
And so, wishing to be happy is love, basic

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:24.711
love. So everybody has this love and kind.
You have love about yourself also. You want

00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:33.969
to be happy, yeah, but we are not recognize.
That's a problem. So very important to recognize,

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:45.020
and mature. How you say- mature, use it, recognize
it. And you have compassion, because you don't

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.709
want to be suffer. You don't want to have
problem, yeah? No? You don't want to have

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:56.930
obstacles. This wish to be free from problem
suffering is compassion.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:05.149
Wish to be happy is love and kindness. Everybody
has this. This is small example. This is why,

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:13.270
try your best to use. Try your best to achieve
your goal, try your best to use your knowledge,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:21.890
capable of whatever, but your mind, don't
be too tight on the result. Because you cannot

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:29.420
achieve everything what you want. You cannot
success all the time 100%. You cannot loss

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:38.050
all the time 100%. So our life is like wave
of the ocean, you know. Or another example,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:48.290
our life is like stock market. Up and down.
That's good, yeah? Our life is up and down,

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:57.270
that makes our life colorful. Otherwise, no
suffering there's no happiness. The stock

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:04.680
markets goes up and down that's why it makes
money, yeah? If stock market always flat,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.690
always same, you can't make money. Do you?
No, it's up and down that's why it's good

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.589
to-good to have business.
Same with our life, up and down's good. See

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:24.740
important is to accept this. Accept life's
up and downs, consequences, you know. I will

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:35.540
tell you one story, oh, two story. One is
with the stock market and one is with the

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.589
lottery. Which one you like?

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:42.180
&gt;&gt;female #2: Lottery.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:52.830
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Lottery, raise your hand. Stock
Market, raise you hand. Okay. Lottery. Okay.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:11:03.681
There's one old man, I have problem, sick,
emergency. He have to go to hospital, emergency

00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:08.801
hospital, and he have to stay there for a
few days. And, actually, he had bought lottery,

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:16.660
you know lottery? And next day he win the
lottery, but he don't know, because he's in

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:24.240
hospital. But his wife and children they know,
and they're so happy and come to hospital

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:31.690
to share this good news to the father. And
first they met doctor. And Doctor say oh,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:37.470
don't tell this good news to your father,
because of special type of disease, you know.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.920
If you tell this to your father is too much
excitement, over excitement, and he will die

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.560
right away. So don't tell this good news to
your father. But the children doesn't believe

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.980
that, no, no, no. We should tell this our
father, you know, good for him, you know,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:02.881
and they have long discussion. In the end,
they make decision that okay tell good news

00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:11.470
to tell father, but who going to tell father?
The doctor. But not directly first, try indirectly

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.950
and doctor see how things going, you know.
And doctor went to his room and said different

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:22.550
things. Hello, you know, good morning. How
was today, you know? And the doctor asked

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:31.820
him, did you bought lottery? The old man reply
yes. Well, that's good. How you feel if you

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:40.209
win lottery? Doctor said well, I mean-Old
man said well, that's nice, but I'm old man,

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:46.690
you know. If I win lottery nice, if I don't
win lottery, okay. You know, it's no big deal

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:52.320
for me, you know. I'm happy and I'm happy
with my life, you know. Doctor said no I don't

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:59.450
believe you. I think if you win lottery you
have over excitement. Old man said no, no,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:06.339
no, I'm serious, you know. Doctor say I don't
believe that. And Old man say I'm serious.

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:09.333
If I win the lottery I will give you have
half, you know.

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:16.040
[laughing]
And doctor says no, no, no. I'm just kidding,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.079
I'm just curious, you know. I'm just asking
you. Old man say yes I'm serious, you know.

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:32.260
If I win I will give you half. And doctor
say will you, it's true? Old man says yes.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:39.700
Could you write it down? Doctor say yes of
course. I mean the old man say yes of course.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:46.790
And old man write down. It said: If I win
lottery this time, I will give half to the

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:52.410
doctor. And he sign, everything. Give it to
doctor. And doctor look at it, you know and

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:59.579
doctor was so happy and die right away.
[loud laughing]

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:11.389
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: And then old man thought, what
happened here, you know? Push emergency button.

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:15.649
And all the nurse, you know, rush in to his
room. And the children, they saw that they

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:20.200
thought wow our father has past away now.
And they were comforting each other, you know.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.481
They have regret. And one thought you-you
say you have to tell your father, and they

00:14:24.481 --> 00:14:29.480
say no-no you say. They complain each other
and they come to room and their father is

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.630
okay, you know. But the doctor has past away.
And then they tell this good news to father

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:42.510
and father was recovered, you know, and after
few days later come back to home. Why? Because

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:51.920
the doctor is too tight, yeah. Too tight,
too much concentration. So much grasping,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:15:02.780
fixation mind. Too much attached to the money
so he cannot enjoy to have lottery. How they

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:10.100
say- over 100 millions, you know. He could
enjoy 50 millions. But the old man is more

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.660
accept the life situation, appreciate what
he have, and he more accept impermanence,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.139
changing, I'm okay. I have everything. I have
good life. So he's not died, you know. Even

00:15:21.139 --> 00:15:27.839
he-he heard the good news. He can enjoy the
rest- the rest of money and then back to home.

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:40.769
So that's just simple example with the lottery.
And now, if you try your best and you mind

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:48.660
don't be too tight on the result, then you
can do much better. You can do better things,

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:58.850
you can have better result and easy for you.
Small effort, you will have big result. Balance.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:04.040
Okay. That's wisdom. Now finish.
And the second next is the method. I would

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:11.889
like to teach you about meditation. So actually,
what I taught this morning. I would like to

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:19.470
teach some meditation technique, you know.
Sound, but we don't have much sound right

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:24.820
now. Before there were good sound, I thought
it good for sound meditation here. But now

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:37.490
every body's gone, yeah. But we have- Do we
have any other sound? Good. Air conditioning,

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:47.630
yeah? That's good. Okay.
First, I'm going to ask you, can you hear

00:16:47.630 --> 00:17:02.260
the sound? Listen, listen, check...hear? If
so raise your hand. You can hear sound clear?

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:16.439
Clear, raise your hand. Great, that is meditation.
Now you know how to meditate.

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:26.049
[laugh]
Why? This meditation just listening to sound

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:34.720
that's all, you don't have to do any special
thing. Mind, when you listen to sound, mind

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:45.289
and ear together, that's it. But you cannot
listen too long, you forgot. Listen to sound

00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:55.979
after a few seconds later you're in the where?
In the office, worry about your job, or worry

00:17:55.979 --> 00:18:06.049
about deadline. Want to go to sleep or want
to go to the pizza shop eating pizza. Okay

00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:13.559
come back, listen too sound, okay. Show time,
any time. You're going to practice this.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:22.080
First, please keep your spine straight and
if you have back you-you can use chair as

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:37.299
support for your back. Just relax and please
feel your body now. What we call mind and

00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:48.809
body together. Just recognize that just realize
that you have body. And feel sensations in

00:18:48.809 --> 00:19:11.649
your body like gravity, weight, and light.
Just relax your muscles, just relax, non-it.

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:21.929
Rest to 100%. Only 100% relaxed. Why I say
not 200%? Because you just relax so you have

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:38.960
tension, tightness, pain is allowed, stress
is allowed. Just relax. Now please listen

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:50.100
to sound.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:56.799
You move to sound to sound, just listen to.
People are chatting, sound of air conditioner,

00:19:56.799 --> 00:21:04.789
or anything.
[long meditative pause]

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:29.710
Okay, that's finished. How was it?
Can you listen to sound? How many of you liked

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:38.110
the sound meditation? Raise your hand. Okay
good. It's very easy, you just listen that's

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:47.779
all. No need have very strong concentration.
Okay now next is. Yes.

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:52.840
&gt;&gt;male #4: I just naturally closed my eyes.
Are you supposed to close your eyes when you

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.840
do that?

00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:00.119
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: With sound, yes close eyes. It's
better. But this is, we're talking about formal

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:06.840
meditation, but you can apply meditation everywhere,
anytime, it alright. If you practice sound

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:14.350
meditation while you're walking you have to
open your eyes, yeah. While you work you can

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:24.080
do that, in the office, in the street, in
the bus, in the car, everywhere. It's your

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:32.460
time anytime. And this is what we call "mental
exercise". Scientists what they call "brain

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:44.220
fitness". Okay.
Now next is with the breath.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:53.479
How many of you like to learn breathing meditation?
Okay. But there's one, another one is how

00:22:53.479 --> 00:23:00.810
to connect with breath. So how to connect
with breath first, breathing meditation first.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.810
Pardon?

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.749
&gt;&gt;audience member: inaudible

00:23:04.749 --> 00:23:12.940
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Connected with breath. Connected
with breath first, raise your hand. Okay and

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:23.460
breathing meditation first, raise your hand.
Okay, okay. How to connect with breath. Can

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:34.830
you bring your attention on your breath right
now? See that you have breath or not. Do you

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:44.230
have breath? And you can check for half minutes,
you know. Just-just connect with your breath,

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:52.580
you know. See that's your breath and just
see the breath in and out for half minutes.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:24:04.380
You don't have to meditate on your breath.
And you- now you count your breath three times

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.680
and after you finish three times raise your
hand.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:40.369
[meditative pause]
Great. You're already connected with your

00:24:40.369 --> 00:24:49.659
breath right now. And now next is breathing
meditation. Breathing Meditation is only breath,

00:24:49.659 --> 00:25:04.369
okay. Don't let your mind go here and there.
No Starbucks, no food in Google, no sour dough,

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:21.999
no pizza, no organic vegetables. Only breath.
Don't listen to sound, don't go to the past.

00:25:21.999 --> 00:25:29.879
Past history, go to future plan. Just now
with the breath just concentrate one point

00:25:29.879 --> 00:25:36.860
in this and no any other thought. Okay, I
will say 1, 2, 3, and then you focus your

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:50.720
breath, okay? 1..., 2..., 2 1/2..., 3. Only
breath.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:26:42.859
[meditative pause]

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:51.840
Okay, finish now. How was it? Which one is
easy? To connect breath easy or breathing

00:26:51.840 --> 00:27:00.120
meditation more easy? Connects more easy?
Just connect with your breaths more easy,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:08.460
raise your hand. And breathing meditation's
more easy, raise your hands. Only a few people,

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:17.969
you don't like meditation? Why you come here?
Okay, now I will tell you my secret. Some

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:23.990
of you know already my secret, yeah. Should
I tell you or... How many of you know my secret,

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:30.019
raise your hand. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...not many.
What is secret?

00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:37.769
&gt;male #5: You work for the Chinese Government.

00:27:37.769 --> 00:27:38.769
[laughter]

00:27:38.769 --> 00:27:41.970
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Many years.
[laughter]

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:49.109
&gt;&gt;male #6: It was the same thing.

00:27:49.109 --> 00:27:59.849
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: They both is meditation. Or which
one is the better?

00:27:59.849 --> 00:28:09.320
The first one is meditation also. Just connect
to your breath. Maybe that's more better than

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:18.429
second one. Because second one you're too
tight. I make you too tight, you know. Only

00:28:18.429 --> 00:28:24.570
breath. Don't let your mind around here and
there, you know. No pizza, you know, no sour

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:32.749
dough, you know, only breath, you know, no
any other talks, concentrate on your breath.

00:28:32.749 --> 00:28:39.080
And you say breath. Oh dear, I have another
thought what should I do? Please, no thought.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:48.570
BREATH. Sour dough, no no. Breath. What should
I do next, you know? Breath. You know, that's

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:55.010
why become more difficult. If you wanted more
concentration, you cannot have more concentration,

00:28:55.010 --> 00:29:01.559
yeah.
Do we have here nice spot here, inside Google,

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:11.750
small dock, garden? Where? What do you call
this name? No name, the bird with the dinosaur,

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:18.849
yeah. Well maybe I give you another example.
I like Golden Gate Park, you know, near here.

00:29:18.849 --> 00:29:26.059
And you want to spend there for whole day,
bring a lot of sour dough, and you know, pizzas

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:32.320
or organic vegetables, you know. And a soon
as you arrive there police car chasing after

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:39.369
you. Wowwow. There's four policemen come.
They say you have special order for you. You

00:29:39.369 --> 00:29:49.440
have to stay here for whole day. And we going
to watch you. There's four policemen from

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:56.839
four directions are watching you and no smiling.
Even you try to smile them they try to control,

00:29:56.839 --> 00:30:08.309
you know. One time I was in London, London,
you know? Huh, palace, big palace in London.

00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:13.951
And there's guard, you know, with the hair,
you know, and this fancy hat, you know. And

00:30:13.951 --> 00:30:18.470
I went in front of him and I say hi, you know.
The guard...

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:27.249
So if the police told you this, you have to
stay here. Then what are you going to think?

00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:33.239
You want to stay, or you don't want to stay?
You don't want to stay, yeah? You don't want

00:30:33.239 --> 00:30:43.609
to stay even five minutes. Even you eat organic
vegetables, no taste, even pizza no taste.

00:30:43.609 --> 00:30:48.771
But if police say you have to stay here, if
police doesn't say you have to stay, if there's

00:30:48.771 --> 00:30:56.179
no police you can enjoy for holiday. Same
focus, no thought, concentration. Then you

00:30:56.179 --> 00:31:03.700
can not have concentration. Actually, no need,
just realize the breath in and out, in-out.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:11.669
That's all. That's the meditation and what
we call non-meditation. Meditation of non-meditation,

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:16.710
because it's naturally, you don't have to
make a new one. And by doing this again and

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:22.999
again, then automatically your mind become
calm and peaceful and pliable and workable.

00:31:22.999 --> 00:31:29.440
Because normally what I call monkey mind,
the crazy monkey mind, controlling you. You

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.619
don't know how to control the monkey mind.
So now this meditation is giving training

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:42.940
to monkey mind. So if you say hello, listen
to sound, who is boss? You are the boss. You

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:49.649
are telling monkey mind hey listen to sound
and monkey mind also happy, because monkey

00:31:49.649 --> 00:31:58.110
mind love job. So if you give job, monkey
mind also happy and you are happy. Win-win

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:08.749
situation, you know. And traditional example
is if you meditate then the goal of meditation

00:32:08.749 --> 00:32:15.499
is become calm, peaceful, pliable.
An example of that is now your mind is like

00:32:15.499 --> 00:32:24.679
monkey and slowly it will transform into tame
elephant. In reality it's impossible, yeah.

00:32:24.679 --> 00:32:28.919
Monkey cannot transform into elephant, but
for example it's possible because you can

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:35.739
use anything for the example.
One time I was in India. Delhi, New Delhi.

00:32:35.739 --> 00:32:44.179
I was walking in the park. I saw giant animals
coming. Look, first time in my life seeing

00:32:44.179 --> 00:32:54.049
elephant. Big almost one floor, maybe one
and half floor, very big. Back of head there's

00:32:54.049 --> 00:33:05.389
one tiny guy controlling elephant. Elephant,
you know, taking how to say- bananas, apples,

00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:10.759
people give them and they eat some give them
money, and the elephant give money to this

00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:21.889
tiny guy. So who is the guide of elephant?
You awareness and the monkey mind become elephant

00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:30.039
doesn't make unnecessary problem. It's become
calm, peaceful and also powerful. Yeah, that's

00:33:30.039 --> 00:33:34.080
finished and do you have any questions?
Yes, you can ask.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:45.309
&gt;&gt;female #4: ...can you tell us how to become
friends with the panic?

00:33:45.309 --> 00:33:49.269
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Panic?

00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:50.269
&gt;&gt;female #4: Yes.

00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:51.269
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Okay.

00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:52.269
&gt;&gt;male # 7: Could you repeat the question?

00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:57.989
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Repeat the question? She asked
me that I in the period start I talk about

00:33:57.989 --> 00:34:03.419
how to make friends with panic, because when
I was young I have panic and I make friends

00:34:03.419 --> 00:34:10.159
with my panic and my panic become one of my
best friend. How to do that?

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:18.099
The style is right now you are using sound
as support for meditation, yeah. Your breath

00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:23.579
is support for your meditation. There's two
things right now. And you have to do this

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:32.889
first, again and again. And slowly, slowly
your gonna use other things as support for

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:40.679
meditation. Anything you see, smell, taste,
physical sensation. And then you can do with

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:47.201
thought, and then rather you do with even
emotions. Do we have thoughts?

00:34:47.201 --> 00:34:50.560
&gt;&gt;male #8: I think so.
[laughing]

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.770
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: If you have thought raise your
hand. Great. If you don't have thought raise

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:09.650
your hand. I don't have thought is also thought,
yeah? Okay, should we have tried with thought?

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:22.450
Good. Please keep your meditation posture.
And please watch your thoughts, thoughts same

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:33.420
as watching your breath. Be aware of sound.
Same style, your breath come in and out, your

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:55.619
thought also come in and out. same as your
breath just watch.

00:35:55.619 --> 00:36:34.011
[meditative pause]
Okay, how was it? Did you watch your thought?

00:36:34.011 --> 00:36:42.329
And what is your experience? You can say...
Pardon?

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:46.250
&gt;&gt;male #9: Wasn't as easy as [inaudible]

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.099
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Not easy as control breath and
sound how?

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:53.769
&gt;&gt;male #9: ... I did not find it that easy
[inaudible].

00:36:53.769 --> 00:36:54.769
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Pardon?

00:36:54.769 --> 00:36:59.519
&gt;&gt;male #9: I did not find it that easy at
all.

00:36:59.519 --> 00:37:02.310
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Oh, you cannot find easy because
when you try to watch they're gone?

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:12.500
&gt;&gt;male #9: Yes, my thought go [inaudible].

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.740
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: What I am thinking and try to
make names, give it names, something like

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.740
that?

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:24.064
&gt;&gt;male #9: I have more thoughts when I trying
not to have thoughts, avoid thoughts, but

00:37:24.064 --> 00:37:25.064
I don't have thoughts now that I need them.

00:37:25.064 --> 00:37:27.970
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: To me there's more thoughts come
out when you try to avoid thought, but not

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:32.750
when you need the thought the thought doesn't
want to come? Okay, pardon?

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:38.279
male #9: Where's the thought?

00:37:38.279 --> 00:37:46.099
Rinpoche: How many with this experience raise
your hand. When you try to watch thought and

00:37:46.099 --> 00:37:55.490
as soon as you watch they are gone. Raise
your hand again. Great. Good. And this experience

00:37:55.490 --> 00:38:02.160
we call "open awareness". When you try to
watch them, they're just gone. You cannot

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:09.599
find them. What we call this experience almost
like you're waiting in the bus stop and waiting

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:19.059
for bus. When bus will come? No bus. Oh, there
one bus coming. You are so happy. Soon as

00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:26.850
if you tried to enter the bus, the bus just
left. Huh, no bus again. So you have your

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:38.940
thought, I need you. Please come now. Normally
I have a lot of them, today what happened?

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:48.080
That's open awareness. You are not lost, too.
You have awareness, but at the same time you

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:56.599
don't have any- you lost focus. But another
thought pop up. Happy. But as soon as watch

00:38:56.599 --> 00:39:01.990
it's gone. The watcher- who's watcher? The
watcher's awareness.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:08.490
And the second experience, how many of you
can watch your thought? You can watch? Raise

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:16.030
your hand. Good. That's also very good meditation
experience, because what we call this experience,

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:27.099
like watching television, very big screen.
IMAX, 100 and what- 90? 190 degree of screen?

00:39:27.099 --> 00:39:33.829
Very big, 3-dimension and what I call inner-television.
There's words, image, bah, blah, blah, yadda,

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:40.309
yadda, yadda, many, many, many different.
Oh, it's so nice. If you watch them, you are

00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:48.430
already out of them. If you see the river
that means you are out of river. If you fall

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:55.320
into river and carry by river you cannot see
river. If you see a thought that means you're

00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:02.010
out. You are watching television, you are
not inside the television, you are not part

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:07.579
of program, you are watching it. Who's watching?
Awareness watching. This is so you can be

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:13.730
with yourself, and this what I call inner
television, and when ever you feel board watch

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:21.500
inner-television. And this is very, very good
price, you know. Zero price, you know. You

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:26.950
don't have to buy this inner-television and
you don't have to worry about monthly payments

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:33.170
for this inner-television. And whenever you
want to go, this inner-television will follow

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:41.440
you. And no one can steal your inner-television.
Thieves, no problem with thieves, you know.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.131
But there's one problem. Should I tell you
problem? The programs are quite old.

00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:48.960
[laughter]

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:57.650
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: You have old, boring programs
comes again, again, again. Even you change

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:05.460
different channels they're all running same
programs, but it's okay. Watch old, boring

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:13.079
program again, and again, and again. The result
is different like playing football- soccer,

00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:21.980
soccer. How many style to play soccer? Only
one style? Or two style? Pardon?

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.640
&gt;&gt;male #10: three means that many...

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:38.500
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Many, many...50? huh, infinite.
And in USA how many styles go to Olympic?

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.650
&gt;&gt;male #11: One style, we always lose.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:42.650
[laughing]

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:54.400
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: One style always lose. To swim
how many style?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:03.599
Six style they say, yeah. Front, right, left,
back, jumping, I don't know. I have friend

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:11.750
they say, six or seven styles total. But anyway,
it's like learning football. You have got

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:17.780
to learn football every day that you play
football, yeah. If you style, you have to

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:25.269
choose one style first to master, yeah. So
you have to repeat the style again and again.

00:42:25.269 --> 00:42:31.349
So this year one style next year same style,
but after ten year, each time you play results

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:36.450
are better, better, better. So watching old,
same, boring program again and again, the

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:44.640
results different. The same, similar with
emotion also. Watching thought the same style

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:50.380
with emotion, but first put it difficult,
special ear you'll have, measure strong emotion,

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:56.970
you cannot watch, cause if you try to watch
you feel overwhelm. Go back to sound, back

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.440
to breath. Okay.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.950
&gt;&gt;Ming: Do you want one or two last question,
okay.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:06.950
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: one or two last question, okay.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:12.390
&gt;&gt;male #12: If everything in the external
world can be used to help with meditation.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:17.190
Why are there traditions [inaudible].

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:22.789
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Can be used as support for meditation,
right. Can help for meditation.

00:43:22.789 --> 00:43:29.441
&gt;&gt;male #12: [inaudible] why are there traditions
about what you eat or whatever in monasteries

00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:32.270
if they are staying away from modern world?

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:38.099
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: -stricter in monasteries? -away
for outer world? -why the mon-better? In general

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:44.150
there's many mentalities and many different
ways, because you can meditate everywhere,

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:54.349
any time, but we are busy and lazy. It's like
meditation wise you can, but personal wise

00:43:54.349 --> 00:44:06.160
you cannot. Because too busy and lazy. So
if you go to the special retreat and you can

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:14.220
put more effort to the meditate and spend
all time, something like that. Yes.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:28.830
&gt;&gt;male #13: Some people believe that like
for chronic injuries that there's a mental

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:32.400
[inaudible] mental there's like a part of
chronic injuries [inaudible].

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Mental...yes

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.490
&gt;&gt;male #13: Could you talk about some meditation
techniques for like dealing with chronic injuries

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.799
to help as a tool in healing.

00:44:40.799 --> 00:44:45.980
&gt;&gt;Rinpoche: Yeah, I think many people now
are using meditation as too to recover mental

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.980
disease.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:55.260
&gt;&gt;male #13: No, no, no, like physical problem
like some people have back pain for a lot

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.819
of years [inaudible].

00:44:56.819 --> 00:45:01.869
Rinpoche: Physical problem, right...oh...mmm
mmm. That's not just like magic. You can meditate

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:11.810
now and tomorrow, boom- finish, no. But never-the-less
it helps. For example, I'm guinea pig and

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:18.250
scientist put me inside machine and the put
inject- kind of like chemical and it produce-

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:30.190
what you call this, blister, blister and then
meditate. And say how you heal the blisters

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:40.900
and this is a dramatic result. The meditator
heal the bli-blister much faster than people

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:47.259
who control diet and physical exercise, the
control group. There's some kind of like-

00:45:47.259 --> 00:45:53.069
when you meditate change in you're the cells
and develop immune systems that really helps.

00:45:53.069 --> 00:46:02.690
But also depends on what kind of problems.
Actually it's good for the mental for the

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:13.559
mind. It's good. Can take on any problem as
support for meditation. For example, I used

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:25.880
to be by panic and, but that's what we call
natural suffering. Getting old, see, die,

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:33.579
these are natural suffering. So this is not
easy to transform, but self-created suffering

00:46:33.579 --> 00:46:41.500
can transform. The worst suffering for us,
death and fear of death. Which one is more

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:49.009
painful? Fear of death. The fear of death
is self-created suffering. Death is natural

00:46:49.009 --> 00:46:57.410
suffering. That's why most suffering for us
is self-created suffering, and that can liberate

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:01.609
by meditation. Thank you.
