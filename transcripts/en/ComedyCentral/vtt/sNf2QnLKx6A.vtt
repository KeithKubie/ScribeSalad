00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.336
(upbeat music)

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.243
- What movie do you
want to watch, Sal?

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:14.414
- We got Faces of Death 10,
Amputee Fails, Cannibal Orgy?

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.650 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I've seen Cannibal
Orgy 100 times.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.885
- You know what?

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.086
Why don't we just go
down to Mulcahey's

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.187
and hit on the waitress
with the sex tattoo?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.355
Because these movies--

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.757 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're just
saying that because

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.291
you're afraid of scary movies.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.761
He pissed his pants last time
we watched Jason in Space.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.863
- He doesn't belong in space!

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.631
- You want to talk scary movie?

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:34.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
I got a guy that will get
you a Norwegian horror movie

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.904
that will prolapse your colon.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.606
- A pink sock.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.474 align:start size:84% position:16%
- My man Olaf will
get you what you need.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.977
All you have to do is go here.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:48.815
The last time I watched
one of Olaf's movies,

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.717
I tried to bury myself.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.787
- This Olaf guy?

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.989
He's not weird or
anything is he?

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.657
- No.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.192
(woman screams)

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.628
- So you're uncle Sal sent ya.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.899
Yeah he's a cool guy dudes.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.801
So when do we get
to go swimming?

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.302
- Oh no we're, no swimming

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.571
we're just here to get
a horror movie from you.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.673 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I do have
something very scary,

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.676
but I don't think
you can handle it.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.580
- He's calling you out, dude.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.581
- Yes I can.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.516
- Drom Mord.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.688 align:start size:84% position:16%
Norwegian horror
film about the demon

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.257
with an ice sword and an axe.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.725 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Okay that sounds
perfect, I'll take that.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.996
- Ah ah, you look like a
bunch of limp noodle dicks.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:39.432
I'm pretty sure you
can't handle this.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.367
- [Dan] I'm not scared.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.902
- Okay.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.571
Sweet dreams, Danny.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.541
(laughs)

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.678
(howling)

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.380
- Drom Mord!

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.855
(whispering)

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.094
(yells)

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.371
- No I think we're good, I
think we're good with this.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.506
I think it's good, we're good.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:20.507
(laughs)

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.975
- Why did he kiss that girl?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.077
- Yo I don't know man,
but we gotta go to sleep.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.645
- Are you scared, is this
some Jason in Space shit?

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.479
- No!

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:28.915
- Oops.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.116 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Dude are you trying
to Drom Mord me?

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:32.585 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Nope, just my
nightly Crisco mask.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.920
Goodnight Danny.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.923
(yelling)

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:39.159
I'm just kidding.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.894
- Where'd you get that axe?

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.128
(farting)

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.663
Dude come on, that's
not even in the movie!

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.298
- I am out of ideas.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.699
Ah dick!

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.001
I'll put my swamp
ass all over you.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:48.968
- Have you gained
a couple pounds?

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:49.836
- Yep.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.538
(creaking)

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.106
- Dude, enough of this shit.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.807
- No, that wasn't me.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.042
- Is mom home?

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.545 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No, she's at
ladies anatropics.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.582
(whispering)

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.019
(yelling)

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.056
- Come on, come on, come on!

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.292
- Just the thing.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.027
- You made an ice sword?

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.230
- I make a lot of ice weapons.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.064
Let's roll.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.299
- Oh come on man.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.234
- Stay back, I got this.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.670
(whispering)

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.407
(whimpering)

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.012
I got this!

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:34.914
Shit, shit!

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.384
Ice swords are fragile.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.553 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I won't let my brother
get dream murdered.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:41.955
- Neither will I.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.491
(yelling)

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:53.166 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's just a burglar,
just a burglar.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.035
Let's get back to bed.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.104
Gotta clean up that
ice in the morning.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:00.773
(thunder booms)

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.676
- No more Norwegian shit dude.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.845 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, turns out
those people are weird.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.481 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Goodnight man.
- Goodnight.

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.084
(tinkly music)

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:11.918
- Shh.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.190
(thunder booms)

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.260
