those those investigations led on to a
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710

64 was the beginning of the return of

64 was the beginning of the return of
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.330

this kind of so-called quantum field

this kind of so-called quantum field
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.149

theory in particle physics it had

previously became been successful in the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
previously became been successful in the
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.260
previously became been successful in the
50s quantum quantum electrodynamics and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
50s quantum quantum electrodynamics and
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480
50s quantum quantum electrodynamics and
then became neglected in particle

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
then became neglected in particle
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.130
then became neglected in particle
physics because it didn't seem to work

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
physics because it didn't seem to work
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.950
physics because it didn't seem to work
and what we did was a step on the way to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
and what we did was a step on the way to
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.560
and what we did was a step on the way to
making it work
