Speaker 1:          00:00          Like we were talking about before, when you meet someone who can give you a lesson and express something in a way that makes you reconsider your own ideas that you hold sacred. I mean, I'll give you an example. When I, when I met my wife 30 years ago, I, I wasn't pro death penalty, but I was, I would say I would say neutral to the death penalty. I would be like, you know, ted Bundy, the state can put him to death. Uh, and I had all the kind of conventional reasons or I didn't really care. He's a vile person. He killed all these people. He tortured them. If the families will get any relief, whatever, that's fine. I had some concerns because I was this statistician about a conviction of the innocent and I support the innocence project. And I am very concerned with police brutality.

Speaker 1:          00:46          I have for years been advocating the racializing a police brutality is vile and, and uh, uh, porridge and must be firmly resisted. Uh, I think that, um, I think the, the, the prosecutorial misconduct to people are prosecutors lie and put people in prison. Uh, you know, there've been many, many cases of people on death row who are innocent that should offend our conscience. So even back then I had some concerns about the death penalty because I, um, because I, I recognize that, you know, we can't be perfect. We're going to convict some innocent people and also let some guilty people go free. That's not as bad as killing the, putting to death, the innocent, but they're both bad. So I had that concern about the death penalty, but otherwise I was like, it's okay. My opinions have totally changed. I'm completely opposed to the death penalty now for many reasons.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Not just the statistical reason, but also I think it's immoral. I don't think the state should put it down. I think we can deprive you of liberty. I think we can make sure you're not a threat to society. We can lock you up for the rest of your life. But I think we, uh, the state should not be taking people's lives in that way. There's something extraordinarily strange about locking someone up. It's very strange. Well, we have a carceral state. I mean, you know, we lock up a higher we have is, we are fraction of people incarcerated I think is the same as Stalinist Russia. And we have very long prison sentences, which are nuts. You don't need them for deterrence actually for nonviolent drug, especially for non all nonviolent offenses should have much shorter prison doesn't, we should have more, we should have higher certainty of punishment.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Higher fraction of people who have actually committed crimes should be punished. But I think we should, we could cut in half or less the, the duration of the senses. I think you'll be able to deter criminals from doing things with a three month sentence if they are very confident that they will be convicted if they're caught. Whereas now we have a system where most are not convicted like this Jesse Smollett thing, which is just ridiculous in the news and uh, uh, and which therefore, and only a tiny fraction are convicted and, but they're giving huge long sentences. It's like they're paying the sense for everyone that didn't. Yes. It doesn't make any sense and it's expensive. It ties up our prison system actually. Um, can I, can I go to tell you another story? True. So it was a situation a few years ago when there's a fairly famous, um, uh, director and writer by the name of David Simon, who I consider a friend.

Speaker 1:          03:07          He did the wire, he was a show runner for a bunch of other very famous, uh, wonderful, uh, TD programs. And he started his career actually as a reporter in a, in Baltimore. He was a beat reporter and then went on to become a writer, did the wire and so forth. And he told the story, uh, actually at Yale to students about how he had just come back from a summit. President Obama was still president where, um, he was trying to help the students to see that you can find common ground with your political opponents and that you need to listen to them and talk to them in order to find that ground. Uh, if, and so he told the following story, he said, I had, I just came back from Camp David where, uh, there was a meeting about how to reduce incarceration in our society.

Speaker 1:          03:53          And he said, the Koch brothers were there and the students all hissed, and Newt Gingrich was there, and the students all hissed and a bunch of liberal people were there. And the students were really happy about that. And then they said, well, why did you go, how could you associate yourself with those evil people? And he said, look, he said, the, the conservatives want to reduce incarceration because it's expensive. The liberals want to reduce incarceration because it's unjust. And the libertarians want to reduce incarceration because the state shouldn't be depriving people of Liberty. And I can find common ground with these people and reduce incarceration. Why would I not talk to them? And the students didn't seem to understand that. They were like, they couldn't get it. That's why they shouldn't be able to vote it to be 30. There should be 25. I mean, and so the, I don't know how we got onto this, you know, like talking to you is so much fun because it's like we're all over the place.

Speaker 1:          04:45          But, um, how did I get a come up with this example? We were talking about talking to a political enemies, was it or something else? Yes. We're talking about people telling you that you shouldn't associate yes. People that have varying opinions. Yes, yes. And you know, Oh, I know. We were talking about incarceration and prison sentences and so forth. So we have a horrible problem in our society with, with incarceration, a larger fraction of our populace as incarcerated. We deprive after you paid your debt to society, we often have these, these, uh, we deprive you of your right to vote, which I think is wrong. You've paid your debt to society. You should be able to reenter society. That's appliances. Exactly. Yes. Exactly. You were in prison for 10 years. That's enough. You know, now you, we want you to feel a part of society and we want to welcome you back if we have that vision of justice.

Speaker 1:          05:29          How about the registered sex offender? That's a serious problem, especially for, uh, crimes. You know, these crazy cases which offend my conscience. I know a guy who got charged as a registered sex offender because he urinated outside. Yeah. That's not caught in the south. Urinating outside. That's nuts. That's just a prosecutorial abuse. Or you know, you have these Romeo and Juliet laws, which are not in every state now. Thank God the alas, they are not in every state. Uh, you know, you have a 16 year old boy and a 14 year old girl. There have to be exceptions for that kind of sexual practice. You know, they're exchanging a sexually explicit images. They should not be considered sex offenders for the rest of their lives. That's nuts. So, um, so yes, so all of those things, but the problem is not only do we have a huge fraction of people in prison, we have extremely long prison sentences compared to any many European countries for the same crime. And it's costly. It's unjust, it's ineffective. I think. I think we should change the policies on this and maybe we will. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:31          There's also the idea of reforming them. It's, it's, they're not using all the tools within their disposal. They're not really doing a good attempted it. And I just don't think it does anything other than make their life hell for a short period of time, which we're hoping we hope deters them from doing future crime.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Well, they're different. There's the justice, there's deterrence, their safety, right? Like so violent criminals that we put in jail. Uh, we need to do that. I mean to, I'm not interested in being killed by somebody who, you know, could it killed someone else? She should have been you in jail for a while, 20 years. So I'm not at a time. People, yeah, for murder. I think 20 years is enough. Well a European, a European standards are about 20 years actually. And that there are different things, like if you wanted to pry them, if your, if your vision is they're being punished for the killing of a life, therefore they've surrendered their life. It's sort of eye for an eye kind of justice. You would, they would be the rest of their lives in jail. And you know, I, we can debate whether that's reasonable or not.

Speaker 1:          07:32          If you, if you want to provide a public safety, we is. And people often age out of their violence. So a lot of men, typically, these were talking mostly about men who do these things. Uh, you know, by the time they're in their forties or 50s, they're much less violent. Testosterone declines. They get older and wiser. Uh, they're not interested in, in criminal, in that kind of criminal behavior. Many of them are not. So that, does that suggest you don't need life sentences for murder? And I think it also depends on we have for gradations of murder, you know, we have like the impulsive stuff that intent matters of planfulness matters, that depravity matters. All of these things are, are factors and I don't think we should have a one size fits all incarceration for murder. Yes. That's my opinion. What do you think?

Speaker 2:          08:12          I think it depends entirely on the circumstances. If two men are engaged in some sort of a dispute and one winds up killing the other one, that's a big difference between that and someone breaking into your house and killing your daughter.

Speaker 1:          08:24          Yes. A correct. And I also think even in that, like I, I really am opposed to these stand your ground laws. I think those are, if you have the opportunity to avoid conflict and to avoid you or not, uh, it, I would prefer as a state to require that you walk away. Uh, even if it makes you feel embarrassed, uh, then give you the right to kill someone for offending you in those, those videos of the, of the guys in that shot, the guy on his knees in the, in the parking lot in the, I forgot what state it was like a, not a year or two ago, they got into an altercation in the parking lot. Like if I have words with someone at a party shot a guy on his knee. Yes. There was no threat to him and he was, he was not prosecuted on the stand your ground argument, which is nuts.

Speaker 1:          09:07          Why was the guy on his knees? He was, I forgot. I see. Don't shoot me or something. Oh, Jesus. So it was, it was crazy. He didn't get prosecuted. I don't think so. We can look up the facts that were several cases. There were several cases like this, but you know, like I remember when I was doing shotokan karate, my Sensei Kazumi Tabata, this was years ago, uh, 30 years ago now. And he told us the following story. He, he said there was a Sensei in this village in Japan and the students were coming to the Dojo. And, uh, there was the, the, the best student that, you know, and then all the other students, and they were walking through the village and they passed the approach to horse that was on the street from the rear. And it startled the horse. And as the horse reared up and kicked his leg, the, the, uh, the best student instantly did a, a kind of a avoidance, kind of a twisted his body and avoided the kick.

Speaker 1:          09:59          And the, and the, and the, uh, the horse's leg went right in front of him and all the other students were amazed at his ability and they get to the Dojo and they tell the Sensei, this is my sensei telling me this story, telling all of us this story. And they, those students get to this, the Dojo and they tell the Sensei the story marveling at the, at the ability of this master student to definitely avoid the strike. And the Sensei is very angry and they don't understand why, why is he so angry? He said if he were a really good student of mine, he would have walked on the other side of the street. He would have avoided the horse all together. So the real wisdom is to avoid avoidance of conflict in the first place. There's no reason to seek out conflict. And so on the stand your ground laws, you know, if the choices ether you just avoid the conflict, you know, someone, someone swore at you or called you an asshole or was an unreasonable jerk, that doesn't give you the right to kill them.

Speaker 1:          10:54          Right. Um, so anyway, I don't know how we got onto this as well. How are we going to the penalty for Kaiser murder. Exactly. Exactly. So, so, so different gradations. Yeah. Yeah. I just don't know how much of a deterrent it is locking people up. I just, I, I'm not sure. I'm not really sure if that actually stops people from doing things. I think it stops some people. I think there've been academic research on this. I just don't think there's any real rehabilitation other than personal choice. I mean, I think the real rehabilitation comes from someone making a personal choice to never be that person that way. Again. Yes. For most of them you're, you're, you're being locked up with a bunch of hardened criminals and you, your, that's your, your company. But you're not suggesting we have a society in which when you commit violent acts, we do nothing.

Speaker 1:          11:44          No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No. I'm, I'm suggesting struggling with this is what you're saying. Yeah. The, yeah, the concept of nuances. Yes. This is, this is applied here than anywhere else. I think I got the impression looking at your face a moment ago when I told my sort of sweet Sensei, Japanese karate story that you didn't agree necessarily. No. That's a very wise way of looking at it. Yeah. Don't, don't be near a fucking horse that wants to kick you. Very smart. Yeah. Get out of there. I'm a big believer in avoiding conflict. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm the first guy we use. It'll conflict on intellectual conflict. Exactly. Physical words and violence are different. Extremely different. Yeah. I mean, intellectual conflict at that is actually important and you learn from it. Yes. Very rarely do you learn too much from you. You learn, don't do that again, that's what you learned from physical conflict.
