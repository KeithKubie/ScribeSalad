back in 1958 Francis Crick actually came

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:49.229
back in 1958 Francis Crick actually came
 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.079
back in 1958 Francis Crick actually came
up with the idea hypothesis which has

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089
up with the idea hypothesis which has
 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.399
up with the idea hypothesis which has
become somewhat of the dogma of the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409
become somewhat of the dogma of the
 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.770
become somewhat of the dogma of the
ribosome field stating that the mRNA

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
ribosome field stating that the mRNA
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.069
ribosome field stating that the mRNA
codon and the tRNA anticodon is pretty

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
codon and the tRNA anticodon is pretty
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.419
codon and the tRNA anticodon is pretty
much like the money area of the ribosome

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429
much like the money area of the ribosome
 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.819
much like the money area of the ribosome
and this is how the body makes proteins

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
and this is how the body makes proteins
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.119
and this is how the body makes proteins
and peptides and so stating that has

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
and peptides and so stating that has
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920
and peptides and so stating that has
actually become the dogma one of our

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
actually become the dogma one of our
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.110
actually become the dogma one of our
recent grad students in our lab did a

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120
recent grad students in our lab did a
 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.420
recent grad students in our lab did a
project on natural amino acids comparing

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
project on natural amino acids comparing
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.210
project on natural amino acids comparing
them to Miss isolated naturals and so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
them to Miss isolated naturals and so
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.860
them to Miss isolated naturals and so
basically right here you see the scheme

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870
basically right here you see the scheme
 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.500
basically right here you see the scheme
and here is where you're finding the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510
and here is where you're finding the
 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.140
and here is where you're finding the
natural amino acids so tRNA alanine with

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
natural amino acids so tRNA alanine with
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240
natural amino acids so tRNA alanine with
tyranny with alanine and as the amino

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
tyranny with alanine and as the amino
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460
tyranny with alanine and as the amino
acid finality is amino acid with the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
acid finality is amino acid with the
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560
acid finality is amino acid with the
tRNA phenylalanine and lysine with a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
tRNA phenylalanine and lysine with a
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.110
tRNA phenylalanine and lysine with a
tRNA lysine and then with a simple

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120
tRNA lysine and then with a simple
 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.300
tRNA lysine and then with a simple
chemistry were actually able to miss ASA

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
chemistry were actually able to miss ASA
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.250
chemistry were actually able to miss ASA
Lacy's so for instance here you're

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260
Lacy's so for instance here you're
 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.170
Lacy's so for instance here you're
seeing tRNA phenylalanine with the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
seeing tRNA phenylalanine with the
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.840
seeing tRNA phenylalanine with the
lysine amino acid and using our

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
lysine amino acid and using our
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.780
lysine amino acid and using our
translational machinery and our actually

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
translational machinery and our actually
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.610
translational machinery and our actually
our ribosome trans translation assays he

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620
our ribosome trans translation assays he
 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.920
our ribosome trans translation assays he
did a couple experiments comparing these

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
did a couple experiments comparing these
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.410
did a couple experiments comparing these
with the relative dipeptide yields

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
with the relative dipeptide yields
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480
with the relative dipeptide yields
comparing to the naturals as well as

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
comparing to the naturals as well as
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.240
comparing to the naturals as well as
doing a selection competition assay and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
doing a selection competition assay and
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.590
doing a selection competition assay and
what we found is actually that these

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600
what we found is actually that these
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630
what we found is actually that these
miss isolated now

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
miss isolated now
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.390
miss isolated now
amino acids are actually going in with

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400
amino acids are actually going in with
 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.520
amino acids are actually going in with
pretty much the same efficiency as the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
pretty much the same efficiency as the
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.650
pretty much the same efficiency as the
natural amino acids showing that the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660
natural amino acids showing that the
 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.700
natural amino acids showing that the
debry Besson was really not

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
debry Besson was really not
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.290
debry Besson was really not
discriminating against these miss

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
discriminating against these miss
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029
discriminating against these miss
isolated naturals which was a really

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
isolated naturals which was a really
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.640
isolated naturals which was a really
interesting find and so kind of stepping

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
interesting find and so kind of stepping
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.740
interesting find and so kind of stepping
to the side of his project I'm actually

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
to the side of his project I'm actually
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.680
to the side of his project I'm actually
looking at DiMeo acids right here and so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
looking at DiMeo acids right here and so
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.600
looking at DiMeo acids right here and so
here's a subset of the amino acids that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
here's a subset of the amino acids that
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.700
here's a subset of the amino acids that
I meant looking at right now and these

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710
I meant looking at right now and these
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.280
I meant looking at right now and these
are all charged on to tRNA lysine and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
are all charged on to tRNA lysine and
 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.410
are all charged on to tRNA lysine and
the difference between Naturals and D

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
the difference between Naturals and D
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.390
the difference between Naturals and D
amino acids is that DS is just a slight

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
amino acids is that DS is just a slight
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.330
amino acids is that DS is just a slight
stereochemistry difference and so for

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
stereochemistry difference and so for
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.680
stereochemistry difference and so for
instance here this amino group it's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690
instance here this amino group it's
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.600
instance here this amino group it's
pointing out and the natural it would be

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
pointing out and the natural it would be
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.050
pointing out and the natural it would be
pointing back and so using these I'm

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
pointing back and so using these I'm
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.449
pointing back and so using these I'm
also using the same translational and

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
also using the same translational and
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.400
also using the same translational and
machinery entrance in vitro translation

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410
machinery entrance in vitro translation
 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.930
machinery entrance in vitro translation
system that we have incorporated in our

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940
system that we have incorporated in our
 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.750
system that we have incorporated in our
lab to do these same type of dipeptide

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
lab to do these same type of dipeptide
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940
lab to do these same type of dipeptide
experiments to look at selection and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950
experiments to look at selection and
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.890
experiments to look at selection and
specifically I'm looking at tRNA pairing

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
specifically I'm looking at tRNA pairing
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.830
specifically I'm looking at tRNA pairing
effects now and so here's just the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
effects now and so here's just the
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.810
effects now and so here's just the
portrayal of a ribosome craft that I

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
portrayal of a ribosome craft that I
 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.270
portrayal of a ribosome craft that I
actually did this past summer it's just

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
actually did this past summer it's just
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.540
actually did this past summer it's just
a very difficult irritation process and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550
a very difficult irritation process and
 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.490
a very difficult irritation process and
so I just like to kind of show that this

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
so I just like to kind of show that this
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.440
so I just like to kind of show that this
is one of the components that goes into

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
is one of the components that goes into
 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.390
is one of the components that goes into
doing the whole translation system and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400
doing the whole translation system and
 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.509
doing the whole translation system and
then down here we're showing the use of

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
then down here we're showing the use of
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.340
then down here we're showing the use of
the flexitime ribozyme which is how we

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
the flexitime ribozyme which is how we
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.009
the flexitime ribozyme which is how we
actually put these miss isolated amino

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019
actually put these miss isolated amino
 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.530
actually put these miss isolated amino
acids onto the tRNA of choice and so

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
acids onto the tRNA of choice and so
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.810
acids onto the tRNA of choice and so
simply just by labeling the amino acid

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820
simply just by labeling the amino acid
 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.750
simply just by labeling the amino acid
with a DBE we're able to put whatever

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760
with a DBE we're able to put whatever
 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.060
with a DBE we're able to put whatever
amino acid of choice onto the tRNA of

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070
amino acid of choice onto the tRNA of
 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.030
amino acid of choice onto the tRNA of
choice as well and then here is just an

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
choice as well and then here is just an
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.470
choice as well and then here is just an
example of some of the results that I

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480
example of some of the results that I
 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360
example of some of the results that I
have of aminoacylation with D amino

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
have of aminoacylation with D amino
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.330
have of aminoacylation with D amino
acids showing that their percentages are

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
acids showing that their percentages are
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.940
acids showing that their percentages are
relatively the same in this case but

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950
relatively the same in this case but
 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.190
relatively the same in this case but
really with the amino acyl Asians it

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
really with the amino acyl Asians it
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.720
really with the amino acyl Asians it
depends on what tRNA are using it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730
depends on what tRNA are using it
 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.610
depends on what tRNA are using it
depends on what amino acid you can see

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
depends on what amino acid you can see
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.310
depends on what amino acid you can see
as much as a 52% charging as low as an

8% charging and so here's just a scheme

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630
8% charging and so here's just a scheme
 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.680
8% charging and so here's just a scheme
of the differences in meal

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
of the differences in meal
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.630
of the differences in meal
and then moving forward from that once

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640
and then moving forward from that once
 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.950
and then moving forward from that once
you get everything I mean amino acyl

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960
you get everything I mean amino acyl
 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.380
you get everything I mean amino acyl
ated we're actually able to move forward

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390
ated we're actually able to move forward
 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.660
ated we're actually able to move forward
and do experiments and so here we're

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670
and do experiments and so here we're
 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.490
and do experiments and so here we're
showing I'm showing some preliminary

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500
showing I'm showing some preliminary
 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.610
showing I'm showing some preliminary
data of looking at the different D amino

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620
data of looking at the different D amino
 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.740
data of looking at the different D amino
acids on tRNA lysine against the natural

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750
acids on tRNA lysine against the natural
 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.040
acids on tRNA lysine against the natural
lysine tRNA lysine and we're looking at

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050
lysine tRNA lysine and we're looking at
 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.170
lysine tRNA lysine and we're looking at
again dipeptide yield translations and

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
again dipeptide yield translations and
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.870
again dipeptide yield translations and
so here we're showing is that the lysine

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880
so here we're showing is that the lysine
 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.440
so here we're showing is that the lysine
tRNA lysine is going to 90 95 percent

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450
tRNA lysine is going to 90 95 percent
 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.540
tRNA lysine is going to 90 95 percent
and a half an hour a deal I saying

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.550
and a half an hour a deal I saying
 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.699
and a half an hour a deal I saying
Ontario icing is also going to almost 80

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709
Ontario icing is also going to almost 80
 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.100
Ontario icing is also going to almost 80
percent but as you move away from the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110
percent but as you move away from the
 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.350
percent but as you move away from the
deal icing on the tRNA lysine using

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360
deal icing on the tRNA lysine using
 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.420
deal icing on the tRNA lysine using
different G amino acids you're actually

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430
different G amino acids you're actually
 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.570
different G amino acids you're actually
showing that their yields are actually

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580
showing that their yields are actually
 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.640
showing that their yields are actually
changing which is different than what

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650
changing which is different than what
 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.990
changing which is different than what
we've found with the Mis isolated

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000
we've found with the Mis isolated
 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.910
we've found with the Mis isolated
natural is that the the ribosome really

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920
natural is that the the ribosome really
 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.860
natural is that the the ribosome really
isn't discriminating against these so

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870
isn't discriminating against these so
 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.060
isn't discriminating against these so
it's interesting to kind of move forward

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070
it's interesting to kind of move forward
 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.030
it's interesting to kind of move forward
and see where we're going to find where

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040
and see where we're going to find where
 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.470
and see where we're going to find where
these discrimination defects are

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480
these discrimination defects are
 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.530
these discrimination defects are
actually occurring in the ribosome and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540
actually occurring in the ribosome and
 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.180
actually occurring in the ribosome and
this is where my project is going to be

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190
this is where my project is going to be
 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.360
this is where my project is going to be
continuing from there on
