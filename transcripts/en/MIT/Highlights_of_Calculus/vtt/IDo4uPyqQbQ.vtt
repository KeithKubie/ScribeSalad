00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.170
GILBERT STRANG: OK, today is
about differential equations.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.730
That's where calculus
really is applied.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.490
And these will be equations
that describe growth.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.540
And the first you've
already seen.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.680
It's the most important and the
simplest. The growth rate

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.190
dy dt is proportional
to y itself.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.550
Let's call c that constant
that comes in there.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.560
And all these problems will
start from some known point y

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.890
at time 0 and evolve, grow,
to k, whatever they do.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.410
And this one we know
the solution to.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.410
We know that that will be an
exponential growth with a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.220
factor c, a growth rate c.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.990
Actually, we should know that
the solution has an e to the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.190
ct because when we take the
derivative of this, it will

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.550
bring down that factor
c that we want.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.820
And at t equals 0
this is correct.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.180
We get started correctly because
at t equals 0 we have

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.940
y of 0 is correctly given by
the known starting point.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.020
Because when t is 0, that's 1.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990
So that's the one we know.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.350
The most fundamental.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.830
Now, the next step.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.610
Still linear.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.280
That allows a source term.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.200
This might be money in the bank
growing with an interest

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.020
rate c per year.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.700
And the source term would be
additional money that you're

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.525
constantly putting in.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.220
Every time step in
goes that saving.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.920
Or if s were negative, of
course, it could be spending.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.800
For us, that's a linear
differential equation with a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.780
constant right-hand
side there.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.720
And we have to be able
to solve it.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.730
And we can.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.490
In fact, I can fit it into
the one we already now.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.070
Watch this.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.805
Let me take that to be
c times y plus s/c.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.490
Remember, s and c
are constants.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.060
And let me write that right-hand
side, dy dt.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.450
I can put this constant in there
too and still have the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.300
same derivative.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.600
So dy dt is exactly the same
as the derivative of y plus

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.190
s/c because that s/c is
constant; its derivative is 0.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.490
So that dy dt is the
same as before.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.520
But now look.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.530
We have this expression here
that's just like this one,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.100
only it's y plus s/c that's
growing at this growth rate c,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.040
starting from--

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.800
the start would be
y at 0 plus s/c.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.360
You see, this quantity in
parentheses, I'm grabbing that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.080
as the thing that grows
perfect exponentially.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:58.580
So I conclude that at a later
time its value is its initial

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.930
value times the growth.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.200
That is a rather quick
solution to this

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.210
differential equation.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.279
You might want me to put s/c
on the right-hand side and

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.130
have y of t by itself, and that
would be a formula for

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.260
the correct y of t that solves
this equation that

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.360
starts at y of 0.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.870
And of course, this one starts
at y of 0 plus s/c and that's

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.605
why we see y of 0 plus
s/c right there.

00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:44.990
Do you see that that equation,
well, it wasn't really

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.010
systematic.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.150
And in a differential equations
course you would

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.890
learn how to reach that
answer without

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.250
sort of noticing that--

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.080
actually, I should
do that too.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.985
This is such a useful,
important equation.

00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:10.520
It's linear, but it's got some
right-hand side there.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.320
I should give you a system,
say something about linear

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.990
equations before I go on.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.630
The most interesting equation
will be not linear, but let me

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.410
say a word about linear
equations of which that's a

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.290
perfect example with
a right-hand side.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.540
So linear equations.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.570
Linear equations.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.590
The solutions to linear
equations, y of t, is--

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.820
to all linear equations.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.280
Actually, this is a linear
differential equation.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.930
When I'm teaching linear algebra
I'm talking about

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.180
matrix equations.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.730
The rule, it's the linear part
that is important for these

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.190
few thoughts.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.200
The solution to linear
equations--

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.595
can I underline linear--

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.335
always has the form of some
particular solution.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:36.770
Some function that does solve
the equation plus another

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.270
solution with a right side 0.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.050
You will see what I
mean by those two

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.350
parts for this example.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:04.350
Can I copy again this example
dy dt is cy plus s.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.150
So I'm looking for a solution
to that equation.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.240
First, let me look for a
particular solution.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.730
That means just any function
that solves the equation.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.680
Well, the simplest function I
could think of would be a

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.001
constant function.

00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:26.210
And if my solution was a
constant, then its derivative

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.950
would be 0.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.620
So that would be 0.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.205
And then c times that constant
plus s would be 0.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.520
I want the equation
to be solved.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.990
I claim that a particular
solution is the constant y--

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.445
so when I set that momentarily
to 0, I'll discover I'll move

00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:50.640
the s over as minus s.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.550
I'll divide by the c and
I'll have a minus s/c.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.750
That's a particular solution.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.180
Let's just plug it in.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.300
If I put in y.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.340
That's a constant, so it's
derivative is 0.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.410
And c times that gives me
minus s plus s is the 0.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.660
OK.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.060
That's a particular solution.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.500
And then what I mean
by right side 0.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.160
What do I mean by that?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.490
I'm not going to wipe out all
this, I'm going to wipe out--

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:33.679
for this right side 0 part,
I'm going to wipe out the

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.679
source term.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.860
I mean, I keep the y's, but
throw away the source in the

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.760
right side 0.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.180
Maybe a book might often write
the homogeneous equation.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.270
And the homogeneous equation
is where we started,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.645
dy dt equals cy.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.040
What's the solution to that?

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.330
The solution to dy dt is cy.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.460
This is this solution,
e to the ct.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:18.210
Any a, any a times e to the ct
will solve my simple equation.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:23.490
Once I've knocked out this
s, then if y solves it, a

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.850
times y solves it.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.080
I could multiply the
equation by a.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.700
So a is arbitrary, any number.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.270
But of course, I'm going to
find out what it is by

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.260
starting at the right place.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.370
By starting at y of 0,
I'll find out what--

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.130
by setting t equals 0.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.560
So put t equals 0.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:54.390
To find a, put t equals 0.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.350
Because we know where
we started.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:04.760
So we started at a known y of
0 equals minus s/c plus A.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.110
Setting t equals
0 makes that 1.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.100
You see we found
out what A is.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.920
A is y of 0 plus s/c.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:21.280
And that's the thing that
grows, that multiplies

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.690
the e to the ct.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.620
And of course, it
did it up here.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.320
Up here what multiplied the e to
the ct was this y of 0 plus

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:40.690
s/c, which is exactly our A.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:45.400
As I said, my main point in this
lecture is to bring in a

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.330
nonlinear equation.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.540
That's quite interesting
and important.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.780
And it comes in population
growth, ecology, it appears a

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.570
lot of places and I'll write
it down immediately.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.630
But just the starting point
is always linear.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.870
And here we've got the basic
linear equation and now the

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:16.510
basic linear equation
with a source term.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.580
Ready for the population
equation.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.220
Population growth.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.980
Population P of t.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.620
OK, what's a reasonable
differential equation that

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.390
describes the growth
of population?

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.950
All right, so I'm interested
in, what is a model?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.140
So this is actually where
mathematics is applied.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.070
And many people will
have models.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.290
And people who have a census
can check those models and

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.730
see, well, what are
the constants?

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.880
Does a good choice of constant
make this model realistic over

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.780
the last hundred years?

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.780
Lots to do.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.900
Fantastic projects
in this area.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.550
If you're looking for a project,
google "population

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.760
growth." See what they say.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.950
Several sites will say--

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.610
Wikipedia, I did it
this morning.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.710
I looked at Wikipedia.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.750
I'll tell you some things
later about Wikipedia.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.750
And also, the Census Bureau has
a site and they all know

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.760
the population now
pretty closely.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.470
Everybody would like
to know what it's

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.170
going to be in 50 years.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.860
And to get 50 years out,
you have to have some

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.600
mathematical model.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.610
And I'm going to pick this
differential equation.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.860
There's going to be a growth.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.670
That c would be sort
of birth rate.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.890
Well, I guess birth rate
minus death rate.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.140
So that would be the
growth rate.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.060
And if we only had that term
the population would grow

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.530
exponentially forever.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.910
There's going to be another
term because that's not

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.540
realistic for the population
just to keep growing.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:27.680
As the earth fills up, there's
some maybe competition term.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.330
Some slowdown term.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.820
So it's going to have
a minus sign.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.990
And maybe s for a slow
down factor.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.630
And I'm going to
take P squared.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.850
That reflects sort of population
interacting with

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.390
population.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.890
There are many problems. This
is also a model for problems

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.420
in chemistry and biology,
mass action it would

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.930
be called in chemistry.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.570
Where I would have two different
materials, two

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.170
different substances, two
different chemicals.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.420
And the interaction between the
two would be proportional

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.670
to the amount of one and also
proportional to the

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.730
amount of the other.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.280
So it'll be proportional
to the product.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.630
One concentration
times the other.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.230
Well, there I would have to have
two equations for the two

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.530
concentrations.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:29.680
Here I'm taking a more basic
problem where I just have one

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.980
unknown, the population P,
and one equation for it.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.860
And it's P times P. It's the
number of people meeting other

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.840
people and crowding.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.130
So s is a very small number.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.255
Very small, like one over
a billion or something.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.960
Now, I want you to solve
that equation.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.250
Or I want us to solve it.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.510
And we don't right now
have great tools

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.860
for nonlinear equations.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.390
We have more calculus to learn,
but this one will give

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.210
in if we do it right.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.370
And let me show you what the
solution looks like because

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.730
you don't want to miss that.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.010
We'll get into the formula.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.790
We'll make it as nice
as possible, but

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.600
the graph is great.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.280
So the population.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.950
Well, notice, what would happen
if the population

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.810
starts out at 0?

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.650
Nobody's around.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.590
Then the derivative is 0.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.270
It never leaves 0.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.460
So this 0 would be a solution.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.920
P equals 0 constant solution.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.090
Not interesting.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.420
There's another case, important
case, when the

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.010
derivative is 0.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.640
Suppose the derivative is 0.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.770
That means we're going to look
for a particular very special

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.690
solution that doesn't move.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:11.080
So if that derivative is 0,
then cP equals sP squared.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.220
Can I do this in the corner?

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.720
If cP equals sP squared.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:23.680
And if I cancel a P, I get
P is equal to c/s.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.660
So there's some solution.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.340
Can I call it that c/s?

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.220
Well, everybody would like to
know exactly what those

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.190
numbers are.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.860
It's maybe about 10
billion people.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.840
So what I'm saying is
if I got up to--

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.650
not me.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:49.120
If the world got up to 10
billion, then at that point,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.490
the growth and the competition
would knock each other out,

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.310
would cancel each other.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.540
There wouldn't be any
further change.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.780
So that's a kind of point
that we won't go past.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.650
But now, let me draw the real
solution because the real

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.940
solution starts with--

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.430
who knows?

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.319
Two people, Adam and Eve.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.910
100 people, whatever.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.880
Whenever we start counting.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.500
This is time.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.609
You know, that's the time
that we're starting.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:21.859
We could start today.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:30.640
This is time starting at some
point where we know something.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.270
Well, we have pretty good
numbers back for

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.350
some hundreds of years.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:37.590
So probably it wouldn't
be today we'd start.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.575
But wherever we start, we
follow that equation.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.020
Let me just draw the graph.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.760
It grows.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.510
It grows and then at a certain
point, and it turns out to be

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.670
the halfway point, c over 2s.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.510
It's beautiful calculus.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.540
It turns out that that's
a point of inflection.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.340
It's not only growing, it's
growing faster and faster up

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.420
to this time.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.740
I don't know when that is, but
that's a very critical moment

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.350
in the history of the world.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.400
I think we may be a little
passed it actually.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.050
And after that point,
the whole thing

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.455
is just like symmetric.

00:18:24.455 --> 00:18:26.530
It's an s-shaped.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:34.090
It goes up and now slows down
and gets closer and closer to

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.960
this c/s steady state.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.010
I would call c/s
a steady state.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.930
If it gets there it stays
there steadily.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.010
It won't quite get there.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.340
This would be the s curve.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.440
And if I went back in time, it
would be going back, back,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.000
back to nearly 0.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.580
Probably to 2.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.210
And up here, but not
quite there.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:04.700
That's the population curve that
comes from this model.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.510
I can't say that's the
population curve that's going

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:14.080
to happen in the next thousand
years because the model is a

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.840
good start.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.500
But of course, you could add in
more terms for epidemics,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.760
for wars, for migration.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:31.140
All sorts of things
affect the model.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.920
OK, now the math.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.940
The math says solve
the equation.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.790
OK, how am I going to do that?

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.580
Well, there are different
ways, but here's

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.250
a rather neat way.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:49.390
It turns out that if I try y.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:57.890
Let me introduce y as 1/P, then
the equation for y is

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.140
going to come out terrific.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.190
This is a trick that works
for this equation.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.520
Nonlinear equations, it's
OK to have a few tricks.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.500
All right, so this is
y of t is 1/P of t.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.060
So of course the graph of y
will be different and the

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.030
equation for y will
be different.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.590
Let me say what that equation
looks like.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.810
OK, so I want to know,
what's dy dt?

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.010
I know how to take
the derivative.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.590
We get to use calculus.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.220
This is P to the minus 1.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:43.500
So the derivative of P to
the minus 1 is minus 1.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.905
P to the minus 2 times dP dt.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.680
That's the chain rule.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.160
P to the minus 1, the derivative
is minus 1, p to

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.060
the minus 2, and the derivative
of P itself.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.800
And now I know dP dt.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.180
Now I'm going to use
my equation.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:11.170
So that's cP minus sP squared
with a minus.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.950
Oh, I can't lose that minus.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.920
Put it there.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.600
Keep your eye on that minus.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.185
Divided by P squared.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.470
So now I'll use the minus.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.170
That looks like an s to me.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.730
Minus minus is plus s.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.170
And what do I have here?

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.340
Minus cP over P squared.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:42.580
I think I have minus c/P.
And you say OK, true.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.790
But what good is that?

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.890
But look, that 1/P is our y.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:55.470
So now I have s minus cy.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:01.550
The equation for y, the dy dt
equation turns out to be

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:07.710
linear with a source term
s just as in the

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.180
start of the lecture.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:18.790
And the growth rate term has
a minus c, which we expect.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:24.450
Because our y is now 1 over.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.020
When this growth is going up
exponentially, 1 over it is

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.630
going down exponentially.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.280
And it turns out that same c.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.280
In other words, we can
solve this equation.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.960
In fact, we have solved this
equation just for--

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.370
shall I write down the answer?

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.490
So the answer for y.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:54.240
You remember the answer
for y is--

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.820
I'm going to look over here.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.400
Up there.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.130
This is our equation, the only
difference is c is coming in

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:03.970
with a minus sign.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.730
So I'm just going to write
that same solution,

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.110
just copy that here.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.280
y of t.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.920
Now c is coming in with
a minus sign, is

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.940
y of 0 minus s/c.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.950
c has that minus sign.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.050
e to the minus ct.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.300
OK, good.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.810
That's the solution for y.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.060
So we solved the equation.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.160
You could say, well, you solved
the equation for y.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.890
But now P is just 1/y.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:54.130
Or y is 1/P. So I just go back
now and change from y back to

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:59.070
P. 1 over P of t is--

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.730
here I have 1 over P of 0.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.950
Is it OK if I leave the
solution in that form?

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:15.120
I can solve for P of t and get
it all-- you get P of t equals

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.140
and a whole lot of stuff
on the right side.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.830
I move this over.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.850
I have to flip it upside down.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.040
It doesn't look as nice.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.390
Well, I guess I could.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.550
I could move that over
and then just put

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.100
to the minus 1 power.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.290
That would do it.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.270
And that is the solution.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.590
Maybe I should do that.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.250
P of t is--

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.410
I'm going to move this over.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:46.900
So this same parenthesis times
e to the ct plus s/c.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.600
I moved that over.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.400
And then I say I have
to flip it.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.210
So it's 1 over that.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:59.290
1 over all that stuff, where
this is just this

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.240
stuff copied again.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.450
So we get an expression but
to me, that top one

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.460
looks pretty nice.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.140
And graphing it is no problem.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.460
And that's what the
graph looks like.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.520
It's that famous s curve.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.960
What we've solved here was the
population equation and it's

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.265
often called the logistic
equation.

00:25:34.155 --> 00:25:37.790
I mention that word because you
could see it there as the

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.270
heading for this particular
model.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:50.290
So let me let you leave open
everything we've done today.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:56.890
But maybe I can say the most
interesting aspect is the

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.140
model itself.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.820
To what extent is it accurate?

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.080
We could try it.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.480
We could estimate c and s,
those numbers, to fit the

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.980
model of what we know over
one time period.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.140
And then we could see,
does it extend over

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.760
another time period?

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.550
I was going to say
about Wikipedia.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.360
And generally, Wikipedia
is not too bad.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.775
They made one goof, which
I thought was awful.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.950
The question was, what's
the growth rate?

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.350
Actually, Wikipedia
doesn't discuss

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.810
this particular equation.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:43.260
It tells you a lot of other
things about population.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.600
Of course, they talk about the
growth rate and at one point

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.580
they say at one time,
it was 1.8%.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.920
I say 1.8% is not
a growth rate.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.040
Growth rate, c, don't have--

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.570
they're not percentages.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.380
Their units are 1 over time.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.370
And maybe I could make that
point, emphasize that point.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:13.940
When I see ct together, that
tells me that has the

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.930
dimension of time, of course.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:20.010
So c must have the dimensions
of 1 over time.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:25.410
The growth rate is
1.8% per year.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.360
And I will admit that three
lines later on Wikipedia, when

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.330
they're referring to an earlier
growth rate earlier in

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:42.700
the last century, they
do say 2.2% per year.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.270
They get it right.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:48.570
The units are 1 over time.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:53.680
The solution is telling us
that and the equation is

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.380
telling us that.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.400
This has the dimensions of
population, number of people.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.720
So does this.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.430
I'm dividing by a time.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.790
So c must be the source of
that division by a time.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.050
The units of c must
be 1 over time.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:15.850
You might like to figure out the
units of s because in an

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.840
equation, everything has to have
the same units, the same

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.260
dimension to make any
sense at all.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.860
So with that little comment,
let me emphasize

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.740
the interest in just--

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:37.460
if you have a project to do,
this could be a quite

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.960
remarkable one.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.870
Now just I'll write down,
but not solve--

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.720
since I have a little space
and mathematicians tend to

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.140
fill space--

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.150
I'll write down one
more equation.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.930
Actually, it will be two
equations because it's a

00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:00.150
predator and a prey.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.850
A hunter and a hunted.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:10.150
And in ecology, or modeling,
whatever.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.080
Foxes and rabbits, maybe.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.220
We might have these equations,
the predator

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.520
and the prey equation.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.070
And what would that look like?

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.510
So we have two unknowns.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.360
The predator.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.810
Can I call that u?

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.060
So I have a du dt.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.080
What's the growth of the
predators, the number or the

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.890
population?

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.300
These are both populations, but
of two different species.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:45.170
And the prey will be
v. So u is the

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.515
population of the predator.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.270
If the predator has nothing
to eat, the populations of

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.840
predator is going to drop.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.650
But the more prey
that's around--

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.150
so here we'll have a u times
v going positive.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:12.280
So we'll have something like a
minus cu as a term that if

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.360
there's nothing to eat, if
that's all there is, if the

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.660
prey is all gone, the predator
will die out.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.570
But when there is a predator,
there will be a source term

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:31.540
proportional to u and v. The
more predators there are,

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.460
they're all eating away.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.010
And the more prey there is
the more they're eating.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.800
And now what about dv dt?

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.910
OK, v is a totally different
position.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:48.470
I guess it's getting eaten.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:53.930
So this term, well, I'm
not sure what all the

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.490
constants are here.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.550
The prey, this is now the prey,
the little rabbits.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.470
They're just eating grass.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.620
Plenty of grass around.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.110
So they're reproducing.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:14.480
So they have some positive
growth rate, capital C.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.540
Multiple per year.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:24.410
But then they will have a
negative term as we saw in

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:29.230
population coming from the
competition with a predator.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:34.860
So this would be a model, a
predator-prey model that also

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.950
shows up in many applications
of mathematics.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:44.510
So there you see two linear
differential equations.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.310
The simple one dy
dt we'll see y.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.080
We totally know how
to solve that.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.460
Now with a source term s,
we're OK, and we got the

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.900
solution there and we found
it a second way.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:06.040
Then thirdly was the main
interest, the population

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.520
equation, the logistic equation
with a P squared,

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:15.130
which we were able to solve
and graph the solution.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.810
That s curve is just
fantastic.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:22.980
If you want a challenge,
check that this--

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.420
so what do I mean at that
inflection point?

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.960
What's happening there?

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:35.260
I claim that at this value of P,
the curve stops bending up,

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.710
starts bending down,
which means second

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:45.710
derivative of P is 0.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.110
You could check that.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:52.280
Take the equation, take its
derivative to get the second

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.830
derivative.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.040
Then that'll involve
dP dts over here.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.640
But then you know dP dt,
so plug that in.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.810
And then finally, you'll
get down to P's.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:05.670
And I think you'll find that the
thing cancels itself out.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.200
The second derivative, the
bending in the s curve, is 0

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.790
at c over 2s.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.170
So that's the moment
of fastest growth.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:22.780
And maybe that happened
relatively recently.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.430
And we're slowing down, but
we've got a long way to go.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.380
So roughly, I think the
population now is

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.630
just under 7 billion.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.270
And oh boy, if we just left--

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:39.850
if it was 7 billion at that
point, it would be 14 billion

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.480
at the end.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.350
I think we're a better further
along now at 7 billion.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.840
7 billion's somewhere
about here.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.880
So maybe the end with this model
is more like 10 or 11

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:58.700
billion as the population of the
earth at t equal infinity.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.820
OK, that's a mathematical
model.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.580
