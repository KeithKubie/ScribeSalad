this ends well for us in society one of

this ends well for us in society one of

this ends well for us in society one of
the things that we ought to be thinking

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910
the things that we ought to be thinking
 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.620
the things that we ought to be thinking
about like I suppose any good book does

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630
about like I suppose any good book does
 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.360
about like I suppose any good book does
is think of things in a two-by-two

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
is think of things in a two-by-two
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.949
is think of things in a two-by-two
matrix right that simplifies everything

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959
matrix right that simplifies everything
 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.810
matrix right that simplifies everything
in our lives and so if we we do that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820
in our lives and so if we we do that
 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.830
in our lives and so if we we do that
then we're fine really

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840
then we're fine really
 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.990
then we're fine really
but in my case I'm suggesting that

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000
but in my case I'm suggesting that
 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.240
but in my case I'm suggesting that
there's there's a Y in an x axis and

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
there's there's a Y in an x axis and
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.729
there's there's a Y in an x axis and
we're only on the x axis the x axis is

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739
we're only on the x axis the x axis is

action so we seem to be stuck in the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500
action so we seem to be stuck in the

bottom right-hand quadrant if you're

bottom right-hand quadrant if you're
 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.420
bottom right-hand quadrant if you're
kind of following a two-by-two matrix so

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430
kind of following a two-by-two matrix so
 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.520
kind of following a two-by-two matrix so
we're down here and that's where action

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530
we're down here and that's where action
 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.860
we're down here and that's where action
is and we just sort of live in that

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870
is and we just sort of live in that
 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.170

I'm not suggesting that we don't take

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120
I'm not suggesting that we don't take
 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.420
I'm not suggesting that we don't take
action obviously we need to we need to

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430
action obviously we need to we need to

we've got tasks etc but if we do insert

we've got tasks etc but if we do insert

we've got tasks etc but if we do insert
more reflection time into our day that

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680
more reflection time into our day that
 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.860
more reflection time into our day that
action becomes that much more prosperous

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870
action becomes that much more prosperous
 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.920
action becomes that much more prosperous
and profitable and positive but when we

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930
and profitable and positive but when we
 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.230
and profitable and positive but when we
don't we just sit there doing all the

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
don't we just sit there doing all the
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.780
don't we just sit there doing all the
time then what ultimately ends up is

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790

absenteeism less productivity ironically
 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.110
absenteeism less productivity ironically
and we end up being more stressed
