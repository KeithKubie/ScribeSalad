00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.240
What is PageSpeed Service and how does it
work?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.200
Web pages today contain a lot more than HTML.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.499
They combine stylesheets, images, videos,
Javascript files and other components to give

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.250
the rich interactive experience we now expect
on the web.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.519
This means however that to display a web page,
a browser has to make several HTTP requests,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.220
as many as 43 requests for the average web
page, to fetch all these resources from the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.480
server hosting your site.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.610
Many such network requests to fetch files
one after another increases wait time and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.670
slows down the page.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.380
Slow web pages can make visitors to your site
less engaged and even frustrated, leading

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.420
to lower conversion and lost revenue.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.300
Google PageSpeed Service is an online service
you can use to automatically speed up your

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.300
website.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.170
It rewrites web pages dynamically to apply
several performance-improving practices, and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.950
then serves the optimized pages via Google
servers to reduce page load time.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.870
When you first setup PageSpeed Service for
your site, you’ll be guided to change its

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.400
DNS entry so that your domain name points
to PageSpeed servers.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.330
Once completed, PageSpeed servers will serve
your web pages and intelligently cache their

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.190
resources to serve them to users faster.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.070
They’ll also fetch newer content from your
original host server so that the latest version

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.670
of your website is always served to users.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.800
PageSpeed servers are located in Google operated
datacenters distributed around the world.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.630
So your site will benefit from the speed,
efficiency and security of the same infrastructure

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.260
that powers all of Google.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.520
PageSpeed rewriters use a combination of techniques
to optimize web pages.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.030
One of them is to reduce the number and size
of the resources to be fetched.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.240
PageSpeed Service rewrites web pages to merge
and compress Javascript, stylesheet and image

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.860
files, and to parallelize the download of
these files wherever possible.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.440
This means fewer HTTP requests and lower round-trip
times, so your web page gets delivered to

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.790
the browser faster.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.960
Another technique is to reduce the perceived
page load time.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.730
This is the minimum time that users have to
wait before they can view the page.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.160
The typical web page today is long and has
many visual elements.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.519
But only a small portion of the page is initially
visible in the browser once the page has loaded.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.069
PageSpeed Service can rewrite a web page so
that the parts of the page that users expect

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.790
to see first get downloaded first.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.099
This means users can engage with your site
right away, without having to wait for the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.120
full page to load.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.230
The rewriters can also cache parts of the
page that don’t change frequently so they

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.409
get delivered to the browser quickly on future
visits to your site.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.859
This combination of advanced rewriter technology
and global serving infrastructure can dramatically

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.010
reduce the load time of your web pages, often
by as much as 40%.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.040
Faster web pages improve the experience of
visitors to your site and so can increase

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.180
both traffic and customer conversion.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.309
So get started with PageSpeed Service today
and discover how fast your websites can be!
