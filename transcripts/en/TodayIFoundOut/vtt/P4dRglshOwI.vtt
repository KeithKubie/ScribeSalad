00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.300
For anyone watching this who happens to be
from the UK, you’re more than likely already

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.880
well aware of what a Jaffa Cake is.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
For our readers that haven’t had the pleasure
of sampling one of the greatest comfort foods

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.080
ever created, they’re little, spongy, chocolate
coated disks that contain a small amount of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.860
orange flavoured jam- they’re delicious.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.980
Oh, and they were also once at the centre
of one of the fiercest court battles of the

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.800
1990s, with the lengthy and expensive case
determining one, and only one, thing- whether

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.470
or not the Jaffa Cake is a cake or a biscuit.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.470
Yep…

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.470
Before getting to that, for the sake of those
unfamiliar, we first have to discuss the thrilling

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.250
and exciting to read about world of European
Tax Law and Value-Added Tax.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.729
In a nutshell, Value-Added Tax (commonly shortened
to VAT) is described as being a: “A type

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:09.000
of consumption tax that is placed on a product
whenever value is added at a stage of production

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.620
and at final sale.”

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.570
In essence, VAT is a tax that is paid by everyone
involved with the manufacture of a given object

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.689
or foodstuff and the consumer.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.409
For example, if a company in the UK wanted
to make socks, they’d be charged VAT on

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.920
the price of the raw materials used to make
them.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.670
When that company sold the socks onto a retailer,
the retailer would similarly be charged VAT

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.890
on that sale.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.780
Finally, when the retailer sells the socks
to a consumer, the consumer will pay VAT on

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.600
top of the price charged by the retailer.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.049
At the time of the publishing of this article,
the VAT rate in the UK is 20% for, to quote

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.990
the official website of the British Government,
“most goods and services“.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.260
Because the government isn’t a cartoonishly
evil entity run by men in suits gleefully

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.329
rubbing their hands together at the thought
of charging people through the nose for everyday

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.119
essentials (are are they!?!?! ;-)), a number
of things are subjected to a reduced rate

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.780
of VAT (currently 5%) while some are exempt
from the tax altogether.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.580
Goods and services subjected to the reduced
rate of VAT include things like mobility aids

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.690
(like walking canes and those awesome scooters)
and sanitary products (think tampons, panty

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.750
liners and other things that make certain
men wary of looking in a woman’s purse).

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.380
As for things that are exempt from the tax
entirely, that is mostly limited to goods

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.530
and services that are considered essential
or otherwise unfair to try and tax citizens

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.680
for using, things like stamps, burials and
end of life care, and most food.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.030
In regards to that last item, while most food,
and by extension animal feed, is exempt from

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.510
VAT, certain so-called “luxury items”
are taxed at the normal rate.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.510
Such luxury items include alcohol, mineral
water, confectioneries and, rather unusually,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.470
biscuits that are covered with chocolate (regular
biscuits are exempt).

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.650
This led to an embittered court battle between
the British Government and McVities in 1991

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.640
when British Customs and Excise decided that
Jaffa Cakes should be reclassified as chocolate

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.590
covered biscuits and hence be liable to the
standard rate of VAT.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.030
Jaffa Cakes had previously been considered
to be cakes by Customs and Excise, something

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.129
that is exempt from the tax.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.569
As such, one of the largest manufacturers
of Jaffa Cakes, McVities, challenged this

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.040
decision and took it all the way to the highest
court in the land.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.829
According to the official website for Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the decision

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:36.090
of the courts hinged on being able to clarify
exactly what made a cake a cake and a biscuit

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.189
a biscuit, and arguing whether or not Jaffa
Cakes conformed more to one definition or

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.189
the other.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.969
Towards this end, the main arguments on behalf
of Customs and Excise were that Jaffa Cakes

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.430
are usually sold along side biscuits, are
roughly biscuit shaped and often consumed

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.730
in place of them- adding that McVities themselves
markets the product more like a biscuit than

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.730
a cake.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.860
McVities countered by stating that Jaffa Cakes
were produced in a manner almost identical

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.560
to that of a traditional sponge cake and they
contained the same base ingredients (flour,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.620
eggs and sugar).

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.780
McVities’ trump card, however, was pointing
out that cakes and biscuits go stale in almost

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.150
opposite ways, with cakes turning hard as
they stale and biscuits turning soft.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.340
To illustrate this point, McVities left a
bunch of Jaffa Cakes out in the open and later

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.050
presented them to the court, proving that,
like cakes, they hardened as they went stale.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.220
According to the BBC, to really seal the deal,
McVities baked a gigantic, 12-inch version

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.000
of the Jaffa Cake and brought it to court
to show off how similar it is to a cake when

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.430
blown up to normal cake-sized.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.370
For anyone wondering why the courts didn’t
just take into account the fact that they’re

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.260
called Jaffa Cakes, the judge presiding over
the case, Mr D.C Potter, was asked to consider

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.380
this and ruled it to be of “no serious relevance”
because a product’s name often has little

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.570
to do with its actual function.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.590
In the end, the court decided the Jaffa Cake
was, in fact, a cake, and McVities was allowed

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:32.330
to continue selling the product without being
subject 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:06:27.750
to VAT.
