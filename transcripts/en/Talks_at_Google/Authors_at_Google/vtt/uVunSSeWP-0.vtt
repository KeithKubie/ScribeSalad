00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.060
&gt;&gt;Chris Gethard: My name's Chris Gethard and
these are my friends

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.180
from the Chris Gethard show, which we'll explain
a little later.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.290
[Chuckles]
We'll specifically explain this guy, making

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.540
his way up to the stage, a little bit later,
I just wanted to say [laughter] first of all

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.740
thank you for having us here today.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.369
I also wanted to say thank you for having
us as part of the Authors at Google New York

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.939
program,
and apparently we're very popular at your

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.189
Ann Arbor office who is watching right now.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.189
[Cheering]
Why?

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.189
What's?

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.269
&gt;&gt;female #1: I am just cheering for Michigan.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.430
&gt;&gt;Chris Gethard: Oh, you went to Michigan,
so you're cheering the concept of Ann Arbor,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.579
not the fact that they're--.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.230
We're apparently streaming to their office
right now,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.640
so whoever is responsible for all the enthusiasm
coming out of the Midwest,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.640
thank you so much.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.170
I'm quite surprised by it, and I have no idea
how it happens.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.230
I think it's sort of ludicrous that I'm here.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.910
I'm not note, I'm not a very impressive man,
or notable person.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.940
It is my birthday today.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.140
It is my birthday so that feels good.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.309
[Cheering]
Thank you.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.590
I turned thirty-two this morning, and if you
told me that, um, when I was a kid

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.950
that I would one day be talking to Google,
I'd be very surprised.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.000
Because "a", Google did not exist then.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.240
[laughter]
and also I am sort of a not that smart, semi-border

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.009
line white trash Irish Catholic guy from New
Jersey.

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.890
So,it feels like a victory to be here.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.360
Just to explain, I'm a comedian,
I've been working at a place called the Upright

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.409
Citizens Brigade Theater here in New York
for twelve years, and I'm the author of a

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.540
book that came out this year,
and I'm also the host of a public access TV

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.049
show that gets, like it's a buzzed about thing
right?

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.810
It's sort of like a cult thing in the comedy
world.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.950
My book is called "A Bad Idea I'm About to
Do".

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.200
And when I was thinking about things I could
do here,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.000
I was thinking I could just come and sort
of like read stuff from the book or whatever,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.729
but that didn't seem that fun to me.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.820
I'd rather kind of merge the idea of the book,
the title, "A Bad Idea I'm About to Do" with

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.689
the vibe of the show we do, on public access
TV

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.119
It also streams on the Internet and we do
podcasts and all that good stuff.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.150
But I wanted to maybe talk today about, the
premise of the book is about

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.010
it kind of I continuously throughout my entire
life have entered situations knowing

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.410
that it's not a smart way to behave and knowing
that I'm about to do something that is

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.940
definitely a bad idea, and then I opt to do
it anyway.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.120
[laughter]
And that's become a sort of defining quality

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.190
in my life, and some of that's rooted
in clear cut mental and emotional issues,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.091
but some of that is just because I enjoy it.

00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:32.209
I think that bad ideas are some of the most
productive ones and I would

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.710
actually argue that everything I've done that
anyone has ever enjoyed,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.920
someone told me it was a really bad idea first.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.030
So I wanted to talk about that and to kind
of put my money where my mouth is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.250
I wanted to invite some people from the Chris
Gethard show so

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.720
this is my friend Shannon O'Neal

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.830
&gt;&gt;Shannon O'Neill: Hello.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.830
[Applause] Hi!

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.190
I want you all to know I let my sleep cycle
style my hair.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.320
&gt;&gt;Chris: You did?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
So that's bed head?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
&gt;&gt;Shannon: This is bed head.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.320
&gt;&gt;Chris: You have bed head.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.599
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I woke up at eight A.M. and I didn't
do anything about it.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.180
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, and also, and before we can
get into any of that, my friend Bethany Hall

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.180
is here.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.180
Thank you for being here Bethany.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.180
[applause]

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Hi.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.340
&gt;&gt;Chris: And Bethany and Shannon, would you
agree with that while everyone at Google is

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.150
very nice,
this office and environment is somewhat terrifying

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.610
to people who don't come here every day?

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.610
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Absolutely.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.370
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Feels like my brain was stolen
as soon as I walked in.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.370
[Laughter]

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.370
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.370
Yeah.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.370
Everyone, we were told six different times
today that everyone we'll meet

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.200
today is a Type A personality, and I was too
scared to say that I'm not sure what that

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200
means.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200
[laughter]

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.570
&gt;&gt;Bethany: I keep feeling like I'm going to
do something wrong and we're secretly being

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.750
monitored,
so I'm like can I really take this water.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.750
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.750
We're outwardly being monitored.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.750
&gt;&gt;Shannon: See, there are cameras recording
this.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.750
&gt;&gt;Chris: There's cameras outward monitoring

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.750
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Wee,
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, here's what's going to happen.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.730
I'm going to give a talk about this idea
of bad ideas and why I think a lot of times

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.799
they actually are very productive,
to go through on bad ideas to follow your

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.019
gut instinct even when you know something's
probably not productive.

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.400
And to sort of is
somehow make today a bad idea.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.629
What I've invited Shannon to do is Shannon
has a number of tools and implements that

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.560
are going to
be a physically not pleasant for me to experience.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.810
She's got a small whiffle ball bat that we
often use on our show to hit

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.519
each other, and she's got a vuvuzela that
can be very loud and in can be in my ear at

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.519
any time.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.519
&gt;&gt;Shannon: [blows air]

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.020
&gt;&gt;Chris: you've got to play that like a trumpet.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.620
&gt;&gt;Shannon: [blows air] I don't know how to
do it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.620
&gt;&gt;Chris: No no no.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.620
Do you know how to do it?

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.610
Like this, [blows vuvuzela] Do you know how
to do that?

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.170
&gt;&gt; Shannon: Do I have put my hand like this?

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.770
&gt;&gt;Chris: We should have clearly practiced
first..

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.880
[Shannon honks vuvuzela weakly]

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh God, this is already horrible,
horrible,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.630
[laughter]
[Shannon blows vuvuzela]

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.630
&gt;&gt;Chris: Like that.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.630
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I just have to put my lips in make
out form.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.830
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yes, yes like a trumpet.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.833
We've also got an, she's got a device it also
involved

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:37.160
that will electrocute me which we don't need
to demonstrate before it's done.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.650
But this is a small low level Taser.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.870
&gt;&gt; Shannon: You don't want me to demonstrate
it?

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.870
&gt;&gt;Chris: Not right now.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.870
No no no no.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.970
We'll get to it later please.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.970
[Laughter]

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.670
&gt;&gt;Chris: So as you can see, what's going to
happen is I'm going to be giving my talk

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.140
and Shannon's going to be tormenting me the
entire time.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.250
That's definitely a bad idea,
but in the style that I know and my way that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.160
I think bad ideas are good ideas,
what I hope is that it will make things more

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.850
entertaining, and engaging, and watchable,
to know that it is not just some guy rambling

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.180
on for forty five minutes.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.290
It will also involve torture, and physical
pain,

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.240
and all the other stuff that I think is funny.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.450
&gt;&gt; Shannon: You have to look straight ahead.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.450
You keep looking towards me.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.450
&gt;&gt;Chris: I know.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.450
I'm so nervous.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.640
And Bethany has a conscience, that's why Bethany
was invited today.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.090
Bethany is a very sweet, nice person and my
hope is she'll calm Shannon down things go

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.090
too far.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.940
Although, what are both of your opinions on
that?

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.020
&gt;&gt;Shannon: It's not going to happen.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.020
&gt;&gt;Bethany: It won't.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.020
I'll try.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.820
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, Try your hardest Bethany to
keep me safe when Shannon goes crazy.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.030
And this odd gentlemen right here, is a character
from our show known only as the Human Fish.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.970
Our understanding is that he's a half man
half fish creature who recently emerged from

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.090
the sea
[laughter]

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.960
I invited him primarily because it is hilarious
to me that I'm explaining this at Google Headquarters.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.280
[laughter]
That's hilarious that I just got to say this.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.240
So the human fish, he hasn't completely mastered
English yet,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.630
But he does have these internal battles where
he figures out the world.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.130
Likely any given time,
You can say "Human Fish, what on your mind?",

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.330
and he'll tell you what he's internally struggling
with right now.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.520
So, he Human Fish what's on your mind?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.640
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Ann Arbor versus Anne Bancroft.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.190
&gt;&gt;Chris: Ann Arbor versus Anne Bancroft, who
wins that battle?

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.190
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Anne Bancroft.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.190
&gt;&gt;Chris: Anne Bancroft?!?!

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.190
&gt;&gt;Shannon and Bethany in unison: Ohhhh!

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: I want to apologize to everybody
watching in Ann Arbor.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.940
Personally, I disagree, but the Human Fish
is apparently a huge Anne Bancroft fan.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.070
Then you can also ask him specific things,
like you could say,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.370
"Human Fish, Google vs. Facebook.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.370
Who wins?"

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.370
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Google.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.370
&gt;&gt; Chris: Google.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.370
Thank God you said that!

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.430
Thank God you said that!
[laughter]

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.370
Because it would've been very awkward if you
gone in the other direction.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.400
So I do encourage everybody in here at any
given point feel free to interrupt us,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.460
if you just want to know what's on the Human
Fish's mind, he'll tell you,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.130
or if you have a specific question.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.970
I don't know if anyone wants to yell anything
out

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.440
but please feel free to interrupt literally
at any given point.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.940
It will be the most enjoyable portion of the
afternoon, I believe.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.930
You can always ask, Human Fish, what's on
your mind now?

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.420
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Trampolines versus Lady and
The Tramp.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.420
[laughter]

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.780
&gt;&gt;Chris: Trampolines versus Lady and The Tramp.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.410
This a tough one, those are both enjoyable
things.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.410
who wins?

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.560
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Lady and The Tramp.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.842
&gt;&gt;Chris: Lady and the Tramp wins, okay.

00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:17.300
&gt;&gt;Shannon and Bethany, together: We have a
question in the front row.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.210
&gt;&gt;female #2: Do you have to like, is it a
versus thing, one versus the other?

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.280
&gt;&gt;Chris: Primarily yeah.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.770
But thank you for getting the--

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.770
&gt;&gt;female #2: the rules of it.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.900
&gt;&gt;Chris:Yeah, getting the rules of it right.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.900
But you can--.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.900
I mean we can phrase pretty much.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.370
Did you have something
specific?

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.510
&gt;&gt;female #2: Well it was not a versus

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.510
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, that's fair.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.510
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Let's try it though.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.510
&gt;&gt;Bethany: What is it?

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.510
&gt;&gt;Chris: We can try it.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.510
&gt;&gt; female #2: I just want to know what he
thought about sharks.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.510
&gt;&gt;Chris: sharks okay.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.180
So the way to do that would be to gauge it
versus other animals.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.981
Like sharks versus dolphins who
wins?

00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:43.570
&gt;&gt;Bethany: What if we just tell him sharks?

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.570
And see what happens.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: We don't know what'll happen but
he probably has a lot of opinions on sharks

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.220
[laughter]
'cause they're his natural enemy.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.430
He lives in the Hudson River.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.750
We found out recently that he is a fresh water
being.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.250
[laughter] He's a freshwater not a salt water
being.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.700
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Dirty fresh water being.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.840
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sharks versus dolphins?

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.250
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Dolphins.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.570
&gt;&gt;Chris: Shark vs. an octa- A sharks versus
an octopus?

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.950
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: an octopus.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.620
&gt;&gt;Chris: sharks versus a squid?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.640
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: a squid.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.660
&gt;&gt;Chris: sharks versus starfish?

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.150
&gt;&gt;Bethany: A shark versus anything?

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.500
&gt;&gt;Chris: anything a shark versus anything
else.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.880
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: anything else.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.480
&gt;&gt;Chris: He doesn't like sharks.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.420
That's his feeling on sharks he doesn't like
them, but thank you very much for your

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.920
contributions to this very important talk.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.320
Um [laughs]so dumb, right?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.520
So dumb.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.090
Okay, so like I wanted to talk about, let
me just explain a little bit about my book

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.440
because I feel like that is why I was asked
to be here, and I should just explain some

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.460
of the things
that I've done in my life that led to me writing

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.460
a book.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.960
So, some of the stories, there's one where
a guy in college, when I was in college,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.650
this guy from, I went to Rutgers University,
[electrical crackling] OW!

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.700
That was horrible,
that was really horrible.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.250
So this guy, I went to Rutgers University,
the state school of New Jersey,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.130
that's who I am, and this kid who went to
Princeton who I didn't know, managed to sort

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:56.660
of quasi-hack, hack into my computer,
and cut of my access to AOL's Instant Messenger

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.000
program, and my response was to drive
to Princeton, break into his dorm room, and

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.250
threaten to fight him.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.650
In his dorm room, I broke into his house.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.390
Said at one point, "I am in your house, and
there is nothing you can do about it."

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.460
And he started crying.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.000
That's something I did in 1998.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.440
I also, in 1998, signed up for one night to
be a manager in a pro wrestling league.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.160
[laughter]
When I was in high school, I volunteered to

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.740
go on the Scared Straight Program.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.440
I was the only volunteer.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.280
It didn't go well, it wasn't pleasant.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.090
I thought it would be funny, it wasn't funny
at all.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.980
There's a story in there how when I was in
college, I signed up for a class on animal

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.820
husbandry
where I had to raise a goat for an entire

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.820
semester.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.520
[laughter] At the end, I competed in a goat
show,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.350
a competitive goat show.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.400
[laughter] That also didn't go well.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.420
There's a story in there about how I decided
one time,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.370
instead of fixing my diet, what I would do
is get a colonic.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.060
That one went about as you think it would
go.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.470
[laughter]
There's other ones in there.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.450
There’s, I signed, I once entered a jujitsu
tournament.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.450
Me!

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.450
That's ludicrous.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.150
You guys have known me for five minutes, that's
so stupid, right?

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.950
It was stupid, again, didn't end well.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.240
The stories in the book, that's just a small
sampling.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.700
A lot of things in there where all of those,
I knew

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.850
they were bad ideas.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.950
I knew they weren't going to end well, and
they didn't end well, but they did lead

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.950
to this book.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.260
And like I said, every, pretty much everything
that I'm proud of, is something

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.040
someone told me was a bad idea.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.350
All the stories I have, and all the other
things that have

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.780
happened in my life, and I hope that by sort
of talking about that, "a" I can kind of make

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.390
sense
of it for myself and also maybe put out the

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.520
idea, into the world, that bad ideas, if your
gut tells you

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.170
to do them, do them.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.850
And hopefully it will also help me validate
my own poor life decisions.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.850
[Laughter]
So, for example, this book that I'm talking

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.330
about, that exists, that I'm very proud of,
that's been met with pretty much positive

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.350
reviews, there's been a couple bad reviews
and a couple, you know,

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.100
we're all Internet people here, you're never
gonna get all positive Internet commentary,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.100
right?

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.100
I never do.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.850
I once had someone say on the Internet, not
about my book, about a video I posted " you

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.710
should advertise your
need for parental love on that billboard of

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.710
a forehead."

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.550
That was once something that was typed about
me.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.450
We did a show in North Carolina a few months
ago, and someone after the show went on Twitter

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:09.270
and at Chris Gethard said,
" Chris Gethard is heroically ugly, like Abraham

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.270
Lincoln.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.930
He is so ugly it takes bravery for him to
continue living."

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.930
So that's the Internet.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.620
So that's how the Internet responds to me.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.740
[Laughter]
But by and large, people have liked the book.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.411
They think it's funny, they think it's engaging.

00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:22.090
A lot of people seem to identify with it.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.270
I talk pretty openly about how I struggle
with depression,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:29.310
For a lot, you know, probably not gonna try
and go fight an innocent Princeton kid unless

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.870
you've got some issues,
and people say they can identify with it.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:38.340
And that's nice, but even that, the book,
when I first decided to do a book, I had a

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.040
manager because I was doing comedy for a long
time, and my manager came to be my

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.960
manager because he liked the web series that
I made and posted on YouTube, which you guys

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.480
are all familiar with,
because you own it, and that's crazy.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480
That's crazy.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.790
When Kate, who organized this, said you have
to sign these things for

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.520
our YouTube channel, which we own, I was amazed
to realize you don't own your YouTube channel

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.920
that you post these on, you own
YouTube.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.340
[laughter]
That's crazy.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.340
That's really crazy.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.530
I put videos up that get eight hundred hits
on YouTube.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.570
You guys own it, that's nuts,
why am I up on the stage?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.350
You should be filling me in on what I can
do.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.000
Anyway, I had this manager and he liked this
web series that that we did and we sold it,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.580
we sold it to this company,
and he gave them the rights, and then he said

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.270
we should keep doing that, that we could build
stuff on that.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.710
He said we'll get agents out of that, and
I be able to talk to all the agents, and I

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.580
said I want talk to the agencies that
have a book department because I'd really

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.580
love to write a book.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.180
I have this idea for a book.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.440
He put it off, and and put it off, and then
eventually, I kept bringing it up.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.960
I said "I don't know how long we wanna make
this web series for.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.231
It's getting kind of old and kind of stale,
and I'd really love to talk to somebody who

00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:42.231
can help me
write the book."

00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:46.480
And he said, and I quote, "Chris, no one wants
to read your dumb stories."

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.920
And he explained to me
why was such a bad idea for me to not continue

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.800
this web series and instead focus on a book.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.540
So I fired him in 2006, and now, six years
later, I have a book that people like, and

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.840
that's something that I like
to sort of talk about, and brag about.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840
Here's another thing.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.400
Here are some of the things we've done together.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.880
[Bethany laughs]
Human Fish, what on your mind right now, before

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.880
we continue?

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:14.250
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Shelley Duvall versus Mr. Peanut.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.250
[laughter]

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.850
&gt;&gt;Chris: What did they even have to do with
each other?

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.680
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Shells.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.680
[laughter]

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Oh!

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.120
&gt;&gt; Chris: Mr. Peanut has a shell, so Mr. Peanut
versus Shelley Duvall.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120
Who wins?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.230
&gt;&gt; Human Fish: Shelley Duvall.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.270
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's good, that's really good.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.450
So something that we all accomplished together
with our show,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:39.580
in a, right before Christmas in 2009, I decided
that what we needed to do to get our show

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.460
more attention
was book a celebrity on our show.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.520
We were doing our show at the UCB Theater
at this time, which is really small, if you've

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.520
ever been there.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.900
I decided why don't we aim big, why don't
we go for someone completely unattainable.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.910
So I went on Twitter, and I asked Sean "Diddy"
Combs if he would appear on our show.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.070
[laughter] Which is ludicrous.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.040
A guy like me
should not be hanging out with "Diddy" Combs.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.790
It doesn't make any sense, it's Puff Daddy,
he produced "Ready to Die."

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.150
He and I have literally nothing in common,
there is nothing that Diddy and I have to

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.550
talk about with each other.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.610
I can't
imagine there's anything about my life

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.610
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Shannon! Shannon!

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.370
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh God, Oh God, what is it?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.370
Okay.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:15.770
That wasn't hard, you held back on hitting
me there.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:16.770
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Yeah.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.000
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, because Bethany got in your
way.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I stood up and she--

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.260
&gt;&gt;Chris: So like I said, what does Diddy have
to talk to me about?

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.010
Nothing, but I asked him,
and I kept asking him.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.400
And for six days, I kept asking him and other
people on Twitter saw what I was doing

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.200
and thought it was funny, and, um, helped
us ask him.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:36.160
And then, for some reason, on New Year's Eve,
the leading into 2010,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.510
Diddy said "Who is Chris Get Hard?" because
that's what my name spells out phonetically,

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.260
that's the word Gethard is
phonetically that.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.340
And all these people are like he's trying
to get you on his show and then minutes later

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.380
I got a phone
call that came up as unknown number and a

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.690
guy said, "Mr. Combs would like to speak to
you."

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.279
[laughter]
And then I picked up the phone and, um, Diddy

00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:01.270
was on the other end and he was like "What's
up?" and I was like "Not much

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.680
"Diddy, what's up with you?"

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.960
And he was like, "so what's your show all
about?"

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.340
And I explained it to him,
and he was like "Yes,it sounds cool.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.800
It sounds really positive.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.260
I'd love to do it."

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.510
And then I was freaking out, and I
was like,"That's really amazing."

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.050
And then at one point, when I was hanging
up, I said, “Thank you so much.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.460
People aren't
going to really believe this is happening.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.010
I think this will be like a really positive,
cool thing for people to see.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.930
I
think it's going to do a lot, thank you.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.410
I can't believe you would do it."

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:31.420
And he paused and said, ”Ask and ye shall
receive" And then hung up on me.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.790
He hung up on me.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.370
And it was amazing, it was pretty incredible
to realize that a human

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.800
being feels like he's allowed to behave that
way and can pull it off.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.290
That was really a pretty great moment, and
then eleven

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.710
months later or was it fourteen months later?

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.110
Fourteen months later he did our show.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.501
It took him fourteen months to find a date
that worked.

00:15:49.501 --> 00:15:50.501
&gt;&gt;Shannon: It was a year.

00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:51.501
&gt;&gt;Chris: It was a year?

00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:52.501
&gt;&gt;Shannon: It was January to January.

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:53.501
&gt;&gt;Bethany: It was January.

00:15:53.501 --> 00:15:54.529
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh yeah, it was January 14th, 2011.

00:15:54.529 --> 00:15:59.190
It took him a year to find a day he had open,
that's how busy he was,

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.460
and it was a pretty fun night.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.910
It was a pretty fun night.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.550
Again, not the smartest idea, not a great
idea but an idea that

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.830
paid off pretty well.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.010
Oh what's going to happen behind me right
now?

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.779
I don't know, I don't know.

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:18.760
Another thing I wanted to talk about on this
topic of bad ideas was that a lot of times

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.130
the things that people have told me, that
things people have told me are good ideas

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.000
wind up not being worth anything at all.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.290
And what I have found continuously is that
when I follow my gut instincts t they lead

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.660
me to good places like hanging out with Diddy
for one night.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.991
And begging him on
stage to invite me to the White Party, which

00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:39.990
he refused to do on stage in front of hundreds
of people.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.370
[laughter] That's a bad idea
that turned into something I'm very proud

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.830
of, that we accomplished.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.360
But I also wanted to talk about the fact that
I've had

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.990
people tell me certain things are good ideas,
that didn't turn out to be enjoyable experiences.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.070
Like for an example,
I was briefly the star of a sitcom on Comedy

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.690
Central, and it was supposed to be my

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.690
[Shannon blows vuvuzela]

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.690
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh God

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.690
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Bethany, I will wrestle you down!

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.870
[blows vuvuzela at Bethany]

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.029
&gt;&gt;Chris:Oh Bethany, you're asking for it.

00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:06.120
You can let her do it, just when it gets too
far, you don't have to stop it.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Okay.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.120
&gt;&gt;Chris: That was never the point.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.880
Let it happen, Bethany.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.880
You'll know in your heart when

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.319
&gt;&gt;Bethany: You're trying to talk to these
people

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.319
[Human Fish blows toy]

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.870
&gt;&gt;Chris: Human Fish, why did you blow that?

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.290
What's on your mind right now?

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.839
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Walt Whitman versus Walt Disney.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.329
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Chris: Walt Whitman, the poet, the bard,

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:30.150
versus Walt Disney, the animator and also
Nazi sympathizer, who wins?

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.000
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Walt Whitman.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.350
&gt;&gt;Chris: Walt Whitman, that's good.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.350
That's good.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.100
You understand that Walt Disney had a dark
side.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.790
Good, you figured that
out about the world.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:44.809
So, I did this show on Comedy Central, and
everybody said it was going to be my big break.

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:47.100
It was
produced by Will Ferrell, and that was cool.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.570
And then, uh, it didn't turn out well, to
say the least, it didn't go anywhere,

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:58.330
and it was kind of a public flop, and that
was hard, and everybody, it was very funny

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.600
to see how everyone behaves when
they're about to make some money off of you,

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.720
in a sense that I would get, for example,
knocks on my dressing room door and I

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.171
would open the door, and this happened three
different times that I would open the door,

00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:12.400
and the guy would be like " Chris, man,
how's it going?"

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400
and I'd be like "Pretty good."

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400
And he'd be like "What's new?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.950
Is there anything you need me to take care
of?"

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.400
And I'd be like, " I don't
really know what you mean by that because

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.770
I've literally never met you in my entire
life.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.600
I have no idea who you are or why
you're behaving this way."

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.510
And he'd be like, “I’m one of your agents."

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.510
I was like "Really?"

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.120
And he was like, "Yeah, I work at
your agency.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.450
I'm one of your agents."

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.910
Then I'd be like, "Then how come you've never
ever called me on the phone even one

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.370
time, and I've, this is the first time I'm
hearing your name?"

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.820
And they were all so nice when they thought
they were gonna

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.270
make money, and then the show failed and not
one of those three guys has ever spoken to

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.960
me ever again.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.020
And the reason I
bring that up.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.020
[Electrical crackle]
AHHHHH!

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.120
That was really loud and also physically painful.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.750
[Laughter]
Okay.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.750
&gt;&gt;Shannon: You have to fight pain with pain.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.540
&gt;&gt;Chris: So my emotional pain that I was bringing
up you wanted to dissuade it with physical

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.540
pain.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.710
Thank you, Shannon
for doing that.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.100
I'm really glad to hear you laughing and having
fun right behind me.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.100
Oh God.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.140
&gt;&gt;Bethany: I'm having a great time.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.140
&gt;&gt;Chris: You are?

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.140
You're enjoying that?

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.140
Good.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.120
So after I did that show, every one told me
that the good idea I could do

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.790
was to move to Los Angeles, and go and try
to get more sitcom work.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.520
And that sounded like something that was probably
smart, and probably like something I could

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.660
do, I'd just been a lead on a sitcom.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.410
In my heart, what I realized was that the
experience of being a sitcom wasn't pleasant

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:34.600
and I shouldn't do it, and even though there's
more work for comedians in L.A.,

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.210
it wasn't really interesting work to me and
I'd rather stay here and be poor, and work

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.490
with these guys and let them hit me
on stage.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.660
And sit shirtless on stage while they debate
Mr. Peanut versus Shelley Duvall.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.360
And that lead us to the Chris
Gethard show, which I think is the worst idea

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.600
I've ever had.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.020
The worst idea I've ever had.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.270
Would you agree with that
Bethany?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.970
&gt;&gt;Bethany: If it's the worst idea?

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.030
&gt;&gt;Chris: There are many aspects of it that
are by far worst idea

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:04.580
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Yea, um, I, I, I think it didn't
make a whole lot of sense when we started.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.059
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, especially when we did it on
public access.

00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:08.059
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Yeah.

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:09.309
&gt;&gt;Chris: It was horrible.

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:10.830
&gt;&gt;Bethany: It was really terrible.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.309
&gt;&gt;Chris: It was really terrible, and horrible
and an unwatchable show.

00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:15.600
And I have to think, I don't know exactly
how to

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.750
research this, but I have to think that I'm
the first person in the history of television

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.910
to go from starring in a sitcom
to hosting a public access TV show,

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.830
[Laughter]
within one year's time.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.690
That's a really bad sign of your career trajectory,
right?

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:34.880
To go from starring in a sitcom produced
by Will Ferrell, to hosting a show on a dying,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.340
antiquated form of media?

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.300
That's probably not a good sign.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.410
But I felt like it
was worth doing and we do a lot of fun stuff

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.740
with the show.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.880
Just last week we had eight different people
make cardboard

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.720
robot suits, and fist fight each other on
the air.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.970
And we've had a kick boxer come on and beat
me up.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.740
We had a show called
"ruin this show" where we said literally anyone

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.430
who wants to can show up and do what they
can to ruin the show, while the

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.430
show was on.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.430
It's a live show, we don't edit it.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:06.371
They can come on our live broadcast and ruin
the show, and, man, did

00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:07.371
they.

00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:08.371
If it was not watchable.

00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:12.040
We thought that would be a really fun charming
thing, it was not at all.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.460
[laughter]
It was really horrible.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.090
And we had gotten a huge break, I had appeared
on the Jimmy Fallon show the night before

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.610
and promoted it and said, "Everybody watch
this show, ruin the show."

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.270
And was it, it was really heartbreaking to
see, on our

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:28.299
live stream, the numbers shot up real big
because of Fallon, and as the show was progressively

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:31.050
more ruined, you could just
watch viewers leaving.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:36.310
Just you could see the numbers getting down
to, by the end, there was about one-tenth

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.640
of the people
watching as were watching at the beginning.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.010
And that was heartbreaking, but I was glad
we went for it.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:47.450
We did a show
recently where a man, there's a guy in Sweden

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.450
who watches our show.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.450
He's a real good guy named Skellen.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.500
And it's pretty cool
to get calls on a public access show in Manhattan

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.809
from Sweden, and Australia, and Wales, and
also from so many

00:21:57.809 --> 00:21:59.410
depressed teenagers.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.440
[laughter]
It's pretty, it is fun.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.230
It is fun to just get a call from a guy who's
like "Hi, it's me from Kentucky."

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.650
And I'm like "What
do you want to talk about tonight?"

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.000
And he's like "I'm just sorta sad and watching
your show."

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.540
And I'm like, "Cool, I'm glad you
felt like you could reach out."

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.680
But this guy named Skellen sent us a tin of
fermented herring, and he claimed, he said

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.570
this, this substance is the most
putrid smelling substance on planet earth,

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.960
and I don't think you guys have the guts to
open it in your studio.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.720
And I said
frankly, there's no way I'm going to let a

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.930
Swedish man challenge American grit and know
how, not that I have anything

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:39.179
against Sweden, but I would like to think
that America has a reputation at least for

00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:42.220
being tougher than Sweden right?

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.240
George Bush was our President a few years
ago,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.590
[Bethany laughs]
so what happened was we opened the can, and

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.160
he was right and I was wrong.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.240
It was really bad.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.490
It was really, truly horrible.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:57.980
There's no way, it smelled largely as if you
stuffed a bunch of cigarette butts inside

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.220
a dead cat's carcass, is what
I would describe the smell as.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.800
Human Fish, you didn't like that smell, right?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:09.160
It wasn't good and I saw a member of our
studio audience honestly crawl out of the

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.720
studio [laughter] and I was told at least
one person vomited outside.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720
[loud laughter]

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.820
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Can I ask Human Fish a question?

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.299
&gt;&gt;Chris: You can ask Human Fish a question.

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:18.809
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Sharks verses, what is it, fermented?

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:20.250
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh, verses Surströmming?

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.320
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Sharks.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.320
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Oh.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.320
[Bethany laughs loudly]

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.620
&gt;&gt;Chris: You like sharks better than Surströmming?

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:32.030
I wonder if you knew, Human Fish, sharks versus
regular herring?

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.030
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Regular herring.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.540
&gt;&gt;Chris: So it's only when you ferment herring
that you don't like them.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:41.030
Okay, fair, thank you, Human Fish, for your
contribution.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:47.510
So again, I feel like, opening that can of
fish, was a really horrible idea, and led

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.799
to a bad stretch of our
life, but hopefully it led to watchable comedy,

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:52.890
and fun television.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:58.750
And, um, the other thing that I've realized,
that I wonder, I would even love to pick your

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.960
guys' brains about this
afterwards, is everyone keeps telling us that,

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:07.870
um, no one's going to put our show on TV,
on like real TV, and the sort of

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.309
area where they've kind of got us on that
is that the TV networks have all the decision

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:16.450
making ability, and all the money,
but where we've got them is we legitimately

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.930
don't care [laughter] 'cause we're doing something
really fun, and really

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:20.940
interesting.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.570
And one of the things that I think I would
love to know from your guys' perspective is,

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:30.910
are you guys, and some of the big Internet
companies, planning on murdering network TV?

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.020
[laughter]
Because it seems like something that could

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.710
happen, seems like TV and the Internet could
just happen there, and as someone

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.020
in the entertainment business who's sort of
struggled to do his own thing, and have any

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.590
sense of integrity, I would love it
if you did.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.780
[laughter] I would just LOVE if all of you
guys got together, you and the other big one

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.299
or two companies, and just
murdered it.

00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:52.299
Just killed it.

00:24:52.299 --> 00:24:57.020
Just say, why doesn't, why don't we just make
the technology so the sound and the picture,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.200
which you're getting there, is good enough
that people can just download what they want

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.710
to watch and maybe pay a tiny sum for
it, and not be barraged with advertisers,

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.320
and then have it dictated to them by companies.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.130
This is being recorded, and these
companies could potentially see me say this,

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.370
companies that don't know what they're talking
about, and make really

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.650
, uncreative, uninspiring decisions all the
time.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.150
Which is a hard truth.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:25.690
But I would beg you, Google, if there's anything
that gets across [laughter] please, I hope

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.650
your YouTube one hundred channels initiative
turns into the new cable, and just

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:34.260
crushes them, and gives people like us, and
a lot of the other creative people in New

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.600
York in particular, who don't want to
go to L.A. because that's where you have to

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:43.470
go to make it happen, a chance to make even
a somewhat decent living via the

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.640
creative output we want

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640
[Shannon blows vuvuzela loudly]

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.530
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh God, you're the worst human being
I know!

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.460
You are literally the worst human being I
know, but I asked you to do

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.460
that, so that's okay.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.460
[Shannon laughs]

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.290
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I am your puppet. [she laughs]

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.710
&gt;&gt;Chris: You are, um, that's not true.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:58.710
That's not true.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.710
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I know.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.600
&gt;&gt;Chris: But I would ask you very legitimately
if that's in the cards, because it will keep

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.000
people like me going in creating
our own content, on our terms, in the way

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
that we want.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.980
&gt;&gt;male #1: If we do, it will have advertising.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.179
&gt;&gt;Chris: It will have advertising.

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:13.190
[laughter] Thank you for being honest about
it.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.370
But it'll at least be, like,
you can click "skip this ad."

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.020
It at least it comes up on the bottom, right?

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.400
At least you don't have to, right?

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.990
At least you
guys are doing it in a way that no one’s

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.910
going to eventually create a device so you
can fast forward through it, right?

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.500
At least you're doing it in a way that is
somewhat kind to the consumer, I would like

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.570
to think.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:37.799
But it's really, I think, so
exciting to see things like podcasting take

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:38.799
over in the comedy world.

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:41.240
There's so many podcasts where people are
managing to

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.220
make their living doing stuff that they really
believe in, and it's because of people like

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.420
you creating devices that make
that palatable, and make that doable and the

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.750
technology to create those things at a quality
level if you want to put in

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.179
harder work than you would have to if it was
on a radio station or a television network

00:26:57.179 --> 00:26:59.220
someday, hopefully, is really
inspiring.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.870
So thank you guys for doing it, legitimately.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.419
I feel like you guys probably hear a lot of
jokes about being a

00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:09.490
scary corporation, and we had those at the
beginning, but also things like YouTube and

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:14.360
things like tablet devices give
people like us hope that we should keep going.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.570
And I want to say, as far as being in Google,
Google New York, and sorry Ann

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.780
Arbor that I'm about to say the good things
about New York.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.090
I don't really know how it works being here
versus being in your

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.820
California offices, but being an entertainer
in New York means that you're constantly told,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.530
"You're not gonna make it.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.160
You're not going to make your living off of
this."

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.700
There's less people who want to read your
writing, there's less auditions

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.700
to go on.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.090
But what I would say is that New York is still
a place where you're challenged the most,

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.250
where there's so many
people we've met through our show.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.400
One of the things that I think we all love
about our show is that it started out with

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.870
a
bunch of comedians, but the other people we've

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:52.590
met are film makers, and musicians who do
the weirdest stuff, and there's no

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.690
place for them.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:58.450
There's bands on our show who are so creative
and so cool, and you can dance to their music,

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.800
and they wear
masks, and like there's one band, Bad Credit

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.890
No Credit, who's so awesome but they have
a trombone and a saxophone as their

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.220
main two instruments, and they're never gonna
get a record contract because no one is going

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.030
to make money off a trombone and
a saxophone.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.130
But, man, would it be nice if they could.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.169
And, man, is it nice that New York is just
sort of full and brimming

00:28:16.169 --> 00:28:18.550
and teeming of people like that.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.890
And I'm glad that our show has become a place
where they can come and hang out and do their

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.520
thing and I'm glad that our show is a place
where we've manage to promote it in some cool

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.000
places that made people actually
see them.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.860
So, I'm sort of rambling and up on a soapbox,
and not saying anything revolutionary to you

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.070
guys, but I hopefully
wanted to explain some of the stuff that I

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.700
do, some of the stuff that we do, some of
the stuff that led to the book that got

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.929
me here and to being in existence.

00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:47.390
And to some of the stuff that we do on the
Internet, and maybe let you guys know a little

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:54.640
about the perspective of someone who's creating
and really struggling and really opting in

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.580
to struggle because he believes
in doing it in his own way, and on the Internet.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:05.201
And, uh, I do, I live in a two bedroom apartment
in Queens, and I don't

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:06.510
have a closet in my room.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.770
Like that's how I have to live as a thirty
two year old man if I want to do this.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.260
And there is the
temptation to just go out there and just try

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.950
to make money, but it's not an inspiring thought
to go out there and act on

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.039
another show that no one's going to like.

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:23.650
And then even, you see, like, I worked ten
years to get that show, our friends, we

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.380
have two, we have a couple friends all of
us who just work ten, fifteen years to get

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:33.040
a show on NBC, and they worked so hard,
and the show was so good, and it was so funny,

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.070
and heartfelt and smart, and it was great,
and that's not just because they're

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:43.840
friends of mine, and then it got put up against
Survivor and they pulled it after four episodes,

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.990
and there's just really no point
in working that system.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:52.320
There's no point to working that system, and
to me, all the people who ever really inspired

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.880
me
are people who gamed the system, who twisted

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.990
it around like Howard Stern took radio and
did something totally different

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.520
with it and was constantly told "What you're
doing is wrong, and it needs to stop," he

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520
just did it anyways.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.470
David Letterman,
in his early days, just did stuff that was

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.320
really so weird, and he kept doing it.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.180
And Andy Kauffman, and Jackass, and then
things that aren't even in the world of comedy,

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.660
like punk rock.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.460
Eventually it got to a point where people
didn't need to get

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.580
real record contracts, they made their livings.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.710
It's an inspiring thing.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.980
And then even in the world of the Internet,
I'm just sort of a sup, I'm a nerdy guy who

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.480
just wants to read and consume information
and I read about things like the

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.970
phone freaks back in the day and how that
was a bunch of blind kids playing with the

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:36.350
phones, and then they started doing stuff
cool enough that other people started to notice,

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.270
and then those people started making computers,
and now, here we

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.919
are, at an office that, literally, reminds
me of the Death Star.

00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:44.919
[laughter]

00:30:44.919 --> 00:30:46.820
&gt;&gt;Shannon: We have a question in the front
row.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.320
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh yes!

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.320
Please

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.590
&gt;&gt;female #3:Human Fish, Punk rock

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.590
&gt;&gt;Chris: Punk rock

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.590
&gt;&gt;female #3: or pet rock

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.590
&gt;&gt;Chris: Or pet rock?

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.590
That's a great question, Human Fish.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.820
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.840
&gt;&gt;Chris: Pet rock beats punk rock?!?

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.929
An outdated gimmicky toy from the, you really
believe, NO this is a punk rock

00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:03.929
thing

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:04.929
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock.

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:06.500
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think you have mixed up what a
pet rock and punk rock are

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.500
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.743
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh, he is a pet, is that

00:31:08.743 --> 00:31:10.080
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.110
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I think he's thinking rock, yeah,
rock and roll for pets.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.471
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh, rock and roll for pets?

00:31:15.471 --> 00:31:16.471
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock!

00:31:16.471 --> 00:31:18.150
&gt;&gt;Shannon: So he's into rock and roll for
pets.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.570
&gt;&gt; Chris: You're into rock and roll for pets.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.039
&gt;&gt;Shannon: He probably doesn't understand
the concept of a rock that is a pet.

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:25.309
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, so let's put it this way.

00:31:25.309 --> 00:31:29.890
Short, maybe three minute songs traditionally
filled with maybe an angry vibe done

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:36.380
on independent music labels versus a stone
that you pay eight dollars for and claim it's

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380
a toy.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.380
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet Rock!!

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.380
[laughter]

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.330
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, how can we rephrase this?

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:49.600
The Ramones and The Clash versus something
you would find in your garden.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.080
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet Rock!!

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.780
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, okay, Human Fish, I think we
just have to move on.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.470
I think we just have to move on.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:03.190
So, I just wanted to put
that stuff out there, say thank you for having

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:08.920
me and hopefully my book is funny and hopefully
my show is funny but also

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.570
to sorta be
Oh my God, what is that?

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.570
Which one is that?

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:13.570
What are you doing?

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.570
[Bethany squeals]

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:15.570
What are you doing?

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.570
If you're going to do it, just get it over
with.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:17.570
If you're going to do it just get it over
with

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:18.570
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Lower

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.570
&gt;&gt;Chris: It's not working

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.570
[smacking sound]

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.570
&gt;&gt;Chris: Ahh, that was my

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.570
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock!!

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:23.570
[laughter]

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.950
&gt;&gt;Chris:Ah ha ha, you aimed for the kidneys

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.950
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Yep.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.520
I wanna make sure they're working.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.799
&gt;&gt;Chris: What is that?

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:31.919
&gt;&gt;Shannon: You're thirty-two, you gotta check
your kidneys.

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:35.260
&gt;&gt;Chris: You're not doing me a service by
any means.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.190
Bethany, you did nothing to stop her, you
have to find the middle

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.330
ground where you're too protective and not
protective at all.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.720
&gt;&gt;Bethany:Well, now I'm just sitting here,
like, cringing, and trying to let it happen.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720
&gt;&gt;Chris:Cringing at what?

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.330
The violence or the quality of this presentation?

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.330
[laughter]

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:56.659
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Mostly, mostly allowing violence
to happen and trying to act comfortable about

00:32:56.659 --> 00:32:57.659
it.

00:32:57.659 --> 00:32:59.580
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, that's fair.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.990
I would say that's a fair gauge of where we're
all at.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.990
Right, Human Fish?

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.290
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet Rock!!

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:09.130
&gt;&gt;Chris: [laughs] So, I've been rambling long
enough, it just felt important to me on some

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:14.570
sort of level to come here and
say this is the perspective of a creative

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:18.730
person who writes, and acts, and specifically
to sort of say, this is the

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.030
perspective of someone who's trying to make
it happen on the Internet.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.920
Almost all the promotion that my book company
wanted

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.390
me to do was via the Internet.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.820
So much of what is asked of creators right
now, you guys would be amazed at how much

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.390
people,
like managers and agents in the entertainment

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:40.070
world, are like "So, we want to get this thing
out so, uh, just make a YouTube

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.559
video and it'll go viral."

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:45.400
And that's just what they tell you, "go make
a viral video, that's how we'll get your project

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.429
off
the ground."

00:33:46.429 --> 00:33:49.330
That's what people think of it, they don't
know exactly how it's going to work.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.970
They don't understand that it's
a hard process, that you have to put a lot

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.550
of work and effort into it, and have a game
plan and a strategy.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:04.120
You would be amazed how many times people
are, I don't have that many Twitter followers

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.169
relatively, but how many times
people go, "Hey, so, this guy wants you to,

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:09.540
like, tweet this thing for him.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.540
Will you do that?"

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:16.119
It's like, wow, people just really
don't know, so we're trying to make a TV show,

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:19.210
and we've basically found out that the Public
Access Network of New York

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:23.700
will give us a three camera studio, and the
only thing we have to do for it is fill out

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.349
paperwork and deal with all the
lunatic maniacs who have public access shows.

00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:32.701
Like the guy who follows our show some weeks,
who his entire show, no joke, is

00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:36.980
just him grinning while putting dollar bills
into ladies' thongs.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.222
[laughter]
That's his whole show.

00:34:38.222 --> 00:34:39.989
That’s his entire television show.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:42.809
There's another one where a guy sets up a
camera on the passenger seat

00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:46.950
of his car, and just drives around without
speaking, and they let him do that television

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:47.950
show.

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:51.019
That's a television show that
he does.

00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:52.460
That's the network that we're on!

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.379
That's the network that we're on.

00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:55.379
[laughter]

00:34:55.379 --> 00:35:00.339
But we also put it out over a streaming service,
and we also archive the whole thing and allow

00:35:00.339 --> 00:35:03.239
it for download as a podcast.

00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:11.599
And, uh, hopefully, the technology will continue
to develop where, um, video podcasts are something

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:13.309
that can get people's
attention.

00:35:13.309 --> 00:35:18.119
And our hope is that our hour long show is
something that, as technology changes where

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:21.000
the attention span of the
Internet becomes more and more of a TV level

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.089
and less of a watch two minutes and fifteen
seconds of this guy getting, you

00:35:27.089 --> 00:35:32.569
know, kicked in the genitals by an adorable
squirrel or whatever.[laughter] Whatever the

00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:33.970
videos are right now.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.650
So hopefully,
someday the technology is there, so that's

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.970
where we're at, and that's who we are, and
that's why we dress up in these

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:43.650
outfits, and that's why we hit each other
with stuff because we want to be creative

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.380
as much as possible so that's in the
book, and that's on the show.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.890
And I hope you guys will check it out, and
I thank you for listening to us ramble, and

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.890
I was
told that we should take some time at the

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.880
end in case there's any thoughts, or questions,
and like I said, I'd love to pick

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.029
your guys' brains about that, and if there's
anybody who works in those areas, or is just

00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:06.609
interested in knowing like
what idiot comedians think the Internet is

00:36:06.609 --> 00:36:07.650
good for.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.859
We're happy to be here and we're happy to
answer anything, and we're

00:36:11.859 --> 00:36:16.109
also happy to throw as many questions as you
want at the Human Fish, cause he always has

00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:17.109
an answer.

00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:18.109
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I have a question.

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:19.109
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sure.

00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:21.160
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Why is there dog hair all over
this stage?

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160
&gt;&gt;Chris: Why is there dog hair?

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.160
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Yeah.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Do you see it?

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160
There's like a pile of dog hair.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.539
Is there a dog that roams the Google offices?

00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:27.599
&gt;&gt;Chris: Was there some kind of dog show?

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.180
Was there some kind of recent dog show?

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.180
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Or a cat, was a cat murdered on
stage?

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.290
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cat murdered?

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.869
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Did Deepak Chopra murder a cat?

00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:35.970
&gt;&gt;Chris: Deepak Chopra?

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.280
It was Tina Fey's presentation, How to Groom
Your Dog.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.780
Hers had to be better than this right?

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.950
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Well, I watched it, it was immensely
better.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.400
&gt;&gt;Chris: It was immensely better.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.400
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Yeah.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.400
&gt;&gt;Chris: This was just me like nervously rambling.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.220
&gt;&gt;Shannon: This is great though.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.940
Only one person left, that I saw.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, but there's like four dudes
who never shut their laptops, but that's okay.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920
[laughter]

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.920
&gt;&gt;Shannon: That's only four dudes though.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.920
&gt;&gt;male #2: I shut mine occasionally.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: You did shut

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.920
&gt;&gt;male #2: I have a question actually.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh great.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.920
Yes.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.920
&gt;&gt; male #2:It's a really weird one and it's
really specific.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.920
&gt;&gt;male #2: So, I'm going to try to keep it
as simple as possible.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:10.499
Is there a section in the book
that talks about like a woodshed where some

00:37:10.499 --> 00:37:12.569
unpleasant activities happened?

00:37:12.569 --> 00:37:13.569
[laughter]

00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:15.589
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Were you molested?

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:22.890
&gt;&gt;male #2: I searched for every variation
on the word woodshed that I could and I couldn't

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.089
find it so I think
I merged memories from another book with your

00:37:24.089 --> 00:37:25.089
book.

00:37:25.089 --> 00:37:26.707
It sounds like there isn't, or I should say,
it looks like there isn't.

00:37:26.707 --> 00:37:29.339
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I think he's confusing your book
with the lonely, uh, The Lovely Bones.

00:37:29.339 --> 00:37:32.330
&gt;&gt;Chris: The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold?

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.670
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I think you read The Lovely Bones
by Alice Sebold.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:39.030
&gt;&gt;Chris: Which I believe is a fictional novel,
whereas my book is a series of non-fictional

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.030
short stories.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.519
No, I don't think
there's anything with a woodshed.

00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:43.589
So did you read, you read the book?

00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:45.029
&gt;&gt;male #2: I read the book, yeah.

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:47.089
&gt;&gt;Chris: And you were like, man I want to
read that woodshed thing again.

00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:48.089
[laughter]

00:37:48.089 --> 00:37:53.729
&gt;&gt;male #2: My band mate used the phrase, time
to hit the woodshed, in an email that also

00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:55.619
mentioned your book,
which I had told him about.

00:37:55.619 --> 00:37:56.619
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

00:37:56.619 --> 00:37:59.489
&gt;&gt;male #2:And I was like, Whoa he must have
read it because he's like totally referencing

00:37:59.489 --> 00:38:01.030
that woodshed
moment.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:05.589
[laughter] and I asked him later and he was
like, no, that's just a saying that people

00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:06.589
say, and I just said it

00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:09.690
&gt;&gt;Chris: And you still didn't trust him, you
still didn't believe him?

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:13.890
&gt;&gt;male #2: I didn't believe him.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.197
I was looking for shed, shack, like you know,
like shanty, you know every

00:38:15.197 --> 00:38:16.197
single word.

00:38:16.197 --> 00:38:17.197
&gt;&gt;Shannon: You should

00:38:17.197 --> 00:38:19.269
&gt;&gt;Chris: To my knowledge, there's no stories
about sheds, shacks, or shanties in my book.

00:38:19.269 --> 00:38:21.049
&gt;&gt;Shannon: You should check your friend's
woodshed

00:38:21.049 --> 00:38:26.079
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, it sounds like he has some
deep secrets and you have some blocked memories

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:28.509
regarding a woodshed that are
very important to you.

00:38:28.509 --> 00:38:29.509
[laughter]

00:38:29.509 --> 00:38:30.829
&gt;&gt;male #2: He said it wasn't in the book,
so what's going on there?

00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:34.319
&gt;&gt;Chris: I can tell you my best story about
a shanty, that's not in the book, if that

00:38:34.319 --> 00:38:35.319
would make you feel better.

00:38:35.319 --> 00:38:36.319
&gt;&gt;male #2: It would make me feel amazing.

00:38:36.319 --> 00:38:39.500
&gt;&gt;Chris: So I worked for many years at a magazine
called Weird New Jersey, which is all about

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.109
haunted places and odd things
in the state of New Jersey, which was definitely

00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:44.680
the best job I'll ever have.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.799
[laughter] Riding around New Jersey looking
for ghosts.

00:38:47.799 --> 00:38:53.210
And we got a letter, we got a letter once
that was like, you gotta to this place, Buttonwood,

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.119
which is in the
swamps of this one town.

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:57.989
There's this river, and down by the swamp,
there's all these shacks.

00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:02.180
And back in those woods,
there's all these cars buried vertically in

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.489
a circle and no one knows who's doing it or
why.

00:39:04.489 --> 00:39:06.779
So we were like, we gotta get a
picture, we'll call it 'Carhenge', and it'll

00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:07.779
be great.

00:39:07.779 --> 00:39:10.529
And we drove back there and we had to drive
past these shacks and

00:39:10.529 --> 00:39:14.109
now, most of them had been abandoned because
of flooding from a hurricane that had come

00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:17.089
through a year or two prior, but
there was one where there was all this like

00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:22.319
stuff, like old washing machines, and car
engines just spread all over the lawn.

00:39:22.319 --> 00:39:27.489
And we were driving and it was me and my boss,
and we got down by the river, and realized,

00:39:27.489 --> 00:39:31.359
like it was kind of a confusing
area, and I was turning around my car, and

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:35.700
this pickup truck rolled in front of us, and
I was just like well, this can't be

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.719
good at all.

00:39:37.719 --> 00:39:41.299
And it wasn't, [laughter] it wasn't good.

00:39:41.299 --> 00:39:44.200
The guy, uh, we went to drive around him,
and his truck blocked the

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.529
whole, it was a dirt road we were on, and
then he put his hand out the window and just

00:39:47.529 --> 00:39:48.710
went like that at me.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.950
And his hand,
no joke, it looked like a catcher's mitt,

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.400
it looked like a catcher's mitt with a bunch
of Italian sausages on it.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.049
And then I
saw the guy, and he was huge.

00:39:58.049 --> 00:40:03.400
He had on this t-shirt that was like tearing,
and he was the biggest man I've ever seen,

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.499
and
then um, the crazy, the scary thing about

00:40:05.499 --> 00:40:10.700
him was all his hair was white, except he
had a lump on his head and all the hair

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.440
growing out of the lump was jet black.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.400
Like this weird lump with all jet black hair
growing out of it.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.769
It was really odd,
and I was like "What's up, sir?"

00:40:18.769 --> 00:40:23.609
And his response, honestly, his response was
[gibberish].

00:40:23.609 --> 00:40:28.089
And I was like, well, what do I
do, how do you, how do I even handle this?

00:40:28.089 --> 00:40:31.619
And he started yelling at me, and as I calmed
him down, I could understand him

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:32.619
better.

00:40:32.619 --> 00:40:36.079
He was going "you come back here, you're stealing
things, we know there's this redhead kid coming

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:37.079
back here stealing
things".

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:39.150
And I was like, "I'm not stealing anything,
man, we're lost.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.640
We're like looking for Carhenge, man.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.640
Like chill out."

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.799
And he was like, "No, you're coming back here
and stealing things, and we're gonna teach

00:40:43.799 --> 00:40:45.009
you a lesson."

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:49.329
And then he went,
"Do you know what the Second Amendment is?"

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:50.809
and I was like, "Yeah, I'm aware of it."

00:40:50.809 --> 00:40:53.559
And he goes, "It says that I'm allowed
to shoot you."

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:56.509
And I was like, “That’s not what the Second
Amendment, [laughter] that's not what the

00:40:56.509 --> 00:40:57.509
Second Amendment is."

00:40:57.509 --> 00:41:01.349
And he's like "Yeah, I stole guns from the
Wayne Township's police Department and if

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:05.640
I shoot you with them, it will trace back
to the police and that's okay because of the

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.759
Second Amendment."

00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:10.269
And I started to get into it, but I was like
I don't think this guy, I don't think I really

00:41:10.269 --> 00:41:14.579
want to debate Constitutional interpretation
with this guy.

00:41:14.579 --> 00:41:16.700
So he started
yelling at me, and at one point, he brought

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.390
up the Jerry Springer show,and I was like,
just out of, for no reason, I was

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.630
like "I love that show."

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.630
And he was like "Really?

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.630
I do, too."

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.829
And I was like, "I love it when they get in
fights, and Steve

00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:26.829
has to break them up."

00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:27.829
And he was like, "yeah, Steve, man."

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:30.349
And then he goes, "I love when they have the
KKK on.

00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:33.059
I love the
KKK." and I was just like, "Me too.

00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:34.059
Yeah.

00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:35.059
Me too, I love the KKK.

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:36.150
I love it."

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:39.589
And he calmed down a lot and then we were
just like

00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:43.430
joking about the Jerry Springer show, and
I was just faking that I loved the KKK.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.579
I DON'T love the KKK, just to be clear.

00:41:45.579 --> 00:41:48.809
And then he started laughing, and the whole
time there'd been this other guy in the car

00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:51.910
with him, who was a smaller guy
who'd pulled his hat down so we couldn't really

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:52.940
see him.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.250
And then once the guy started laughing, it
felt like the tension

00:41:55.250 --> 00:42:00.209
broke and I was going to get out of there,
and the skinny guy leaned over to the big

00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:04.039
guy and whispered something, and the
big guy laughed, and I was like "What's up

00:42:04.039 --> 00:42:05.489
man, what's so funny?"

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:08.709
And he goes, "I'm gonna have sex with you
now."

00:42:08.709 --> 00:42:11.040
And I was
like, "Nah, I don't think.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.969
I would really prefer that we didn't."

00:42:12.969 --> 00:42:15.130
And he goes, "I'm gonna give you twenty dollars,
and

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.799
then I'm gonna have sex with you."

00:42:16.799 --> 00:42:21.220
And I still don't know why he thought the
twenty dollars was necessary, like, it's not

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.440
[laughter]
like, there's no reality where I'd be like

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.339
"hmm, twenty, great."

00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:30.660
And then he started to get out of his truck,
and I drove

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.089
into, I was like, well, I'm just going to
drive into the swamp.

00:42:34.089 --> 00:42:36.369
And I drove into the swamp, and luckily managed
to make it

00:42:36.369 --> 00:42:37.369
back out onto the road.

00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:40.529
I didn't know how deep the swamp was and if
my car would make it through.

00:42:40.529 --> 00:42:44.269
And then I realized, too, I
was like, those cars, I think, are probably

00:42:44.269 --> 00:42:48.140
the cars of all the people this guy has killed,
and he's so big he just picks

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.489
them up and does that [laughter] and we drove
away and got out of there.

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:54.349
And as soon as we got back to the office,
my boss

00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:58.290
was like, "Write that down" and we published
it and it was one of our most popular stories.[laughter]

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:02.769
And we started getting letters about this
dude, and we got letters, we got a letter

00:43:02.769 --> 00:43:07.510
from a cop who said "I once had to
arrest him, and I put handcuffs on him, and

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.420
he was so physically strong that he just went
like this and broke the

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.549
handcuffs."

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:14.859
And then we got a letter from someone who
lived there, and she's like "it was a strange

00:43:14.859 --> 00:43:19.739
little area, but I
liked living by the river, and it was peaceful,

00:43:19.739 --> 00:43:22.869
and then I had to move because that guy killed
my dog with his hands."

00:43:22.869 --> 00:43:25.329
And I was like, this is nuts.

00:43:25.329 --> 00:43:28.480
We had gotten away, and he had chased us a
little bit, but just to sort of the border

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480
of his
area.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.839
Then we got one letter from a kid, who was
like, "We went back there and that guy chased

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:38.749
us, as well, and he didn't
stop.

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:42.400
He chased us for an hour, and I eventually
had to go the wrong way on Route 80 to get

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.569
away from him."

00:43:43.569 --> 00:43:45.849
And if you know
Route 80, that's the road that starts at the

00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:50.339
George Washington Bridge, and ends in California,
it's like America's mega-highway and he had

00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:53.079
to drive the wrong way down it to get away
from the guy.

00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:57.450
But then, the letters died down, and after
another year or so, we got one last letter

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:05.019
about the guy, where he was like "I'm a cop,
and I've dealt with that dude, too.

00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:07.680
He's strangely enough, a good guy in his own
way.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.209
He was a troubled individual.

00:44:09.209 --> 00:44:12.681
The other guy you dealt with was his
brother, they had rough lives, and they were

00:44:12.681 --> 00:44:16.589
definitely problematic people, but they had
good hearts.

00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:20.430
And I wanted to let you to know
he died of a heart attack, the guy who tried

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:24.200
to assault you, and I figured you'd want to
know just for the story to come

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:31.480
full circle, but also, he was a huge fan of
Weird New Jersey, and he loved reading about

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.700
himself, and he'd been a subscriber
for years before he ever showed up in it."

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.280
And I was like "Oh my God, I've been writing
about this man, and he'd been

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280
reading the whole thing."

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.670
And apparently just laughing about it.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.160
So, that's my story about a shack, but it
didn't make the

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.160
cut for the book, so

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.920
&gt;&gt;male #2: Do you think that he knew you were
involved, that he was trying to, no,

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.030
&gt;&gt;Chris: No, I don't think so.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:53.239
It's not like, when you work for a company
called Weird New Jersey, it's not like you

00:44:53.239 --> 00:44:56.549
have a
company car [laughter] with like a logo on

00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:57.549
the side.

00:44:57.549 --> 00:45:00.819
It was just, at that point I was driving a
1986 Chevy Celebrity.

00:45:00.819 --> 00:45:02.431
So he
just, we were just two people back there.

00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:06.010
I don't think he was messing with us to try
to get into Weird New Jersey magazine,

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:09.670
and plus, that means every time he killed
a dog, he was like maybe they're an editor

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.239
at Weird New Jersey magazine.

00:45:11.239 --> 00:45:13.650
[laughter]
So I don't think so.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.930
So that's my shack story.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:15.930
&gt;&gt;male #2: Excellent shack story.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:16.930
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh thank you so much.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:18.990
I should have just told stories the whole
time, huh?

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.140
[applause]
Wow that got applause, oh no, all I've done

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.930
is wasted everyone's time!

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.690
Yeah, you agree, huh, Human Fish?

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:27.700
Um, but I don't know.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.539
I wanted to put that other stuff out there.

00:45:29.539 --> 00:45:31.849
Um, but yeah, that's a shack story.

00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:34.319
&gt;&gt;male #2: You came here to convince people
to get the book, right?

00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:35.660
To either purchase it, or
you know,

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.239
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, I guess so, but as you can
tell, I'm not, I'm sort of allergic to money.

00:45:40.239 --> 00:45:44.039
I'm sort of allergic to money and
success, so by all means, I hope people read

00:45:44.039 --> 00:45:47.569
the book, and the stories in there, I hope
are funny.

00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:51.170
But I also felt like, I
don't know, it's dumb, and it's a soapbox

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.980
moment, but to get a chance to talk at Google,
I'd rather talk about the stuff we

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.450
do that is Internet driven, as well as the
book, ya know?

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:02.130
Were there any other thoughts, or questions,
or questions for the

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.789
Human Fish?

00:46:04.789 --> 00:46:08.730
&gt;&gt;Shannon: You guys keep motioning to your
friend over there

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:09.730
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Yeah.

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.430
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, you're also the only crowd
that's reacted...

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.559
&gt;&gt;Shannon: You're like [whispering gibberish
sounds].

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:14.690
&gt;&gt;Unknown female speaker 3: [unintelligible
words]Ashanti?

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:15.690
&gt;&gt;Chris: What's that?

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.690
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Ashanti the singer?

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:17.690
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh, okay, these are some people who
know

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:21.519
&gt;&gt;Shannon: you heard a shanty and you disappointed
them because your story was not about Ashanti.

00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:23.140
It was about a shanty.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.140
&gt;&gt;Chris: What they're referencing.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.450
First of all, thanks for coming, because you're
people who clearly follow me, at least

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.039
one of you follows me on Twitter.

00:46:30.039 --> 00:46:33.509
What they’re referencing is I've fallen
into a situation lately where someone made

00:46:33.509 --> 00:46:35.270
a
Wikipedia page for me, which is nice.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:38.920
That feels like an accomplishment of some
sort to have someone write a Wikipedia page

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.999
about you, but then other people have taken
to altering it.

00:46:42.999 --> 00:46:46.369
And recently, no matter how many times the
editors of Wikipedia

00:46:46.369 --> 00:46:51.249
go in and change it, someone insists on going
in and saying that I'm romantically linked

00:46:51.249 --> 00:46:54.299
to the R and B singer, Ashanti.

00:46:54.299 --> 00:46:56.849
Which
is not, which is not, although she's a lovely,

00:46:56.849 --> 00:46:59.119
from what I can tell, she's a really lovely
woman and a really talented

00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:03.410
person, and easy on the eyes, but those rumors
are untrue.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:07.079
And not only do they keep saying I'm romantically
linked to

00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:11.329
Ashanti, they keep going to Ashanti's Wikipedia
page and linking to her that she's linked

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:15.650
[laughter] to New York comedian,
Chris Gethard, which I have to imagine, if

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.150
you're Ashanti, feels so bad.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:18.999
That has to feel so bad.

00:47:18.999 --> 00:47:22.619
Apparently, she was
dating, I forget who she's really dating.

00:47:22.619 --> 00:47:23.839
&gt;&gt;Female voices: Nelly.

00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:24.839
&gt;&gt;Chris: Nelly.

00:47:24.839 --> 00:47:29.049
So then I'm a really neurotic, paranoid guy,
and I have all these fears that at some point,

00:47:29.049 --> 00:47:30.759
I'm going to be
walking down the street and Nelly's going

00:47:30.759 --> 00:47:33.759
to be like "Yo," like, "Yo."

00:47:33.759 --> 00:47:35.690
Like he's going to see me across the street
and he’s'

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:36.729
going to be like "That's Gethard!"

00:47:36.729 --> 00:47:38.719
And I'm going to be like "How do you know
who I am, Nelly?"

00:47:38.719 --> 00:47:41.270
And he's going to be like
"Cause there's rumors that you're sleeping

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:42.270
with my girl, Ashanti."

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:45.109
And I'm going to be like, “What’s the
likelihood that

00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:46.210
that's true, Nelly?"

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.449
And he's going to be like, "Slim to none,
but it makes me nervous."

00:47:49.449 --> 00:47:53.180
And I'll be like, "Nervous,
nervous, you got nothing to be nervous about

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.180
man.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.739
You're Nelly, you've had three successful
songs in 2002, man.

00:47:57.739 --> 00:47:59.180
Chill out.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.619
Chill out.

00:48:00.619 --> 00:48:02.809
All I did was star in a failed sitcom.

00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:05.469
You're still way ahead of the curve on me,
Nelly."

00:48:05.469 --> 00:48:07.989
And then Nelly's going
to punch me in the face and be like, "That's

00:48:07.989 --> 00:48:09.160
in case you're lying."

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.549
And I'll be like, "This is just my luck."

00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:15.089
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I liked that when you asked who
she was dating, all of them answered at the

00:48:15.089 --> 00:48:16.089
same time.

00:48:16.089 --> 00:48:17.930
Can we ask them another
pop culture question?

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:18.930
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:19.930
Are you guys Gethard fans or are you Ashanti
fans?

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.609
&gt;&gt;female #4: We were just talking about it
before we came.

00:48:21.609 --> 00:48:24.880
&gt;&gt;Chris: But are you aware of the whole thing
through Ashanti's Wikipedia, or through mine?

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.880
&gt;&gt;female #4: Your Wikipedia.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.880
&gt;&gt;Chris: My Wikipedia.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:32.219
I'm hoping that you guys came to this event
being like, "We get to meet Ashanti's boyfriend!"

00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:35.420
[Laughter]
That's my hope, is that that was your impulse

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.420
when you came here.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.459
&gt;&gt;Shannon: So you Googled him before you came
here to figure out who you were going to see?

00:48:39.459 --> 00:48:41.279
&gt;&gt;Chris: You're not familiar at all with stuff.

00:48:41.279 --> 00:48:43.069
&gt;&gt;female #4: Um, no.

00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:44.069
&gt;&gt;Chris: Fair.

00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:46.289
Fair, thank you for cutting me down a peg,
Shannon.

00:48:46.289 --> 00:48:47.289
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:47.289 --> 00:48:48.289
I just want to make sure.

00:48:48.289 --> 00:48:50.299
&gt;&gt;Chris: I thought there was a small handful
of people in here who enjoyed what we do,

00:48:50.299 --> 00:48:53.269
but we remain underground completely.

00:48:53.269 --> 00:48:57.259
But I'm glad that's what you linked on to,
out of all the things to talk to on that,

00:48:57.259 --> 00:48:59.119
to talk to me on that Wikipedia page.

00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:04.009
I'm glad it's a fictional relationship with
someone way out of my league.

00:49:04.009 --> 00:49:06.440
Thank you for that, thank you
for that.

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.569
[chuckles] Um, I don't know.

00:49:09.569 --> 00:49:10.739
What else should we do?

00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:12.529
&gt;&gt;Shannon: There's a question.

00:49:12.529 --> 00:49:13.529
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, yeah.

00:49:13.529 --> 00:49:23.069
&gt;&gt;male #3: In reference to your Wikipedia
entry, Human fish versus Wikipedia editors.

00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:25.809
&gt;&gt;Chris: Human Fish versus Wikipedia editors.

00:49:25.809 --> 00:49:26.809
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Human fish.

00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:27.809
[Shannon laughs loudly]

00:49:27.809 --> 00:49:28.809
&gt;&gt;Chris: Human Fish.

00:49:28.809 --> 00:49:29.809
He thinks that he can take down all the Wikipedia
editors.

00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:31.670
[several voices speaking at once, unintelligible]

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:32.670
&gt;&gt;male #3: I think you have the culprit.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:33.670
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay, okay.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.670
You think he's the one changing it to say
Ashanti.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:39.609
I don't know if he knows
how keyboards or computers work.

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:42.170
I don't know what he thinks he's inside right
now.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.380
But I don't know if he knows about
computers enough.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.380
No.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.630
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I'd be surprised if he knew who
Ashanti was over a pet rock.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:49.630
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:51.289
&gt;&gt;Shannon: He didn't know what a pet rock
was.

00:49:51.289 --> 00:49:53.249
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock!

00:49:53.249 --> 00:49:56.230
&gt;&gt;Chris: Human Fish, Google versus pet rock.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.970
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Google.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:02.949
&gt;&gt;Chris: Wow, the only thing that has beat
pet rock so far is the concept of Google.

00:50:02.949 --> 00:50:03.949
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Google.

00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:05.119
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I think that was fear

00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:06.119
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Google!

00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:07.390
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I think that was a fear based answer.

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.819
&gt;&gt;Chris: You're so scared you're going to
have to talk to some of these people on the

00:50:09.819 --> 00:50:10.819
way out.

00:50:10.819 --> 00:50:11.819
&gt;&gt;Bethany: There's a question over there.

00:50:11.819 --> 00:50:12.869
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, just yell it out.

00:50:12.869 --> 00:50:15.269
&gt;&gt;male #4: Human Fish, Ashanti versus a shanty.

00:50:15.269 --> 00:50:17.069
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh, tying it all together!

00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:19.670
&gt;&gt;Bethany: That's what I was wondering.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:20.670
[laughter]

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:23.829
&gt;&gt;Chris: Ashanti versus a shanty.

00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:25.609
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: A shanty.

00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:26.869
&gt;&gt;Chris: A shanty?!?!

00:50:26.869 --> 00:50:32.569
Ashanti's so talented, You're not a fan.

00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:33.569
Ashanti versus Rihanna?

00:50:33.569 --> 00:50:34.569
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Rihanna.

00:50:34.569 --> 00:50:35.569
&gt;&gt;Chris: Wow, okay.

00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:40.410
So you know what you're talking about, and
that seems like your real opinion, actually.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.489
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Rihanna.

00:50:42.489 --> 00:50:43.489
[laughter]

00:50:43.489 --> 00:50:44.569
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Sharks.

00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:46.019
Sharks versus Chris Brown?

00:50:46.019 --> 00:50:47.019
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

00:50:47.019 --> 00:50:48.109
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Sharks.

00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:49.109
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:50.190
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Good answer.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:51.449
&gt;&gt;Chris: Good answer.

00:50:51.449 --> 00:50:54.390
Is there anything else we'd like to talk about
today?

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.969
I don't know how much time, should I
tell another story, that went well.

00:50:57.969 --> 00:50:58.969
[laughter]

00:50:58.969 --> 00:50:59.969
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Yeah, tell a story.

00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:02.010
&gt;&gt;Chris: Which, what one should I tell?

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:05.440
Another one, one that's in the book to entice
people to buy it, or one that's not

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440
in the book?

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.270
&gt;&gt;Bethany: Do you guys have a preference?

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:12.009
&gt;&gt;Chris: The way that this book came about
is I just kept telling stories on stage until

00:51:12.009 --> 00:51:16.140
I had about forty stories, and then
I had editors yell at me for five years about

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.279
how the whole thing read like a guy talking
on stage.

00:51:19.279 --> 00:51:21.559
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Have them throw a suggestion out,
that'll--.

00:51:21.559 --> 00:51:22.559
Do it the old school way.

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:24.119
&gt;&gt;Chris: Is there any sort of topic of interest?

00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:25.619
&gt;&gt;female #5: Sharks.

00:51:25.619 --> 00:51:26.619
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sharks?

00:51:26.619 --> 00:51:30.599
[Shannon laughs] Do I have a story that involves
sharks?

00:51:30.599 --> 00:51:32.920
&gt;&gt;male #5: Rap music.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: Rap music?

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.170
Well, the Diddy story I already told.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:36.789
&gt;&gt;male #5: Well, he's an entrepreneur.

00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:42.000
&gt;&gt;Chris: He is an entrepreneur.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.859
I'm trying to think of some of the other...

00:51:43.859 --> 00:51:44.859
Oh!

00:51:44.859 --> 00:51:47.309
You want to hear something crazy about Diddy?

00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:50.799
If, now we're literally just talking about
someone more successful and

00:51:50.799 --> 00:51:52.609
interesting.

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:58.720
Before he came and did our show, his assistant
kept calling me, and she got a kick out of

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.680
the whole thing, and
I was like, "It must be pretty crazy to be

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.599
Diddy's assistant sometimes, huh?"

00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:12.569
And she's like, "Yeah, the weirdest was we
stayed up for five entire days, and eventually

00:52:12.569 --> 00:52:15.109
I had a physical break down and started crying.

00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:17.460
And he was like, 'Oh my God,
what's the matter?'

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.609
And I was like, 'Diddy, I need to go to sleep.'

00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:22.900
And he went, 'Oh, I don't have to, so sometimes
I forget

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:24.619
other people need to sleep.'

00:52:24.619 --> 00:52:30.219
" Diddy, apparently, can just stay awake endlessly
and only sleeps when he chooses to.

00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:34.190
And then,
I'm honestly convinced that he is a magical

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:39.259
being, akin to like a unicorn, I'm honestly
convinced.

00:52:39.259 --> 00:52:41.759
Because then, his
assistant called me right before the show

00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:46.259
like the day before and was like, "Does your
theater have any computers or

00:52:46.259 --> 00:52:47.339
TV's?"

00:52:47.339 --> 00:52:50.880
And I was like, "Yeah, we have a computer
in our tech booth, and TV monitors out on

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.880
stage.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.880
Why?"

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.039
And she was like, "Ah, it might be a problem."

00:52:54.039 --> 00:52:58.029
And I was like "Why?", and she goes "Well,
there's this thing that

00:52:58.029 --> 00:53:03.690
happens with Diddy where when he looks at
a computer or television monitor, he breaks

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:04.690
the device."

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.990
And I was like,"This is
weird."

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:11.249
And she was like, "Yeah, when he does his
reality shows, he can't even be in the room

00:53:11.249 --> 00:53:14.039
when they're editing it
because he breaks all their computers, and

00:53:14.039 --> 00:53:17.049
they do all this work and then he breaks the
computers when he looks at them."

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:21.119
And I was kinda like,we're already doing this
event, and everybody's, there's already so

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:24.269
much buzz about it, why is she
trying to like convince me,like you don't

00:53:24.269 --> 00:53:25.369
have to convince me Diddy's cool.

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:26.369
I get he's cool.

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:28.319
Why are you throwing these BS
stories at me?

00:53:28.319 --> 00:53:33.329
And then, on the night of the show, we were
backstage, and they came and got us, and they

00:53:33.329 --> 00:53:35.839
were like,"Okay, alright,
Gethard, Diddy, time to do the show."

00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:40.420
And we had made this video package of like
the videos where I had asked him to do the

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:44.910
show, on Fallon we had talked about it a little
bit, and we made this video package, and it

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:45.910
was playing.

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:48.869
We had tested the
video and it worked, and then we got to the

00:53:48.869 --> 00:53:52.249
tech booth, and it was airing on a little
monitor there, and he was like "Oh,

00:53:52.249 --> 00:53:53.249
what's this?

00:53:53.249 --> 00:53:54.249
Oh, this is funny.

00:53:54.249 --> 00:53:55.249
That's funny."

00:53:55.249 --> 00:53:58.809
And he walked away, and the sound was like
thirty seconds off after he

00:53:58.809 --> 00:53:59.809
looked at the screen.

00:53:59.809 --> 00:54:03.410
Diddy, he did it, he broke it with his mind.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.089
How could I ever doubt Diddy?

00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:08.670
So now, honest to God,
if anybody ever comes up to me and says, "Oh,

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.829
you met Diddy once, I saw him walking in the
sky."

00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:13.869
I'd be like, "Yeah, sure."

00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:18.460
I will never ever doubt anything that Sean
Combs says he can do, ever again, like ,yeah,

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.690
if he told me, like.

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:23.049
If I ran into
Diddy again and he was like, "Hey dude, I

00:54:23.049 --> 00:54:26.209
used my ability to travel into the future,
and everything's going to be okay."

00:54:26.209 --> 00:54:28.739
I'd
genuinely feel better, because I think he

00:54:28.739 --> 00:54:29.779
can probably do that.

00:54:29.779 --> 00:54:31.349
So, there's a story about rap music.

00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:33.500
I'm still trying to think about one about
sharks.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.440
I don't think I have a shark story.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.920
I have a goat story, that's the
closest one.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.829
Why don't I, should I tell the Princeton story,
that's the best one.

00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:44.829
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Yeah.

00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:46.199
&gt;&gt;Chris: Can I tell you guys one more

00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:47.199
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Mike Bramski

00:54:47.199 --> 00:54:48.199
&gt;&gt;off screen voices: White magic's pretty
amazing too.

00:54:48.199 --> 00:54:49.199
White magic, white magic

00:54:49.199 --> 00:54:52.930
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh, you like White Magic?

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.779
White Magic is weirdly more embarrassing.

00:54:54.779 --> 00:54:55.920
I like the Princeton one because

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.920
&gt;&gt;female #5: Three minutes.

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:57.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: Three minutes.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:58.920
[claps hands]

00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.920
&gt;&gt;female #5: You've got three minutes for
White Magic.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: Got White Magic.

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:01.920
So I grew up, I was huge into pro wrestling.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.469
&gt;&gt;Shannon: That sounded very racist by the
way, for White Magic.

00:55:03.469 --> 00:55:05.809
&gt;&gt;Chris: Three minutes for White Magic, it
did sound racist.

00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:07.130
It wasn't racist.

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:08.809
You're not racist at all.

00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:12.089
So, I grew up, I was huge into pro wrestling.

00:55:12.089 --> 00:55:15.410
It was like an obsession of me and my brother,
and we had this friend named

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:18.049
Eddie who grew up across town, and he loved
wrestling, too.

00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:20.150
And when I was a freshman in college, I hadn't
heard from Eddie

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.479
in a while, and then he called me up one day.

00:55:22.479 --> 00:55:24.959
And he was like, "Hey, man."

00:55:24.959 --> 00:55:29.549
Long story short, he basically goes, “This
is going

00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:34.680
to sound weird but I took pro wrestling classes,
and I'm not good at it, but I met a lot of

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.690
contacts.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:39.650
One of those contacts
is an agoraphobic man named Carmine."

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:42.400
And I was like, "He's scared of the world?"
and he was like, "He never ever, ever

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:47.339
leaves his house, but he owns a wrestling
league called the Stars and Stripes Championship

00:55:47.339 --> 00:55:48.349
Wrestling League.

00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:51.829
We're having an
event at Seton Hall University and I was wondering

00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:56.029
if you would want to come be a manager and
manage a wrestler?"

00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:57.059
And I was like, "This is amazing.

00:55:57.059 --> 00:55:58.489
Yeah, of course, of course."

00:55:58.489 --> 00:56:00.739
I get to be a wrestler, in my head, I was
like I finally get

00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:03.119
to be a pro wrestler, that's always been my
dream.

00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:06.049
So he told me to come up with a character,
and the character I came up

00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:09.289
with was called "White Magic", and in my mind,
I'm like, I'll be a pimp.

00:56:09.289 --> 00:56:11.670
I'll look like this and then I'll walk around
being

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:15.349
like "oh, man" and being like, "I got hoes
in all the zip codes" and I'll yell that at

00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:17.089
people and they'll hate me.

00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:21.200
The next
night, I had a conference call with the agoraphobic,

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.730
and he sounded very agoraphobic, and he was
like, "Chris, I’ve heard a

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:27.709
lot about you, Eddie has described to me what
you look like, what's your character?" and

00:56:27.709 --> 00:56:30.449
I said, "Character's White Magic,
and I'll wear a smoking jacket, I'll wear

00:56:30.449 --> 00:56:33.635
a top hat, I'll have a cane, and I'll got
up to people and say, 'like I'm going to

00:56:33.635 --> 00:56:35.890
take your girlfriend out back,' and all this
stuff.

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:37.829
And he's like, "Oh that's great, that's great."

00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:43.269
So we went to the event,
and oddly enough, there was like a few wrestlers

00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:46.079
I had seen growing up in this dressing room.

00:56:46.079 --> 00:56:49.959
The Iron Sheik, who wears the
curlicue boots, and he showed up in those,

00:56:49.959 --> 00:56:52.239
I don't know how he drives with those.

00:56:52.239 --> 00:56:55.069
King Kong Bundy was there, if you've ever
seen King Kong Bundy, he's like this five

00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:56.960
hundred pound scary guy.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.249
He had like a big feud with Hulk Hogan back
in the day.

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:01.289
I was like, man, King Kong Bundy.

00:57:01.289 --> 00:57:03.730
So, we go out to have our match, Oh!

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:06.309
Even before that, very important, the guy
I was

00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:10.209
managing was brand new, the guy he was up
against was named Flash Wheeler.

00:57:10.209 --> 00:57:12.170
Flash Wheeler, they told me that I would have
to

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:16.880
hit Flash Wheeler with my cane to end the
match, and I was not comfortable with that,

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.579
and Flash Wheeler was not comfortable
with that.

00:57:18.579 --> 00:57:22.540
And he came up to me and he said, “I don't
know what you're doing here, you're not trained

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:28.319
in this, if you hit me
with that thing wrong, and uh, hurt me, I'm

00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:29.319
gonna beat you up.

00:57:29.319 --> 00:57:30.589
Like, I'm just going to beat you up."

00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:32.069
And he was this huge
pro wrestler.

00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:34.569
And I was like, "Okay.

00:57:34.569 --> 00:57:35.569
That's fair."

00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:37.640
And they were like, your match goes out to
start, and I went out,

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.589
started telling all my schtick to people,
telling them.

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:42.150
At one point, this guy started yelling at
me, and I was like, "Don't

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:44.799
make me slap those last two hairs off your
bald head."

00:57:44.799 --> 00:57:46.099
And all the crowd booed.

00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:48.819
There's another guy started to talk to me,
and I was like, "Don't make me hit you in

00:57:48.819 --> 00:57:49.819
front of your daughters."

00:57:49.819 --> 00:57:51.069
The whole crowd was like booing and I was
doing a good

00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:52.069
job.

00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:58.430
So the match happened, and it was really really
bad, and the kid who I was managing was nervous.

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:00.609
And Flash was hitting
him really hard, every time the kid would

00:58:00.609 --> 00:58:03.430
mess up a move, Flash would hit him really
hard, and you could see like red

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:05.460
hand prints all over him, and it was scary.

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:09.339
And all I could think about was, if I do this
thing with the cane wrong,

00:58:09.339 --> 00:58:10.640
he's gonna beat me up.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.859
So Flash gave me the signal, and he ran across
the ring, and I jumped up on the edge of the

00:58:14.859 --> 00:58:18.689
ring
with my cane, and I froze completely.

00:58:18.689 --> 00:58:24.579
So he looked at me, and he just kept running,
so now he had to pretend that one throw from

00:58:24.579 --> 00:58:28.589
Vicious Vin meant that he had to run three,
that Vicious Vin is so strong that I just

00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:29.589
have to keep running.

00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:32.140
And he ran back
to me, and I raised, I was like you have to

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.859
do it, you have to do it.

00:58:33.859 --> 00:58:42.499
And I hit him largely like this[loud laughter]
No joke, like orchestra conductors hit the

00:58:42.499 --> 00:58:43.549
stand harder.

00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:45.059
I was like, "uh."

00:58:45.059 --> 00:58:50.599
And he looked at me, and he was like,
“Ahhhhhh..." and he sold it and then Vicious

00:58:50.599 --> 00:58:51.599
Vin pinned him.

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:56.220
And in my head, for a brief moment,maybe he'll
just, maybe this

00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:00.039
crowd will just think like I'm amazingly strong.

00:59:00.039 --> 00:59:01.039
They didn't.

00:59:01.039 --> 00:59:04.119
They started booing me, and yelling at me,
but it wasn't like

00:59:04.119 --> 00:59:07.720
booing like a wrestling, like you want from
a wrestling crowd anymore, now it was like,

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.109
"You are horrible at what you do."

00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:16.799
And they were booing me, and chaos erupted
around me, and I was like filled with fear.

00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:21.339
And I went to walk back towards the
dressing room, these thirteen year old kids,

00:59:21.339 --> 00:59:25.809
they must have been like twelve or thirteen,
jumped out of the crowd, and over

00:59:25.809 --> 00:59:28.869
the barrier in front of me, and one of them
pushed me, and I was like, "Oh my God, what's

00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:29.869
going on?"

00:59:29.869 --> 00:59:34.680
And one of them reached up and grabbed my
top hat off my head, and where before I was

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.420
like, "in front of your kids, don't
make me slap you, old man."

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:42.859
This guy, this kid, not guy, kid grabbed my
top hat, and the best I could come up with

00:59:42.859 --> 00:59:46.680
was,
“Hey, I need that."

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.949
And the whole crowd just started booing me
and throwing trash at me and stuff.

00:59:49.949 --> 00:59:53.469
And it was like the most
shame I have ever felt in my life,

00:59:53.469 --> 00:59:56.599
[laughter]
which is saying so much, so much.

00:59:56.599 --> 01:00:01.000
And a wrestler, I had forgotten that because
we cheated, these other wrestlers were

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.900
supposed to come out and fight and defend
Flash Wheeler's honor, and one of them grabbed

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:09.630
me and he threw me back towards the dressing
room, really hard, kind of clearly as a "you

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:12.559
messed up the whole match"thing, and the dressing
room wasn't an actual room,

01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:17.230
they had built these, set up this big partitions
that were almost floor to ceiling, and then

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:18.729
connected them with curtains.

01:00:18.729 --> 01:00:25.089
And I hit it, chest first, and it went like
this, and then back towards me, and then it

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:32.249
collapsed inward, and it brought
down all the curtains, and all the partitions,

01:00:32.249 --> 01:00:35.019
and there were all these like naked wrestlers
who were like "Uh, what?"

01:00:35.019 --> 01:00:37.390
like
this whole crowd looking at them.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:42.569
It came about this far, no kidding, this wall
I knocked over came about this far from

01:00:42.569 --> 01:00:46.509
crushing King Kong Bundy, who is like three
quarters naked at the time.

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:50.160
And, a wrestler named Skull Von Crush, grabbed
me,

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.009
as they, his whole gimmick was that he was
like a Nazi, and he kind of seemed like he

01:00:54.009 --> 01:00:57.390
was into it, he kind of seemed like it
was born out of his real life.

01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:00.809
He grabbed me and threw me in a corner and
said, "You almost killed Bundy, like we're

01:01:00.809 --> 01:01:01.809
gonna
mess you up."

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:02.809
And I was like, "I didn't, Dude.

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:03.809
It was an accident.

01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:04.880
I can't kill Bundy.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.880
Bundy's Bundy!"

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.709
And he's yelling at
me, and Bundy went out to wrestle his match

01:01:08.709 --> 01:01:15.720
at that point, and then, thankfully, at one
point, King Kong Bundy, the fire alarm

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.210
just went off, and we were all like what happened?

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:21.839
How can this be more of a fiasco,and someone
said, "Bundy got body

01:01:21.839 --> 01:01:26.959
slammed, and he's so big he shook the foundation
of the building,and the fire alarms got set

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:27.959
off.

01:01:27.959 --> 01:01:31.710
And all the wrestlers went
that way to look, and I grabbed all my stuff,

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:32.819
and ran out the back door.

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.400
I was like "I'm out of here!

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.439
This is horrible!"

01:01:35.439 --> 01:01:41.469
And I ran out, and I ran to my car,and as
I ran to my car, I saw another emergency exit

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:46.069
get kicked open, and my brother came
running out, he instinctively knew that I

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.180
would be fleeing in a panic.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.549
And he came out, and he had my top hat, and
we got to

01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:53.200
the car, and he was like,"That was a complete
disaster!"

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.599
And I said, "I know, how did you get my top
hat back?"

01:01:55.599 --> 01:01:59.799
And he said,"They were little kids, I took
it, I went up and I took it from them, they

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.019
were little kids."

01:02:01.019 --> 01:02:04.849
So that's the abridged, the
version of the White Magic story in the book

01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:07.890
is much longer, but that's the abridged version.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:12.749
It's mostly how I signed up to
live a dream, the dream quickly turned into

01:02:12.749 --> 01:02:16.630
a nightmarish reality, and then I got chumped
by, literally, a bunch of

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:17.979
prepubescent children.

01:02:17.979 --> 01:02:20.630
[electric crackle]
Ah, you jerk!

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:23.809
You jerk, that hurt so bad.

01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:26.369
[applause] [laughter]
Thank you, guys very much, I hope the rambling

01:02:26.369 --> 01:02:29.499
was okay, and I hope that the boring parts
weren't so boring.

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:31.200
And I'm glad
that we got to tell a few stories, and I'm

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.069
glad that we got to talk about some of the
Internet driven stuff that we do.

01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:35.849
So thanks for putting up with us, it really
means a lot.

01:02:35.849 --> 01:02:36.849
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Thank you.

01:02:36.849 --> 01:02:38.160
&gt;&gt;Human Fish: Pet rock!
