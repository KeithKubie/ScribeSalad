we launched the Parkinson's initiative

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
we launched the Parkinson's initiative
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.670
we launched the Parkinson's initiative
with michael j fox and the Parkinson's

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680
with michael j fox and the Parkinson's
 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.749
with michael j fox and the Parkinson's
institute in out here and we have

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:16.759
institute in out here and we have
 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.679
institute in out here and we have
individuals with Parkinson's were given

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689
individuals with Parkinson's were given
 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.040
individuals with Parkinson's were given
a discounted version of the 23andme so

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050
a discounted version of the 23andme so
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.140
a discounted version of the 23andme so
we've designed the 23andme site so that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
we've designed the 23andme site so that
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.029
we've designed the 23andme site so that
individuals can get access to their data

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
individuals can get access to their data
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.849
individuals can get access to their data
they can fill out surveys specifically

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
they can fill out surveys specifically
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.040
they can fill out surveys specifically
about Parkinson's as well as about their

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
about Parkinson's as well as about their
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.680
about Parkinson's as well as about their
general health and they get all the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
general health and they get all the
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840
general health and they get all the
other access so information about their

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
other access so information about their
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000
other access so information about their
ancestry they can connect and share with

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
ancestry they can connect and share with
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.710
ancestry they can connect and share with
individuals there's a community portion

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720
individuals there's a community portion
 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.900
individuals there's a community portion
they can learn from people so we want to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
they can learn from people so we want to
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.729
they can learn from people so we want to
have a really engaging experience for

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
have a really engaging experience for
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440
have a really engaging experience for
people so that we can keep getting

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
people so that we can keep getting
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.869
people so that we can keep getting
information from them so we have one

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
information from them so we have one
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790
information from them so we have one
Parkinson's survey now we will plan to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
Parkinson's survey now we will plan to
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200
Parkinson's survey now we will plan to
have additional Parkinson surveys

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
have additional Parkinson surveys
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.689
have additional Parkinson surveys
because the long-term goal is how do I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
because the long-term goal is how do I
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790
because the long-term goal is how do I
get information about you today but

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
get information about you today but
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.049
get information about you today but
let's say I want to know how does your

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
let's say I want to know how does your
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.139
let's say I want to know how does your
Parkinson's progress in 12 months in 24

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
Parkinson's progress in 12 months in 24
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.420
Parkinson's progress in 12 months in 24
months and 48 months because that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
months and 48 months because that
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.130
months and 48 months because that
information will be really valuable to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
information will be really valuable to
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.529
information will be really valuable to
correlate with your genetic information

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539
correlate with your genetic information
 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.600
correlate with your genetic information
so then comes in 23 and we on the back

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
so then comes in 23 and we on the back
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.389
so then comes in 23 and we on the back
end our researchers in-house are

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399
end our researchers in-house are
 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.490
end our researchers in-house are
actually analyzing all the data so all

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
actually analyzing all the data so all
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.929
actually analyzing all the data so all
the information that we're collecting

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
the information that we're collecting
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.730
the information that we're collecting
through the surveys they then compared

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
through the surveys they then compared
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.649
through the surveys they then compared
with the genetic information and what

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
with the genetic information and what
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.760
with the genetic information and what
we're finding is we're actually making

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
we're finding is we're actually making
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.140
we're finding is we're actually making
really interesting discoveries so on all

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
really interesting discoveries so on all
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.130
really interesting discoveries so on all
the different questions that we're

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
the different questions that we're
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.530
the different questions that we're
asking about so we'll hope to announce

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
asking about so we'll hope to announce
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.890
asking about so we'll hope to announce
soon information about you know because

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
soon information about you know because
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.120
soon information about you know because
this Parkinson's community came together

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
this Parkinson's community came together
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550
this Parkinson's community came together
what are some of the discoveries that we

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
what are some of the discoveries that we
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.230
what are some of the discoveries that we
have made and what are those discoveries

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
have made and what are those discoveries
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880
have made and what are those discoveries
what kinds of discoveries will benefit

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
what kinds of discoveries will benefit
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800
what kinds of discoveries will benefit
that community so that might also

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
that community so that might also
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929
that community so that might also
integrate with a lot of the clinical

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
integrate with a lot of the clinical
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.819
integrate with a lot of the clinical
trials that are happening where clinical

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
trials that are happening where clinical
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.649
trials that are happening where clinical
trials are happening you know either on

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
trials are happening you know either on
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.090
trials are happening you know either on
drugs where we can potentially help

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
drugs where we can potentially help
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.249
drugs where we can potentially help
figure out why some people respond some

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
figure out why some people respond some
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.010
figure out why some people respond some
people don't respond what where there's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
people don't respond what where there's
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.530
people don't respond what where there's
toxicity or there's not toxicity and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
toxicity or there's not toxicity and
 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.880
toxicity or there's not toxicity and
some of a lot of the Parkinson's

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
some of a lot of the Parkinson's
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.679
some of a lot of the Parkinson's
patients are eager to participate in

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689
patients are eager to participate in
 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630
patients are eager to participate in
clinical trials so we might be able to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
clinical trials so we might be able to
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.490
clinical trials so we might be able to
help make sure that their they can find

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
help make sure that their they can find
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.840
help make sure that their they can find
a clinical trial that makes sense for

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
a clinical trial that makes sense for
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.620
a clinical trial that makes sense for
them

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
 
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660
 
I think the biggest problem in clinical

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
I think the biggest problem in clinical
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.010
I think the biggest problem in clinical
trials is that they're underpowered and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
trials is that they're underpowered and
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.990
trials is that they're underpowered and
that fundamentally that the studies are

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
that fundamentally that the studies are
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910
that fundamentally that the studies are
just too small and they're designed in

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
just too small and they're designed in
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.110
just too small and they're designed in
such a way because they're so expensive

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
such a way because they're so expensive
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.970
such a way because they're so expensive
their design in such a way that they're

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
their design in such a way that they're
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.479
their design in such a way that they're
just there's a small cushion and so you

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
just there's a small cushion and so you
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.710
just there's a small cushion and so you
know they're expensive to run if you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
know they're expensive to run if you
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.170
know they're expensive to run if you
need if you need a thousand patients to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
need if you need a thousand patients to
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.910
need if you need a thousand patients to
really get the Clint the power that

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
really get the Clint the power that
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.910
really get the Clint the power that
you're looking for maybe you have 1100

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920
you're looking for maybe you have 1100
 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.930
you're looking for maybe you have 1100
but what we're finding is that those

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
but what we're finding is that those
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.880
but what we're finding is that those
actually are still under powered so the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
actually are still under powered so the
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.250
actually are still under powered so the
advantage the 23andme that we can do is

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
advantage the 23andme that we can do is
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.960
advantage the 23andme that we can do is
we can actually have huge data sets

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
we can actually have huge data sets
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.240
we can actually have huge data sets
where we're not looking to collect you

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250
where we're not looking to collect you
 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.589
where we're not looking to collect you
know a hundred people with cancer or a

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599
know a hundred people with cancer or a
 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.509
know a hundred people with cancer or a
thousand people with you know multiple

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519
thousand people with you know multiple
 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.820
thousand people with you know multiple
sclerosis we want you know tens of

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
sclerosis we want you know tens of
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.039
sclerosis we want you know tens of
thousands so the Parkinson's initiative

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049
thousands so the Parkinson's initiative
 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.059
thousands so the Parkinson's initiative
we've announced you know we have over

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069
we've announced you know we have over
 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.280
we've announced you know we have over
3,000 people with Parkinson's in it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
3,000 people with Parkinson's in it
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.740
3,000 people with Parkinson's in it
which is you know on a relative basis

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
which is you know on a relative basis
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.479
which is you know on a relative basis
one of the largest cohorts out there now

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
one of the largest cohorts out there now
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.640
one of the largest cohorts out there now
so we're looking to develop these large

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
so we're looking to develop these large
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.280
so we're looking to develop these large
cohorts and keep asking questions I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
cohorts and keep asking questions I
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.780
cohorts and keep asking questions I
think one of the other advantages that

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
think one of the other advantages that
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.520
think one of the other advantages that
we have is that we can ask these

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
we have is that we can ask these
 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.140
we have is that we can ask these
Parkinson's patients about their

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
Parkinson's patients about their
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.000
Parkinson's patients about their
Parkinson's but we're also learning

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010
Parkinson's but we're also learning
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.130
Parkinson's but we're also learning
about all these other aspects of them so

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
about all these other aspects of them so
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.839
about all these other aspects of them so
we asked the general health survey and

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849
we asked the general health survey and
 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.490
we asked the general health survey and
then we're asking about commonly use

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
then we're asking about commonly use
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.740
then we're asking about commonly use
drugs so you know do they get a stomach

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
drugs so you know do they get a stomach
 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.300
drugs so you know do they get a stomach
ache when they take advil how do they

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
ache when they take advil how do they
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.580
ache when they take advil how do they
respond to benadryl things like that so

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
respond to benadryl things like that so
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.289
respond to benadryl things like that so
it's a cohort where we can keep learning

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299
it's a cohort where we can keep learning
 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.180
it's a cohort where we can keep learning
more and more things from them I think

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
more and more things from them I think
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.090
more and more things from them I think
we're very focused on developing or

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
we're very focused on developing or
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.650
we're very focused on developing or
understanding the the relationship

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
understanding the the relationship
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.539
understanding the the relationship
between genetics and drug response and

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549
between genetics and drug response and
 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.979
between genetics and drug response and
so that could be either on the efficacy

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
so that could be either on the efficacy
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.289
so that could be either on the efficacy
side or the safety side but you know

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299
side or the safety side but you know
 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.030
side or the safety side but you know
there's it's a well-known studies that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040
there's it's a well-known studies that
 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.440
there's it's a well-known studies that
have come out that said fifty percent of

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450
have come out that said fifty percent of
 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.360
have come out that said fifty percent of
all drugs that we take to have no effect

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
all drugs that we take to have no effect
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.039
all drugs that we take to have no effect
on you so what we would like to

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049
on you so what we would like to
 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.470
on you so what we would like to
understand is if you're given a drug is

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
understand is if you're given a drug is
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.870
understand is if you're given a drug is
it going to respond yes or no and is it

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880
it going to respond yes or no and is it
 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.729
it going to respond yes or no and is it
going to be safe yes or no and that's

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
going to be safe yes or no and that's
 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.500
going to be safe yes or no and that's
going to be a critical mission of 23

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510
going to be a critical mission of 23
 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.440
going to be a critical mission of 23
Emmy

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450
 
 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.510
