00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.918
We take a breath every few seconds.

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:19.168
Our life depends upon inhaling oxygen,

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:21.284
but we never think about how we breathe.

00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:23.550
It just seems to happen automatically.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.051
How can something that seems so simple

00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:28.684
be the key to keeping us alive?

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:31.050
Breathing starts with the environment around us.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.468
The air we breathe in, or inspire,

00:00:33.468 --> 00:00:38.184
has a mixture of gases including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen,

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:40.451
which is the most important for our survival.

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:43.017
It enters our body through the nose and mouth,

00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:46.968
moves down into the pharynx, trachea and bronchial tubes,

00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:51.401
and ultimately reaches the alveoli air sacs in the lungs.

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:56.084
The alveoli use pressure to move oxygen and nutrients into the blood.

00:00:56.084 --> 00:01:02.434
The diaphragm and intercostal muscles are a pumping system that facilitates this air exchange.

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:08.535
How you breathe affects your energy level, especially when you are under physical or emotional stress.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.500
Think back to the last difficult test you had to take.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.967
It's likely that as you became more nervous, the tension in your body increased,

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:18.468
and your breathing quickly sped up.

00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:24.434
The shallower our breath, the less oxygen that reaches our brain, and the harder it is to focus.

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:29.534
What's our response to physical stress, like a fast-paced game of field hockey after school?

00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:36.584
As we exert pressure on our bodies, the muscles require a great deal of energy and demand additional oxygen.

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:38.768
Our panting breath starts to kick in,

00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:42.868
which creates pressure to draw in more air and oxygen to the body,

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:48.084
and regulates body temperature by allowing it to cool down naturally.

00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:51.467
These aren't the only times our breathing is affected or altered.

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.467
Think about the last time you got angry or emotional.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.252
Anger creates a metabolic reaction in the body,

00:01:57.252 --> 00:02:00.684
which stresses it out and heats up our internal temperature.

00:02:00.684 --> 00:02:03.751
Have you ever seen anyone lose their cool?

00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:09.383
Ultimately, if we're breathing under stress over long periods of time, there are consequences.

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:12.634
When the cells of a body aren't getting the oxygen they need,

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:17.372
the nutrients available to the body decrease and toxins build up in the blood.

00:02:17.418 --> 00:02:23.450
It is thought that a hypoxic, or oxygen-poor environment, can increase cancerous cells.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.612
The good news is that we can control our breath much more than we realize.

00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:31.684
This means we can increase both the quality and quantity of the breath.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:34.851
The science of breathing has been around for thousands of years,

00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:39.967
from ancient yogis in India to respiratory therapists working with patients today.

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:45.134
Both would tell you that there are specific techniques that will help you improve your breathing.

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:49.951
Breathing is all about moving air from a higher-pressure to a lower-pressure environment.

00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:51.935
More breath means more oxygen,

00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:56.834
and ultimately a greater amount of nutrients that's available for our cells and blood.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:03:00.934
We naturally do this when we let out a big sigh.

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:05.784
Changing the air pressure going into the lungs is one of the main ways to alter breathing.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:10.418
Our body automatically does this when we cough, sneeze, or have the hiccups.

00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:12.218
Here's a simple experiment.

00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:14.934
Close off your right nostril with your right thumb.

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:20.668
Breathe in and out just through the left nostril.

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.884
Notice how much harder it is to get the breath in.

00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:29.050
You have to focus your attention, and use your diaphragm and muscles much more than normal.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.618
By decreasing the surface area of the airways, you're increasing the pressure of oxygen

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:36.168
moving from the alveoli to the blood.

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:40.500
Yogis often practice alternate nostril breathing to slow down the breath,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.734
increase oxygen, and activate the body's parasympathetic nervous system,

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:50.134
which deals with the body's operations when it's at rest.

00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:52.068
Let's try another exercise.

00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:55.518
Visualize the way a dog pants when it breathes.

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:57.684
Now try doing the same type of panting,

00:03:57.684 --> 00:04:03.951
first with your tongue out, then with your mouth closed.

00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:09.218
You will find yourself using your stomach muscles to push the air out as you exhale.

00:04:09.218 --> 00:04:11.301
Place your hand under your nose,

00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:13.934
and you'll feel the strength of the breath coming out.

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:20.284
Breathing this way is hard because it requires an active movement of our diaphragm and intercostal muscles.

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:26.801
Our body temperature changes quickly during this exercise from the amount of pressure we are exerting on our breath.

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:32.500
It's no surprise that you'll find dogs doing this breath often to cool down on a hot day.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.634
When we sleep at night, the medulla center of the brain makes sure that we keep breathing.

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:40.168
Lucky for us we don't have to think about it.

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:42.501
During the day, our breath is much more vulnerable,

00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:45.967
especially under stressful or difficult situations.

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:49.051
That's why it's helpful to pay attention to your breathing.

00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:51.350
If you can monitor and change your breath,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.284
you can improve both the quality and quantity of oxygen that enters your body.

00:04:55.284 --> 00:05:00.701
This lowers stress, increases energy, and strengthens your immune system.

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:04.134
So the next time someone tells you to relax and take a deep breath,

00:05:04.134 --> 00:05:05.834
you'll know exactly why.
