00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.880
&gt;&gt; So, I'm curious, why is it that

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.340
males are more susceptible to sex-linked traits than females?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.260
&gt;&gt; Well that actually has a lot to do with the fact that the X and the Y

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.270
don't have the same genes on them. And the

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.740
X chromosome is also much longer than the Y chromosome.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.050
&gt;&gt; Does that mean the X chromosome has more genes on it?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.760
&gt;&gt; It's exactly what it means. And the genes that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.240
the X chromosome has aren't actually on the Y chromosome.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.470
&gt;&gt; So is it beneficial to have two copies of the X?

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in a sense it is. I mean all your other

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.960
autosomes you have two copies of, right? It's kind of like having a back up

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.450
copy for a lot of the genes. In the same way that you'd have

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.330
a backup copy for data on your computer. You might have it on your

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.910
internal hard drive and then have a backup copy on an external hard drive.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.310
&gt;&gt; So if one crashes, you still have the other.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.940
&gt;&gt; Right but you're still not completely protected because both

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.030
of the hard drives could still crash. Although it's less likely

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.830
that both of them would crash than just one of

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.860
them. And the same is actually true for recessive alleles on

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.170
the X chromosome, in the case of males, if you

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.020
only have one copy of the X. A recessive allele is

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.430
really more of a dominant allele because there's no back

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.900
up copy to mask up the affect of the recessive allele.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.290
&gt;&gt; So, for females, you could still be affected by the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.370
trait, but if both of your X-chromosomes had that recessive allele.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.310
&gt;&gt; Exactly. We can even see this in a trait like red-green

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.870
color blindness in the general population. The fact that 8% of males

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.040
have some form of red-green color blindness, while only 0.5%

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.490
of females have a similar form of red-green color blindness.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.030
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm curious, are you red/green color blind?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.340
Let us know, and are you male or a

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.560
female, so we can see how the distribution lines

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.810
up with our class, compared to the general population.
