Rubin: Thank you
for joining us today.

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:05.868
We're really, really excited
to present Honeycomb,

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.234
and, uh, and some new
features of Android

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:10.767
and also some really,
really interesting demos.

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:13.934
We have a couple of people
getting onstage with us.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.634
We have a pretty good demo

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:20.267
of the Motorola Xoom tablet
running Honeycomb,

00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:23.834
and Hugo is gonna present that,
who's our Director of PM.

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:26.701
And after that, Chris Yerga's
gonna get onstage

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.133
and talk about some of
the future functionality

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.234
and features
of Android Market.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:33.834
And we have some really
exciting news there as well.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.868
And just briefly, let me talk
a little bit about

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:38.400
how excited I am
about the momentum.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.968
It's, uh, you know, Android
obviously,

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:42.067
you know, being
an open-source project,

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:45.133
we consider ourselves
the shepherd of it.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.400
And as we shepherd it
through the industry,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.434
we're seeing it just pop up
all over the place.

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:52.901
At CES,
when I walk the floor,

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:55.100
it was just amazing
and surprising

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.367
about all the different
variety of devices

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.634
that popped up
running Android.

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:01.100
Again, you know,
with open source,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.234
you don't really know what
people are gonna do with it,

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:04.567
and, you know,
all the innovation

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.901
doesn't happen
in this building.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:08.734
It happens all around us.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.467
So there's a lot of
excitement,

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.734
and a lot of opportunity,
future opportunity,

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:17.000
for finding Android
in new places.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.367
When you see Hugo's demo,

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.234
one of the things
you're gonna witness is

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:26.334
how Google's cloud services
tie together

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:28.467
all these different
applications

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:30.334
and all these different
companies

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:33.200
that are making devices
in all these different segments.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.934
Again, it's the cloud that
makes the experience seamless.

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:39.434
You could literally lose
your laptop or lose your phone

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:41.934
or lose your tablet,

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.434
and all your data's safe
and secure in the cloud.

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:47.100
The next time you pick up
your new tablet,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.467
it all comes back.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:50.334
The cloud is also
the central point

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:52.667
at which all the applications
and services

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:53.901
share information.

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:56.367
So in the future,
you'll be able to see

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:59.434
a real seamless integration
between phones and tablets

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:03.167
and, you know, Google TV,
which is also based on Android.

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:06.667
And before I bring Hugo up,

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:08.567
the one thing I wanted
to mention is

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.501
I truly believe
the Android team,

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.234
the folks over in
building 44

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:14.334
with all the Android
statues out front,

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.934
I really, truly believe

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:18.234
they're the hardest working
team in mobile.

00:02:18.234 --> 00:02:19.934
They sweat the details,

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:21.501
and they're there right now,
actually,

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:22.734
putting the finishing touches

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.300
on what we're
talking about today.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.968
Uh, so I really, really would
appreciate it

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:29.501
if you mention them
when you talk about Android,

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:32.100
because they're the ones that
are actually creating it.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.667
Okay, Hugo, come on up
and show off your stuff.

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:39.434
Barra:
Thanks, man.

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:41.400
Thank you, Andy,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.567
and good morning
and welcome, everyone.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:44.834
From the very beginning,

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:47.300
the Android project,
as Andy said,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.434
has been committed
to open development.

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:52.701
And one of the most critical
aspects of open development

00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:55.934
is creating an ecosystem
platform

00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:58.501
that enables developers
to iterate

00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.234
and innovate
as quickly as possible.

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:05.434
So our approach with Android
has been to equip developers

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:08.701
with the best possible
tool kit that we can build

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:11.567
and then simply
get out of their way.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:13.067
So with Honeycomb,

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:17.067
we're enabling this style
of rapid, agile development

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:20.067
that the internet has been
used to for so many years

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:24.934
on this new generation of
tablet-sized mobile computers.

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:27.634
So today I'm gonna show you
some of the new features

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.267
of this platform
that we've designed

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.901
specifically keeping in mind

00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.567
the creation of amazing apps

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.334
that are optimized
for tablet-sized computers.

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:40.000
So let me start by giving you
an overview of Honeycomb.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.634
And first what you'll see
is that

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:44.901
we've revamped
how you navigate

00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:47.100
in a device with a larger
screen like this.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.200
So if you look at the bottom
left of the screen,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.000
you'll see that there's
a back button,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.567
there's a home button,
and there's also a new button

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.567
that's dedicated
to multitasking.

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:58.801
So when I tap that,
you'll see visual previews

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:01.901
for some of the applications
that I was using recently,

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:03.734
and the state that they're in,

00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:06.934
so it's actually really easy
to switch back and forth.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.167
Over here on the bottom right,

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:11.968
you'll see the notifications
and systems status area,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:14.300
which I'll talk about
in just a little bit.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.167
And the rest of the screen

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.100
is dedicated entirely
to applications.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.901
And the home screen is actually
a really important part

00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:23.567
of our developers' story.

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:26.334
It's not just a warehouse
full of apps.

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:30.234
It's an application
development platform in itself,

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:32.834
and I'll talk
a little bit about that.

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:35.334
For example,
widgets, as we call them--

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:37.501
and by the way,
the widget system

00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:40.434
is the same that's been hugely
popular in Android phones--

00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:43.834
can now be backed by
collections of data.

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:45.400
And these collections of data

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.701
can be visualized
in some interesting ways.

00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:49.701
So right here, you're seeing
my Gmail inbox

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.200
that I can scroll through.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.968
You also see my calendar.

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:54.901
I can even scroll
through them together,

00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:58.167
and it's just really easy
with multi-touch support.

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:00.033
If I move over here
to this home screen,

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:04.067
I have a grid widget
for my bookmarks.

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:05.634
And if I scroll once again,

00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:08.400
I have what we call
a stack widget

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.734
that allows me to flick through
different things,

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:13.968
for example,
Major League Baseball highlights

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:16.667
or my books over here

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.534
or some YouTube videos
that are popular today.

00:05:19.534 --> 00:05:21.767
And I can even sort of
do this together

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:24.467
and actually have
a lot of fun with it.

00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:26.334
So there you go.

00:05:26.334 --> 00:05:29.634
So these widgets
are sort of reusable

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:32.200
pre-built components
that developers can use

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.934
to bubble up important
information to the home screen.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.868
From a user's perspective,
what really matters is

00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:40.367
despite all of the clever
computer science that we have

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:42.567
to enable the smooth experience
that you just saw,

00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:45.934
it's really just about
quick and easy access

00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:48.200
to important information.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.501
Now, another thing
that we've redesigned

00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:54.634
on Android, on Honeycomb,

00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:56.667
is the notification system.

00:05:56.667 --> 00:06:00.801
And as you'll see, notifications
are completely nonintrusive.

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.167
They don't get in your way
just like on phones.

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.267
But now they contain
more information,

00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:07.934
so in this particular case,

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.501
my friend Anand
is IMing me,

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:12.501
and you can see his picture
in the notification.

00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:16.767
And you can ignore it, or
you can action it if you want.

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:20.534
What we've done
is we've built--

00:06:20.534 --> 00:06:22.767
Maybe I should tell him
to stop.

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:25.501
What we've done is
we've built some templates

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:27.601
that actually allow
developers to create

00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:30.534
these richer, more advanced
kind of notifications.

00:06:30.534 --> 00:06:32.701
And I'll show you
a few of those.

00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:36.234
Probably my favorite example
is what I'm gonna show you now.

00:06:36.234 --> 00:06:38.934
There's a headphone
notification at the bottom here.

00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:42.400
I was listening to some music
before getting onstage,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.834
and while the music app
is active in the background,

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:49.334
I get this notification
that if I click on

00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:51.334
will allow me to play, pause,

00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:53.901
or go to the next track,
for example, like this.

00:06:53.901 --> 00:07:00.300
[hip-hop plays]

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.634
And I can just pause that.

00:07:01.634 --> 00:07:03.400
Now, if I tap on
the notifications area

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.567
anywhere here
on the bottom right,

00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:10.834
I'll be able to dismiss
some of these notifications

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.067
if I don't need them anymore.

00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:13.801
We call this a line item veto.

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.634
And while I'm in
the neighborhood,

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:19.334
let me talk about the quick
settings panel right here.

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:21.167
This gives me quick access
to important things

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:24.968
like airplane mode, WiFi,
and so on and so forth.

00:07:24.968 --> 00:07:29.100
Just right there
in one place.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.934
So now I want to show you

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:32.834
some of the new
application patterns

00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:34.234
that we've created as part

00:07:34.234 --> 00:07:36.567
of the Honeycomb UI framework.

00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:38.234
But before I do that,

00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:39.701
let me just point out the fact

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:42.601
that we've spent
a significant amount of effort

00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:45.400
making sure that existing
Android applications

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.701
run really well on tablets.

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:50.534
In fact, an app
that's been designed

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:53.300
with our recommended
development guidelines

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.067
is going to work
without any modifications

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:57.167
and run really well
on Android,

00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:58.834
and I want to show you
an example,

00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:01.501
in fact, one of my
all-time favorite games,

00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:03.934
which is of course
Fruit Ninja.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.968
So because I was
playing this earlier,

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:08.167
I'm gonna see that
it's actually showing up here

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:09.334
in my recents,

00:08:09.334 --> 00:08:12.267
by touching
the multi-tasking button.

00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:13.868
So I'm gonna go
into Fruit Ninja,

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.934
and I'll play this
for a little bit.

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:17.400
Now, this is a completely

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.267
unmodified version
of Fruit Ninja,

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:21.434
in fact what's available
in Android Market today.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.901
And it was built
before Honeycomb even existed.

00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:26.601
And it works amazingly well.

00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:29.267
It even supports
multi-fingered,

00:08:29.267 --> 00:08:31.601
multi-handed gestures
if you want.

00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:32.868
You can probably also tell

00:08:32.868 --> 00:08:34.801
that I am really good--

00:08:34.801 --> 00:08:36.133
or getting really good
with this.

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:41.067
But I'll pause that
for a second.

00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:42.367
So it works really well

00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:44.667
even though it was built
before Honeycomb even existed,

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.133
as I said.

00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:47.467
Now, of course,

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:49.834
we want to encourage
application developers

00:08:49.834 --> 00:08:52.400
to built tablet-optimized
experiences

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.901
for the applications.

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:57.067
And to do that, we've added
a lot of really cool, new things

00:08:57.067 --> 00:08:59.767
to they Honeycomb
application framework.

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:03.734
One of these things is what
we call an application fragment,

00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:05.167
and I want to show you
what that is

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:07.133
inside of Gmail.

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:08.968
So let me open
Gmail over here.

00:09:08.968 --> 00:09:11.567
So we're in landscape mode.

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:14.100
And in landscape mode,
you're gonna see two panes,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.167
the left folder view
and then my Inbox on the right.

00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:21.601
Now, watch what happens
when I click on a message,

00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.868
when I tap on a message.

00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:26.567
You see that
the left-most pane slid out

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:28.734
to make room for another pane,

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.767
the message, that then slides
into the same place.

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:33.334
and if I click on the Inbox,

00:09:33.334 --> 00:09:35.200
you see that the side--

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.968
the left-most panel
or pane slides back in.

00:09:37.968 --> 00:09:40.868
These panes are what we call
application fragments,

00:09:40.868 --> 00:09:42.834
and a fragment is something

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:44.167
that a developer can use

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.133
to encapsulate specific
application functionality,

00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:49.701
and then reuse that
throughout the application.

00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:52.601
So, for example, if I flip
this tablet into portrait mode,

00:09:52.601 --> 00:09:54.767
um, I may want,
and probably will want,

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:57.601
to recombine how these
fragments are laid out.

00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:00.434
And, eventually,
fragments are gonna be useful

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:03.667
so that you can have completely
reusable functionality

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:07.868
between the phone and the tablet
version of your application.

00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:11.334
So that's coming
in the future.

00:10:11.334 --> 00:10:13.300
Another really cool action

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.334
is being able to pick up
and then drag a message,

00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:20.767
for example, into a folder.

00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:23.868
And this is something
that has been built

00:10:23.868 --> 00:10:24.968
not as part of Gmail,

00:10:24.968 --> 00:10:27.033
but part of
the application framework.

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:30.200
We have an incredibly
full-featured dragging manager

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.634
that allows you
to create and manage

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.467
sort of these
dragging interactions.

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:37.334
There's a lot more
coming there.

00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:39.200
And then one last thing
that I wanted to show

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.901
is across the top here,

00:10:40.901 --> 00:10:42.300
is the application bar.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.834
The application bar
is another application pattern

00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:46.868
that can be packaged
into a fragment,

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:48.968
and in this case,
it contains--

00:10:48.968 --> 00:10:50.968
It's showing global actions,

00:10:50.968 --> 00:10:53.100
so, like, I have Search,
I have Compose,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.667
and a few other things.

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:56.367
But if I select
a few messages,

00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:59.534
you'll see that
application bar now changes

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.534
to contain actions
that are specific

00:11:01.534 --> 00:11:02.934
to the selected items.

00:11:02.934 --> 00:11:06.334
In this case Archive,
Star, Label, et cetera.

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:08.133
So this is another example

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:10.367
of sort of really
modular developments

00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:15.267
that we've built as part of the
Honeycomb application framework.

00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:16.501
Go back to the home screen.

00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.000
Now I want to talk a little bit
about performance.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.067
Needless to say, we've spent
a tremendous amount of time

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:23.868
really optimizing performance

00:11:23.868 --> 00:11:25.601
at every level on Honeycomb,

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:28.834
especially for
2D and 3D graphics.

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:32.167
So first, all of 2D drawing

00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:36.200
that developers have been doing
with the existing framework

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.300
can now be
hardware accelerated.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.267
And developers
can actually do that

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:43.334
literally by adding
just one line of code

00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:44.801
to their existing application,

00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.000
and then they can take advantage
of hardware acceleration.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.033
We've also added a new animation
framework to Honeycomb,

00:11:52.033 --> 00:11:55.801
to enable developers to add
transitions and overall polish

00:11:55.801 --> 00:11:57.167
to their applications,

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:58.501
and you've seen
some of that stuff

00:11:58.501 --> 00:12:00.567
already in the home screen.

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:02.601
I want to show,
in a really simple way,

00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:04.067
how powerful this is.

00:12:04.067 --> 00:12:06.901
So I'm gonna click on the top
button here on the right,

00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:08.000
and that's gonna take me

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.234
into the home screen
customization UI.

00:12:11.234 --> 00:12:14.634
And then I'm gonna tap on the
home button on the bottom left,

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:17.901
and then I'll do that
in rapid sequence,

00:12:17.901 --> 00:12:20.267
and you can see
how amazingly powerful

00:12:20.267 --> 00:12:23.000
this new animation
framework is.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.868
Just incredibly
fluid and smooth.

00:12:25.868 --> 00:12:30.067
We're also introducing
a brand new graphics engine

00:12:30.067 --> 00:12:31.968
called Render Script.

00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:35.167
Render Script is built
for high-performance

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.200
interactive 3D graphics,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.767
and it enables
some amazing new things,

00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:40.534
some of which I believe
you've already seen.

00:12:40.534 --> 00:12:43.133
Let me show you one of the best
examples of this,

00:12:43.133 --> 00:12:44.133
which is YouTube.

00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:46.033
So I'm gonna go
to YouTube here,

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:49.434
and what you see
is this insanely beautiful

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:51.300
3D video wall
that I can use

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.667
to browse videos on YouTube,

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:55.601
and you can see how fluid
and awesome it is to play with.

00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:59.467
This is built
using Render Script.

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:02.100
I'll go into our Books app,
and in the Books app,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.968
you'll see a 3D carousel of
the books that I've purchased,

00:13:04.968 --> 00:13:06.601
also built with Render Script.

00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:08.067
And if I go
into a book here,

00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:10.133
I've chosen "Unbroken."

00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:12.200
Watch how incredibly smooth

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.000
the turning the page
flipping animation is,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.100
even when you have pictures.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.601
It's just really beautiful.

00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:19.067
This is all built

00:13:19.067 --> 00:13:21.734
using Render Script
technology as well.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.834
Just for fun, I want to show
just a few more examples

00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:30.801
of 3D applications
that we can build,

00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:32.634
or that can be built
on Honeycomb.

00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:35.334
We've spent
as much time as we could

00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:37.501
optimizing performance
at every level.

00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:38.767
Even doing things like

00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:40.767
supporting
multi-processor cores,

00:13:40.767 --> 00:13:43.634
or multi-core processors
at the kernel level

00:13:43.634 --> 00:13:45.834
to make sure that everything
works super smoothly.

00:13:45.834 --> 00:13:47.934
So let me take Maps
as an example.

00:13:47.934 --> 00:13:49.367
So I'll go into Maps here.

00:13:49.367 --> 00:13:50.834
And with this
new version of Maps,

00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:52.334
as some of you may know,

00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:55.567
we're adding dynamic
rendering technology

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:57.767
with three-dimensional
vector graphics,

00:13:57.767 --> 00:14:00.267
and what that allows is
for me to do manipulations

00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:01.601
of all sorts on a map.

00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:04.834
So I can zoom. I can do some
rotations, for example.

00:14:04.834 --> 00:14:06.267
I can tilt the map.

00:14:06.267 --> 00:14:08.100
Uh, and If I go close,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.334
I can even start
to see some buildings.

00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:14.434
Look how beautiful it is
to look at the Embarcadero.

00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:17.534
Just incredibly cool.

00:14:17.534 --> 00:14:19.567
I will also show
our music application,

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.567
which is over over here.

00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:27.133
And I'll go to, uh...

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:28.133
I'll go over here.

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:30.400
So look at this
incredibly smooth

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.968
sort of carousel
that allows me

00:14:32.968 --> 00:14:34.934
to browse through my albums.

00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:38.501
Also built
using the 3D constructs

00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:41.000
that are part
of the application framework.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.868
And one last and really fun
example is Google Body,

00:14:44.868 --> 00:14:47.868
which is a new application
that I've heard some call

00:14:47.868 --> 00:14:50.000
the Google Maps
of human anatomy.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.067
And I can do here,
you know,

00:14:52.067 --> 00:14:54.100
things that you would expect
from Maps,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.100
like pan and zoom.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.667
I can also turn on layers.

00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:59.000
But in this case,
there are layers like muscles,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.567
or maybe the circulatory system,
or skeleton,

00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:05.400
and I can zoom in here.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.934
And perhaps this is useful,
maybe,

00:15:06.934 --> 00:15:08.534
to tell my doctor on the phone

00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:10.634
that I've broken my clavicle.

00:15:10.634 --> 00:15:14.334
Uh, or if my doctor
tells me that, uh,

00:15:14.334 --> 00:15:16.634
maybe I've pulled
my infraspinatis,

00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:18.734
I can actually
find out what that is.

00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:21.534
Doesn't look that serious.

00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:24.634
So, speaking of 3D graphics,

00:15:24.634 --> 00:15:27.100
I wanted to invite
an expert over to the stage.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.067
So please welcome
Thomas Williamson

00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:32.534
from War Drum Studios
to show some of the amad--

00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:35.100
amazing things that you can
build using 3-D graphics

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.334
on Honeycomb.

00:15:36.334 --> 00:15:38.567
Thomas, come on up.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.200
Williamson: Thank you, Hugo.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.834
My name is Thomas Williamson.

00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:46.334
I'm the CEO
of War Drum Studios.

00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:48.467
We're a game developer based
out of Gainesville, Florida.

00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:51.367
And we're recently,
uh, we've moved completely

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.501
over to mobile development

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.000
and next-generation game
development on Android.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So we have a few games
I want to show you.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.534
The first game
is "Monster Madness."

00:15:59.534 --> 00:16:02.667
That's the first tablet here.

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:07.033
Okay, so "Monster Madness"
is a South Peak Games title

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.701
that was a PS3 game.

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.968
And we've brought it
over to Android

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:12.000
using the same assets,
the same gameplay logic,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.501
the same animations.

00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:16.734
And you kind of get
a cinematic feel...

00:16:16.734 --> 00:16:20.467
[rooster grunting]

00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:22.801
[crash]

00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:25.200
And so the game itself,
it's a hack-and-slash shooter.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.400
Uh, you have up to two people,
so you can have Wi-Fi call up

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.667
with two different tablets.

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:32.334
Uh, fighting enemies coming
from all around you,

00:16:32.334 --> 00:16:33.601
hundreds of particles.

00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:34.901
You have explosions.

00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:36.501
You have destructible
environments.

00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:38.801
You're--
Blow up the barrel, Ben.

00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:40.300
There goes. [laughs]

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.300
So you have a--
a lot of performance

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.501
and high definition context
with "Monster Madness."

00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:48.834
And the game's gonna feature
five huge environments,

00:16:48.834 --> 00:16:51.167
four difficulty levels,
vehicular combat,

00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:52.567
the whole nine yards.

00:16:52.567 --> 00:16:53.601
We're trying to throw
everything we can at the player,

00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:55.434
and the high performance
of Android

00:16:55.434 --> 00:16:59.400
and what Honeycomb provides
allows us to do that.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.501
So let's move on
to the second tablet,

00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:04.501
and I can show you...

00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:05.734
"Great Battles Medieval."

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.968
So "Great Battles Medieval"

00:17:06.968 --> 00:17:09.234
is, uh, "History Channel
Presents Great Battles..."

00:17:09.234 --> 00:17:11.234
And it is a cooperative
development

00:17:11.234 --> 00:17:15.367
between War Drum Studios
and Slitherine Software.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:19.534
And so this title is basically
an educational strategy game

00:17:19.534 --> 00:17:20.868
with massive battles.

00:17:20.868 --> 00:17:22.767
And it's the first
title that we've done

00:17:22.767 --> 00:17:26.267
that has 100% usage
of two cores on tablet, and--

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:27.701
Or, you know,
we're looking

00:17:27.701 --> 00:17:29.767
to support the phones
as well.

00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:32.067
The game itself
shows hundreds of units

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:33.634
animating, moving,

00:17:33.634 --> 00:17:34.734
uniquely thinking.

00:17:34.734 --> 00:17:36.868
All in a massive battle,
all on your phone,

00:17:36.868 --> 00:17:41.067
all on mobile.

00:17:41.067 --> 00:17:43.901
Just try to get a...

00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:46.801
[men grunting]

00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.801
So it really pushes
the tablets to the limit,

00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:54.400
and you can look forward
to all of--

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.868
both of these titles
within the next month.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:00.200
Thank you for your time.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.200
[applause]

00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:07.033
Barra: Thank you, Thomas.
That was--

00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:08.634
that was absolutely stunning.

00:18:08.634 --> 00:18:10.701
Um, finally, I'd like to talk
a little bit about

00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:12.601
the new media capabilities

00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:14.334
of the Honeycomb platform.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.434
It's live multitasking here.

00:18:24.434 --> 00:18:26.634
So, um, I want to show you
the new Camera app

00:18:26.634 --> 00:18:27.801
that we've built,

00:18:27.801 --> 00:18:31.534
because it has a completely
stunning new UI.

00:18:31.534 --> 00:18:33.501
So, as you can see here
on the right,

00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:36.167
uh, we have a really slick
new UI for--

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:38.167
to expose all of the controls
that you want

00:18:38.167 --> 00:18:39.501
when you're taking
a picture.

00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:41.868
So I can, you know, control
the flash, white balance,

00:18:41.868 --> 00:18:45.300
and exposure settings,
color effect, et cetera.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.234
Um, I can also flip to
the front camera if I want.

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.267
Uh, I'll go back
to the main camera

00:18:52.267 --> 00:18:57.000
and I'll just take
a picture of you guys.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.601
That's a little shaky
over there.

00:18:58.601 --> 00:19:00.601
Um, so there you go,
and I can, of course,

00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:03.801
also shoot a video and upload it
instantly to YouTube.

00:19:03.801 --> 00:19:05.501
We think this is a really cool
new UI.

00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:07.968
And, uh, hopefully,
you'll love it.

00:19:07.968 --> 00:19:10.133
Uh, now Android
has also been

00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:12.400
an amazing
communications platform.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.901
And this device has
a front-facing camera,

00:19:14.901 --> 00:19:17.334
which is really great
because Honeycomb

00:19:17.334 --> 00:19:19.234
supports video chat.

00:19:19.234 --> 00:19:22.234
So I want to show you
a little bit of video chat.

00:19:22.234 --> 00:19:24.834
And what you won't
see here necessarily,

00:19:24.834 --> 00:19:27.534
because the tablet is sort
of fixed in a stable position,

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.400
is that we've actually spent
a lot of time,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.334
uh, building image
stabilization technology,

00:19:32.334 --> 00:19:34.767
uh, as part of video chat
on Honeycomb,

00:19:34.767 --> 00:19:36.834
both to make the experience
really smooth,

00:19:36.834 --> 00:19:38.100
but also to save bandwidth,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.334
recognizing that,
a lot of times,

00:19:39.334 --> 00:19:41.400
users are gonna be
on cellular networks

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.334
with--with a device
like this.

00:19:43.334 --> 00:19:45.267
And it works really,
really well.

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:48.267
Uh, to show you video chat,
I'm going to actually

00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:50.801
contact my friend
Lady Killer.

00:19:50.801 --> 00:19:53.033
Lady Killer is his nickname.

00:19:53.033 --> 00:19:54.734
You probably already
know who it is.

00:19:54.734 --> 00:19:57.067
And you certainly will know
as soon as we connect.

00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:59.968
So let's see if we can
talk to Lady Killer here.

00:19:59.968 --> 00:20:02.100
Uh, looks like he might not
be online.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.567
Let me, uh,
let me go into Talk.

00:20:09.734 --> 00:20:11.934
Maybe we'll try, uh,
logging out.

00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:13.868
Oh, I'm not signed in.
There we go.

00:20:13.868 --> 00:20:16.667
That would help.

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:19.267
So what I'll do here
from my home screen

00:20:19.267 --> 00:20:21.267
is I'm gonna use a widget
that's called

00:20:21.267 --> 00:20:22.701
a Contact shortcut,

00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:24.968
which allows me
with a single click

00:20:24.968 --> 00:20:26.567
to actually email or--

00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:28.868
or start a video chat
with someone.

00:20:28.868 --> 00:20:31.133
Um, it doesn't--
my friend Lady Killer

00:20:31.133 --> 00:20:34.300
isn't showing
as online yet.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.601
Um, so maybe we'll try that
in a little bit.

00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:41.133
Uh, or perhaps I'll just chat
with my friend, uh,

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:47.534
Anand here.

00:20:47.534 --> 00:20:49.601
Let me try that.

00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:51.534
Lady Killer, where are you?

00:20:56.667 --> 00:20:58.067
Hmm, still offline.

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:00.701
Well, let's just talk
to my friend Anand here

00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.300
on video chat.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.234
[phone line ringing]

00:21:14.934 --> 00:21:16.534
Hey, Anand.
How are you, man?

00:21:16.534 --> 00:21:19.200
Anand: Hey, what's up?
Barra: It's going pretty well.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.501
Anand: Sorry I'm not
Lady Killer.

00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:22.434
I'm not--I'm not bad
with the ladies, though.

00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:24.167
[laughter]

00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:25.534
Barra: I'm sure you're not.

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:30.000
Hope you're having
a good time, man, though.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.400
So, uh, I'll see you
a little bit later, okay?

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.968
I just wanted to make sure
that everybody saw

00:21:33.968 --> 00:21:36.234
the new video chat technology
that's part of Honeycomb.

00:21:36.234 --> 00:21:38.234
And maybe Lady Killer will
show up in a little while.

00:21:38.234 --> 00:21:40.267
Anand: Cool.
See you around.

00:21:40.267 --> 00:21:41.467
Barra: Thanks, man.

00:21:46.534 --> 00:21:47.667
Yeah, Lady Killer
still isn't there.

00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:50.968
Well, um, of course,

00:21:50.968 --> 00:21:53.434
there's probably no one
in the world

00:21:53.434 --> 00:21:57.067
that knows how much video
is capable of changing things,

00:21:57.067 --> 00:22:01.300
changing the world in itself,
than CNN.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.767
So I'd like to invite
my colleague and friend,

00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.501
uh, Louis Gump from CNN

00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:07.634
to show an amazing
new application

00:22:07.634 --> 00:22:09.200
that CNN has been building

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.801
using the Honeycomb platform.

00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:12.734
Louis, come on up.

00:22:18.968 --> 00:22:23.734
Gump: Thanks, Hugo.

00:22:23.734 --> 00:22:28.767
Thank you, Hugo.
Make sure we're all set up here.

00:22:28.767 --> 00:22:30.100
Okay,
good morning, everyone.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.901
I'm Louis Gump, Vice President
of Mobile at CNN.

00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:35.934
I'm here with Lila King
who heads up our iReport group.

00:22:35.934 --> 00:22:38.501
We're really excited
to be here this morning

00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:40.234
to talk a little bit
about a new application

00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:41.400
we've been building.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.133
We've been hard at work
on an Android app

00:22:44.133 --> 00:22:46.334
for the tablet
and it will be launching

00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:49.334
in the near future for free
in the Android market.

00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:51.267
And we'd like to give you
a little sneak peek.

00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:53.667
First of all, I'd like
to share a bit of context.

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:58.400
It's no secret that tablets
are becoming a force

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.334
in the marketplace
and are going to be something

00:23:00.334 --> 00:23:01.868
we're watching
throughout the year.

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:05.234
And as part of this,
CNN has decided that mobile

00:23:05.234 --> 00:23:07.267
is a core strategic priority.

00:23:07.267 --> 00:23:09.734
As part of the strategy
of making sure

00:23:09.734 --> 00:23:11.434
that we meet consumer needs
on mobile,

00:23:11.434 --> 00:23:13.200
we want to make sure
that we're there

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.367
for Android users
around the world.

00:23:15.367 --> 00:23:17.300
We've learned quite a bit
over time.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.968
And what we're trying to do
is to take what we learn

00:23:19.968 --> 00:23:22.934
and put it into a really
compact package

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:24.868
that goes where consumers are.

00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:26.200
So if you take a look,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.801
you can see what we refer
to as the broadsheet here.

00:23:28.801 --> 00:23:30.567
It's a compilation
of content.

00:23:30.567 --> 00:23:34.434
You can have as many
as 350 stories in one sheet.

00:23:34.434 --> 00:23:38.601
However, if you want to dig down
into a more focused thing,

00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:41.434
you can go into the left
fragment there,

00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:43.734
and it goes back to what Hugo
was speaking to

00:23:43.734 --> 00:23:45.767
in terms
of dividing up the screen.

00:23:45.767 --> 00:23:48.300
And then you can pick
a category

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.300
or you can swipe from left
to right.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.567
In addition to that,

00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:54.100
when you find a story
you're interested in,

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.667
you can just go in,
look at the content,

00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:56.701
and then keep on going.

00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:57.767
And I have to tell you,

00:23:57.767 --> 00:23:59.267
based on some
of the experiences

00:23:59.267 --> 00:24:00.767
we're having in testing,

00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:03.534
this is an incredibly
immersive experience.

00:24:03.534 --> 00:24:06.100
Consumers love it and there's
a lot of time spent

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.934
in the application.

00:24:07.934 --> 00:24:10.334
That's, in many respects,
the core of the apps

00:24:10.334 --> 00:24:13.334
because it's so rich
and there's so much to it.

00:24:13.334 --> 00:24:15.667
However, if you look at the top
in the action bar,

00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:18.000
you will see both
an audio update

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.801
and also live video.

00:24:20.801 --> 00:24:22.567
And the live video is something,
of course,

00:24:22.567 --> 00:24:25.033
that goes to the core
of what CNN is all about.

00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:27.367
Here you can see
a live stream.

00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:31.100
We have live streaming video
both from the U.S.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.300
and also internationally.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.100
In this case,
it's some of our coverage

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.934
of the protests in Egypt.

00:24:38.934 --> 00:24:40.467
So you can get a sense
of what's going on.

00:24:40.467 --> 00:24:43.834
We cover both the top stories
and breaking news.

00:24:43.834 --> 00:24:46.534
And we take advantage
of the HLS capabilities

00:24:46.534 --> 00:24:48.534
of Honeycomb
as we're delivering this.

00:24:48.534 --> 00:24:51.367
It's really a stunning
experience.

00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:53.968
Now, these are some
of the aspects

00:24:53.968 --> 00:24:56.100
of our traditional
CNN coverage.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.501
But in addition to that,

00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:00.267
we have an element of the app
that we're building in

00:25:00.267 --> 00:25:01.734
related to iReport.

00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:03.000
And to share more
about that,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.033
I'd like to introduce Lila.

00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:06.901
King: Thank you, Louis.

00:25:06.901 --> 00:25:10.701
iReport is an invitation
to anyone in the world

00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:12.501
to participate in the news.

00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:15.200
And today,
it's a community of about

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.901
3/4 of a million people
who share photos, and videos,

00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:21.400
and stories of things
that are happening

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.734
in their corner
of the world.

00:25:23.734 --> 00:25:26.367
And today, what I'm excited
to show you,

00:25:26.367 --> 00:25:27.634
that for the first time,

00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:29.901
iReport will be available
on a tablet.

00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:32.400
So let's take a look
at what we have.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.100
First, if you tap iReport
in the action bar,

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.968
what you see first
is a gallery

00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:41.000
of the most recently featured
iReports on CNN.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.667
They are--right now,
this is--this is live.

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:44.701
So what you're seeing

00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:46.667
is Super Bowl snow helmets,
right?

00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:49.000
Lots and lots of snow
in the Midwest.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.801
But also, we've very recently
seen video of--

00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:54.701
eyewitness video
of protests in Cairo,

00:25:54.701 --> 00:25:57.868
and--and flooding
in Australia,

00:25:57.868 --> 00:25:59.601
and what people
are actually seeing.

00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:02.434
And all of that gets woven in
to CNN coverage

00:26:02.434 --> 00:26:06.100
all over--all over CNN platforms
every day.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.267
My favorite piece
of the app though

00:26:08.267 --> 00:26:10.868
really is not just
that you can see iReports,

00:26:10.868 --> 00:26:13.167
but you can actually
contribute one yourself.

00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:16.267
So you could imagine
that you're standing

00:26:16.267 --> 00:26:18.100
in the middle
of a news event

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.901
like this one, right?

00:26:19.901 --> 00:26:21.267
And what you're seeing
in front of you

00:26:21.267 --> 00:26:23.601
is something that you just
have to share.

00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:25.934
You have to show
the rest of the world.

00:26:25.934 --> 00:26:29.167
So here in the CNN iReport,
in the app for Android,

00:26:29.167 --> 00:26:32.801
you can choose that you want
to capture a photo or a video.

00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:36.434
Pull up your camera
that we just saw.

00:26:36.434 --> 00:26:38.033
Line up your shot,
right?

00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:40.133
And you could choose
to use the front-facing camera

00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:42.133
if you'd like to describe
what you're seeing

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:45.634
or use the back-facing camera
to actually capture the scene.

00:26:45.634 --> 00:26:49.133
So we've got our shot.
Thank you, Steven.

00:26:49.133 --> 00:26:51.300
We press "OK."

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.100
Write just a little bit
about what it is

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.133
that we're seeing.

00:26:54.133 --> 00:26:55.234
Press "Upload."

00:26:55.234 --> 00:26:57.968
And then the story
goes right into CNN

00:26:57.968 --> 00:27:01.000
and it gets attached
to your account on CNN iReport.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.267
You'll also notice
that in the Honeycomb status bar

00:27:04.267 --> 00:27:05.767
at the bottom
of the screen,

00:27:05.767 --> 00:27:07.767
you're seeing a tiny little
iReport icon

00:27:07.767 --> 00:27:09.701
that's indicating to you
that your story

00:27:09.701 --> 00:27:11.767
is being posted
to iReport right now.

00:27:11.767 --> 00:27:12.767
But if you'd like to,

00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:13.968
you can move on
to something else.

00:27:13.968 --> 00:27:15.400
You could close the app
and your story

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.868
will still make its way
to CNN.

00:27:17.868 --> 00:27:20.567
So I have to say the thing
that I'm most excited about

00:27:20.567 --> 00:27:23.334
is that when iReport
is on this tablet,

00:27:23.334 --> 00:27:26.968
it means that it extends
the invitation to everyone

00:27:26.968 --> 00:27:27.968
to be part of the news

00:27:27.968 --> 00:27:29.801
to a whole new audience
of people.

00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:34.000
And I just--I can't wait
to see what they do with it.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.934
Gump:
So thanks so much, Lila.

00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:37.667
Appreciate
your describing that.

00:27:37.667 --> 00:27:40.634
What a powerful way
to connect the news

00:27:40.634 --> 00:27:42.968
to individuals
and for certain people

00:27:42.968 --> 00:27:44.801
who want to
to feel part of it.

00:27:44.801 --> 00:27:46.501
If you're in Chicago
and you're in the middle

00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:48.534
of the snow, you can still tap
into this event.

00:27:48.534 --> 00:27:51.200
And, likewise, if we're here
in the Valley,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.934
we can still take a look
and understand

00:27:53.934 --> 00:27:56.501
what's going on
in the Midwest.

00:27:56.501 --> 00:28:00.467
Now if we pan back a little bit
and look at the whole package,

00:28:00.467 --> 00:28:02.868
what we'll have
is an application that launches

00:28:02.868 --> 00:28:05.601
on the Xoom Tablet
in the near future.

00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:07.067
And in addition,
will be available

00:28:07.067 --> 00:28:09.667
on other tablets
using the Honeycomb platform

00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:11.701
as they roll out
around the world.

00:28:11.701 --> 00:28:14.701
And that's really exciting
to us at CNN.

00:28:14.701 --> 00:28:17.100
I actually was just
sitting next to someone here

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.267
who said "Hey, you know,
CNN is really well-known

00:28:20.267 --> 00:28:22.701
as a video platform--
a source of video."

00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.634
And that's absolutely true.

00:28:24.634 --> 00:28:26.501
But the combination
of the video,

00:28:26.501 --> 00:28:30.868
and the traditional reporting,
and the imagery together,

00:28:30.868 --> 00:28:32.767
it's just quite powerful.

00:28:32.767 --> 00:28:37.067
And so as people use tablets
and as these grow

00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:39.100
around the world,
we want to be there.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.400
And people--when people
want to connect with the news,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.501
we want to be with them
around the world.

00:28:43.501 --> 00:28:46.234
So thanks very much
for sharing your time with us.

00:28:54.501 --> 00:28:56.334
Barra: Thank you, Louis.
That was really amazing.

00:28:56.334 --> 00:29:01.300
Let's just do a little bit
more multitasking here.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.167
I'm reconnecting
'cause I'm told

00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:05.901
our friend Lady Killer
wants to try and call in.

00:29:05.901 --> 00:29:07.501
We'll see if that happens
in a little bit.

00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:11.434
But, um, well,
let me just segue

00:29:11.434 --> 00:29:13.300
to the rest
of the presentation here.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.901
And if Lady Killer calls in,
we'll take the call.

00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:18.467
Um, so hopefully
what you saw today

00:29:18.467 --> 00:29:21.167
was a really good illustration
of the hard work

00:29:21.167 --> 00:29:22.467
that we've put
into making sure

00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:26.000
that Honeycomb is an amazing
story for developers,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.200
which we think it is.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.300
We think it opens
incredible opportunities

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.167
for innovation
in this new class of devices.

00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:35.267
We certainly cannot even predict
what you,

00:29:35.267 --> 00:29:37.934
the developer community,
are going to build.

00:29:37.934 --> 00:29:43.467
Of course, um, the platform
is just one half of the story.

00:29:43.467 --> 00:29:45.200
The other half of the story

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.234
is how to get these
applications--

00:29:47.234 --> 00:29:49.934
these amazing applications
into the hands of users--

00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:51.000
of people.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.934
And to tell that half
of the story,

00:29:52.934 --> 00:29:55.467
I want to invite my colleague
and friend, Chris Yerga,

00:29:55.467 --> 00:29:57.234
who's Android's
Engineering Director

00:29:57.234 --> 00:29:58.701
for Cloud Services.

00:29:58.701 --> 00:30:02.934
Chris, stage is yours.
Thank you.

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.534
Yerga: Thank you very much,
Hugo.

00:30:04.534 --> 00:30:07.234
So if Lady Killer calls in,
can I speak with him?

00:30:07.234 --> 00:30:08.901
man: Yeah.
Yerga: Okay.

00:30:08.901 --> 00:30:11.367
So Hugo's talking about some of
the improvement's

00:30:11.367 --> 00:30:12.801
we're making in Honeycomb.

00:30:12.801 --> 00:30:15.100
We're also making
some important changes

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.300
to Android Market
that I'd like to tell you about.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.167
The changes we're making,
we're doing so

00:30:20.167 --> 00:30:23.234
in order to meet the needs
of both users and developers.

00:30:23.234 --> 00:30:26.067
For users, to give them
the best experience--

00:30:26.067 --> 00:30:29.133
a variety of ways
to discover applications,

00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:32.534
and also a very seamless path
to purchasing those applications

00:30:32.534 --> 00:30:34.801
and installing them
on their devices.

00:30:34.801 --> 00:30:36.667
For developers,
we want to give them

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:39.667
additional control over how they
promote their applications,

00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:42.133
as well as giving them
some more flexible ways

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:43.934
to monetize those
applications.

00:30:43.934 --> 00:30:46.300
I'm gonna be talking about
all of those things here today.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.767
The first thing
that I'll be announcing

00:30:49.767 --> 00:30:52.300
is something
I'm very excited about.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.100
And while I'm
logging in here,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.434
I would like to just
reiterate something

00:30:56.434 --> 00:30:58.133
that Andy Rubin said
at the outset.

00:30:58.133 --> 00:31:01.100
I'm actually fairly new
to Android--

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.167
fairly new to Google.

00:31:02.167 --> 00:31:04.267
I've been here three months.

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:05.667
But I've been in the industry
for 20 years.

00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:08.200
I've never worked with a team
that is as dedicated

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.267
and hard-working
as the Android team.

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:12.701
And the team that are
putting together

00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:14.234
the things that
I'm showing here today

00:31:14.234 --> 00:31:17.167
have been working tirelessly
to get them ready for you.

00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:20.968
And so I just want to give
a bit of a shout out to them.

00:31:20.968 --> 00:31:24.434
So the first thing
I'm happy to announce today

00:31:24.434 --> 00:31:27.601
is the release of
the Android Market web store.

00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:32.267
The Android Market web store
is basically the new way

00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:34.968
that users can get applications
on their devices.

00:31:34.968 --> 00:31:38.734
Up till now, the way
you would browse applications

00:31:38.734 --> 00:31:42.234
and in stall them is by
using the Android Market client

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:43.434
on your phone.

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:45.467
But now,
with today's release

00:31:45.467 --> 00:31:47.267
of the Android Market
web store,

00:31:47.267 --> 00:31:48.834
users can go
to their browser,

00:31:48.834 --> 00:31:51.334
discover and browse
through the entire catalog

00:31:51.334 --> 00:31:54.100
of Android applications
on Android Market

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.968
as well as install
and purchase

00:31:55.968 --> 00:31:58.000
directly to their device
from the web.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.968
So let's take a look.

00:32:04.801 --> 00:32:08.534
So as we've been building
Android Market,

00:32:08.534 --> 00:32:12.267
we've kept in mind that
there's a variety

00:32:12.267 --> 00:32:16.367
of different ways that users
discover applications.

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:18.834
Sometimes I'm coming
to the Market,

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:21.534
and I might not have
something very specific

00:32:21.534 --> 00:32:22.734
that I'm looking for.

00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:24.100
I'm more in a browsing mood,
right?

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.400
So what I want to do is
I want to come to the store

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.334
and have a variety of
different kinds of content

00:32:29.334 --> 00:32:32.334
sort of offered up to me that
I can easily search through.

00:32:32.334 --> 00:32:34.334
The home page of Android Market
on the web

00:32:34.334 --> 00:32:36.100
delivers exactly that.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.734
As you can see here
from the top,

00:32:37.734 --> 00:32:39.901
we have a carousel
that shows a variety

00:32:39.901 --> 00:32:42.234
of promotional banners
for applications

00:32:42.234 --> 00:32:44.000
that cycles through.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.133
I can click through them
and see the different apps here.

00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:47.901
Additionally, underneath,
you'll see

00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:51.267
the familiar categories from
Android Market on your device.

00:32:51.267 --> 00:32:54.601
Featured Applications, as well
as Top Paid and Top Free.

00:32:54.601 --> 00:32:57.367
And additionally,
we have categories

00:32:57.367 --> 00:32:59.501
that can be browsed
on the left-hand side.

00:32:59.501 --> 00:33:01.868
But I think I'm gonna
take a look here

00:33:01.868 --> 00:33:03.968
through some of
the Featured Applications

00:33:03.968 --> 00:33:07.667
and see if there's anything
that catches my eye.

00:33:07.667 --> 00:33:10.234
You know, I'm sure Kenny
Chesney's a terrific singer,

00:33:10.234 --> 00:33:12.434
but that's not really the kind
of app I'm looking for.

00:33:12.434 --> 00:33:15.133
But hey, this Zenonia, actually,
is catching my eye.

00:33:15.133 --> 00:33:16.968
So if I click in here,

00:33:16.968 --> 00:33:20.701
it takes me to the applications
detail page for this app.

00:33:20.701 --> 00:33:22.734
And so the first thing
you'll notice

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:24.534
is that the page is
graphically rich,

00:33:24.534 --> 00:33:25.968
and it looks terrific.

00:33:25.968 --> 00:33:28.934
And it looks terrific in a way
that developers can control.

00:33:28.934 --> 00:33:33.100
In anticipation of launching
Android Market on the web,

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.167
we've enabled features
for developers

00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:38.367
that enable them to upload
these high-resolution banners

00:33:38.367 --> 00:33:39.868
to promote their
applications,

00:33:39.868 --> 00:33:43.601
as well as the larger-size icons
over here on the left.

00:33:43.601 --> 00:33:46.000
And so by doing so,
developers are able to make sure

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.534
that when people come
and look at their applications

00:33:48.534 --> 00:33:50.033
on the Android Market
web site,

00:33:50.033 --> 00:33:51.634
they look their best.

00:33:51.634 --> 00:33:53.567
Additionally, you'll see here
on the left,

00:33:53.567 --> 00:33:55.434
since this developer
has other applications

00:33:55.434 --> 00:33:57.501
in Android Market,
they show up here,

00:33:57.501 --> 00:33:59.267
so the folks can
easily find that.

00:33:59.267 --> 00:34:01.367
And then all the information
a user needs

00:34:01.367 --> 00:34:02.934
to make a decision
about whether this is

00:34:02.934 --> 00:34:05.567
an interesting application
for them, as on the page.

00:34:05.567 --> 00:34:08.067
We have a description,
user reviews,

00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:11.734
as well as application screen
shots that I can look at.

00:34:11.734 --> 00:34:15.133
And so, having looked
at this screen shot,

00:34:15.133 --> 00:34:16.934
this actually does look like
a pretty cool app.

00:34:16.934 --> 00:34:19.567
I think I'm gonna purchase it
and install it onto my device.

00:34:19.567 --> 00:34:22.267
I'd like to show you
how seamless that is.

00:34:22.267 --> 00:34:24.167
So there's a "buy" button
right here on the page.

00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:26.968
When I click on it,
it opens up this window

00:34:26.968 --> 00:34:29.667
that pops up, shows me
the permissions for the app,

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:33.234
asks me which device
I want to install to.

00:34:33.234 --> 00:34:35.767
Since I only have one device
registered to this account,

00:34:35.767 --> 00:34:37.334
it's pre-populated for me.

00:34:37.334 --> 00:34:40.267
But if I had multiple devices
and tablets, et cetera,

00:34:40.267 --> 00:34:42.968
this list would be filtered
to just those devices

00:34:42.968 --> 00:34:45.167
that are compatible
with this application.

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.634
So I'm gonna go ahead
and purchase it.

00:34:47.634 --> 00:34:51.667
And by clicking
on the "continue" button here,

00:34:51.667 --> 00:34:53.300
it brings me--

00:34:53.300 --> 00:35:01.300
Oh, I dismissed instead of
continued here.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.968
Clicking on "continue,"

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:05.000
it brings up
a purchase dialogue here.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.968
And essentially,
all I need to do

00:35:06.968 --> 00:35:09.167
with one additional click
is complete my purchase.

00:35:09.167 --> 00:35:14.534
However...I'm gonna put this
on the Google corporate card.

00:35:14.534 --> 00:35:17.100
That okay, Andy?

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.968
So I complete my purchase,

00:35:19.968 --> 00:35:22.501
and it starts charging
my credit card.

00:35:22.501 --> 00:35:26.167
And so this is where some
of the real cloud magic happens

00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:28.300
because as it's processing
my order,

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.767
as soon as that credit card
transaction completes,

00:35:30.767 --> 00:35:34.334
what happens is, if we switch
over here to my phone,

00:35:34.334 --> 00:35:37.400
you can see that I've got
a notification right up here,

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.033
and the application is
already downloading

00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:40.501
directly to my phone.

00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:43.334
To this works the same way
that all of our Google

00:35:43.334 --> 00:35:45.033
Cloud-powered services work.

00:35:45.033 --> 00:35:47.367
There's no wires, there's no
synching with computers--

00:35:47.367 --> 00:35:48.968
none of that sort
of nonsense.

00:35:48.968 --> 00:35:50.501
Everything is connected.

00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:52.901
Your phone's connected
to the Cloud,

00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:55.667
your Android Market browser
is connected to the Cloud.

00:35:55.667 --> 00:35:57.534
And so everything
just works seamlessly

00:35:57.534 --> 00:35:59.100
synching between the two.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.033
And so now, just
in a few short seconds here,

00:36:03.033 --> 00:36:05.667
I actually have the game
successfully installed

00:36:05.667 --> 00:36:08.968
on my Nexus phone.

00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:13.200
So that's one way
of discovering applications.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.300
But frequently,
in addition to browsing

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.834
through a marketplace,

00:36:17.834 --> 00:36:20.601
I often get recommendations
from my friends

00:36:20.601 --> 00:36:23.501
about applications
I should look at.

00:36:23.501 --> 00:36:25.334
And so the Android Market
web site

00:36:25.334 --> 00:36:28.000
enables a lot of scenarios
around this

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.300
that are very fast
and flexible and easy.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.000
I'd like to show
some of them to you.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.667
So I recently had lunch
with a buddy of mine, Randy,

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:37.601
and he was recommending
a news reader app

00:36:37.601 --> 00:36:39.200
that he thought
I should check out.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.467
So he sent me this
email here.

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.267
And if I click on the link
that he grabbed

00:36:45.267 --> 00:36:47.067
right off the Android Market
web site,

00:36:47.067 --> 00:36:48.534
it takes me directly,
deep-linked,

00:36:48.534 --> 00:36:50.734
to the application's
details page

00:36:50.734 --> 00:36:52.467
for this Pulse News Reader app.

00:36:52.467 --> 00:36:55.801
So I guess it turns out
that Randy and I have

00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:58.267
a similar taste in apps
because this is an application

00:36:58.267 --> 00:36:59.734
I've already installed.

00:36:59.734 --> 00:37:01.968
And Android Market web site
knows that this is

00:37:01.968 --> 00:37:03.634
already installed
on my device,

00:37:03.634 --> 00:37:05.200
and tells me that here.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.300
Another thing that is
interesting here

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.200
is that in addition
to the screen shots and banners,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.234
this developer has uploaded
a YouTube video

00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:16.334
to promote other application.

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:18.300
So we've also been
enabling features

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.801
on the Android Market
publisher site

00:37:20.801 --> 00:37:23.300
to enable developers
to upload YouTube videos

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.033
as another way to flexibly
promote their applications,

00:37:26.033 --> 00:37:27.667
get their message across
to users

00:37:27.667 --> 00:37:30.067
when they're here
on the Android Market web site.

00:37:30.067 --> 00:37:32.033
So since I have used
this application

00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:33.934
and I really do like it,

00:37:33.934 --> 00:37:37.267
I would like to share it
with my friends as well.

00:37:37.267 --> 00:37:39.534
But instead of sending an email,
I think I'm gonna tweet

00:37:39.534 --> 00:37:41.300
about it to my followers
on Twitter.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.300
And so if you notice here
on the right-hand side,

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.734
there's a tweet button.

00:37:44.734 --> 00:37:48.234
If I click on this, it pops up
a little dialogue from Twitter.

00:37:48.234 --> 00:37:52.334
It's pre-populated with the link
already pre-shortened

00:37:52.334 --> 00:37:55.868
to the application
on Android Market on the Web.

00:37:55.868 --> 00:38:00.067
And so I can customize
the link here

00:38:00.067 --> 00:38:02.934
and send it out
to my followers on Twitter.

00:38:02.934 --> 00:38:05.434
And as soon as that's completed,

00:38:05.434 --> 00:38:06.601
it'll show up on Twitter,

00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:08.267
and anybody
who gets that message

00:38:08.267 --> 00:38:09.834
can then click on it

00:38:09.834 --> 00:38:12.133
and be taken directly
to the Android Market Web store.

00:38:12.133 --> 00:38:14.334
So I can pop over
to Twitter here

00:38:14.334 --> 00:38:19.067
and show you how this shows up

00:38:19.067 --> 00:38:20.667
in my stream,

00:38:20.667 --> 00:38:21.968
and there's something
kind of cool

00:38:21.968 --> 00:38:23.801
about the way these links work,
so if I click

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:25.100
on the link from my computer,

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.334
no surprise,
takes me right back

00:38:26.334 --> 00:38:28.701
to the Android Market
web site where I was.

00:38:28.701 --> 00:38:29.934
But the other thing
I want to do

00:38:29.934 --> 00:38:31.334
is go over here
to my phone

00:38:31.334 --> 00:38:33.934
and show you
how the phone experience works.

00:38:33.934 --> 00:38:37.868
These links do the appropriate
thing if you're either

00:38:37.868 --> 00:38:42.601
on your Android device or if
you're on your browser here.

00:38:42.601 --> 00:38:45.534
And so as we see here,
my tweet just showed up.

00:38:45.534 --> 00:38:47.167
So I can click
on that hello one

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:49.200
and follow the link.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.634
And when I do follow this link,

00:38:52.634 --> 00:38:54.634
what happens
is that it understands

00:38:54.634 --> 00:38:57.267
that this is a link to an
application on Android Market,

00:38:57.267 --> 00:39:00.234
and so it takes me directly
to the Android Market client

00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:02.067
on my phone,
which is a more convenient way

00:39:02.067 --> 00:39:03.667
for me to install
this application

00:39:03.667 --> 00:39:08.200
for my mobile device.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.133
So the final way
that people get applications

00:39:13.133 --> 00:39:14.400
is sometimes you have
a pretty good idea

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.701
of what it is exactly
you're looking for.

00:39:16.701 --> 00:39:18.033
You might know
the specific application,

00:39:18.033 --> 00:39:19.567
or you might have an idea

00:39:19.567 --> 00:39:21.767
of the kind of application
you're looking for.

00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:23.734
In this case,

00:39:23.734 --> 00:39:26.267
my family and I
are planning

00:39:26.267 --> 00:39:27.567
a trip to Japan.

00:39:27.567 --> 00:39:29.868
My daughter's
already been studying Japanese,

00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:31.868
and she's been telling me
that I have to brush up

00:39:31.868 --> 00:39:33.067
on my katakana.

00:39:33.067 --> 00:39:35.667
So I'm gonna search
for katakana

00:39:35.667 --> 00:39:37.133
here on the Android Market
web site.

00:39:37.133 --> 00:39:39.767
And when I do, I get a list
of relevant search results

00:39:39.767 --> 00:39:41.834
from all the applications
on Android Market.

00:39:41.834 --> 00:39:44.100
But I also have
some additional options here

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.701
about how I can present
this list.

00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:48.801
I can elect to show
only paid or free apps

00:39:48.801 --> 00:39:50.133
or the combination,
the both.

00:39:50.133 --> 00:39:53.534
I can also filter by
applications that are compatible

00:39:53.534 --> 00:39:55.567
with specific devices
that I own.

00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:57.501
In my case,
I'm kind of curious to see

00:39:57.501 --> 00:40:00.167
what other users
have found useful,

00:40:00.167 --> 00:40:02.801
so I'm gonna sort
by popularity here.

00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:06.033
And this looks interesting.

00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:08.334
So I'm gonna go ahead
and go in here and,

00:40:08.334 --> 00:40:10.934
since this
is a free application,

00:40:10.934 --> 00:40:12.234
installing it on my phone

00:40:12.234 --> 00:40:15.734
is merely a one-click process
of clicking

00:40:15.734 --> 00:40:17.200
on the install button.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.467
And once again it starts
"automagically" downloading

00:40:20.467 --> 00:40:23.334
to my phone.

00:40:23.334 --> 00:40:26.601
Having downloaded a number
of applications,

00:40:26.601 --> 00:40:28.467
there's one final thing
I'd like to show you here,

00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:31.200
which is
the My Market account screen.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.701
So when I go into My Market
account, it presents a list

00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:39.400
of all the applications
that I've previously purchased

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.400
so that I could do things,
like, click on them

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.400
and install them
to an alternate device

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.400
if I got a new phone
or a new tablet.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.400
I can also go
into my settings page here

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.000
and give a nickname
to individual devices,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.400
so if I have, like,
a personal phone

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.601
and a work phone,

00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:59.634
I can keep those--
keep easier track of them

00:40:59.634 --> 00:41:02.367
so that I know
which applications are going

00:41:02.367 --> 00:41:03.634
to which devices.

00:41:03.634 --> 00:41:07.567
So that's
the Android Market Web site.

00:41:07.567 --> 00:41:09.801
It is live right now
on the Internet.

00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:13.367
So we encourage everybody
to come to market.android.com

00:41:13.367 --> 00:41:18.200
and see the great work
that the team has been doing.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.267
So the next thing
I want to talk about

00:41:20.267 --> 00:41:24.934
is related to how users
purchase applications.

00:41:24.934 --> 00:41:29.267
So Android has a global base
of both users and developers.

00:41:29.267 --> 00:41:33.400
But currently in Android market,
if a user is purchasing

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.734
an application in a currency
that's different

00:41:35.734 --> 00:41:37.968
from the one the developer
is selling in,

00:41:37.968 --> 00:41:40.734
the currency gets converted

00:41:40.734 --> 00:41:43.667
based on an exchange rate,
and so it can be a bit

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.634
of a confusing experience
for the user.

00:41:45.634 --> 00:41:48.300
Sometimes the prices are,
you know, funny numbers.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.968
And developers also kind of feel
like, you know, they want

00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:54.000
to remove
some of that confusion

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.200
as well as have
a little bit more control

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.400
over how their applications
are priced

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.834
in different currencies.

00:41:58.834 --> 00:42:03.200
So today we're announcing
that buyer currency support

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.868
is coming to Android Market.

00:42:04.868 --> 00:42:08.033
What this means is that,
in the developer console,

00:42:08.033 --> 00:42:10.434
when developers upload
their applications,

00:42:10.434 --> 00:42:12.267
for the currencies
that are supported,

00:42:12.267 --> 00:42:15.567
they can go in and enter
explicit prices

00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:16.934
for various currencies.

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:19.501
That way, it gives the user
a consistent experience,

00:42:19.501 --> 00:42:21.367
gives the developer
a little bit more control

00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:23.234
over how their applications
are priced

00:42:23.234 --> 00:42:25.501
in different markets.

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:28.067
The way we're rolling this out
is in a phased manner.

00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:31.434
So what's gonna happen
is today the developer console

00:42:31.434 --> 00:42:34.334
is gonna turn on for
the initial set of currencies

00:42:34.334 --> 00:42:36.100
for U.S. sellers.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.801
Developers will be able
to go in there

00:42:37.801 --> 00:42:40.634
and set those override prices
if they wish to.

00:42:40.634 --> 00:42:42.334
If they don't,
then everything continues

00:42:42.334 --> 00:42:44.300
working the same way
it does today.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.367
And then over the coming months,
we'll be adding new currencies

00:42:47.367 --> 00:42:50.434
and new seller support.

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:52.267
Now the final thing,

00:42:52.267 --> 00:42:54.767
and Lady Killer
still hasn't called,

00:42:54.767 --> 00:42:57.501
so...

00:42:57.501 --> 00:43:01.133
The final thing I want
to show today is something

00:43:01.133 --> 00:43:03.701
that's very exciting to us
here at Android Market.

00:43:03.701 --> 00:43:06.734
We've gotten a fair amount
of consistent feedback

00:43:06.734 --> 00:43:08.701
from developers
that they would like

00:43:08.701 --> 00:43:12.000
to have additional ways
to monetize their applications

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.567
on Android Market.

00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:17.834
So I'm very pleased
to announce that support

00:43:17.834 --> 00:43:21.400
for In-App purchases is coming
to Android Market applications.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:25.000
Now what this means
is that developers who integrate

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.167
with our In-App purchasing SDK
will be able to sell

00:43:28.167 --> 00:43:29.934
a variety of virtual goods

00:43:29.934 --> 00:43:32.300
directly from within
their applications.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.701
So examples could be
a game might sell

00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:36.834
additional levels
or consumables

00:43:36.834 --> 00:43:40.467
or even virtual currency
that could be used in-game.

00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:43.801
Other applications might
use this to unlock features

00:43:43.801 --> 00:43:45.767
or premium versions
of the applications.

00:43:45.767 --> 00:43:48.534
I mean, there's really
a wide variety of different ways

00:43:48.534 --> 00:43:50.701
In-App purchasing could be used
by developers.

00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:53.267
And we're very excited to see
how they use it.

00:43:53.267 --> 00:43:56.934
We've been working
with a couple developers

00:43:56.934 --> 00:43:58.968
initially
to get some feedback

00:43:58.968 --> 00:44:01.100
on the In-App purchasing SDK

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.834
and also to get
some integrations going

00:44:03.834 --> 00:44:06.534
to see how--
what they do with it.

00:44:06.534 --> 00:44:10.634
And so I'm very happy
to invite one of them

00:44:10.634 --> 00:44:12.701
up on stage here with me today.

00:44:12.701 --> 00:44:15.434
I'd like you all to welcome
Bart Decrem.

00:44:15.434 --> 00:44:19.234
He is the general manager
of Disney Mobile.

00:44:19.234 --> 00:44:21.934
And he's got some exciting news

00:44:21.934 --> 00:44:23.534
about their support
of Android Market

00:44:23.534 --> 00:44:25.801
and what they've done
with the In-App purchasing SDK.

00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:27.801
Bart?

00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:29.234
Decrem: Thanks, Chris.

00:44:29.234 --> 00:44:30.901
I'm Bart.
Although, I think

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.167
some of you know me better

00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:34.968
by my nickname,
Lady Killer.

00:44:34.968 --> 00:44:36.767
Anyway, it's really great
to be here

00:44:36.767 --> 00:44:38.501
for the announcement today.

00:44:38.501 --> 00:44:41.601
I think at Disney
we're a really good example

00:44:41.601 --> 00:44:43.868
of what's going on
in mobile today.

00:44:43.868 --> 00:44:46.234
We're bringing
some of the most beloved brands

00:44:46.234 --> 00:44:47.667
and characters
and stories

00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:49.868
to a new generation
of mobile devices

00:44:49.868 --> 00:44:52.234
that are just really powerful
and fun

00:44:52.234 --> 00:44:55.100
and just generally awesome.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.734
And at Disney Mobile,
to date,

00:44:57.734 --> 00:45:02.100
we've had about somewhere
over 60 million app downloads

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.734
already on other platforms,

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.901
and I think, now
that we're coming to Android,

00:45:05.901 --> 00:45:08.167
that number's about to get
a lot bigger.

00:45:08.167 --> 00:45:11.133
So today I'm really
excited to announce that,

00:45:11.133 --> 00:45:13.367
for the first time ever,
we're bringing three

00:45:13.367 --> 00:45:17.234
of our key apps
to the Android platform.

00:45:17.234 --> 00:45:20.334
First, Radio Disney.

00:45:20.334 --> 00:45:23.367
Radio Disney...not a lot
of kids and tweens

00:45:23.367 --> 00:45:24.968
in the audience
here today,

00:45:24.968 --> 00:45:26.567
but it's really
a bit of a phenomenon

00:45:26.567 --> 00:45:29.734
with young kids
and with tweens in the U.S.,

00:45:29.734 --> 00:45:31.467
but really
all around the world.

00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:34.033
And with the new
Radio Disney app,

00:45:34.033 --> 00:45:35.734
you'll be able--
the kids will be able

00:45:35.734 --> 00:45:38.334
to stream music straight
to their Android device,

00:45:38.334 --> 00:45:40.567
and they'll be
able to talk back.

00:45:40.567 --> 00:45:44.634
Send out shout-outs and song
requests to Radio Disney.

00:45:44.634 --> 00:45:46.667
The app's already been
downloaded millions of times

00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:49.000
on other platforms, and now
we're bringing it to Android.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.868
We're demoing it
in the other room,

00:45:50.868 --> 00:45:54.534
and it will be launching over
the next couple of weeks.

00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:57.767
The second app that we're
bringing to Android,

00:45:57.767 --> 00:46:00.567
and that will be this Spring,
is "Jelly Car."

00:46:00.567 --> 00:46:02.501
And some of you may be
familiar with "Jelly Car."

00:46:02.501 --> 00:46:03.968
It's one of the
most popular apps

00:46:03.968 --> 00:46:08.267
that we originally developed
for Mobile at Disney.

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:10.434
It's the
original physics game.

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.234
which, of course, has become
a really big category

00:46:12.234 --> 00:46:13.400
over the last year.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.000
And what you do is you tilt,
and you tap,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.534
and you pinch your phone,
to navigate your car

00:46:17.534 --> 00:46:19.467
through a set of obstacles
to the next level.

00:46:19.467 --> 00:46:21.767
And so it really takes advantage
of all the capabilities

00:46:21.767 --> 00:46:23.934
of these
Android devices.

00:46:23.934 --> 00:46:25.534
That's also another
app that's been

00:46:25.534 --> 00:46:27.067
downloaded millions
of times.

00:46:27.067 --> 00:46:31.801
And we think we're gonna see
really big numbers on Android.

00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:35.267
And then finally,
I'm especially delighted,

00:46:35.267 --> 00:46:37.033
having worked on this
with the team

00:46:37.033 --> 00:46:40.167
for three years now, to announce
that we'll be bringing

00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:42.634
"Tap Tap Revenge"
to Android.

00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:44.701
As you may know,
"Tap Tap Revenge"

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.567
is our most
successful franchise.

00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:48.100
And I think it's
one of the most

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.834
popular apps ever,
on any mobile platform.

00:46:50.834 --> 00:46:54.167
And now we're bringing it
in it's full glory to Android,

00:46:54.167 --> 00:46:57.033
with all of the social features,
all the game play,

00:46:57.033 --> 00:47:02.534
and then, most importantly,
all the music that is

00:47:02.534 --> 00:47:04.300
so powerful
for our audiences.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.234
So we've got
Lady Gaga, Katy Perry,

00:47:06.234 --> 00:47:09.601
Linkin Park, Bruno Mars,
in the game.

00:47:09.601 --> 00:47:11.501
And "Tap Tap Revenge"
has been downloaded

00:47:11.501 --> 00:47:15.067
somewhere north of
50,000,000 times right now.

00:47:15.067 --> 00:47:19.033
And we've sold more than
25,000,000 songs

00:47:19.033 --> 00:47:21.067
in our In-App platform

00:47:21.067 --> 00:47:24.234
across these different
versions of the game.

00:47:24.234 --> 00:47:28.801
And because giving our users
the music that they love

00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:31.033
and the hits that they love,
is so critical

00:47:31.033 --> 00:47:33.234
to the user experience
in "Tap Tap Revenge,"

00:47:33.234 --> 00:47:36.167
we've waited until
the announcement here today

00:47:36.167 --> 00:47:39.167
of In-App billing to bring
"Tap Tap Revenge" to Android.

00:47:39.167 --> 00:47:42.567
So let's see
what it looks like.

00:47:42.567 --> 00:47:47.033
If we can switch
to the device.

00:47:47.033 --> 00:47:53.367
There we go.

00:47:53.367 --> 00:47:55.701
So here I'm running
"Tap Tap Revenge"

00:47:55.701 --> 00:47:58.100
on a Nexus S.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.601
But you can run it on
any YVGA Android device

00:48:02.601 --> 00:48:06.834
that's running
Android 2.1 or higher.

00:48:06.834 --> 00:48:08.634
And as you can see,
this is the latest version

00:48:08.634 --> 00:48:10.000
of "Tap Tap Revenge."

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.767
It's "Tap Tap Revenge 4".

00:48:12.767 --> 00:48:14.000
And we're showing off
some of the big hits

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.400
here on the home page.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.000
And what I'm gonna do is

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.834
I wanna get some Bruno Mars.

00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:22.033
So we'll tap on the icon,

00:48:22.033 --> 00:48:24.167
and it'll take you
to our store

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:26.033
that's inside the app.

00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:29.434
And then all you do is you tap
to purchase the Track Pack.

00:48:29.434 --> 00:48:32.601
And this is the new In-App
purchasing UI from Android.

00:48:32.601 --> 00:48:34.667
And as you see--
you see the price,

00:48:34.667 --> 00:48:37.300
which we specify
as a developer.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.300
And then the user has the credit
cards that they've entered,

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.801
or carrier billing that's
available for that device.

00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:47.267
And you can just
leave that to a default,

00:48:47.267 --> 00:48:48.567
or you can change it.

00:48:48.567 --> 00:48:50.567
And then I'm going to
tap on the Buy button.

00:48:50.567 --> 00:48:53.534
And here goes the In-App
purchase transaction.

00:48:53.534 --> 00:48:55.300
And there it is.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.300
I just purchased Bruno Mars.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.868
And so we've preloaded it
here for the demos,

00:48:59.868 --> 00:49:01.901
so I can simply
click here now

00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:03.934
to go ahead and
play the song.

00:49:03.934 --> 00:49:07.501
And the song that I'm loading
is, again, it's Bruno Mars.

00:49:07.501 --> 00:49:11.200
He's really the biggest new
music sensation of the year.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.067
Came out of nowhere,
has had two big hits.

00:49:14.067 --> 00:49:15.601
This is
a new song by him.

00:49:15.601 --> 00:49:17.234
And it's called
"Somewhere in Brooklyn."

00:49:17.234 --> 00:49:18.968
And let's see how well I do
with the device

00:49:18.968 --> 00:49:20.701
sort of flat on the table.

00:49:20.701 --> 00:49:23.734
Mars: 21 years old,
I lost her in the cold.

00:49:23.734 --> 00:49:25.467
Decrem: Bruno Mars has been
nominated for, I think,

00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:27.534
seven Grammy Awards,
and the Grammys

00:49:27.534 --> 00:49:28.767
are coming up
in just a week.

00:49:28.767 --> 00:49:32.367
So you'll be hearing
a lot more of him.

00:49:32.367 --> 00:49:33.534
Doing all right so far.

00:49:33.534 --> 00:49:35.033
It's kind of an
easy level, actually.

00:49:35.033 --> 00:49:37.334
I cheated a little bit
that way.

00:49:37.334 --> 00:49:40.000
So that's "Tap Tap Revenge"
on Android.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.701
And it's coming this Spring

00:49:41.701 --> 00:49:44.400
with the launch of
In-App billing on Androids.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:52.267
Thank You.

00:49:52.267 --> 00:49:54.367
Yerga: Thanks a lot.

00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:56.067
So, if I
remember correctly,

00:49:56.067 --> 00:49:59.267
we just gave you access to
the SDK fairly recently.

00:49:59.267 --> 00:50:01.067
Uh, how long did it take you
to get this working?

00:50:01.067 --> 00:50:02.701
Decrem: Yeah, well,
we've had a team of developers

00:50:02.701 --> 00:50:04.667
working on the Android version
of "Tap Tap Revenge"

00:50:04.667 --> 00:50:05.868
for several months now.

00:50:05.868 --> 00:50:07.400
That's been a really great
experience.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.534
And the people we have working
on this are very talented.

00:50:09.534 --> 00:50:11.334
But I think we got
the Code Drop,

00:50:11.334 --> 00:50:13.067
the latest code
for In-App billing,

00:50:13.067 --> 00:50:14.634
I think we got it
just five days ago.

00:50:14.634 --> 00:50:16.434
So great, talented engineers,
but really,

00:50:16.434 --> 00:50:17.868
a great code base
for the integration.

00:50:17.868 --> 00:50:19.267
It was really easy
for us to do.

00:50:19.267 --> 00:50:20.434
Yerga: That's terrific.
Thank you very much.

00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:22.534
Decrem: Thank you, Chris.

00:50:22.534 --> 00:50:25.634
Yerga: So today
we're gonna be releasing

00:50:25.634 --> 00:50:29.601
developer documentation
for Inn-App purchasing

00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:31.267
as well as sample code.

00:50:31.267 --> 00:50:34.400
And, as I said, we've been
working with a few

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.667
developers to get
some early feedback on it.

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:38.934
Now we're going to release it

00:50:38.934 --> 00:50:40.834
to the entire Android
Developer community,

00:50:40.834 --> 00:50:42.400
seeking to get
some additional feedback

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.767
on the SDK,

00:50:43.767 --> 00:50:46.767
and we're going to be
releasing it live to users

00:50:46.767 --> 00:50:49.734
prior to the end
of this quarter.

00:50:49.734 --> 00:50:52.334
So, uh, there's been
a lot of stuff

00:50:52.334 --> 00:50:53.901
we've talked about today.

00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:57.067
I think it's about time
to wrap up.

00:50:57.067 --> 00:50:58.934
Uh, Hugo?

00:50:58.934 --> 00:51:00.300
Barra: Yeah?

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.734
Yerga: There's some guy looking
at me from your tablet.

00:51:02.734 --> 00:51:06.000
Barra: Oh, it's Lady Killer.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.033
Let's switch over.

00:51:08.033 --> 00:51:10.133
Can we get--
Can we go hot here?

00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:11.767
Yeah?

00:51:11.767 --> 00:51:13.667
Hey, Cee Lo.

00:51:13.667 --> 00:51:14.868
Cee Lo: Yo.

00:51:14.868 --> 00:51:16.067
Barra: How are you, man?

00:51:16.067 --> 00:51:17.100
Thanks for joining us.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.200
Cee Lo:
No problem, no problem.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.701
Ahem.

00:51:20.701 --> 00:51:24.801
Barra: Hey, uh, we're, uh--
We're just calling to say

00:51:24.801 --> 00:51:26.033
that we're really looking
forward to seeing you

00:51:26.033 --> 00:51:27.601
at the Grammys next week.

00:51:27.601 --> 00:51:29.567
We heard you're performing
with Gwyneth and The Muppets.

00:51:29.567 --> 00:51:31.033
That sounds pretty awesome.

00:51:31.033 --> 00:51:34.133
Cee Lo: Yeah, it's gonna
be real cool.

00:51:34.133 --> 00:51:35.501
Barra: That's awesome, man.

00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:38.534
And, uh, what else
are you up to?

00:51:38.534 --> 00:51:39.868
Cee Lo: Just that.

00:51:39.868 --> 00:51:42.734
I'm doing a little touring
in support of the album,

00:51:42.734 --> 00:51:44.067
which is doing very well.

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:47.000
Uh, you know, having
a little fun in the process,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.200
but working very hard
at the moment.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.033
Barra: That sounds like us
on this end, man.

00:51:51.033 --> 00:51:52.434
We're having a ton of fun

00:51:52.434 --> 00:51:54.234
and working very hard
at the same time.

00:51:54.234 --> 00:51:56.667
You're probably working
harder than us, though.

00:51:56.667 --> 00:51:59.267
Cee Lo: No, no, no,
we're neck and neck.

00:51:59.267 --> 00:52:00.934
Hard work is hard work.

00:52:00.934 --> 00:52:03.234
Bara: Hey, Cee Lo, all the best
next week, man.

00:52:03.234 --> 00:52:04.400
Thanks for joining us.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.767
Cee Lo: Thank you
for having me.

00:52:05.767 --> 00:52:07.400
Barra: Yeah, talk to you
soon, man. Later.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.400
Cee Lo: Peace.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.567
Barra: Peace.

00:52:15.701 --> 00:52:18.834
Yerga: All right,
so thanks, everyone, for coming.

00:52:18.834 --> 00:52:23.234
I would now like to invite you
to come into the back

00:52:23.234 --> 00:52:24.834
and look
at our demo stations,

00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:28.100
where we have 18 developers
showing off applications

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.267
optimized for Honeycomb,
In-App billing,

00:52:30.267 --> 00:52:32.367
and all of the new features
we've announced today.

00:52:32.367 --> 00:52:33.868
And for those of you
who are coming

00:52:33.868 --> 00:52:37.033
to Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona later this month,

00:52:37.033 --> 00:52:38.534
we're gonna have
over 50 developers

00:52:38.534 --> 00:52:41.100
showing off
Honeycomb-optimized apps there.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.167
Developers have really been
the fuel

00:52:43.167 --> 00:52:44.501
behind a lot
of Android's success,

00:52:44.501 --> 00:52:45.901
and we think this year's
gonna be

00:52:45.901 --> 00:52:48.033
bigger and better than ever
with these announcements.

00:52:48.033 --> 00:52:50.601
Thank you very much.
