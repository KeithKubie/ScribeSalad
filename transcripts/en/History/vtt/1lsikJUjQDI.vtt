00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:02.961
HOST: All right, gentlemen.

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:03.962
There will be a strength
test, a sharpness test,

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.255
and up first, the kill test.

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:06.423
Doug?

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.758
[music playing]

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.677
DOUG: To see how
lethal your weapon is,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.887
I will take your spear
and deliver lethal blows

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:14.556
on this pig carcass.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.515
Matt, you're up first.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.474
Are you ready?

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:17.684
Ready as I'll ever be.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.018
DOUG: Let's do this.

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.104
MATT: What I'm
most worried about

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.773
is lateral force on
this spear, because it's

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.609
a very thin, sleek spear.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.946

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.677
[music playing]

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.562
Well, that sucks.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.316
[music playing]

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.617
Matt, I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it-- this is bad.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.827
Your weapon has suffered
a catastrophic failure,

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.412
and cannot continue
with testing.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.498
However, John, we
can't just declare

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.999
you the [inaudible] champion.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.752
Your blade has to hold
up for at least a stab

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.796
and a slash on this carcass.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.047
Doug?

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:32.467
[music playing]

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.178
JOHN: I don't know what to say,
I don't know what to think.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.890
I've never been more, you
know, nervous in my life.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.560
I'm hoping and praying that it
doesn't break in the same spot.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.396
[music playing]

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.503
Bladesmiths, as
they're designed,

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.131
these tests push your
weapons to the limit.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.468
John, your blade survived
the two cuts on our carcass.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:18.054
Matt, that means,
unfortunately, your blade

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:19.764
did not make the cut,
and I have to ask

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.308
you to please leave the forge.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.226
Congrats, man.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.143
I'm happy for you.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.020
[music playing]

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.689
I'm disappointed.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.650
Given what I know now, I would
have gone back and really

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.902
tried chopping something
very hard with the spear,

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.321
and hopefully broken
the handle myself.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.031
I'm really happy for John.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:38.032
Maybe I'm not happy to lose to
John, but I'm glad John won.
