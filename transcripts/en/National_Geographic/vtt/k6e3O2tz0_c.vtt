Spending just a few days
and weeks with these monkeys,

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.838
you start to see their
individual personalities

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.372
start to emerge.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.007
Some of them are chatty,

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.541
some of them are kind of quiet,

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:12.144
others are just plain old mean.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.480 align:start size:94% position:6%
And while it's
interesting to watch this

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.916 align:start size:84% position:16%
just from a human
observer perspective,

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:21.187
this is also really valuable
information for scientists.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.323 line:0%
By tracking individuals
from dawn until dusk,

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.758 line:0%
everyday,

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:28.561 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
we can take this kind of
individual level information,

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.930 align:start size:91% position:9% line:0%
and learn about their
structure of their society.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.232
Like who's related to whom,

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:35.100 align:start size:84% position:16%
who's higher ranking
or lower ranking,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
or bits about if
they're stressed out

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:41.341
and what that means for
their internal state.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.508
Unfortunately,

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.043 align:start size:88% position:13%
you can't embarrassingly
go up to a monkey

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:47.180 align:start size:97% position:3%
and ask for a reminder of what
it's name is if you forget.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.849
So we invest a lot of
our time in the field

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.118 align:start size:81% position:19%
just trying to
learn their faces.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.220 align:start size:97% position:3%
And this involves binoculars
standing really close

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.956
to something and
just staring at it.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.758 align:start size:88% position:13%
For some monkeys this
is not that hard at all.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.861
This guy right here is a face

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.831
that only mother
monkey could love.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.299
And hopefully it doesn't
reappear in your dreams

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.869
a little bit later tonight.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.371 align:start size:84% position:16%
This one you could
learn in five seconds.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.206
Other animals you don't
have to rely on faces.

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.409
Topanga here on the
left has half a tail.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.411 align:start size:97% position:3%
You can tell her from
twenty, thirty meters away.

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.147
But for the majority of them,

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:24.517
it comes down to looking at
little ridges in their face,

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:28.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
little moles they might have
or old scars from fights.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.224 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we try to get as much of
this into our own mental banks

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.026
as we can but we do
rely on our notes.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:36.395 align:start size:84% position:16%
And fortunately
Vivek and I are both

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:40.266
world class natural
history illustrators.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.567
And we've filled
up our notebooks

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
with all sorts of
illustrations like this.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.537
(laughter)

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:47.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think this is
Vivek's Mona Lisa here.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.976
But jokes aside this is
a really valuable tool

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:54.447
to kind of remember the little
landmarks on a monkey's face.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.882
And so we were the
first kind of cohort

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:58.284
of camp managers at Guassa.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.219
So not only did we
have to learn monkeys

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
that had been identified
by Peter and Nga,

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:05.157
but we also identified a
bunch of new ones as well.

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:07.460
And on some days it
was really exciting.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.294
You see a female
who's recognizable

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:11.697
and you might want to name her.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.733 align:start size:94% position:6%
And this is what
happened with a juvenile,

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.302
I think back early
when we were there.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.638
I was just standing there and
Vivek ran up really excitedly.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:21.908
- [Vivek] Jeff I have
a new monkey for us.

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.776
- Oh really that's
very exciting Vivek.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.045
Have you thought of a name yet?

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.414
- I think I wanna
name it Anusha.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.415
- Anusha?

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.950
What does that mean?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.186
- Well it's my sister's name
and I think she'll hate it.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.320
(laughter)

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.321
- Perfect.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.589 size:84% position:58%
It's decided.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.557
Normally we deliberate a
long time back and forth

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.359
cause these names
are in the record,

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.463
but that one was a
pretty easy call.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.665 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it's been fun to track
Anusha over the years.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.333 align:start size:97% position:3%
I know she was a juvenile
when we first identified her.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.336
And now she's come into her own.

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:54.006
She has offspring and
some of the latest news

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.409
is that Anusha has a new male.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.911
Which is very exciting.

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:03.016
But mothers have really
intimate relationships

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.216
with their infants,

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.352 align:start size:88% position:13%
they invest a great
deal of time with them.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.522
Caring for them while
they still have to

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.990
go about their daily duties.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
So you'll see a mother
holding an infant

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.959
like this with one hand,

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.661 align:start size:94% position:6%
while she's grabbing
grass with the other one.

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:18.264
It's always amusing when
she kind of crosses wires

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.365 align:start size:97% position:3%
a little bit and is whacking
her infant in the head

00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:22.635
while she's putting
grass into her mouth.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.904 align:start size:94% position:6%
But this relationship
between mother and infant

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.172
can last years.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.774
As they grow up a bit more,

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.876 align:start size:88% position:13%
they'll give them rides
when they're tired.

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.711 align:start size:88% position:13%
Geladas can walk
several kilometers a day

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.014
in search of just the
right grass meals.

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.515
And they'll help
them jump across

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.185
little obstacles like this.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
And when the kids need
help they'll let them know,

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.389 align:start size:97% position:3%
they'll stand there
screaming like (screaming).

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.023
And then it annoys
the mom just enough

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:46.091
she'll throw them on the back

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.194
and take them to the other side.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:51.130 align:start size:94% position:6%
But it's not only
behavior that we focus on

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.331
while we're out there.

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.734 align:start size:88% position:13%
Knowing individuals
can unlock all sorts of

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.202
other information
sources as well.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:04:00.172 align:start size:97% position:3%
You can tell Vivek's really
excited about this one.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:02.241 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think he gave a little
teaser of it earlier.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:06.612
And this is processing
a monkey fecal sample.

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:08.681
And when a monkey poops,

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.482 align:start size:84% position:16%
it gives you all
sorts of information.

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:12.018
It tells you what
it's been eating,

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.320 align:start size:81% position:19%
how well it's been
digesting that,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.923 align:start size:94% position:6%
and other information
about it's internal state.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.593 align:start size:88% position:13%
You can extract hormones
from poop as well.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.296
So what we do is we follow
known individuals around

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.866 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then try to guess when
they're going to poop.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.469
And Vivek and I are both
pretty competitive guys,

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.039
so this is a nice way
to pass those long,

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.007
endless days in the field.

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.209
You know who can end up with

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.843 align:start size:84% position:16%
the most fecal samples
in the morning?

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:41.180
Like who can have the
(bleep)iest morning?

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:44.484
I haven't talked about
this publicly before,

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:46.952 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I think Vivek's a
little bit better at this

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:48.821
than I am unfortunately.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.289
So congratulations.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.758
- [Vivek] Thank you.

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:55.094 align:start size:94% position:6%
- We can also look at
disease in fecal samples.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:05:00.065
Because disease is an important
part of the geladas ecology.

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:03.169
About 30% of adults in
the population at Guassa

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.340 align:start position:0%
have parasitic swellings of
tapeworms from the genus Taenia.

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.075
And you can see
the swelling here

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:11.711
on the head of this monkey,

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.947
but they can be found
anywhere on the body.

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.717 align:start size:97% position:3%
At some point the swellings
will continue to expand

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.452
and occasionally rupture.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.587
And it's a way that the
monkeys can get infected

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:23.856
and then lead to mortality.

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:28.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
Another kind of
outlet of competition

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:31.964 align:start size:88% position:13%
for Vivek and I related
to disease in us.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:34.901 align:start size:84% position:16%
I lost about 30
pounds of body weight

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.536 align:start size:84% position:16%
while I was in Guassa
the first year.

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.405
And that had to
do with a variety

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.540 align:start size:84% position:16%
of kind of bacterial
and viral issues.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.576
But we had this contest
running for some reason,

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:46.678
that we wanted to know
who could go the longest

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:48.714
without a shower.

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:52.118 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we went for I think two
months and then a couple days,

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.919
and I was supposed to
go back to the capital

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.721
right before Vivek so I broke.

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:57.122
And I was like all right fine,

00:05:57.122 --> 00:05:58.557
this one's yours.

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:00.158
But this sort of
idiotic competition

00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:02.928
led to other problems as well.

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:04.864
I think for both of us,

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:09.334
the flesh on our hands
started rotting off.

00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:11.037
And falling off in big sloughs,

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we didn't really
know what it was.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:15.007 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we wrote to some tropical
disease specialists,

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:16.442
and they didn't know
what it was either.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.811 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we dumped some
balsamic vinegar on it,

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.413
and then we put gloves on

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.649 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it went away
after a couple months.

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:28.621
- Okay well.

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:31.790 align:start size:84% position:16%
So you just heard
about how Jeff and I

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.525
can get pretty competitive.

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:36.228
But that's mostly in
very trivial contexts,

00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:38.463 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
because we had too
much time on our hands.

00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:40.566 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
But male-male
competition in geladas

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.268 line:0%
is actually no laughing matter.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:46.071 align:start size:91% position:9% line:0%
Cause it has profound life
and death consequences.

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.375
I mentioned earlier
how each male gelada

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:52.211
is associated with
a group of females,

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.746
his harem.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:57.850
Now this kind of demographic
imbalance creates a problem,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.318 align:start size:88% position:13%
because it means there's
this pool of males

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:02.087
that aren't getting
mating opportunities.

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:05.391 align:start position:0%
So there's a huge amount of
competition for these top spots.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.095 align:start size:97% position:3%
And evolution has basically
shaped gelada males

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.265 align:start size:84% position:16%
to reflect this
legacy of competition.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.700
You can see that
in this male here.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.169
First of all he's
big and imposing.

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.507 align:start size:97% position:3%
Male geladas are about twice
the size of the females.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.576 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you're gonna be
fighting all the time,

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.878
it really helps to be big.

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:29.848 align:start size:97% position:3%
And they may look even
larger by this billowing cape

00:07:29.848 --> 00:07:31.283
that you see right here.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
The secondary sexual
characteristic.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.620 align:start size:81% position:19%
This makes him
look more imposing

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.390 align:start size:84% position:16%
in these aggressive
interactions.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:41.293
We also go back to
the chest patch.

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:44.930
So he has a very red
bleeding heart there.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.232
And what that indicates
is that testosterone

00:07:47.232 --> 00:07:48.900
is coursing through his veins,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.672
he's ready to fight and
put it all out there.

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.208
What's truly spectacular though,

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:56.808
are the canines.

00:07:56.808 --> 00:07:59.645 align:start size:84% position:16%
Gelada canine teeth
are one of the largest

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:03.015 align:start size:84% position:16%
among any primates
relative to body size.

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.717 align:start size:97% position:3%
And during the day when
we're out with the animals,

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:07.820 align:start position:0%
we can hear them grinding
their teeth against each other.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.089 align:start size:97% position:3%
They're grinding that canine
against the bottom row

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:13.226 align:start size:84% position:16%
sharpening it for
subsequent conflict.

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.996
Now when fights erupt,

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.631 align:start size:81% position:19%
they can be pretty
crazy to watch.

00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:23.969
And sometimes we even get hit
by monkeys that run into us.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:26.705
But they can go on for hours,

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:27.707
if not days.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.043
And eventually,

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.879
there's gonna be a winner.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:36.048 align:start size:94% position:6%
So we observed a days
long interaction in 2011,

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:39.385 align:start size:97% position:3%
where at the end of it we
heard a bone crunching sound,

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.920
and one male limped
away totally bloody.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.525 align:start position:0%
He disappeared after a few hours
and we never saw him again.

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:49.394 align:start size:84% position:16%
All the geladas become
really really upset

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:51.864
during these takeover events.

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.866
But it's the adult
females in the group

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.601 align:start size:88% position:13%
where there's a takeover
attempt that stand

00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:58.004
to lose the most.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.172
That's because in geladas,

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.074 align:start size:84% position:16%
because of the social
system they have,

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:04.176
you see a very disturbing,

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:05.945
distasteful behavior.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.446
This is infanticide.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.382
The killing of infants.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.085
The way this works
is the new males

00:09:14.085 --> 00:09:16.789 align:start size:84% position:16%
will grab an infant
off the mother's back,

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:20.759
and it will turn these
canines onto the baby.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.228
Why are they doing this?

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.563 align:start size:94% position:6%
They're doing this because
that baby isn't theirs

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:27.233
and they wanna have their
own chance of reproduction.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
So by killing this baby that
belonged to someone else,

00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:33.105 align:start size:88% position:13%
they're able to stop the
mother from lactating

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:35.607 align:start size:81% position:19%
and have her start
her cycle again

00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:38.444 align:start size:84% position:16%
so that he can
then mate with her.

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.113
So these males are
advancing their own

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:44.917
reproductive interests at
the expense of the females,

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.052 align:start size:84% position:16%
as well as at the
expense of other males

00:09:47.052 --> 00:09:48.553
like the one you see here.

00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:52.525 align:start size:97% position:3%
Terrified that his offspring
is about to get killed.

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:55.627
Now the females in the story

00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:58.363 align:start size:88% position:13%
are actually not
passive players at all.

00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:02.501 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it was recently discovered
that geladas have evolved

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:04.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
an amazing strategy
to counteract

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:08.507 align:start size:88% position:13%
these infanticidal
tendencies of the males.

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:10.175 align:start size:84% position:16%
So this was discovered
by our colleagues

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:11.610
at the University of Michigan,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.913 align:start size:88% position:13%
working at the
Simian's research site,

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.514
with geladas in Ethiopia.

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.950
They discovered that
in geladas a phenomenon

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.452
known as the Bruce
effect is operating.

00:10:20.452 --> 00:10:24.223
What this means is that when
there's a takeover in a group,

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:26.925 align:start size:97% position:3%
the females who are
pregnant will spontaneously

00:10:26.925 --> 00:10:29.628
terminate their pregnancies.

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:33.365
Pregnancy and having a baby is
really energetically costly.

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.066
If that baby were to be born,

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:37.836 align:start size:84% position:16%
it would be killed the
day that it's born.

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:42.174 align:start size:97% position:3%
So they cut their losses
and terminate the pregnancy.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:43.976
They start cycling again,

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.045
and can soon have a baby.

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.149
In the end,

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.617
they end up losing
little time overall

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:53.619 align:start size:84% position:16%
in their own
reproductive careers.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:56.388
So this kind of drama it
almost seems more fitting

00:10:56.388 --> 00:11:00.559
for Game of Thrones but this
is daily life for a gelada.

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:07.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This can be heavy
stuff to watch,

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.935 align:start position:0%
particularly when it's your
job to just take notes about it

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.471
or gather pictures of it.

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.172
But it's part of the job.

00:11:14.172 --> 00:11:15.941 align:start size:84% position:16%
You sign up for
this when you engage

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.844
in kind of a long term
field project like this.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.947
And it also comes
with other aspects.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:24.382 align:start size:97% position:3%
When you're out in the
field for months at a time,

00:11:24.382 --> 00:11:26.117 align:start size:84% position:16%
particularly in
alpine environments,

00:11:26.117 --> 00:11:28.553
you're exposed to some
very extreme weather

00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:31.189
that can be challenging as well.

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.025 align:start size:88% position:13%
So as we kind of
proceed through this day

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.293
in the life of a gelada,

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:36.862
in the early afternoon
it can turn from sunny

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:40.666 align:start size:84% position:16%
to just absolutely
dreadful very quickly.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.835
And this has big impacts
on our data collection,

00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:46.371
our ability to take photographs,

00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:49.008
and our ability to stay sane.

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:52.244
Which is going to be
reflected shortly.

00:11:54.112 --> 00:11:56.949
(thunder booming)

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:02.121
(heavy rain falling)

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:04.190
- Just another rainy day.

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:11.162 align:start position:0%
It's been raining about non-stop
since 5:45 this morning.

00:12:11.162 --> 00:12:14.934
(heavy rain and hail falling)

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:19.905
Woah (bleep)!

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:24.376
(lightning crashing)

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:28.447
(heavy rainfall)

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:40.125
- [Vivek] You still
alive out there?

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:41.460
- [Jeff] Yeah it's quite a show.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.394
What?

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.195
- [Vivek] Merry Christmas.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.863
- Yeah yeah.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:47.133
(laughter)

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:51.670
I think we've spent several
Christmases at the Guassa,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.541 align:start size:97% position:3%
but it's always Christmas when
there's hail on the ground.

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.642 align:start size:88% position:13%
People ask me
sometimes if I'm afraid

00:12:57.642 --> 00:12:59.344
of the monkeys attacking me,

00:12:59.344 --> 00:13:02.147
or afraid of the animals kind
of turning on us out there.

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:03.849
But to be totally
straight with you,

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.084
it's the lightning.

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.953
I am deeply deeply
afraid of lightning

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.287
in alpine environments.

00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:10.923
And rightfully so.

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.424
It's very dangerous.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.426 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I get kind of a chill
seeing some of those videos.

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.894
They're fun to look back on,

00:13:15.894 --> 00:13:18.097 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I don't want to spend
another rainy season

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.765
at the Guassa.

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:21.200
And to be fair,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.969 align:start position:0%
the geladas probably don't
wanna spend another rainy season

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.203
at the Guassa either,

00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:27.439
but they don't have as
much choice as I do.

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.074
It's a very exposed place,

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.442
there's nowhere to hide.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.911 align:start size:88% position:13%
So they just have to sit
out there and take it

00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:35.948
like your research assistant
sitting right there as well.

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:38.417 align:start size:97% position:3%
And they'll bundle together
and just wait it out.

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:41.619 align:start size:97% position:3%
Some days they won't even come
up from their cliff edges.

00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:44.657 align:start size:94% position:6%
And they can be difficult
to find for days

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.858
or weeks at a time.

00:13:46.858 --> 00:13:49.261
But with these rainy periods

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:51.296 align:start size:88% position:13%
which can last for days
or weeks or months,

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:53.031 align:start size:84% position:16%
there's kind of a
seasonal cycle to it,

00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:55.033
the highlands transform.

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:56.769
They become very lush.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:57.769
On the Guassa,

00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:59.738
the grass grows green and tall.

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:01.773
And down on the farms
the crops start growing

00:14:01.773 --> 00:14:04.176
and the livestock
start to fatten up

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start size:97% position:3%
on the really nutritious
grass that exists down there.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's more
livestock in Ethiopia

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.650
than in any other country,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.754 align:start position:0%
yet it's rare to see any
livestock on the Guassa itself.

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.590
And this is by design.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.160
For centuries,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.962 align:start size:88% position:13%
and we're talking
hundreds of years here,

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:26.865 align:start size:97% position:3%
the local community has
limited access to the Guassa,

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:29.868 align:start size:88% position:13%
except during an
occasional time of need

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:31.870
every couple of years.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.041
And what this means is that
they're trying to protect

00:14:37.175 --> 00:14:39.277 align:start size:88% position:13%
their most precious
resource on the Guassa.

00:14:39.277 --> 00:14:41.013
And that's the grass.

00:14:42.413 --> 00:14:44.383
The word Guassa is derived from

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.251
the Amharic word
for festuca grass,

00:14:46.251 --> 00:14:48.386
which you see growing here.

00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:50.789
Aside from being a
potential buffer zone

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.925 align:start size:84% position:16%
for grazing animals
and livestock,

00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:56.828
the grass itself is a
very useful resource

00:14:56.828 --> 00:14:58.564
for the local people.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:01.166
They use it to thatch the
roofs of their houses,

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:02.500
they use it to build ropes,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.035
line their floors,

00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:07.973
build brooms and many
other tools as well.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:12.144
And for centuries enforcement
of this closure of the Guassa

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:16.981
from grazing or for grass
cutting was associated with

00:15:16.981 --> 00:15:18.884
the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:21.986
This is a really important
institution in the highlands.

00:15:21.986 --> 00:15:23.955
And it ties in with traditions

00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:26.692
that go back more
than centuries.

00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:33.866 align:start size:97% position:3%
Enforcement could be very
severe however many years ago.

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:36.200 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you were caught illegally
grazing your cattle,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.803
it would be killed on the spot.

00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:40.872
If you cut grass
without permission,

00:15:40.872 --> 00:15:43.541
your house would be burned down.

00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:45.444
In recent years a more secular,

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.313
and less severe version of
this enforcement has emerged

00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:51.250
and now it's being
led by this man.

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.785
Admassu Getaneh.

00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:58.089
Who's a former soldier
turned conservationist.

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:01.259
He leads patrols of local
farmers from the community

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:05.563 align:start position:0%
on the Guassa day and night
looking for unwelcome outsiders.

00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start size:88% position:13%
People that are
poaching it's resources,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.967
cutting it's grass,

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:12.637 align:start size:88% position:13%
cutting down it's
shrubs to make charcoal.

00:16:12.637 --> 00:16:14.440
And for centuries,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.709 align:start size:94% position:6%
the fact that they've been
preserving this region

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:20.145
to protect it's grass has had
the unintended consequence

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.212
at least initially,

00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:24.216
of preserving it's wildlife.

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.251 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is not the case
throughout many of the other

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:28.420 align:start size:84% position:16%
parts of the
Ethiopian highlands,

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.289 align:start size:97% position:3%
where farming and overgrazing
has led to erosion

00:16:31.289 --> 00:16:35.694
and just the real change in
the land cover that you see.

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:37.229
This is outside of Guassa,

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:39.297 align:start size:88% position:13%
and this is a photograph
of Ryan Burke,

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:40.765
another former camp manager

00:16:40.765 --> 00:16:43.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
from the Guassa Gelada
Research Project.

00:16:43.602 --> 00:16:45.070
Over the past several years,

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.105 align:start size:94% position:6%
along with several of
his Ethiopian colleagues,

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:49.007 align:start size:84% position:16%
they've been scouring
the highlands

00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:51.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
looking for information
about geladas.

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:55.513 align:start position:0%
Censusing them and figuring
out what their distribution is.

00:16:55.513 --> 00:16:57.548
And they've created this map.

00:16:57.548 --> 00:16:59.818
This is the most up
to date understanding

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:02.687 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we have of
gelada distribution.

00:17:02.687 --> 00:17:04.122
They're found only in Ethiopia,

00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:07.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
along these high
altitude ridge lines

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:09.595
associated with the
Great Rift Valley.

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:12.530
And the gorges that
go inland from it.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is a much reduced range
from what people thought

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.102
geladas existed in,

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:20.571
based on some preliminary
surveys 40-50 years ago.

00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:22.774
And right now Ryan and his team

00:17:22.774 --> 00:17:24.676
are still working
on these surveys,

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:27.246
there's a couple areas left
to go but this is really

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:30.581 align:start size:94% position:6%
rewriting what we know
about gelada distribution.

00:17:30.581 --> 00:17:32.650
The Guassa is located
right in the center.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.453 align:start size:84% position:16%
And it stands apart
as I mentioned,

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:37.155 align:start size:88% position:13%
as the most ecologically
pristine elements

00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:39.158
where geladas are found.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.661 align:start size:88% position:13%
And with an ecologically
intact environment

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.563
comes other things.

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:47.131
In this case predators.

00:17:47.131 --> 00:17:49.334
It's very rare to see a predator

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.570
out in the daylight
in the highlands.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.605
This is only one of a
couple sightings I had

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.841 align:start size:84% position:16%
of a serval cat
over my time there.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.209
But there are also hyenas,

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.577
and leopards,

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:02.447 align:start size:97% position:3%
and other mammalian predators
in this environment.

00:18:02.447 --> 00:18:05.183
Despite the fact that you
don't often see predators,

00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:06.918
they still have a massive impact

00:18:06.918 --> 00:18:09.454
on the behavior of this species.

00:18:09.454 --> 00:18:11.723
Geladas are always on edge.

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
And you'll hear
alarm calls coming up

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:15.560
maybe several times a day,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.229 align:start size:88% position:13%
where geladas will
stop what they're doing

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:19.030
and scan the environment.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start size:84% position:16%
Devoting all their
attention to assessing

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.768
whether there's a
threat in the area.

00:18:23.768 --> 00:18:25.637 align:start size:84% position:16%
Most of the time these
are false alarms.

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:29.474
But they have good
reason to be worried.

00:18:29.474 --> 00:18:32.844
I had no idea that
I was standing just
a couple meters away

00:18:32.844 --> 00:18:35.547
from a serval that was
hiding in this bush.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:38.683
And neither did the female
who was carrying this infant.

00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:41.253
I was standing there and
I saw a flash of movement,

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.088
and heard geladas
starting to scream.

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.357
I spun around and kind
of threw my camera up,

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:47.493
and took this photograph.

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:48.493
A second later,

00:18:48.493 --> 00:18:50.529
the serval was gone,

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:53.365
buried in this St.
John's wort thicket.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
You can tell this infant's
just a couple days old,

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:58.035 align:start size:88% position:13%
still has the
umbilical cord attached

00:18:58.035 --> 00:19:00.204
and a dried out placenta on it.

00:19:00.204 --> 00:19:02.006 align:start size:84% position:16%
The herd was screaming
and fled back

00:19:02.006 --> 00:19:03.775
towards their sleeping cliffs,

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:05.010
followed by their mother

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.780
who was giving her
own mournful calls.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.817 align:start size:97% position:3%
Even if geladas don't
experience a predation event,

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.852 align:start size:84% position:16%
just seeing a predator
is often enough

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:17.923
to send the herd fleeing
back towards the cliffs.
