00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.500
Okay. What's your answer?

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.469
&gt;&gt; My answer is no.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.670
&gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry, that's wrong. No, no, I think that, well, if

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.270
it's, if it's right, then we need to provide a sequence that proves it.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.970
&gt;&gt; So what are you thinking?

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.400
&gt;&gt; Well, I was thinking actually something very similar to what we just saw.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.320
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.650
&gt;&gt; Where so tit for tat, what they're going to do is they're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.670
going to do cooperate, cooperate, cooperate, cooperate,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.300
right? That's what they normally want to do.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.780
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; So what would happen if at one

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.220
point, one of them defected?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, just for simplicity let's make it the very first point.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.870
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.940
&gt;&gt; So, tit for tat number one defects,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.220
and tit for tat number two also defects.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.500
&gt;&gt; At the very first time? No, it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560
cooperates, because it's done at the same time.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.020
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean so we're, we can feed

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.660
it anything we want. So we could tell tit for

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.720
tat two to cooperate. So it's sort of like we've

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.540
taken over its brain for a brief amount of time.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.860
&gt;&gt; Right. So I'm not yet convinced it's going to matter

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.770
for this, but the thing is that from that point

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.230
on, tit for tat two is going to want to, for

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.220
the next step tit for tat two is going to want to defect.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.260
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.210
&gt;&gt; And, tit for tat one would want to cooperate.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.390
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.367
&gt;&gt; And that's sort of. Sucks.

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:06.700
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.268
&gt;&gt; For tit-for-tat two, right?

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:12.030
&gt;&gt; So, I don't know, so maybe we should try

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.090
to think through. What is the expected reward, for tit-for-tat

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.750
two, to actually do this defect at this time?

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.055
&gt;&gt; Or wait, no. So, so, sorry to,

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:24.850
to stick with the tit-for-tat machine at this time.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.910
&gt;&gt; Well, what's going to happen at

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.930
that point is, it's going to keep alternating.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.340
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. So it's going to get the, the rewards corresponding

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810
to D versus C, C versus D, D versus C, C versus D.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.420
&gt;&gt; Over and over again.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.699
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's thi, let's think about it

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.260
in the average reward case. So, in the D versus

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.100
C, if it does D when the other machine does C, then it gets zero.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.140
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.800
&gt;&gt; If it does C when the other one does D it gets minus nine.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.083
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:52.800
&gt;&gt; And then this alternates. So if we look at the average award,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.310
which is basically what you get when the discount factor's very, very high.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.025
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:58.533
&gt;&gt; It's scoring negative 4.5.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:01:59.770
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.440
&gt;&gt; Is there any way, that it could behave against tit for

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.293
tat, starting from this point that would do better than negative 4.5.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.780
&gt;&gt; Just go ahead and cooperate.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.820
&gt;&gt; Just cooperate forever?

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.580
&gt;&gt; Well cooperate the next time and then keep doing tit for

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.300
tat from that point on. It'll work out to be cooperate forever.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.270
&gt;&gt; On average. That's right. What will get is a minus, minus

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.248
one. So not being tit for tat at that point but instead,

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:26.300
instead turning always to cooperate would actually get it better. So the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.330
idea that is should defect at this point, is an implausible threat.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.430
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.335
&gt;&gt; So this is not

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:33.170
sub-game perfect. So yes, you nailed it.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.660
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.720
&gt;&gt; It did make sense.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.206
&gt;&gt; Good, alright. So that leaves open the question of, is

00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:42.940
there a way, to be sub game perfect in Prisoner's dilemma?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.830
&gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.510
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.220
&gt;&gt; Before you answer that. So, I had sort

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.430
of convinced myself that it didn't matter whether tit for

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.930
tat number two started out with C or started out

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.270
with D. I'm trying to decide whether that's actually true.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.340
&gt;&gt; 'Kay, that's a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.160
good question. So what will happen, at this from

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.970
this point on if we now continue. We, you

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.490
know, we took over the brains for tit for

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.680
tat, and we forced them to play defect against defect.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.023
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:09.070
&gt;&gt; And now we release that, and we let them do what, whatever it is

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.185
that they're going to do. And what is

00:03:10.185 --> 00:03:11.442
th, what are they going to do? Is [CROSSTALK]

00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:12.022
&gt;&gt; They would defect forever [CROSSTALK]

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:12.380
&gt;&gt; Defect forever.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.750
&gt;&gt; And is there anything that tit-for-tat two machine,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.780
could do to get a better score than that?

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.870
&gt;&gt; Cooperate.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.413
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it could. Cooperating with tit for

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:23.224
tat will bring it back into mutual cooperation.

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:23.450
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.360
&gt;&gt; It will actually get a better score.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.349
&gt;&gt; So, in one case, it would average to minus one and the other one, it

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.761
would, it would average to minus three and

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:34.940
minus one is better, so, you're right. Good point.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.770
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.580
&gt;&gt; So what matters is that we get we get them defecting.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.800
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay, so that makes sense. So, I, I was right that

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.860
it didn't matter, although you do get

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.480
slightly different answers, or slightly different averages.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.770
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.850
But in both cases, there's a way of getting a higher average.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.960
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay, cool, that's what I thought. I thought it was

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.760
something like that. So now, let's go back to what you wanted

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.870
to do. So, are we going to be able to figure out how

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.050
to do Prisoner's dilemma in a way that is sub game perfect?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.460
&gt;&gt; Well, how about I propose a machine, and we'll see what it does?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.
