vast majority of the reading I do I try
 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.890
vast majority of the reading I do I try
to do in physical books because I can

I'm actively reading that what I'm
 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.610
I'm actively reading that what I'm
paying attention to which is super

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620
paying attention to which is super
 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.980
paying attention to which is super
important and also one of the other

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
important and also one of the other
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.930

things that I find easier to do with a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940
things that I find easier to do with a
 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.460
things that I find easier to do with a
physical book although you can do it

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470
physical book although you can do it
 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.410
physical book although you can do it
with a Kindle book I call it sort of

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420
with a Kindle book I call it sort of
 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.240
with a Kindle book I call it sort of
like the blank sheet what we do there is

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250
like the blank sheet what we do there is
 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.820
like the blank sheet what we do there is
we just sort of before you read a book

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830
we just sort of before you read a book
 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.580
we just sort of before you read a book
you take a blank sheet of paper and you

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590
you take a blank sheet of paper and you
 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.320
you take a blank sheet of paper and you
write down what you know about that

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330
write down what you know about that
 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.450
write down what you know about that
subject you can mindmap it you can write

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460
subject you can mindmap it you can write
 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.280
subject you can mindmap it you can write
it and sort of like bullet points and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290
it and sort of like bullet points and
 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.280
it and sort of like bullet points and
then you read maybe a paragraph or not a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290
then you read maybe a paragraph or not a
 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.810
then you read maybe a paragraph or not a
paragraph you read a chapter of that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820
paragraph you read a chapter of that
 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.300
paragraph you read a chapter of that
book and that's all the reading time you

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
book and that's all the reading time you
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.710
book and that's all the reading time you
have for that day well now you go to

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720
have for that day well now you go to
 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.450
have for that day well now you go to
that sheet and use a different color pen

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460
that sheet and use a different color pen
 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.400
that sheet and use a different color pen
and you just fill in like what gaps that

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410
and you just fill in like what gaps that
 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.630
and you just fill in like what gaps that
I learned did I learn a different

it to what I've already read and then

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440
it to what I've already read and then
 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.960
it to what I've already read and then
before you pick up the book for the next

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970
before you pick up the book for the next
 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.730
before you pick up the book for the next
chapter you read that you just skim this

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740
chapter you read that you just skim this
 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.890
chapter you read that you just skim this
sheet and it sort of primes your brain

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900
sheet and it sort of primes your brain
 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.230
sheet and it sort of primes your brain
for what you're going to read and I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240
for what you're going to read and I
 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.880
for what you're going to read and I
think that that's a really effective way

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890
think that that's a really effective way
 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.030
think that that's a really effective way
to sort of like not only build on the

to sort of like not only build on the
knowledge you have but connect what

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510
knowledge you have but connect what
 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.630
knowledge you have but connect what
you're reading to the to the existing

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
you're reading to the to the existing
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.700
you're reading to the to the existing
knowledge it's going to show you what

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710
knowledge it's going to show you what
 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.050
knowledge it's going to show you what
you learned while you were reading

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
you learned while you were reading
 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.609
you learned while you were reading
because it's going to be a very visual

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619
because it's going to be a very visual
 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.349
because it's going to be a very visual
distinction it's going to be a different

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.359
distinction it's going to be a different
 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.319
distinction it's going to be a different
color of ink and I think that that

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329
color of ink and I think that that
 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.300
color of ink and I think that that
allows you to sort of like connect

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310
allows you to sort of like connect
 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.620
allows you to sort of like connect
to the book and aft and do that in the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630
to the book and aft and do that in the
 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.840
to the book and aft and do that in the
jacket of the book where if I don't have

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850
jacket of the book where if I don't have
 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.670
jacket of the book where if I don't have
a physical piece of paper that's okay

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
a physical piece of paper that's okay
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.199
a physical piece of paper that's okay
because I can just do it on on the front

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209
because I can just do it on on the front
 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.780
because I can just do it on on the front
cover that is so much harder when you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790
cover that is so much harder when you
 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.610
cover that is so much harder when you
try to translate that to electronic it's

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
try to translate that to electronic it's
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.700
try to translate that to electronic it's
possible but it's a lot more difficult
