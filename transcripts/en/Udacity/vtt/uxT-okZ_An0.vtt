The Clinical Information Modeling
Initiative, CIMI, C-I-M-I,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.380
is an attempt to enumerate the detailed
models of hundreds of thousands of

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.690
medical ideas to achieve
consensus among clinicians.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.532
They can be used to define
standard messages or

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:21.750
structured documents as
components of clinical rules, and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.158
to automate or facilitate constructing
data entry or reporting templates.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:30.040
The CIMI group lists
simplification of existing models,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.450
perhaps referring to RIM,
as one of its key objectives.
