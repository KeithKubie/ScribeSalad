00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.540
NOAH LEVIN: So quick question.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.430
How many of you in the room have
used a prototyping tool before,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.210
or one of the tools
maybe listed up here?

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.291
Just raise your hand.

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:17.790
Oh, my.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.905
That's awesome.

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:20.164
I actually didn't expect that.

00:00:20.164 --> 00:00:21.330
That's really, really great.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.390
I'm super excited to
facilitate a conversation

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.430
about these tools and
why they matter for us.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.762
And actually, while
we're talking,

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.720
I want you to think about
questions at the end,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.340
because I will say there's
not been a lot of questions.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.340
So just prepare
now, and write down

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.099
little doodles or
notes of things.

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:39.890
I'm totally going to
just hope that there's

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.310
amazing questions afterward.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.960
The first thing I
wanted to point out

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.450
was that you'll notice on
this panel there's not really

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.912
any representation from
traditional design tools

00:00:49.912 --> 00:00:51.120
you might have thought about.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.620
Right?

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.110
There's not anyone here from
something like Photoshop

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.120
or Sketch, even though we spend
a lot of time in those tools.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.990
These are all people who've
created interactive tools,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.580
yet we still chose to call the
panel Design Tooling and not

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.640
something like Prototyping
to kind of make

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.415
a statement about where we
think these tools are headed.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.040
We really think it's
the next evolution

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.750
of the medium of the tools
we use and what we work on.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.400
So I think we've used static
mockmaking tools for a while,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.024
and they worked
really, really well

00:01:19.024 --> 00:01:20.690
in a world where we
were creating things

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.090
like business cards and
book covers and posters.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.190
But now with our devices,
we touch, we drag,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.020
we swipe, we play,
in some cases,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.400
we speak with our devices.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.280
And yet we're using tools
that don't necessarily

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.040
represent that.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.540
Right?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.750
We're using these
flat, static tools,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.961
and I think it's mostly
because it's easier.

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:42.460
Right?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.420
There's not really much
of a better option.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.470
It's just kind of the
best that we have.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.090
And I think what
I'm excited about is

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.610
I think that's starting
to change, thanks a lot

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.050
of the people you see here.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.550
So I think a common
scenario that

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.000
might sound kind of
familiar to many of you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.270
is you're in a meeting room--
some combination of maybe

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.010
product managers,
engineers, and designers--

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.300
and you're looking up at a
screen in some kind of room,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.460
and that screen has a
picture of a phone on it.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.720
And that picture has a bunch
of pictures inside of it,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.080
and you're kind of
clicking through a bunch

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.810
of different mockups, and you're
making some pretty important

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.319
decisions at that
point sometimes.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.110
You're starting to kind
of critique things,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.540
the way things look, the
way things are placed,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.130
but it kind of feels productive.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.630
You know?

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.630
You're making decisions.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.120
You're making tradeoffs.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.350
And at a certain point, you
make enough of those iterations

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.490
that you decide, OK, it's time.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.660
Let's hand it off to engineers.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.424
So you hand it off to engineers,
and in a couple of weeks,

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:37.840
or depending on the size of
the product you're working on,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.910
maybe a few months, you
finally get this demo.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.910
And you get this
demo in your hands,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.180
and finally, your eyes
kind of start to light up,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.640
and the conversation starts
to change a little bit.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.400
All of a sudden,
we're not focused

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.650
on the pixels that were
off on the projector,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.120
but we're talking about
the flow in our hands,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.670
and we're having a productive
conversation at this point.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.600
And unfortunately, sometimes
at that point in the process,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.440
you might realize a
lot of those decisions

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.600
you made weren't as
good as you thought.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.642
And it's expensive to make
changes at this point.

00:03:08.642 --> 00:03:10.016
You've made a lot
of assumptions.

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:11.470
You've built this whole thing.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.420
It sucks to have
to go back on that.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.220
And I've actually seen this
happen all the time at Google,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.595
and it's something
we're actually

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:19.569
trying to work on and
get a lot better at.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.610
And fortunately, we can,
because today, again, we

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.730
have these new
tools that allow us

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.820
to skip to the field
part a lot sooner.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.870
And I think even without
like a CS degree or staring

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.680
at kind of a monospaced
wall of text,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.270
we have these more
visual tools now,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.650
and we can things interactive
in a matter of days

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.260
instead of waiting months, which
I think is really important.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.635
So thanks to a
lot of these tools

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:44.760
like Form and Pixate and
Origami and Framer and Invision.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.530
We can hand around our devices
and ask people to try it,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.580
as opposed to just kind
of imagining and making

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.070
a lot of assumptions and filling
in the gaps in your own way.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.240
But even with all of the
different-- this explosion

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.660
of all of these new
tools, there hasn't really

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.520
been a lot of
conversation about it.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.060
There hasn't even been really a
whole lot of press or articles

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.760
on the subject.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.986
I read one by Pasquale
D'Silva that felt pretty good,

00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:09.360
but it was one of
the only ones I

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.610
could find about these tools,
these interactive tools.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.486
And so we're really
excited to actually

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.110
have a conversation
about these things,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.651
and I hope that inspires us to
continue to have conversations

00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:20.730
about the tools
that we use and how

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.080
it affects our process, how
it makes better products.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.940
And so to start
this conversation,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.820
we're going to go around and
introduce ourselves, and maybe

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.472
just say your name, where
you're from, and how you-- just

00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:33.430
to start with something
light-- how you came up

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.720
with the name for your
product, and if there were

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.880
other names you'd
considered beforehand.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.910
We'll start with Adam, because
his tool's name is particularly

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.786
appropriate for the
conference we're at today.

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:45.910
ADAM DEBRECZENI: Hey, guys.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.810
My name's Adam.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.140
I work on Form by Relative Wave.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.330
Thanks for coming
to our conference.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.140
I'm really excited.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.210
Google got to sponsor it.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.440
Our first code name
for the project

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.400
was called Tango, and going
along with the line of Google

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.240
taking our product names,
Google announced Project Tango,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.350
and we couldn't use it anymore.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.990
So we went to Form, because
for the longest time,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.470
our ethos for the
project was, how

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.220
do we make a tool
that's really malleable?

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.520
How do we make a
tool that survives

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.420
15 years down the line?

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.780
And we kind of see Form as kind
of transcending mobile phone

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.170
prototyping and doing
something down the line.

00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:29.130
PAUL COLTON: Hi, there.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.500
My name is Paul Colton.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.285
I'm the founder of Pixate.

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:35.780
I was actually born
outside of Venice, Italy,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.760
but lived most of my life here.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.565
For us, how we came
up with the name,

00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:42.750
I actually came up with
the name before we even

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.300
knew what we were
going to build.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.420
I knew it was going to be about
pixels in motion, if you will.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.050
I knew that much.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.380
Pixar.com wouldn't
sell me their domain,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.160
so I went ahead and
went with Pixate.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.790
Interesting side note-- it was
an Apple employee that sold us

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.370
the domain he was
holding personally.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.110
And the other
interesting part, just

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.620
I thought I'd
throw out there, is

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.050
we use 99 designs for
our little flower logo,

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.230
and it was interesting
getting back 600 or 700 logos

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.890
and whittling it down to one.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.440
So I feel like it was kind
of community-driven for us,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.790
and then that essentially we
used that name for the product

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.330
that we were going to build.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:27.740
KOEN BOK: Well, I'm Koen.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.670
I make Framer.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.774
And the story about our
name is very boring,

00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:34.690
so I'll keep it short.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.000
There's a guy here in the
audience, and he told me,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.110
you should call it Framer.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.818
It's a cool name.

00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:39.910
I liked it.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.617
So that's kind of
what we settled on.

00:06:43.617 --> 00:06:44.450
BRANDON WALKIN: Hey.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.540
I'm Brandon Walkin.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.740
I'm a product
designer at Facebook.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.410
I worked there for
about five years,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.270
and I built Origami
while working on Paper,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.340
so I was part of the team
there, and we worked on it

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.100
for two years, and
I basically built

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.630
Origami in my spare time
while working on that.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.640
And in terms of a name,
I think I actually

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.980
know as a roommate, who's
one of our design managers

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.770
named Austin Bales
came up with the name.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:19.190
And I think we just wanted to
reference two things-- one,

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.870
craftsmanship.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.760
And another is-- so
Origami played a big role

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.630
in designing Paper,
and so we thought

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.510
it'd be pretty cool if
there was some consistency

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.810
between the names there.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.570
CLARK VALBERG: I'm
Clark from Invision.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.750
You might know me from
Brooklyn, or maybe your inbox.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.610
We invented Invision
at a consulting company

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.540
that I ran before Invision.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.170
And we invented it--
is this the question

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.440
I'm supposed to be answering?

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.370
We invented it to solve the
problem of socializing design

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.630
process, so we felt
like things were broken.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.130
Too many of the
design conversations

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.730
we were having were
one-on-one, and we

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.130
wanted to allow
people to be included

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.212
in the vision of the product.

00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:04.420
I may have just made that up.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.270
I'm not sure.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.650
NOAH LEVIN: Awesome.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.300
So we're going to just take
you through a couple of themes

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.880
and questions within
those themes that we think

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.963
capture some of the problems
we're trying to solve

00:08:13.963 --> 00:08:15.390
and some of the
interesting topics

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.690
that we're going to go
over, and just start.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.220
We want you to
hopefully come away

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.000
with this thinking
about why this matters,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.874
and if you haven't
already tried these tools,

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:24.860
why you might want to.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.130
And so I guess just to get
things started, let's go around

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.530
and talk about some
of the inspiration

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.900
for creating your tool.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.390
Like what drove you to do it?

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.549
And actually we'll
start with Adam,

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.591
and kind of go along
in the same way.

00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:39.799
ADAM DEBRECZENI: Yeah, we
started working on the tool

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.400
about a year and a half
ago, so time flies.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.110
It's crazy that
we're here on stage.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.110
We were working on a
client project at the time,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.590
and we were building
this 3D model

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.650
editor for this client who
wasn't overtly technical.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.480
And it was very difficult
conveying the concepts and just

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.620
PNGs.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.720
So we would send her
a PNG on her iPad,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.440
and she would be
zooming in and out,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.640
not understanding how
the interface worked.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.280
And I played around with
ways of making-- or trying

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.450
to convey what I was trying
to do with a 3D model editor

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.472
and just sending
the client an mp4.

00:09:17.472 --> 00:09:19.830
It showed the result of
what we wanted to create

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.840
but didn't let you
actually interact with it.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.500
So we tried to build a
tool just for ourselves,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.520
and then we quickly
realized, as I was just

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.260
talking to friends
in the industry,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.640
that this is a very common
problem that a lot of people

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.287
have.

00:09:34.287 --> 00:09:35.620
NOAH LEVIN: How about you, Paul?

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.870
How did you guys-- what
inspired you to create Pixate?

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.900
What are the things that led
to you guys creating this?

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.520
PAUL COLTON: Literally before
we wrote a line of code,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.500
we said, we're not going to try
to guess what we need to build.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.300
We went out and spoke
with many of you honestly.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.560
Just every designer who would
have our meeting-- Twitter,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.620
Pinterest, and a whole
list, but beyond.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.500
And we said, what are your
pains, and how can we fix them?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.350
And I'll just mention too real
quick that I'm sure all of you

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.220
have-- when I personally
heard things like,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.780
we make After Effects movies,
so then we can show that

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.190
to somebody about
what we intend,

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.900
I don't know.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.983
I cringed about that,
because that was like, well,

00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:17.530
what if you have
to make a change?

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.800
And how do you make
variations of this movie?

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.974
Can you interact with that?

00:10:20.974 --> 00:10:22.890
Of course, we know the
answer to all of those.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.265
And then the other
thing we heard

00:10:24.265 --> 00:10:25.770
was, oh, we hand
it to engineering.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.800
Engineering spends three weeks
prototyping an idea, only

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.280
to have someone say,
it doesn't work.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.090
I mean that's, to me, was
like-- I mean I felt their pain.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.290
I wanted to run out of the
meeting and start implementing.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.490
But we talked to
lots of companies,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.290
and we literally just set out to
build exactly what they needed,

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.210
and that's effectively
what we've started with

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.132
and were able to keep
going from there.

00:10:48.132 --> 00:10:48.840
NOAH LEVIN: Nice.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.520
And how about Koen?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.478
What inspired you guys?

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:52.150
KOEN BOK: Yeah,
so for us, there's

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.900
actually kind of two
parts to this story,

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.440
and the first part is
pretty close to Brandon.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.750
I was also working at
Facebook-- not on Paper,

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.930
but on other stuff.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.490
And I was also trying
to invent a way

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.960
to just do better
and faster work,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.760
and iterate faster on IDs.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.670
So I found a way to
sort of hack together

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.140
existing technologies that
we knew like Photoshop

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.340
and JavaScript, and
get that down quickly.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.580
And it stayed like
that for quite awhile

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.630
until I left Facebook.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.350
And after that, we
started thinking

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.490
about what are the
biggest problems with that

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.840
for designers to actually
pick this up and start using?

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.930
So how do we get designers
to start learning code?

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.840
How do we get this
sort of framework

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.695
to give you live
direct feedback?

00:11:32.695 --> 00:11:34.070
And that's what
we tried to solve

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.736
in this sort of second
coming of Framer,

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:37.295
and that's where we are now.

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:38.170
BRANDON WALKIN: Yeah.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.770
Well, the first time I
started using Quartz Composer

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.930
was actually when Mike
Maddess joined Facebook.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.530
He brought Quartz
Composer with him,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.740
and he was just building
these incredible prototypes,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.240
like things we've just
never seen earlier.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.800
And it was just like totally
different from the work

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.100
that we were doing at the time.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.170
So we saw that, and
we were like, OK,

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.960
we have to get to that level.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.070
This is where everyone's
going to be in a few years.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.880
And so at that point, we
started using Quartz Composer,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.480
and Quartz Composer is
this really old tool.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.560
It wasn't even built
for prototyping,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.510
and so we found a lot
of inefficiencies in it

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.600
and just started building
UI design abstractions

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.490
on top of it.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:33.500
And we built it for ourselves
while we were designing Paper.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.980
We had all these ideas, and we
wanted to actually get them out

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.980
in prototypes.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.772
And so yeah, we actually
built Origami to do that.

00:12:41.772 --> 00:12:43.980
And then we just wanted to
share that with the world,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.240
and so we shipped it.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.000
CLARK VALBERG: So we developed
Invision in an answer to,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.900
I think, a couple of
conspiring factors.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.780
One was I think that designers
were engaging with some of what

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.210
were [INAUDIBLE] looked at as
kind of academic approaches

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.160
to design, like usability
testing and real user testing

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.590
and some of the things
that people tend to do when

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.505
a product's already
been launched,

00:13:08.505 --> 00:13:10.879
and they're trying to figure
out what to do with it next.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.990
People were doing that
during the design process.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.480
And people were engaging their
end users, their stakeholders,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.560
and the multiple
networks of stakeholders.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.820
Not only like the main
product leads, but also

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.850
real users, and VPs,
and domain experts.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.890
And we needed a
place that allowed

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.020
all of that
conversation to happen,

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.980
and we needed a really
low investment way

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.760
for the product to iterate and
to evolve in a process of kind

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.987
of design discovery
in reaction to that.

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.820
So we wanted to make
sure that whatever tool

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.665
we built required very little
investment from the designer

00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:47.830
and was extremely flexible
the whole way through

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.870
so that the story could
really come through.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.180
NOAH LEVIN: Yeah, I think
it's really interesting

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.470
to hear even a little
bit of contrast

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.000
in the backgrounds of
how each of these people

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.050
made their tools.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.390
You're having some that are
sort of more observational

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.195
that you're going and
interviewing various designers

00:13:59.195 --> 00:14:00.790
and learning about the problems
they're having, and how to

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.290
fix them.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.972
And you can kind of step back.

00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:05.180
Maybe you have your own
understanding being designers

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.817
on the panel, but
it can be different

00:14:06.817 --> 00:14:09.150
than maybe you see your own
problems that you're facing,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.290
and you're solving
them for yourself.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.760
Yet we still kind of end up
with a somewhat similar result

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.100
in being able to-- seeing
this need for being

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.480
able to prototype faster.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.310
So the next thing
I want to ask is

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.280
why did it take up until now?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.570
Honestly, I think even like
three years ago, at most,

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.270
people might have prototyped a
little bit with some web code,

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.010
or maybe used Keynote, and I
think a lot of people still do.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.570
But a lot of the tools that
you guys represent up here

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.640
are pretty new.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.680
And what do we think took
so long to make that happen?

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.682
I know, Paul, you had
some thoughts on this.

00:14:39.682 --> 00:14:43.016
PAUL COLTON: Yeah, actually
we were chatting last night

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:44.640
or this morning--
it's all a blur now--

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.690
but the idea is how can
it be that all of a sudden

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.160
we're all here on stage?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.650
I didn't know about these
guys when I started.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.370
I mean seriously.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.140
And I mean it's awfully
interesting that how could

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.120
we have all these different
ways of prototyping

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.740
and all converge to this
point in this room today?

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.670
And I rewound, and I
thought about everything,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.180
and long story short
is I think it had a lot

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.180
to do with the whole skeumorphic
shift to flat design.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.020
If you think about it, we
all spend all this time

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.540
nudging a pixel to get
that perfect texture,

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.170
or that perfect shadow,
or whatever it might be.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.900
And frankly, how
the user interacted

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.860
with that perfect look,
if you will, came second.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.310
I think when Apple kind
of threw that out frankly,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.480
shifted to let's
keep things flat,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.800
but now let's focus on the
experience a little more--

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.280
the motion and the actual
interaction-- all of a sudden

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.710
that put it front and center.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.550
So it's no coincidence that
for us, when we went out,

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.640
that was the pain point.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.490
No one said to me,
how do I make a better

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.120
texture for my mobile app?

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.280
That was gone.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.780
What came to me is, how do I
get this nuanced interaction

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.590
completely, precisely
how I want it to be,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.370
and how do I do that without
investing a lot of time

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.380
in engineering and
design, frankly?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.230
Or at least can I iterate
my design of the interaction

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.362
many times over?

00:16:06.362 --> 00:16:08.070
Because I always like
to say, by the way,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.300
designers like to iterate.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.110
They need to.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.562
Engineers do not.

00:16:11.562 --> 00:16:13.770
They do not want to rewrite
their code over and over,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.312
and I think that's fundamentally
the big shift, basically.

00:16:16.312 --> 00:16:17.770
BRANDON WALKIN:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:18.478
It's interesting.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:21.920
Like when I started seeing
a shift was when we actually

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.490
shipped chat heads
and Facebook Home.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.490
It's funny.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.970
Before that, I was
trying to tell everybody

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.090
about Quartz Composer.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.540
I'm like, it's
this amazing tool.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.400
It looks crazy, but you can
actually use it to build these

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.890
really cool interactions
that you otherwise couldn't.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.590
And no one wanted to hear it.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.950
But yeah, when we
shipped Facebook home,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.450
it had a bunch of pretty
interesting interactions

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.930
in there all done
in Quartz Composer.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.610
And then I think one of our
design directors, Julie Zhuo,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.300
wrote a blog post where she
kind of talked about some

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.240
of the design process,
and she mentioned

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.980
that yeah, the whole thing
was done in Quartz Composer.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.750
And so that's when I
saw this immediate shift

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:13.310
where people started thinking
about interactive tools.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.599
I think that was a
big change there.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.640
NOAH LEVIN: So I want to
shift gears a little bit

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.859
and talk a little bit
about the actual creation

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:23.099
experience, the experience of
opening up one of these tools

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.430
and creating something,
and how the difference

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.020
between these tools
might actually

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.102
affect the outcome of
what you're producing.

00:17:29.102 --> 00:17:31.310
They're very different, if
you've used each of these.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.518
Some of them are more visual.

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.100
Some of them are code-based.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.320
They have a different approach
to how you might do it.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.210
So to start, there's no
one on the panel that

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.190
really works on a
timeline-based tool.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.910
No one here really-- something
like Flash or After Effects.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.950
Why don't we think-- is
there a reason for that?

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.640
Why don't we have
timeline-based tools

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.359
versus something more free-form?

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:55.650
KOEN BOK: Well, if you're
building an interactive tool,

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.420
then time is not a constant.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.220
Stuff like state is
shifting throughout time,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.192
and it's going to go
through different states

00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:05.150
every time you use the
app and stuff like that.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.590
So a timeline isn't
very efficient,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.540
if you're trying to build
these longer interactions.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.660
Maybe just a show
of a small thing,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.280
and I think that's the most
obvious reason that that

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.009
wouldn't be the best model
to pick for these new tools.

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:19.550
NOAH LEVIN: But why
do we think that?

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.490
Even with that being the case,
a lot of people-- at least

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.127
in my experience, and
even seeing at Google--

00:18:25.127 --> 00:18:27.210
are gravitating still to
the timeline-based tools.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.970
What is it about them that
are making people use them?

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.040
KOEN BOK: Well, I
mean a lot of people

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.600
build a knowledge
around these tools,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.580
and I think they do
particular things very well.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.110
And they're still very valuable.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.660
It's not that we're going
to move After Effects

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.890
out of the market with
our interactive tools.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.090
I think they're going to
live next to each other,

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.430
and we'll slowly start
taking more of the stuff

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.870
that they're really good at
and taking that into our apps,

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.572
I think.

00:18:52.572 --> 00:18:54.030
PAUL COLTON: One
thing I'll add is,

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.860
time, at least for
interaction, implies

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.760
you know the exact flow that
your user's going to take.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.270
Right?

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.090
Interaction by definition
means it's random,

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.685
and I think that's fundamentally
why timeline doesn't work.

00:19:05.685 --> 00:19:08.740
And you can imagine, we've
been asked countless times,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.070
put a timeline in there.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.940
And we're like, interaction
is not about timelines.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.980
You can't dictate what
your user's going to do.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.340
They might reverse the order in
which they move their finger.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.790
You're not going to
know that ahead of time.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.630
ADAM DEBRECZENI: Yeah, one of
the big things in Form is we

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.170
were debating this internally
whether to do timelines

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.210
or something a lot
more interactive.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:34.660
And we thought that removing
as much abstraction as possible

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.040
is really important when you're
trying to think of new ideas,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.950
because if you conceive of
an idea in After Effects,

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.710
and you load it on your phone,
and you can't actually interact

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.485
with it, there's a
level of telephone

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.200
that you give to the engineer.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.350
Versus a system
that works exactly

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.730
like it would in production--
lets you actually

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.200
tweak little variables
as you're using it.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.310
So we have this
silly thing where

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.290
if you're dragging
around an image,

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.440
you can actually adjust
the spring friction when

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.750
you're dragging the image.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.540
Or you could have
like three iPhones,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.026
and they could all have
people interacting with it

00:20:10.026 --> 00:20:11.400
with different
amount of springs.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.040
It's really difficult to
fine tune stuff like that

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.262
when it's a pre-baked movie.

00:20:16.262 --> 00:20:16.970
NOAH LEVIN: Yeah.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.520
That's a really point.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.950
I'm wondering, though, how
do these UIs actually--

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.540
particularly for Form and
Origami, that a lot of people

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.640
have mentioned they feel one of
the reasons they haven't tried

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.030
it out yet is maybe there's
a bit of a learning curve.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.540
It's a different
way of thinking.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.110
It's something that
they haven't done yet.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.193
How do we help that a bit?

00:20:34.193 --> 00:20:36.120
How do we teach
people this new tool?

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.920
Is it the right
UI, or do you think

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.380
your UIs might change over time?

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.040
BRANDON WALKIN: Yeah,
so it's worth noting,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.730
Origami looks the way
it does, because it's

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.120
an extension on Quartz Composer.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.610
I wasn't given a team
of engineers and people

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.090
to go and make a
tool from scratch.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.660
It was just something
I had to build

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.600
in a scrappy way
in my spare time,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.720
just because I needed to do it.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.390
And so that's definitely why
it looks the way it does.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.430
But I mean, in terms
of-- what I think's

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.800
actually really important
is the fact that you

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.850
can build anything
in Quartz Composer.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.580
Like it's completely unbounded,
and I think that's important,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.430
because when you're
trying to be creative,

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.450
and you actually might
want to do something

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.720
that the maker of the
tool hadn't thought about.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:30.320
And if you can't get those ideas
out there, it's a huge problem.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.830
So I do think there
are definitely

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.600
huge problems to the
Quartz Composer interface.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.060
It's intimidating.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.280
A lot of people
find it confusing.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.299
And yeah, there are a bunch of
other issues as well, but yeah.

00:21:44.299 --> 00:21:46.090
So I think if I were
to start from scratch,

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.716
it would look way different.

00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:49.340
But it would still
have that capability

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.096
to let people build anything
that they can imagine.

00:21:52.096 --> 00:21:54.470
NOAH LEVIN: I think there's
a really interesting contrast

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.011
there between what
you're mentioning,

00:21:56.011 --> 00:21:58.714
which is you have this
kind of free-form canvas.

00:21:58.714 --> 00:22:01.130
In the same way that you have
this big canvas in something

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.470
like Sketch or Photoshop,
you have almost a blank page,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.670
and you can create anything.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.920
But with that comes a little
bit of hesitation, right?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.380
Everyone has that little
bit of blank page,

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.989
you just don't know
where to start.

00:22:10.989 --> 00:22:13.280
And actually I'm excited by
the contrast on this panel,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.530
because I find something
like Invision, for example,

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.940
there are more
constraints to it.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.660
There's a little bit
more-- if you've used it,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.618
it's a little bit simpler
for you to get going.

00:22:21.618 --> 00:22:24.457
There's not the same kinds
of questions from customers

00:22:24.457 --> 00:22:26.040
that I've heard about
that are saying,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.830
I don't know how to
start with this tool.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.760
But on the other
hand, how does that

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.040
affect what you can create?

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.390
This one, for example,
you can tie together

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.340
screens a lot
easier, and you can

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.180
allow things to slide left
and right or up and down.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.610
How have you found the
approach of having a simpler,

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.402
approachable tool versus
a more flexible one?

00:22:43.402 --> 00:22:45.360
CLARK VALBERG: I think
I look at product design

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.252
as being three
different dimensions.

00:22:47.252 --> 00:22:48.710
So there's the
aesthetic dimension,

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.050
the interactive dimension,
and then there's the story.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.950
So with any of these
products, the focus

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.250
of the product kind of
biases you towards a focus

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.200
on one of those dimensions.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.616
So with Invision,
the focus is story.

00:23:02.616 --> 00:23:03.740
We all agree on aesthetics.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.554
I think we're not
wire forming tools,

00:23:05.554 --> 00:23:07.220
so we all agree that
you need aesthetics

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.630
to be able to have a broad
reach with your user engagement.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.580
But if the story is
why the user showed up,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.229
and the story is where you
want to bring them in the end,

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.770
I look at that as
being fundamentally

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.620
different than engineering
an interaction, which

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.820
I think is also important.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.278
But I think it's
something that has

00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:28.742
to happen after the story has
been nailed down, because most

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:30.450
of the business
strategy, which is really

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.319
what we do as designers, and
I think this also conspires

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:36.610
with the whole changing role
of designers and designers

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.270
just doing more,
being more involved,

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.700
and taking a greater leadership
role in the product design

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.090
process, and even a
strategic business level.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.700
But when you're
there, and you're

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.030
thinking about what
the business needs,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.620
the story has to be primary.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.840
The interactions are there as an
accompaniment to the aesthetics

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.960
to create comfort as the
user responds to the system.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.090
Which is also important.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.270
PAUL COLTON: I just wanted
to add, from our take,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.760
I don't think-- you
don't require complexity

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.000
to build something complex,
and I think, think of a pencil.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.920
It gives you complete
creative freedom.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.340
Yeah, it's one of the
simplest tools you could have.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.680
I think for us, that's
been our approach.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.560
How can we build the
absolute simplest tool

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.685
to then also absolutely
not hamper any creativity?

00:24:27.685 --> 00:24:29.310
And to touch a little
bit on your point

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.320
too, I think also
for all of us, is

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.780
I think we strive-- I'll speak
for everyone, at least we do--

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.320
we strive that our tool
doesn't influence what

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.250
the final product's
going to be like.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.770
That's when we
know we've failed.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.640
If everything you build looks
like it was built in Pixate,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.237
then we've done something wrong.

00:24:46.237 --> 00:24:48.570
We want to make sure that the
end result looks like what

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.990
you wanted to build,
and we were just

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.507
that pencil that made it happen.

00:24:53.507 --> 00:24:55.965
ADAM DEBRECZENI: Just to add
on to Brandon's point-- sorry,

00:24:55.965 --> 00:24:58.280
I cut you off, Koen.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.960
One of the big things
that we focused

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.550
on with the open
canvas, the fact

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.382
that you can build
anything, is it's

00:25:05.382 --> 00:25:06.590
a great amount of difficulty.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.685
So you first open up
Form-- blank canvas.

00:25:08.685 --> 00:25:11.410
It's really intimidating.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.910
The main thing that we focused
on while designing patches

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.240
is how do we make this the most
consistent system possible?

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.010
And because everything
is consistent,

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.100
there's only outputs
and only inputs,

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.880
data flow is always
the same way,

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.690
you can build a lot
of reusable chunks.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.460
So you can build
your own patches.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.750
And because you can
reuse a lot of it,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.490
and you can build
your own patches,

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.110
the canvas actually
ends up shrinking a lot.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.490
Because it's actually
a very concise canvas,

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.520
it makes it very easy to parse.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.212
And because it's parsable,
you can actually-- well,

00:25:44.212 --> 00:25:45.670
because you can
build anything, you

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.586
can actually build like
a hamburger menu patch

00:25:47.586 --> 00:25:49.270
if you really wanted to.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.950
And it's still made
out of the same 20

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.050
patches that Form ships with.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:53.690
NOAH LEVIN: One
thing that's starting

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.064
to come up that
I'm curious about

00:25:55.064 --> 00:25:57.690
is Clark had
mentioned that there's

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.960
a big emphasis in
Invision for storytelling,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.790
and at other points
of our conversation

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.850
here, we're talking
a bit about moments

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.950
of openness and execution.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.320
Is there a point in the process,
in the design process, that you

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.410
think your tool is
meant to be used in?

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.580
Can it be used at any point?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.650
Are your tools all possible for
storytelling in a higher level?

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.730
Is it just about execution
polish and detail?

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.350
KOEN BOK: Well,
I think that ties

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.080
into the flexibility
of your tool.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.780
So for example, if you would
take the linear approach

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.190
for any of these tools, you
would be pretty much confined

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.950
in this one thing, like
this microinteraction.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:36.660
But once you get to code or
visual or signal flow program,

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.620
you can do anything.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.700
So it's pretty-- like in Framer,
it's really-- it's not easy,

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.420
but it's doable to set
up really huge apps,

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.650
basically build entire
applications in there.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.720
So for us I think
we often get defined

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.674
as sort of like a
microinteraction tool,

00:26:53.674 --> 00:26:55.340
because you focus on
these small things.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.006
But it's actually, I think we're
one of the few tools where it's

00:26:58.006 --> 00:27:02.150
possible to build out
entire app experiences.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.276
BRANDON WALKIN: Go for it.

00:27:03.276 --> 00:27:03.960
Oh, OK.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.460
Yeah.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.830
So at Facebook at
least, we started

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.260
using Quartz Composer
really early in the process.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.580
And so whether it's like a new
app that we're thinking about,

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.360
when we go and
pitch this to Mark,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.170
he's expecting to see a full
prototype that is polished,

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.610
that has animations,
that has interactions,

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.730
that's thought through.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.540
And obviously
sketching plays a role.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.140
We all have
sketchbooks and draw.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.730
It's very low
friction to do that,

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.980
but yeah, I think it really
does help tell the story when

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.200
the thing that you're showing
looks like how it will actually

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.837
look to users.

00:27:44.837 --> 00:27:46.670
CLARK VALBERG: I think
a pretty major caveat

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.140
there is that investment
is the enemy of creativity.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.130
The more you invest in any
particular direction, the more

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.890
biased, naturally, you
are to moving ever further

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.379
in that direction.

00:27:58.379 --> 00:28:00.420
So when you're dealing
with these multiple layers

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.005
of abstraction, you
have your design,

00:28:02.005 --> 00:28:03.590
then you have your
interactive components,

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.215
and maybe you have two different
tools, so you're in Photoshop,

00:28:06.215 --> 00:28:07.770
and you're in one
of these tools.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.270
You have to be very
careful that you

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.750
don't end up down a rabbit hole.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.720
It just makes you either
personally resistant

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.980
to the change that
you'd like to make,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.510
or the changes that happen as a
natural process of discovering

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.330
what the user really needs.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.770
And I think that there's
also a really important

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.140
philosophical difference between
articulation and discovery.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.437
So if you have an
idea, if we took,

00:28:29.437 --> 00:28:31.020
let's say Facebook
Paper or something,

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.260
and we knew that we wanted
to take that animation

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.680
and design it, to engineer
it, to make it look exactly

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.620
like that with all the
subtle nuances, that's

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.860
a certain process.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.640
That's a certain domain.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.310
If you're not sure
what you want, and you

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.420
know that the user
came from point A,

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.504
and they're ending
up at point Z,

00:28:50.504 --> 00:28:52.670
and there are all these
different points in between,

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.580
and you want to
understand how to deal

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.460
with the gentle volley of
interaction with that user,

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.190
I think that you need to stay
really flexible, because three

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.200
screens in your app
could turn into one.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.800
Or one screen could
turn into three,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.750
depending on the direction
that you make strategically.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.990
NOAH LEVIN: Yeah.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.430
I'm going to move things
along just a little bit,

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.680
just so we can make sure we
touch on one of the topics

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.435
that I think we
talked to be about one

00:29:15.435 --> 00:29:18.170
of the most interesting
things we look at

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.820
is where is this really going?

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.070
Is it going to be
one of these tools

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.750
that we end up
using predominately

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.530
in the same way you
could argue something

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.210
like Photoshop or
Sketch is done?

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.980
There's not a huge amount
of disparity in the tools

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.119
we've used in other contexts,
yet here these tools

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:33.910
are very different.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.820
And you have a lot of choice
now, and in some ways,

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.820
you can almost find that
paralyzing as a way to start.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:45.110
And so just as kind of a
final topic to touch on ,

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.420
let's start with, is it
going to be one tool?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.445
Do you think that it's just
one of us standing after this

00:29:51.445 --> 00:29:52.820
or something, and
it's just going

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.255
to be one tool you
approach, or is it

00:29:54.255 --> 00:29:55.505
a combination of these things?

00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:57.640
Can you use these
things together?

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.140
Yeah.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.582
Where do we think this
is going in that sense?

00:30:00.582 --> 00:30:02.040
KOEN BOK: I think
it's good to have

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.750
choice, finally, as designers.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.680
We've been coming
from five to 10 years

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.690
where if you were designing, you
were probably using Photoshop,

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.290
and everybody around
was using Photoshop.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:19.114
So I'm pretty happy
to get rid of that,

00:30:19.114 --> 00:30:20.530
although Photoshop
is a nice tool.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.920
But I'm also pretty sure that
all the different directions--

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.460
like it's weird that we all
have such different approaches,

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.790
like from UI-based to
visual programming to like

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.000
actual codes.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.650
And I think the real
tool in the future

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.530
will probably be a
blend of some of those

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.100
in a really smart balance,
where maybe you give up

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.530
some flexibility for a
really low learning curve,

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.160
or maybe not at all.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.000
We'll see.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.830
But I would definitely be
surprised if in five years,

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.630
we would still be debating
if visual program would

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.060
be better than code
or better than a UI.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.587
That will solve
itself over time.

00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:57.670
BRANDON WALKIN: I actually
do think designers will

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.290
be expected to know
prototyping tools.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.390
KOEN BOK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.056
BRANDON WALKIN: Just
like every designer

00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:06.270
is expected to know
Photoshop or Sketch,

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.870
and designers are
really good at that.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.328
Like you can go on
Dribble, and you

00:31:09.328 --> 00:31:12.770
can see a whole range of
different types of visuals,

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.230
right?

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.920
You're actually not seeing
that with interaction.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.690
What you normally see
is people will be really

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.070
creative with visuals,
because they know how

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.290
to use those tools,
but then when it

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.120
comes to how the app
is actually structured

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.420
and the specific
interactions, they'll

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.250
pull stuff from some applets
out there and maybe another app,

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.720
combine them together.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.810
But you really don't see
the same sort of creativity

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.040
in interactions.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.390
And so I think once people start
learning these new interaction

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.680
tools, and once they
become more advanced,

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.840
easier to learn,
easier to use, I

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.827
think that's going to be huge.

00:31:48.827 --> 00:31:50.910
ADAM DEBRECZENI: And if
you really think about it,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.951
we've been talking and
interacting with computers

00:31:52.951 --> 00:31:54.310
the same way for like 30 years.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.370
It's been [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.660
They've been talking back
to us through consoles.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.490
And there's been
almost a sense of dogma

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.352
laid down with how we
actually build things.

00:32:04.352 --> 00:32:06.810
And for the first time, we're
actually empowering designers

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.800
to go out and essentially make
their designs interactive,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.080
and we have no dogma right now.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.570
So it's really
fascinating that we

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.390
have Wiziwig,
visual programming,

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.267
and textual-based programming.

00:32:20.267 --> 00:32:22.600
It's interesting right now
that we have no expectations,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.350
so I think that's why there's
all these different directions.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.120
CLARK VALBERG: I
think the thing that's

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.280
going to precipitate
all of this change

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.100
is the changing role
of the designer.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.625
So I think we've seen a
convergence around everybody

00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:34.750
just generally describing
themselves as a designer,

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.916
because nobody wanted to
be just a UX person or just

00:32:36.916 --> 00:32:38.490
a visual person.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.942
I see in the future, and
I see this happening now,

00:32:40.942 --> 00:32:43.150
even companies in this room,
where you have a product

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:47.090
designer, who really thinks
more like a product manager.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.000
And I think product managers
that also think like designers,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.560
and I think best of
both will probably

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.630
have that kind of mindset--
strategically-driven, needs

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.105
of the business
at the forefront.

00:32:58.105 --> 00:32:59.480
Leadership skills--
understanding

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.110
how to engage end users, how
to take a lot of feedback

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.360
and sort it, and throw away
the stuff that isn't good,

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.820
but interpret it emphatically.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.810
And then, perhaps,
people who are more

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:13.832
focused on the interactive
layer, the more subtle nuances

00:33:13.832 --> 00:33:15.540
of an application,
and I see those people

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.975
sitting in the room as
part of an ecosystem of how

00:33:19.975 --> 00:33:23.690
a product is designed in an
open, kind of socialized way.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.990
What I don't see is the
traditional hand-off process

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.517
where a designer or a few
designers go into a room,

00:33:29.517 --> 00:33:31.100
they build something,
and then there's

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.390
this cadence of design review.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.300
I think that humped
design review

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.080
cadence will flatten out.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.490
And the design that's
being worked on

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.430
will be socialized
and more available

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.940
and engaged beyond
the design department,

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.472
kind of through the life of the
product development process.

00:33:49.472 --> 00:33:50.180
NOAH LEVIN: Yeah.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.721
It's even interesting
how these tools

00:33:51.721 --> 00:33:53.330
might affect our
role in that process

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.980
and change the
pieces in which we're

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.320
involved throughout that cycle.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.644
We did want to just
pause here for questions,

00:33:59.644 --> 00:34:02.060
and see if there are anything
that you guys were wondering

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.110
that we can help answer.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.096
And there's people,
I think, with mics

00:34:05.096 --> 00:34:06.970
that are walking around
and can help you out.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.790
So I guess just raise
your hand if there's

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.889
some kind of burning thing on
your mind, and we'll go around.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.989
Oh, my god, we have questions.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.199
So whoever's closest,
right over there.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:23.123
Whoever gets the mic is going
to be the one that gets to ask.

00:34:23.123 --> 00:34:26.150
AUDIENCE: How do you guys
feel, or what do you guys

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.460
think about the
dichotomy of tools

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.974
that starts to emerge when
you have a tool for visuals

00:34:31.974 --> 00:34:35.520
versus a tool for
interactions, and like maybe

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.920
even a different means?

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.679
How do you deal with data
in those prototypes as well?

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.550
Because I personally would love
to have a tool where I can just

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:52.199
go and just focus on one thing
and design an entire product,

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:55.810
versus having to flip around
through different tools

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.272
depending on their
strengths and weaknesses.

00:34:58.272 --> 00:34:59.730
PAUL COLTON: I'll
just say, I think

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.280
one challenge that we've tried
to stay, for example, away

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.230
from is anywhere away
from your core product

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.760
becomes a slippery slope.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.180
In other words, we
were joking last night.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.367
Next thing after square,
you want a triangle.

00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:14.950
And now you're going to want a
circle, and all of a sudden you

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.062
want Sketch.

00:35:16.062 --> 00:35:18.020
Now on the other hand,
now you want a timeline,

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.580
now you want compositing, and
now you have After Effects.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.440
Though the problem is
how far do we keep going?

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.330
I think for us, what
we've decided to say

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:28.640
is, there's a big gap in
the workflow right now.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.200
Regardless of the tool you
pick for your processes

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.920
of building these
interactions, that's

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.640
the hole we're trying to fill.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.950
We're trying to say,
you've designed over here,

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.500
and you want to
deliver over there.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.560
There's a big hole
in the middle.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.810
We're going to fill that hole.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.932
I think we, at least
speaking for Pixate,

00:35:43.932 --> 00:35:45.390
we have to be
careful we don't keep

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.560
slipping more and more
into, oh, by the way,

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.195
now we're your design tool,
now your pixel editing tool,

00:35:50.195 --> 00:35:51.320
we're your deployment tool.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.117
You know what I'm saying.

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.700
So there's a give
and take, basically.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.751
I don't think one
tool can do it all.

00:35:56.751 --> 00:35:59.250
I don't think you want one tool
to do it all, because if so,

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.330
you wouldn't have Sketch.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.690
CLARK VALBERG: I think
aesthetic authoring will happen

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.080
in the desktop probably in the
incumbent tool set, Photoshop,

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.280
Sketch.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.610
But I think that the
process of bringing that

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:15.460
to life and kind of
moving that through time

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.810
in an interactive way,
which really prototyping

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.530
is just a storytelling
tool, but I

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.787
see that converging
in one place.

00:36:21.787 --> 00:36:23.620
NOAH LEVIN: Let's take
another question just

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.300
to make sure we get
a few more out there.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.883
Yeah, whoever you
guys want to walk up

00:36:26.883 --> 00:36:29.780
to you that's closer to you.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.490
There you go.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.270
AUDIENCE: Last time I used
a visual prototyping tool,

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.800
it involved a lot of
logic and decision-making

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.750
that normally doesn't happen
until you get into code.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.190
And that sort of gave me this
grandiose vision of one day

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.720
maybe we'll be able to
build apps completely

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.860
through some of these
prototyping tools.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.570
How far away do you think
we are from that happening?

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.730
ADAM DEBRECZENI: I
think we're-- sorry.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:59.530
I think we're very, very close.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.780
The reason Form took so
long is our foundation

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:09.389
is you could actually run these
compositions in production.

00:37:09.389 --> 00:37:11.180
That's something that
we're working toward,

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.190
and it's not that far out.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.350
So even though it's
very challenging,

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.840
and there's a lot of
logic, some of that,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.810
unfortunately, is necessary
to cover all the edge cases.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.290
So there is a very
short-term future

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.290
where you can just do file
export and load it up in Xcode,

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.960
and give it to your engineer, so
there's no lost in translation.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.260
CLARK VALBERG: I
think generating code

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.190
is very different than
architecting software.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.680
So even if you have a tool
that can spit out some code

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.830
that's descriptive at a
programmatic level of the thing

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.810
that you see on the screen,
how that ties together--

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:46.600
frameworks.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.550
I mean there's probably at least
some developers in the room,

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.130
right?

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.949
It is way more complicated
than just generating code.

00:37:51.949 --> 00:37:53.490
All of this has to
be glued together.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.830
There has to be
some infrastructure

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.090
to tie it all together, and
that takes hard decisions.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.360
And even how that happens is a
very rapidly evolving process.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.400
I mean it's a whole field.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.650
And so I think it would be
really difficult for a tool

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.532
to generate an app
you could ship.

00:38:07.532 --> 00:38:08.990
And I think that'll
probably be a--

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.360
BRANDON WALKIN: I think there
are all these complexities

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.680
that you have to deal
with when you're building

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.369
an app, versus what you actually
want to be thinking about when

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:15.160
you're prototyping.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.540
For example, when
you're prototyping,

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.920
it may not be worth
the effort to make

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.740
sure your prototype works
in every single language

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.899
or on every single screen size.

00:38:24.899 --> 00:38:26.440
That's going to take
a bunch of time,

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.940
and if it's not going to help
you solve the problem that you

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.380
were originally trying to
solve, you don't want to do it.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.941
I think in addition
to that, when

00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:36.690
you're building apps--
say you're building

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.100
an app for iOS--
you probably want

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.800
to use the system frameworks.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.144
You want to use UI kit.

00:38:43.144 --> 00:38:44.560
That gives you a
bunch of benefits

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.340
like it's immediately
accessible if you're

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.280
visually impaired
or hearing impaired.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.040
The Apple just kind of work.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.850
And I think if
the tool just sort

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:59.040
of renders in its
own environment,

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.985
you're going to miss
out on a lot of that.

00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:01.610
KOEN BOK: Yeah.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:04.140
And having said that, I
also-- I'm with Brandon.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.260
I think that it's too big and
probably the wrong problem

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.160
to tackle to go
from your prototype

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.589
to the final product at once.

00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:13.130
But there's a lot of in-between
that we can actually improve,

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.630
I feel.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.760
I think a lot of you are
still sending ZIP files

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.936
up and down with resources
through your engineers.

00:39:17.936 --> 00:39:18.810
That's kind of silly.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.280
I mean we could do
better than that.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.070
I think there's a lot of obvious
stuff like matching inputs

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.450
for spring physics,
maybe even mapping out

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.540
positions like states that
we can maybe send down

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.040
to the iOS engineer that
can also use a state machine

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.060
and can reuse all that stuff.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.340
And I think that's the
obvious stuff that we still

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.085
have to solve and
haven't, and that's

00:39:40.085 --> 00:39:42.210
what I'm going to try to
focus on in the beginning.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.835
CLARK VALBERG: I just
have one warning.

00:39:43.835 --> 00:39:46.730
The minute you find yourself
heading up the investment

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.860
slope, and the day you walk into
a meeting with VPs or product

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.990
people or your own
team, and you're

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.257
angry at the person
who gave you feedback,

00:39:55.257 --> 00:39:57.090
suggesting you should
change everything, not

00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.411
because he's wrong, but
because it means that you have

00:40:00.411 --> 00:40:02.410
to go and redo something
you spent a week doing,

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.010
be very afraid.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.855
That's not where you want to be.

00:40:06.855 --> 00:40:09.230
NOAH LEVIN: We probably time
for about one more question.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.813
If there's more
things-- I think there

00:40:10.813 --> 00:40:13.170
were more hands than that,
feel free to either tweet,

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.397
add us, or just find everyone
during the happy hour later,

00:40:16.397 --> 00:40:17.230
something like that.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.671
But I think we have time for
just maybe one more quick one.

00:40:20.671 --> 00:40:21.170
Yeah.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.917
Wherever you are.

00:40:21.917 --> 00:40:22.500
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.600
Alexander from Inbox.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.470
I have a question
for all of you.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:32.520
I think it's amazing
all of these tools

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.781
enabling all different
types of content creation,

00:40:35.781 --> 00:40:37.864
but what ends up happening
is that over the course

00:40:37.864 --> 00:40:40.850
of a project, all these
different types of content

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.510
get siloed into these services.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:46.050
So the more you use, everything
gets fragmented and spread out.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:49.010
So I just was wondering what
your thoughts were on that.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.526
Does that makes sense?

00:40:50.526 --> 00:40:51.150
KOEN BOK: Yeah.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.180
I guess it's a
downside of choice.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:53.961
Right?

00:40:53.961 --> 00:40:55.710
AUDIENCE: I don't mean
like similar tools.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.168
I mean like each
one of these tools

00:40:57.168 --> 00:40:59.210
that you use is specialized
in a different way.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.880
KOEN BOK: Yeah.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.870
AUDIENCE: So it's come to the
point where we're using 10

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:06.590
cloud-based tools right now,
and we have to go to each one

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.740
of these services to either
export content and put it

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.770
somewhere or host
it and share a link,

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.403
so I was just wondering if you
guys think that's a problem,

00:41:14.403 --> 00:41:15.300
or--

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.175
CLARK VALBERG: Thankfully,
Adobe has actually

00:41:17.175 --> 00:41:19.370
acquired all these guys.

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.880
PAUL COLTON: We're all merging.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.300
Well, I think
obviously integration

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.060
with the other
tools is important.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.080
I mean obviously,
like that's why

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.587
earlier the point about
rectangles and circles

00:41:32.587 --> 00:41:33.420
really isn't a joke.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.610
The point is we don't want
to get into that stuff.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.110
Right?

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.840
The idea is you know
how to whether it

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.470
be vector or
bitmap-based, you're

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.920
doing that somewhere else.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.980
We're not asking you
to redo anything.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.290
We're saying, bring that in
here, and when you're done,

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.470
it'll go out to there,
wherever that might be.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:51.580
I hear you, though, that
movement of data is a pain.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.830
And hopefully, I think either
some of us already have,

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:54.329
frankly.

00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:57.480
Others have already dealt
with import and exporting.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.370
We'll look that
and just continue

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.954
to streamline the workflow,
I think, is the answer.

00:42:01.954 --> 00:42:02.870
ADAM DEBRECZENI: Yeah.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.130
And just I'm totally
trolling at this point,

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.552
but we have a JavaScript
patch in form,

00:42:08.552 --> 00:42:10.010
so you could just
load a JavaScript

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.770
prototype in our tool.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.082
But that's not going
to help with your case.

00:42:14.082 --> 00:42:14.790
NOAH LEVIN: Cool.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.670
I think we're out of time.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.080
But thank you so
much for being here,

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.820
and I hope this is, again, like
the start of more conversations

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.820
about these tools and
what other gaps there

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.260
are in our design
process, and how

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.561
we can solve them
with more tools.

00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:28.060
So, yeah.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.250
Thanks a lot.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.050
And we'll see you around.
