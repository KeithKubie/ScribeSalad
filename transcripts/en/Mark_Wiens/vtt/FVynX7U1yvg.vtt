00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.010
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.843
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.843 --> 00:00:04.130
I'm in Islamabad, Pakistan,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.400
and we just arrived late last night.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.090
We're staying at the Serena Hotel,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.130
and today we're gonna go on

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.330
an Islamabad food tour.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.640
We're gonna go to some of
the famous restaurants,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.400
eat some of the dishes
that you have to eat

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.667
when you are in Islamabad.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:19.380
Islamabad is the capital city of Pakistan.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.370
But before we do anything,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.800
we're gonna go have
breakfast at the hotel first.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.650
All right, let's get the day started.

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.733
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.460
Hello, you ready for breakfast?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.293
Okay, let's go.

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:41.558
Good morning.

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:42.587
- [Staff] Good morning, sir, how are you?

00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:44.342
- Good morning, good, thank you.

00:00:44.342 --> 00:00:47.509
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:50.242
Thank you so much.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:55.846
Thank you.

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.030
I went straight for the good stuff,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.250
the Pakistani curries.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.560
Beef qeema, in particular,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.280
is what I'm looking forward to eating.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.170
But there's chicken curry,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.280
there's some potato curry,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.200
and some chickpeas.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.290
Thank you very much.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.460
I gotta pace myself, though,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.850
because we have a lot to eat today.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.500
Okay, let me try that beef qeema.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:14.900
Oh, that's delicious.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.780
You got the minced meat,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.290
you got a bunch of spices in there,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.490
you can taste the chili,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.080
and then it's like
juicy and slightly oily.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.380
Keema is a wonderful dish.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.560
Chickpeas are always good in Pakistan.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.810
They're always so creamy.

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:34.108
What kinda juice is this?

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.660
No, orange juice, but it might have like,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.060
some pineapple or something.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.250
It tastes like mixed fruit.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.041
(sighs)

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:48.208
(steady techno music)

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.940
Thank you very much.

00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:02.270
There's not a huge
selection of fruit, though,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.613
maybe due to the season we are in.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.740
One more cup of coffee for good measure.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.120
We're gonna go back to the room,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.953
get ready,

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:15.370
and then we got to head out,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.440
and then we're gonna begin

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.313
this Islamabad food tour today.

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:23.504
(upbeat techno music)

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.940
In comparison to other cities

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.360
that we've been to so far in Pakistan,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.480
Islamabad is so much more spread out.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.217
It's more organized,

00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:38.130
and that's because it's
a very modern city.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.970
It's a very newly developed city.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.530
We drove over to the university.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.920
This is one of the main universities

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.753
in Islamabad.

00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:46.290
There's a dhaba,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.470
a local restaurant that

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.450
we're gonna go to that is,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.420
it's legend,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.170
it's reached legendary
status for their food.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.003
All right, right outside of

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.490
the Asian Civilizations Institute.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.430
- Excited for this.
- Yeah,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.850
very excited to visit the dhaba.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.740
Even being someone from Islamabad,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.350
I have never visited this dhaba before,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.430
so I am as excited as you are, Mark.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.263
- Cool.

00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:08.057
When you walk in here,

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:09.520
it's kind of like a seating section

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.810
all under the trees.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.330
It's even like whole market,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.360
so, you can buy fruits and vegetables,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.280
there's restaurants.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.270
It's kinda like a chill spot for students

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.700
and everyone else who's not students,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.810
who just wants to come and eat

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.590
and hang out, like us.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.049
Everybody wants to pretend we're students.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.317
(laughs)

00:03:27.317 --> 00:03:28.731
(speaks foreign language)

00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:30.929
I think this is...

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:31.873
(speaks foreign language)

00:03:31.873 --> 00:03:35.220
- Mr. Anees is the son of Mr. Majeed,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.270
- Okay.
- Mr. Majeed,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.690
who basically opened this dhaba.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.195
- You see everything is--
- That looks amazing.

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:41.128
What is that dish?

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:42.820
- This is a barbecue fry.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.990
- Barbecue fry.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.135
- We first make it the barbecue,

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:48.958
then fry in the special gravy.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.203
- Yeah, looks incredible.

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:51.969
- Crisis, yes, crisis.

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:53.066
- That's the one,

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.983
the most famous, right?

00:03:56.332 --> 00:04:00.249
(cook speaks foreign language)

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:03.300
- This place is so cool,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.280
and it's actually called Majeed Huts.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.690
They serve a variety of different dishes.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.240
They have all the stews and the curries

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.560
in the back here prepared,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.450
then when you do order,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.980
he reheats them over that jet plane.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.040
So laid back too,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.690
that's a laid back feeling to it.

00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:22.935
(dhaba staff speak in foreign language)

00:04:29.388 --> 00:04:32.530
- [Man] They're just
churning out the orders.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.480
- [Mark] Oh man, I'm getting so hungry.

00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:41.965
(men singing folk song)

00:04:42.993 --> 00:04:44.250
- Crisis.
- Crisis, yeah,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.946
they call it crisis.
- They call it crisis.

00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:46.779
- They call it crisis.
- Because you never

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:47.612
eat a crisis.

00:04:47.612 --> 00:04:48.445
- Here comes the...

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:52.301
Yes. (laughs)

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.305
- Thank you, man.

00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:54.138
- Thank you.

00:04:54.138 --> 00:04:56.200
And we're also sitting
here with Majeed's son,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.732
who is the owner of the restaurant.

00:04:57.732 --> 00:04:59.610
This is one of the coolest restaurants

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.860
I've been to in Pakistan.

00:05:02.697 --> 00:05:03.530
- Once you order,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.770
it makes fresh,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.810
and then it deliver to the customers,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.888
where the people are.

00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:10.740
They like our food, very much, very much.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.710
This is the reason.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.543
- You're right.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.610
There's so many dishes to try.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.490
Let's try the kebab fry first.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.610
So they take the kebab,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.040
first the kebab is grilled, barbecued,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.970
and then they stir fry it with like a,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.383
looks like a tomato-y curry.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.240
- So, the dish which is on the other side,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.190
that is called the chicken laziza, yes.

00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:34.786
This is malai boti,

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:35.619
and this is chicken laziza.

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:38.120
- And now, we gotta try
the boneless chicken,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.870
two different boneless chicken dishes.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.120
Okay, next dish is the chicken malai boti,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.370
which is the cream sauce.

00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:46.174
Whoa.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.187
Straight up cream of chicken, oh wow.

00:05:49.187 --> 00:05:52.280
That's like rich and hearty creamy.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.113
Cream-sicle.

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:56.750
(man laughs)

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.870
Mr. Ali, how is that?

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.173
- It's amazing, Mark.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.950
It's really nice.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.580
The kebab masala is out of the world.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.690
- Yes, it is. (laughs)

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.610
The owner is gonna explain to us quickly

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.270
how the name, Crisis,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.760
the crisis dish came about.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.010
- Basically, crisis is a dish

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.440
that evolved over the time.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.987
So this is all the sworn of

00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:17.550
many men in the late,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.203
you can say, 80s,

00:06:19.203 --> 00:06:20.036
and they came,

00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:22.240
they take classes up to the four o'clock,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.353
and at four o'clock,

00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:24.670
then they get hungry,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.320
and at our space,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.230
we normally close lunch
hours at four o'clock,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.960
so all the things normally finish.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.640
So what they asked,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.410
that put all the things
together and mash it

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.425
and then wrap it into the egg.

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:40.994
So we will call it crisis, you know.

00:06:40.994 --> 00:06:42.014
In a crisis moment,

00:06:42.014 --> 00:06:43.190
there is a crisis dish.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.578
So this is the history.

00:06:44.578 --> 00:06:46.740
(Mark laughs)

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.950
- When there's a crisis moment,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.890
this is a crisis dish.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.349
That is a quote.

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:52.300
You know, it's 4 p.m.,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.730
you've just finished your classes,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.080
you get to your favorite restaurant,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.270
Majeed Hut, and unfortunately,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.300
they're just closing down

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.410
and all the dishes are done,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.570
so what do you do?

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.200
You look at the bottom of the pans,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.480
and you see, oh,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.650
there's still some leftovers.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.170
Let's scrape all that goodness

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.710
off the bottom of the pans,

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.160
re-fry it, and shove it in an omelet,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.706
and call it the crisis.

00:07:12.706 --> 00:07:13.687
- Cheers to Islamabad.

00:07:13.687 --> 00:07:14.520
- Islamabad.
- Crisis.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.353
- Crisis.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.530
You can taste like,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.055
yesterday's aloo-fry.

00:07:27.055 --> 00:07:28.931
It's just like, it's warming.

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:30.125
That's what it is, it's warming.

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:31.113
If you were in a crisis,

00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:33.180
that would solve your crisis.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.583
Okay, I'm going to try
that chicken lazizi now.

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.193
This is the other chicken curry.

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:40.508
Oh.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.161
Oh, that is stunning.

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:46.940
(laughs)

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.893
It is so good.

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:51.680
It's like that same
creaminess as the other one,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.513
as the boti,

00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:54.560
but it has like,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.780
maybe tomato-y-ness in it.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.440
- Yeah, cool. (laughs)

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.890
- You're just gonna
wanna lick your fingers,

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:00.770
and lick the plates,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.820
lick everything here.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.603
- I did just lick each finger.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.730
- Ali is still stuck in the crisis.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.563
- Ali is still stuck in the crisis.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.040
- Dip into the chutney.

00:08:13.402 --> 00:08:15.350
Mm, mm, chutney is delicious too.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.960
I like the yogurt-y minty-ness.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.450
I think the final dish we ordered,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.250
but we did actually order one more dish,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.210
because it was something I needed to try,

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.660
but this is the final order,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.610
dish on our plate right now is the dal.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.540
They have just excelled at their dal.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.640
What I like is it's not
too heavy on the ghee,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.150
so that you can taste the creaminess

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.920
of the actual lentils.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.623
Tastes like some fried
garlic on top of that.

00:08:36.623 --> 00:08:37.703
This one is chicken karahi fry.

00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:39.970
Looks like the same as the kebab,

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.800
but just a rich chicken,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.823
just a rich tomato-y looking sauce.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.590
That tomato sauce and the coriander

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.740
comes in really nicely.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:57.650
- I got a crunch,

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.483
the chilies are fresh.

00:08:58.483 --> 00:08:59.740
- You just end your day right here,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.323
cancel all further plans.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.738
- So right.
- Bye.

00:09:03.738 --> 00:09:04.571
- Bye.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.279
- What is also, nice to see you here.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.201
- Thank you so much.
- Please do visit

00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:12.498
our Pakistan and Skardu also.

00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:13.331
- Thank you so much.

00:09:13.331 --> 00:09:14.390
Yeah, I met up with,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.644
what was your name again?

00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:16.538
- Akbar Haiyal.

00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:17.663
- Akbar...
- Haiyal.

00:09:17.663 --> 00:09:18.990
- Haiyal, Akbar Haiyal.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.760
He watches our videos.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.660
They're just sitting down

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.520
at Majeed Huts to eat.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.000
And what do you think
about this restaurant?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.950
- It's a good place,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.390
and you also have tasty foods.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.040
- Yes, we just finished it,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.000
it was so good.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.980
- And it's extremely pleasure

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.076
to see you here in Pakistan.

00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:39.953
- Thank you so much.
- I was like, oh,

00:09:39.953 --> 00:09:42.400
because...
- Thank you so much.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.450
Okay, and they have invited me

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.360
to sit down and eat again with them,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.940
so let's, we gotta taste the,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.610
oh, this is a dish we didn't order,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.614
so maybe we should try

00:09:49.614 --> 00:09:50.447
the beans.
- Lobia.

00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:51.280
- Lovia?
- Lobia.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.470
- Lobia, okay.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.640
- Just break some roti

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.510
from here.
- Break some roti.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.181
Aw.

00:10:00.753 --> 00:10:01.586
It's really good.

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:04.047
It has a smoky flavor to it.

00:10:04.047 --> 00:10:05.250
And you can see, of course,

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.563
they ordered the crisis.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.683
- Thank you very much for coming,

00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:12.730
it's been nice.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.883
- Thank you so much.

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:18.040
(speaks foreign language)

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.170
That was, yeah,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.580
one of the greatest meals

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.550
we've had in Pakistan,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.750
and they're so friendly,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.680
they're so nice.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.070
What a stunning place.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.230
It's worth coming to Islamabad

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.033
just to eat at Majeed Hut.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.790
All right, we are on our way

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.080
to the next spot today.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.930
I will never forget

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.723
the crisis we just encountered.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.007
(upbeat techno music)

00:10:56.027 --> 00:10:59.610
All right, we had a little bit of a,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.810
hold on, focus,

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.030
we had a little bit of
a unplanned afternoon,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.200
and we had to run some errands,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.140
and then, it got kinda dark,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.170
and then we went to a restaurant,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.180
but they were closed,

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.210
so we gotta go back to get them.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.043
But in the meantime,

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:12.876
we decided to come up

00:11:12.876 --> 00:11:15.090
to the top of the mountain,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.960
to a restaurant that's called Monal.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.710
Okay, security checkpoint, hold on.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.893
Thank you very much.

00:11:21.893 --> 00:11:22.726
It's called Monal,

00:11:22.726 --> 00:11:24.840
but it's one of the must visit restaurants

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.133
because of the view.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.830
It's kinda cloudy today,

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.970
kinda like, air isn't the clearest,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.550
but this is the view of
Islamabad down below,

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.020
and yeah, it's a very nice restaurant,

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:38.853
and then, yeah,

00:11:38.853 --> 00:11:40.110
unfortunately, it got dark

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.410
right as we arrived here.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.930
The sun went down,

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.520
but still an impressive view.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.650
It was definitely worth it to come here

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.870
just to get the view,

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.221
but now, we can go eat Afghani kebabs.

00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:51.054
(all laugh)

00:11:51.054 --> 00:11:53.403
- I can't just wait for it.

00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:54.747
- [Cook] Be careful of the coal.

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:56.353
- Okay.
- [Cook] Be careful.

00:11:56.353 --> 00:11:58.915
(cook speaks foreign language)

00:11:58.915 --> 00:12:00.450
This is kebab.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.283
- Kebab.

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:02.116
This is one of the places that

00:12:02.116 --> 00:12:05.088
I really wanted to come in Islamabad,

00:12:05.088 --> 00:12:07.830
so Ali and I came here--
- All these are made

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.690
by my brother.
- Okay, the kebabs.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.523
- He is professional.

00:12:10.523 --> 00:12:12.470
He has been in Dubai for training people.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.303
- Wow.

00:12:13.303 --> 00:12:14.270
- Yeah, he is younger than me,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.830
but he knows very much about kebabs,

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.563
very much.
- And when did your,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.570
your family came from Afghanistan?

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.960
- Maybe it's about 37 years.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.130
- With the fan going,

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.710
he's just working those kebabs.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.760
The meat aroma, the smoke

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.080
is just going all the way down the--

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.950
- 30 years, that I'm making this--

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:34.783
- You've been making kebab

00:12:34.783 --> 00:12:35.616
for 30 years?
- Yeah,

00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:37.200
I was at the age of six.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.670
When we reached here,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.370
I started making kebabs.
- Start making kebabs

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.810
at the age of six.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.900
I can't stand myself any longer.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.197
We've gotta try these kebabs.

00:12:46.197 --> 00:12:47.466
- Why don't you have dinner with us?

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:48.773
- Thank you.

00:12:48.773 --> 00:12:49.763
- We would love it, come on.

00:12:49.763 --> 00:12:51.013
- Such a pleasure to meet you, sir.

00:12:51.013 --> 00:12:53.410
- Thank you, my pleasure
to meet you, hello.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.717
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

00:12:54.717 --> 00:12:55.700
- Nice to meet you too.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.251
- Essen.
- Essen?

00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:59.326
Essen, nice to meet you.
- Thank you, thank you,

00:12:59.326 --> 00:13:00.400
nice to meet you.
- Thank you so much.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.410
He watches our videos,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.390
and then he's invited us

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.910
to sit with him and his friends,

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.743
who are all here,

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:06.180
eating the kebabs.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.840
Such an amazing atmosphere,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.520
such a friendly place.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.260
The owner is kind,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.970
and the kebabs just
smell unbelievably good.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:15.910
And we're getting the full,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.710
like, smoky aroma
therapy at the same time.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.510
And they're doing some sighing behind us,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.343
so every now and then,

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.720
you will hear a loud sighing sound.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.500
It's totally acceptable to grab a skewer

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.540
and eat it right off the skewer.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.445
You can see there's one
chunk of tomato in it.

00:13:30.445 --> 00:13:32.612
(mumbles)

00:13:33.603 --> 00:13:35.980
Oh, wow.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.927
Mm-hmm.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.600
Oh, that is wonderful.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.650
There's so much fat in there.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.940
That's what makes it so juicy.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.500
That's what gives it so much flavor.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.190
Oh, thank you, oh, you take it out.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.910
Oh, thank you very much.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.743
Okay, cool.

00:13:48.743 --> 00:13:49.890
All right, and there's also a chutney

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.640
that you can eat with the kebab that goes.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.730
So you gotta, it's easier to

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.280
pull it off the skewer, though.

00:13:56.132 --> 00:13:57.578
Oh.

00:13:57.578 --> 00:13:59.040
Oh.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.270
Oh, that just, that bumps it up.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.810
Again, the chutney is
not like, overpowering.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.170
It's almost fruity.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.410
It's not like an overpowering sauce.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.710
You still taste the full flavor of

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:08.860
the vibrance of the meat,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.960
the salty meat, but then,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.820
just with that fruity cooling sensation.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.720
It just complements the meat.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.333
That one is the tikka?

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:16.640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.473
This one is the tikka,

00:14:17.473 --> 00:14:18.390
which is the pieces.

00:14:20.456 --> 00:14:21.289
Oh yeah.

00:14:22.442 --> 00:14:23.867
It's really good too.

00:14:23.867 --> 00:14:25.190
And that's like,

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.450
I mean, that's more of the pure meat,

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.700
the top, a little bit tougher,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.700
but still flavorful.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.753
Mm.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.120
I taste the ginger in
that chutney on that bite,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.210
'cause I dug kinda deeper.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.183
Amazing food.
- So it's also

00:14:39.183 --> 00:14:40.303
our friend's birthday.

00:14:40.303 --> 00:14:41.820
- Oh, great.
- So that should be

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.810
a great birthday present

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.640
if you can wish him.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.230
- Yes, happy birthday.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.063
- Thank you so much.

00:14:47.063 --> 00:14:49.180
- I'm glad that we got to
celebrate all together.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.080
- Like I said,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.020
Pakistan is a mashup of different cultures

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.020
of the region.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.100
You have Pashtuns in the northwest,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.933
Punjabis in the east,

00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:58.050
Hindis in the southeast as well.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.230
So this is a lot more closely related to

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.347
the Afghani cuisine.

00:15:02.347 --> 00:15:03.410
This is basically Afghani cuisine.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.480
- Okay, but especially from Kabul area.

00:15:07.342 --> 00:15:08.925
Okay, Kabul, pulao,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.300
and again, I see those kebabs on top,

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.000
and I think that's carrots on top.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.193
Oh, wow.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.140
Oh, that's spectacular.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.790
The meat, it's the same kebab,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.160
then you got the rice that's like,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.520
so individual, each grain.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.350
It's really, really long grain rice.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.270
You've got these carrots,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.190
which are caramelized,

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.360
kinda sweet and salty,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.193
and then you've got these,

00:15:35.193 --> 00:15:36.200
tastes like raisins.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.968
But with that kebab on top,

00:15:37.968 --> 00:15:38.990
oh, that's incredible.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.076
Thank you so much.

00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:41.350
- Great pleasure meeting you.
- Great to meet you,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.183
thank you.

00:15:42.183 --> 00:15:43.107
- Thank you, thank you,

00:15:43.107 --> 00:15:45.294
it was nice to meet you.

00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:46.801
- Thank you very much.

00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:47.634
- You're welcome.

00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:48.930
Will you tell me your page?

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.890
- That is what I love
so much about traveling.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.060
That was just an experience

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.410
I will never forget,

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.490
and oh, man, those kebabs,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.860
when you are in Islamabad,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.633
this is a place you don't wanna miss.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.163
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

00:16:08.354 --> 00:16:09.480
All right.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.120
Thank you.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.060
Oh, okay, so I'm just gonna,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.290
for dinner tonight,

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.020
we are at the Serena in Islamabad,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.980
the hotel that we're staying at,

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.850
and we're eating at Dawat restaurant,

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.560
which is their Pakistani restaurant

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.393
at the hotel.

00:16:23.393 --> 00:16:25.070
The chef is actually just
gonna take care of us,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.750
so we're just gonna
see what he brings out.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.750
It's kind of romantic,

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.510
because it's just Joel and I for dinner.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.343
- What's up?

00:16:32.322 --> 00:16:34.239
(live band plays traditional music)

00:16:34.239 --> 00:16:36.692
(Mark laughs)

00:16:36.692 --> 00:16:38.410
- [Waiter] You told me you like spicy.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.020
- But we told them we like spicy.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.770
They brought us the
entire basket of chilies.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.260
- A pre-appetizer.
(Mark laughs)

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.190
- Yeah, they're cool.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.372
They're very cool.

00:16:47.372 --> 00:16:48.334
- Jheenga pakora.

00:16:48.334 --> 00:16:50.214
- Jheenga pakora.
- Yeah, appetizer.

00:16:50.214 --> 00:16:51.875
- It's shrimp pakora.
- Yeah, shrimp pakora.

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.650
- I normally know pakora as the like,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.360
deep fried fritters,

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.010
but shrimp, that's even better.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.173
They smell so good.

00:17:00.022 --> 00:17:00.855
Mm.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.513
With a like, tamarind sauce on the side.

00:17:06.488 --> 00:17:07.321
Mm-hmm.

00:17:08.229 --> 00:17:09.191
That's delicious.

00:17:09.191 --> 00:17:12.608
- That sauce looks delicious, oh my gosh.

00:17:17.894 --> 00:17:21.873
Mm, really juicy shrimp too, nicely spicy.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.380
- Mm, mm.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.150
Nice.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.110
Okay, next up, we have a lamb soup.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.210
Yeah, you can immediately smell that meat.

00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:43.920
Oh.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.540
Oh, that is just
effortless tenderized meat.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.160
It's so soft.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.940
Mm.
- Oh my goodness.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.490
- Whoa, what are they bringing?

00:17:57.782 --> 00:17:58.920
- [Chef] Lamb chops, chicken--

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.753
- Thank you, chef.

00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:01.137
- Thank you, sir, it's my pleasure.

00:18:01.137 --> 00:18:03.020
- And then, oh, biryani on the side,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.853
they brought us as well,

00:18:03.853 --> 00:18:06.393
which is covered in a pastry cover,

00:18:09.368 --> 00:18:11.987
to seal in all the
juices and smoky flavor.

00:18:13.421 --> 00:18:15.004
- [Joel] Thank you.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.480
- The onions in there.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.373
Yeah, that's fantastic.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.090
Okay, next up to try the chops.

00:18:33.603 --> 00:18:36.582
Oh, wow.

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:37.415
I can taste fat.

00:18:37.415 --> 00:18:39.210
There's that fat layer.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.320
Oh, wow.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.173
Yeah, that's some good meat too.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.350
Final dish is the biryani,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.983
which is from KP province.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.260
It, yeah, it has crusted with that dough

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.933
that holds in all the flavor.

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:00.700
Mm.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.400
Same ridiculously tender lamb.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.180
The crunchy cashews.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.220
It's so aromatic.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.550
You taste like, the sweet spices,

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.350
the cardamom, the cinnamon
in there, the clove.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.530
We've got some desserts now.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.477
This one is ras malai

00:19:13.477 --> 00:19:16.420
and this one is like an entire trough.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.780
And this is all to myself, by the way.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.292
Joel got his very own trough.

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.137
(Joel laughs)

00:19:21.137 --> 00:19:22.361
- [Joel] Look at that.

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:23.194
- Whoa.

00:19:28.315 --> 00:19:29.888
Whoa.

00:19:29.888 --> 00:19:34.888
Tastes like deep fried bread underneath,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.509
which is kinda soaked up with the,

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.342
it's a pudding,

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.773
like kind of a nutty pudding.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.553
Oh, yeah.

00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:47.084
Okay, I think I've tried this before.

00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:49.023
And you can see that
little saffron on top.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.863
Yeah, that's really good.

00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:57.240
Soaked up with that milk.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.610
You can taste the pistachio in there.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.760
You taste the cardamom.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.780
And that completes dinner.

00:20:09.883 --> 00:20:11.072
(sighs)

00:20:11.072 --> 00:20:13.060
Oh, that really sinks down.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.750
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.120
But we finished with dinner.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.530
Dinner was delicious,

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.280
and I wanna say a big thank you

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.720

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.460
Tomorrow, we continue
on to go further north,

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.790
towards Peshawar,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.460
and also to visit some of the areas

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.293
