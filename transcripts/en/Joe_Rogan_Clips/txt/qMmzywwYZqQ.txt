Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 2:          00:02          and I'm getting less. He carried a deer's out every time I see that now be thinking, how do you carry the deer,

Speaker 1:          00:06          nick? If he did, he'd never tell anybody he would have Lyme disease and just run 150 miles and still alive disease died out. You man, he's a psycho II. You, there's discipline and then this is what that guy has. And this guy too though. Y'all Goggins he's another one man. He's another one. It's like these guys that like, they, they exhibit this next level toughness that makes you reexamine what you're doing. Like you think you tough and then you find out what Goggins what do we say? He'd ran like 28 100 fucking mile runs in a row. Something insane like that. More than once. A lot. Why? Because when you run over two miles, I'll look like why I get a text message from Goggins say stay hard, motherfucker. This is, I'm checking in on you right now. Can you see, you see [inaudible] you hear them yelling in the texts. Have you seen the, um,

Speaker 2:          00:54          can we go, uh, Netflix losers? No, I haven't. Oh look it up. It's one on there. Uh, the guy called lost in the desert. It's a guy who runs, that's a desert ruin. They do carry on what country? But he'd go out there and he was just so mad, so obsessed with winning like thousands of people running through the desert. But it's, of course they have to follow when the wind get bad. They got checking ins and whatnot they supposed to follow and he said he was so obsessed, like he wasn't checking. He was like trying to take shortcuts and like if I go this way, I'll find it. He ended up going off the course and when it cleared up, he was way off course. But he was so obsessed. I still gotta finish. He was out there for like five or something. Five or six days.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Yeah. And that's talking about how they announced to his family, told his family, your husband's dead. We can't find you. Find them. They had helicopters going all over the place. He went to the point where he starts drinking his own piss. He found his cave was full of Battlestar [inaudible] ripping his off, mixing them up the trigger to survive, drinking the Batu strategies, mixing it up, and he like, at one point I heard the helicopter coming over. He took all his clothes, all his geared, dug a hole and set it on fire, hoping they would see him at the fire one up. The wind blew it out so he didn't get sick. So he out there with no gear, no nothing in the middle of nowhere. He's a vile. He ended up getting back in his mind. He's everybody left. He said when he got there, the checkpoint was gone, but his friend had flew back to find them and sure enough his friend was there, found them in a desert.

Speaker 2:          02:09          Yeah, it's called. Those are the documents called losers here. Losers in the episode is lost in the desert. The whole show is good. All the little things on it was good, but that lost in the desert. He ended up divorcing. His wife was wife left him because after that he still went back. He came home and she was like, you're not going back. And like, I'm doing it again. I have to finish and now he still does. He divorced his wife. His wife left when his wife left him because you've got a family. When she left and he left, she was mad like, what about your family? People die on this. What happened? He's like, don't worry. This is miss. I love this. I have to do it. When he came back and his wife was like, we're not doing it again. He was like, yes, I am like you. Just as on like, he was pretty much dead. They put him in the hospital. They found them and everything. She ended up doing again. Mauro prosperity.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Wow. The survival story of moral Prospera disoriented after a turns. Sahara desert does. Italian ultra marathon runner walk nearly 200 miles to safety, but he's Italian. He's probably going to get divorced anyway. Hey, what am I gonna go?

Speaker 2:          03:12          Well was it was fucking guys are animals. Yeah. You see it. You're going to be like, I have to. I want you to direct DME after you watched it. I'll see it. When he ate the badges, I was like that. I was just kill myself there. I'm not like, he was really biting their heads off. Just any dark, no light. He could. He was feeling phone. He can see the odd, he gra he was survive. Kate, what kind of diarrhea did that guy have? Oh, kill drinking. Dot. Even killed. He tried to kill this stuff actually, but he was so dehydrated. He cut his wrist because they had the last thing he cut his wrists with and went to bed hoping he's going to wait, like not wake up debt and he woke up. He was like, what in the world? He said, and that was my sign that I wasn't supposed to die.

Speaker 2:          03:51          He said when he got the house, when he saw his Bris, they said you were to die dehydrated to believe. So he didn't have anything. He couldn't believe he's healed Jesus Christ. That was it. He was, while he's, I felt myself fainting. I just kept telling myself, I'm here. I have to make it. I have to make it and I have to make it, and he said he finally like he see like some girl walking out in the desert. He started walking away. She was going and then the army, whatever, wherever they was at the army had to come get him and they got guns and shit. You think he's going to die? Ended up taking him to the house. When he woke up, he had ivs and everything and they were covering him and took him back to his family. It's a crazy story. I mean all of them was good, but that was my brother calling me. Like, watch that Bro. You got a mentality like that. You ought to fucking man washed

Speaker 1:          04:29          that two days and he stumbled into an abandoned Muslim shrine where he noticed some bats huddled together. Prosperity, grabbed a handful of them, cut off their heads with a knife and then sucked out their insides to drink their blood and quenching thirst. Eventually he did his Vampire Act on 20 bats when another three days pass with no signs of rescue. He slit his wrists and waited to die, but his blood thick and due to dehydration so it wouldn't drain out. Fuck man.

Speaker 2:          04:59          Like that's some Goggins and county to get together and do a podcast and talking about that, like that was,

Speaker 1:          05:04          they wouldn't have cut their wrist [inaudible] killed himself. It would have just kept going. I think those, those kinds of people is ultra marathon people. It's a different, different breed of human. You know, they, it's like everything has, there's levels right to everything. There's levels you, you've, you've experienced it in your own life where you tough adopt, it became a stronger person, a harder person. And then there's levels past that. And then there's levels past that. And especially for people that have one solitary thing, they do like ultra marathons there, all the skinny dudes who can just keep going, keep going. It's just, it's, it's the, the pulling it off the, crossing the line and knowing that you did something that seemed almost impossible. So, so titanic, Lee, epically difficult to do that. So few people can ever do it. When they do, they're talking about running a 500 mile race now cause they did the Moab to 30 and they had the big foot 200 they'll all these people that are putting on these races, they were like, okay, we could do to 40 let's see if we can do 500 so now they're talking about doing a 500 mile race.

Speaker 2:          06:13          It's next level. It was hard for me to run a five K I hearing when you're a big fellow too. I mean I could do it, but I did in college and I've never ran like nothing calculated like you had to pay do again. It was like a charity we had to do for college. Nope. Never again. Have you ever thought about doing something like that? Like I'm gonna go around from five k I ain't going to pay. It's like going Scott, I want my jump out of a perfectly good plane to go on the ground play, pay to run a five k like what did the organizing it? I guess most of them I go to foundations and stuff like that. But even then, like you heard about the foundation that taking money and what you do hear about paying no punting something books to go run 13.1 miles. Right. Cool. People, it's more the fact that I can say I did it. I can see I did it on my own. I run 13.1 miles and not check my phone. 13 miles. We're good. Yeah, I'm home.
