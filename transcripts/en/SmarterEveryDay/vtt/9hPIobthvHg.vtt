00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
Okay, let's just get this out there right now, I know

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.839
This is weird you probably watch this channel because you want to see slow motion phenomenon of like

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.139
bullets hitting stuff and fracture mechanics and water drops bouncing and animals squirting things

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.469
Whatever you're into

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.029
But this

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.750
is crazy.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.619
Most people think "Oh look, the cute little nerds set up the dominoes, and they knock them down, and everyone claps and it's great." No.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.069
This is different than that. I was naive enough to think that I was gonna set up a high-speed camera, point 'em at dominoes,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.099
I was gonna set 'em up knock 'em down, vary the spacing and the type of floor it was on and I was going to

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.260
transcend the knowledge of dominoes instantly, you were gonna get smarter every day, and we were gonna go about our merry way.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.620
But no. Look me in the eyes.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.280
This has broken me.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860
I do not understand dominoes.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.840
The reason this's broken me is because I've been sitting here doing all this math to determine the gap

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.640
Necessary in order for this red Domino's weight to always knock over the blue one, but when I set up with my calipers

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.080
It doesn't work, and if you think about it the same people that taught me how to do this math

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.149
Also told me if I needed to I could assume a cow is a sphere in a vacuum

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.360
Paper physics can only get you so far. If there's anything I've learned from my job as an engineer. It's that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.240
There's no replacement for actual real-world testing

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.780
if we want to make observations of the exact times these Dominoes hit down to the millisecond

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.740
It's really hard to do it from a camera like this the reason is look over here

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.680
You can see the inside of this Domino, and then the inside of this one and somewhere in the middle it changes

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.249
So if we want to get a shot where we get all this data

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.170
We have to have a moving camera not only that but a moving camera that is

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.999
Perfectly timed right here in the middle so we can see when this edge hits this edge

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.130
Which means we're gonna have to time it perfectly

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.669
With the wave of Dominoes as it runs along the track do I want to keep making videos on smarter every day about Dominoes

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.389
Yeah, if that's what it takes to find the answer. Yes, that's what I want to do

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.460
This is about not quitting so now we're gonna give Domino's the respect they deserve and we're going hardcore mode

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440
We're at fifteen millimeters

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720
The second one over here

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.480
Welcome to hardcore mode...

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.220
It's the same as before only I try harder so here we go we're gonna build stuff

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.290
And we're gonna do experiments, and we're not gonna quit, and there's a twist at the end of this video. Let's do it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.699
Okay, this is Trent. He is the contraption fabricator that I talk about on the patreon page, and this is my cousin Hayden, hey Hayden

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.250
okay, so this is a high speed camera on a skid and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.799
Trent made this, good job Trent and we are about to try to pace

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.499
These dominoes so that we can tell the difference between a hardwood floor, and you know a surface that's grippy. Okay ready ?

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.059
That looked awesome, oh it outran us it moves a lot faster than the wood floor, and I'm so used to the wood floor

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.630
He's frustrated. I know well enough to know when he's frustrated. He's frustrated. You miss that one

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.020
Are you frustrated Trent?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.149
No all right we're going to figure out exactly how to nail this we're gonna get all the dominoes in frame as they fall

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:27.120
So we can gather the timing data and figure out what steady state velocity is it took some practice because sometimes the dominoes would outrun us

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.300
And sometimes we outran them

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.360
So I keep messing up the high speed which means Hayden has to keep set up dominoes

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.050
Which means up if we're gonna my half-court shot

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.850
We got it. It'll work, it'll work this data

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.170
This is the first good run we got on felt

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.879
Watch closely and you can see that the bottoms are trying to slide out from under the Domino

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880
But it digs into the felt and stops

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.829
I think we got it do that one more time

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.289
I feel really good about that. Oh, we did pretty good Hayden Hayden

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.049
We got it, that's the one right

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.709
This is the best run we got on hardwood if you look at the bottom you can see that

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.379
It's slipping out from under the Domino makes it rotate around its center of gravity and also if you look at the top you can

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.379
See that they're not hitting square on

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.160
So which one is faster

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.559
We've got hardwood on the bottom that slips and we got filth up top that doesn't slip and Trent and I both felt felt

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.549
Was faster so how do we know we have to like quantify this?

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.479
The answer is brute force science to figure this out

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.069
We did a ton of runs mostly filmed at 5,000 frames per second the goal is to figure out exactly

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.820
What millisecond each individual impact occurs which made for over a hundred and twenty thousand frames of data to reduce?

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.288
Your boy here has too many kids and too many jobs to reduce that much data

00:05:53.289 --> 00:06:00.579
So I blasted out a spreadsheet template to everywhere that smartereveryday touches the Internet I compared you guys against each other Twitter

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.849
Got it done fastest people follow me on Instagram and snapchat got it done quickly

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.410
Facebook helped surprisingly the physics subreddit wasn't interested in doing physics that day the smartereveryday subreddit was great and accurate but

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.919
Patreon was by far and away the most accurate source, which makes sense because these are the best people in the world

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.889
There's a reason I gave each social media outlet its own spreadsheet. It's called the wisdom of the crowd here

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.228
You can see exactly what frame each individual chose at the impact point and the average of those selections

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:36.129
These averages were then graphed for each individual video file and there you have it if you average all the runs together it appears that

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.469
The non slipping felt is faster than the slipping hardwood before I go into why I think it's faster

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.880
I'm gonna let grant from the YouTube channel three blue one brown take a crack at it because this dude is

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.000
fantastic at reducing super complex mathematical systems down to quick little YouTube bytes

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.940
It's amazing you should check his channel out anyway go for it grant

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.259
Hey, Destin its grant, so I wouldn't haven't looked at some of the data that you sent and here

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.788
I'm just gonna pull up two examples one of them with Domino's on felt the other on hardwood

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:08.829
and these are just the plots of the average velocity of each individual Domino as they fall and

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.399
Obviously the first thing that stands out is just how chaotic this is right

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.459
they're super jaggedy and I think some of that might just be that the

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.259
Distances between each Domino were probably a little bit variable right that's probably not perfect

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.240
But the way that we were computing those velocities kind of assumed that that distance was a constant

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.819
So one pretty simple thing I did to just kind of smooth out this data is rather than graphing each

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:35.169
Individual velocity point take a look at the previous 20 different velocities

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:39.189
And then average all of those and that way if we look at the moving average

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:45.219
It should hopefully kind of smooth out any of the small variations and things like distances between dominoes so when you do that

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.749
It does look like that in general filth is a little bit faster than hardwood, right?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.200
But that's not always consistently true like here if we look at the last few Falls

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.439
It seems like the hardwood sort of catches up with it, and this is just two examples

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.400
But I saw this in a lot of the other ones so if you just look at the overall average

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:06.009
Velocity felt definitely does look faster, but it wouldn't be comfortable saying that it's consistently faster

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.719
I think there's probably a lot of other variables at play here that sometimes might pull hardwood ahead grants

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.999
Channel is amazing you should really go check it out, but you gotta skimmed over the chaotic part of the graph and for me

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.710
that's the most fun part when you track a rocket with a radar you get a general idea of the

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.769
Acceleration profile by looking at the distance versus time plot

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.349
But the magic is over here in the noise

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.400
When a rocket makes a correction usually that shows up as a perturbation in the raw data

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.770
And I'm seeing perturbations in this data

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.650
and there seems to be an actual pattern here a

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:41.920
Natural undulation of the curve initially I didn't have enough Domino setup to determine a steady state velocity

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.909
But now I'm wondering if there. Even is a steady state velocity because if you look at the data

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:51.850
It goes faster and slower over and over again. I think this might be happening for two reasons number one

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.780
You can see little twists

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.290
You can see that the Domino's aren't hitting each other

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:03.310
Square and in fact the twist gets worse and worse and slower and slower until it gets so slow that the pushers behind it fall

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:09.010
Down and straighten them back out this slam down is that velocity spike that we're seeing watch this

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.920
twist

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.360
Things are stacking up and

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.370
Slam see that spike. It's a natural cycle in the graph

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.580
there's a twist a

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.920
twist

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.560
Twist

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.750
Twist

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.940
They're starting to stack up and

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.170
slam

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.740
The twist is energy lost in the system

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.740
And the slam is the positive

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.500
correction the second thing I'm seeing becomes more clear when we spread out the

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.400
Domino's where each Domino hits the next one seems to determine how much it rotates versus how much it's pushed watch this

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.959
When a Domino is hit down close to the center of gravity the impact will tend to?

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.679
Translate the Domino forward instead of rotating it because this

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.969
Translation calls it to still be upright when it hits the next one it hits it up high

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.980
which makes the next one rotate faster the next one gets hit down low and you see that a

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.180
back-and-forth pattern emerges

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.239
I'm not really sure how this plays in but it's clear to me that where a Domino's hit on its back determines

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:22.219
How it falls forward when you spread the Domino's out farther the effects of these phenomena are amplified even more for example watch this case

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:24.589
one Domino in the entire chain

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.900
Doesn't fall all right, so

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.159
This is curious, so we see how that happen

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:55.359
Check this case out where the chain stops altogether due to the twist error building up past the point of recovery

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:22.280
Okay, here's the twist to all this this video is not about dominoes this video is about creating an experiment

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.630
To understand what seems like a simple system at a very very

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.260
Complex level now that you know what to look for you're able to see very

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.360
Intricate interactions in this Domino chain right now right in front of you. There's no real direct

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:43.370
Application so why do we do this, this is what we call basic research, and it's very very important

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.929
It's not like Applied Science where you're inventing things using some technology

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.130
It's about being able to

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.900
understand and predict

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:58.010
Natural phenomenon humans weren't able to go to the moon because they suddenly felt like it it started by wanting to understand how birds fly

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.330
Someone had to first answer that

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.689
Question before we could ever start on our way

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.950
Cancer won't be cured because we walk into a lab with a lot of money and want it to go away

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.839
It's gonna involve basic research like how cells work these complex

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.680
Building blocks to understand the world are right there in front of us all the time

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.399
But we have to make that first little push into the unknown

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.690
to start the chain reaction

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.690
So here's the point ask

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:30.830
The simple questions keep an eye out for those little things that end up being building blocks that lead to the bigger stuff

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:37.849
At work my favorite people are the ones that ask questions in meetings that might sound silly

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:44.990
but they're not because for every 10 they ask there's one that they'll ask that'll start this chain of discovery and

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.300
Pull us all towards the profound

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.269
So that's the take away ask the simple questions and dare to try to answer them

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.370
I'm Destin you're getting smarter every day. Have a good one all right

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.729
I'm gonna travel for my day job, so sorry for the weird transition here

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:07.130
This is the hotel room that I'm staying in I want to say. Thank you to everyone who worked on the data

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.870
That was a big deal

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.850
It would've taken dozens of hours

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:17.330
So thank you everyone that did that especially the patrons who helped me fun things like Trent making the little high-speed camera cart

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:22.759
I also want to say. Thanks to the sponsor, which is 23andme 23andme is a personal DNA service

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.540
They send you this kit

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.639
And then you send off a sample and you get all kinds of info

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.459
And back about your DNA in about six to eight weeks now

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:32.179
I wanted to know what happened in that six to eight weeks so in another video on smarter every day

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.459
I went to the labs where they actually process the samples and I got to see exactly what happens there

00:13:37.459 --> 00:13:40.189
It was awesome, and I feel really good about the process

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:45.289
I personally enjoyed doing the service because I got to share my DNA family history with my dad

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.810
And so we got to connect over that it was really cool

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.849
And I'm totally gonna give it as a gift if you want to check this out and learn more about your DNA then go to

00:13:53.279 --> 00:14:00.319
23andme comm slash smarter you can get yourself a kit do it yourself. It's really a fun thing to do again

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.419
That's 23andme comm slash smarter doing that support smarter every day

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.630
And you get to learn more about yourself in the process alright. That's it

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.699
