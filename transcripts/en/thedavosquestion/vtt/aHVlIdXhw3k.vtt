00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.599
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think India can become a superpower,
I think it is already a superpower given the

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.900
population, given the idea, given the changes
that are taking place in India. I am very

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.000
confident that India will continue to progress
and will become a superpower in the future.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.070
It will benefit millions and millions of Indians
living here and also will benefit global class.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.260
India could define the meaning of superpower;
superpower does not just necessarily mean

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:46.210
military superpower but superpower in all
the aspects including agriculture, healthcare,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.930
and contributing to the global well-being.
Thank you.
