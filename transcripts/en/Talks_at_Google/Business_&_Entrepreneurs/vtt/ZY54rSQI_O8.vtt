00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:07.770
DAVID EDWARDS: I'm really
delighted to be here

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.700
and hope we can have a
dialogue after I speak

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.920
a little bit about my book.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.140
So yeah, far from
scaring you, I think

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.250
I want to reassure you initially
that creating is really

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.730
something that we all do
every day of our lives.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.460
It's one of the most fundamental
biological processes.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.500
And to frame that, it's pretty
clear that there's hardly

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.810
a condition in the
course of your day

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.350
that you encounter that's
fully predictable or predicted.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
You encounter it, and you act
in a fundamentally creative way.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.080
You go right, or you go left.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.780
And that may be a
trivial creative act

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.617
or a consequential creative
act, but in any case

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:52.200
it matters to you in the moment
that you do it or you wouldn't

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.550
have done it.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.780
Occasionally, those creative
acts lead to creative things,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.450
and those created
things may be anything

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.870
from a well-articulated
sentence, to a pirouette,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.034
to a book.

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:07.200
And those things matter to
you when you create them,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.090
or you wouldn't create them.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.630
Now, it has turned out
to be in our interest

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.510
to create not only
for ourselves things

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.810
that matter, but also
things that matter

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.630
for many of those around us.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.330
The clan and the well
being of the clan

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.820
tends to correlate with our
own personal well-being.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.370
And therefore, over
time, our biology

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.260
has pushed us to think
about creating things

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.990
that matter not just
to ourselves right now,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.550
but to others, and for a
fairly long period of time.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.660
And if you look over the
course of human history

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.460
at created things, whether
it's an equation or a wheel,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.980
these things have
tended to involve,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.070
of course, collaboration,
discussion,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.252
figuring out what matters to the
clan, and pooling of resources.

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:55.710
And when we finally
made something,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.170
we've tended to make
it to last not just

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.640
for the moment
when we created it,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.800
but for some relatively
long period of time.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.140
And therefore, villages,
and pyramids, and shoes

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.770
tended for most of history
to last quite a long time.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.800
Fast forward to
where we are today.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.670
And we're in a
moment that in a way

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.610
is the pinnacle achievement
of human creativity.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.380
And if you read Steven
Pinker's recent book, clearly

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.930
by most indicators,
the human condition

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.940
is better off today
by human creativity

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.350
than it ever has been.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.930
But one of the
uniquenesses of our moment

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.960
is that the created
things that surround us

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.770
are remarkably short-lived.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.380
And the reason for
that is multiple.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.440
Firstly, among the things that
we have a limited supply of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.550
is time.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.860
And therefore in
all of history, when

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.210
we have had a chance to
create something tomorrow

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.400
versus creating something
that matters to us the day

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.190
after tomorrow, we sort
of focus on tomorrow.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.420
Time matters.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.750
And over the last 300
years, and maybe especially

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.270
over the last 30 years, the
power of science and technology

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.170
has made it possible to
create things of mass utility

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.520
really rapidly.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.820
And it's led to this increasing
focus on creating things

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.660
over a really short
period of time,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.840
and that's skewed our
perception of what

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.900
creativity is, and really led
me to the writing of this book.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.650
It's also created, of course,
the situation highlighted

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.750
by the United Nations
and their identification

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.730
of the 17 sustainable
development

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.150
goals, of a world that is in
risk of no sustainability.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.550
And therefore, many
today are focusing

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.770
whether it's on
feeding the planet,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.620
or saving life in the
sea, or preserving

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.580
the environment in some
way on creating over

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.080
a long period of time.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.890
Now, I'd like to just talk for
a little bit about creating

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.700
and this concept of learning.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.620
If you think about the sort of
canonical creator environment,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.630
you probably think about
the scientific lab,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.450
which is indeed responsible
for much of the created

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.720
world around us today.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.991
And if you think about what
happens in a scientific lab,

00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.990
you probably have in mind
the scientific method.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.160
And indeed, the
scientific method

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.320
is one of the things that
goes on in a science lab.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.279
We tend to focus on phenomena
whose laws we understand.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.830
We frame those
phenomena in conditions

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.350
that are really well-specified.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.870
And we apply the
scientific method,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.380
and we observe, and deduce,
and we make discoveries.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.940
However, in pioneering
work in science,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.250
and engineering,
and other domains,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.250
we tend to have either
not perfect understanding

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.244
of the phenomena nor perfect
understanding of the conditions

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:44.910
that frame them.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.210
And as much as analysis
and deduction matters

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.410
in the science lab, actually,
intuition and imagination

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.080
matters, too.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.724
And therefore, the scientific
process in science labs,

00:04:56.724 --> 00:04:58.140
or in engineering
labs, or in labs

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.400
generally, is a combination of
the classical scientific method

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.070
and what I call an
artistic method.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.070
It blends this
induction, deduction,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.160
comfort with uncertainty, and
ability to frame a problem

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.010
and move on into
a single process

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.540
that over the last
10 or 15 years

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.280
I've been talking about
as an art science process.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.970
Now, if you take the
metaphor of the science lab

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.640
and you apply it to your
lives here at Google

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.800
or to your personal lives,
this balance of art and science

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.230
still holds, and there's
probably a lot more art

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.820
that is involved in science.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.010
And you can take any example.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.560
An example, for example,
of losing your watch,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.260
you make a hypothesis that
your watch is under your bed.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.780
You then test your hypothesis
by looking for your watch,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.863
and you make a discovery,
and so on, and so forth.

00:05:44.863 --> 00:05:50.100
And that's generally how we
encounter opportunity and need

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.220
in our lives, and by this
balance of art and science.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.830
Now, in my book, I
talk about this notion

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.430
of an aesthetic
work or aesthetics.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.000
And a lot of thinking over
the last century particularly

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.230
around aesthetics as
being closely coupled

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.180
with a kind of
mindful way of living.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.630
And if you look at the most
mindful of experiments,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.940
the works that come
from those, whether it's

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.790
a scientific
article or a relief,

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.660
can be thought of
as aesthetic works,

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.740
so I'd like to talk about
aesthetic works just

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.310
for a little bit.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.950
If you look over the
course of history

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.850
at things that we've made
through experimental processes,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.090
whether they're books,
or plays, or reliefs,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.600
they have generally
invited a reaction

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.550
from the public of
observation and learning.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.640
And that has led
to how we structure

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.010
our universities,
our museums, and even

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.290
our companies and stores.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.320
If you look, however,
at the last 30

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.180
years or so at cultural works
and works of technology,

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.180
indeed, as you produce
here at Google,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.150
they invite a very different
kind of public experience.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.670
This here is an image from
Olafur Eliasson's 2004 weather

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.660
project at the Tate Modern.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.170
A kind of sun was created
in the Tate Modern,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.830
and people were
invited to observe.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.130
And nobody had any idea
how people would observe.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.500
And they actually ended
up laying on their backs,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.000
and they ended up
making formations.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.650
There's a whole story about how
the weather project was lived.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.970
But they became part
of the cultural work.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.870
And that's indeed what's
happened in technology,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.300
in media, if you
look at something

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.520
like a smartphone, which
invites me to engage,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.250
and my engagement changes
the phone in a certain way,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.070
just as Google is changed
by me using Google.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.770
And so there's this
increasing participation

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.440
of the public with
the creator, and we're

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.930
all kind of creating together.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.610
And I say all of
that just to say

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.570
that the notion of
learning, indeed, even

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:15.270
of commerce as being one of
a producer and a consumer,

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.710
is going away.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.730
And it actually has
a radical impact

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.820
on how we think about learning
at Harvard University,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.210
and ultimately probably
doing business.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.640
And so I've been focused
over the last 15 years

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:36.510
on the synonymous nature
of learning about tomorrow

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.750
and creating tomorrow,
and particularly focusing

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.179
on, among other
things, little kids.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.370
My book begins with a
story about a little kid.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.560
If you think about
the ultimate pioneers,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.880
they are little kids, right?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.960
They're encountering conditions
that are radically new

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.300
and they are learning
at an amazing rate.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.009
And if all is particularly
supportive, they're having fun.

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:03.550
And so this is something that
I come back to very frequently.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.040
They're being motivated not
for a commercial purpose

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.080
or for making a
name for themselves,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.090
but they're just
fascinated, super curious,

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.820
and they're learning.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.920
Now, particularly
in my book, I focus

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.080
on pioneers,
pioneering creators who

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.140
are creating over a very
long period of time,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.920
and actually in quite risky
and uncertain conditions.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.470
And I focus on the emotive
and cognitive dimensions

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:35.620
that lead to not only successful
pioneering creating, but also

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.970
deep pleasure.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.920
And to give you just
a little insight,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.670
one of the creators
who I spent time with,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.170
David Doubilet, who is one of
the great marine photographers

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.225
of our time, and
invented the split screen

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:55.450
or the split lens
for photographing

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.220
above and below water.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.920
And I was talking to
David about the qualities

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.310
important in a buddy in
diving deep into the ocean.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.340
And just to point
out, as I'll mention

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.420
more here in the last part
of my talk, when we pioneer,

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.374
we tend to pioneer
best not alone.

00:10:13.374 --> 00:10:15.040
Now, we're not clearly
not in a village,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.670
but we tend to have
a team, a buddy who's

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.140
thinking of our interest, and
we are thinking of her interest,

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.010
and that tends to maximize
or optimize our survival.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.620
And it's obviously true
in diving in the ocean.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.420
I asked David, well, what are
the qualities that matter most

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:31.640
to you?

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.190
And he said, well, the
second-most important quality,

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.590
which interesting that
he started with that,

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.910
was that they be kind.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.670
There's nothing worse
than diving with somebody

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.410
and risking your life
with somebody who's

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.240
just fundamentally not kind.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.427
And so I said, well, what's the
first most important quality?

00:10:46.427 --> 00:10:48.760
And he said, well, they need
to be passionately curious.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.600
And so obviously at a
frontier, if you're not

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.600
waking up and motivated to
explore, then nobody will be,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.100
right?

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.320
So this passionate
curiosity, empathy, these

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.900
are the kinds of emotive
and cognitive dimensions

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.860
that I focus on in the book.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.970
And I look at creators
like Ferran Adria,

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.660
the chef of El Bulli,
which closed down in 2011,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.150
arguably the greatest
chef living today.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:18.280
And I look at their creative
process from great scientists

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.160
living today to great
inventors to artists,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.990
and I show that all of them
follow a very similar process.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.190
They may all do really
well economically.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.580
They may create amazingly
successful companies

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.590
or amazingly successful
music theater.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.180
And yet, what's driving them
is something else, actually,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:48.190
and it's related to the
reward system of our brains.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.370
And you are all probably
aware, but just to remind you,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.117
there are three fundamental
processes that motivate us

00:11:55.117 --> 00:11:56.200
through the reward system.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.580
One is a wanting process, one
is a reinforcement learning

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.740
process, and one is
a liking process.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.950
And an illustration
of this very simply

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.380
would be "Anna Karenina."

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.380
Let's say I'm told
to for my class

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.870
or for some other
reason want to read

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.730
Leo Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina."

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.599
There's some pleasure,
actually, in wanting anything.

00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:21.640
And particularly wanting
to read "Anna Karenina,"

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.950
I read it, so there's this
reinforcement learning.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.530
I begin to like "Anna Karenina."

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.130
And finally, having
finished the book,

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.460
I really like it so much
that I talk to my wife

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.370
about "Anna Karenina,"
and we exchange ideas.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.710
And when I go to read my
next book of Leo Tolstoy,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.925
"War and Peace," I
have been informed

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.550
through that conversation
with my wife.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.580
And that kind of
cycle of how we learn

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.500
is really the cycle
of how we create.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.950
And so in Ferran Adria's
case, from the ideating,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:53.350
to the experimenting, to the
serving of an amazing dish.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.740
This cycle in all
of the creator lives

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.572
that I describe is fundamental
not only to learning,

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.280
the kinds of dimensions
that I mentioned,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.380
the empathy, the passion,
and others that I'll

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.760
mention in just a minute.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.840
But also creating value that
they bring to the public,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.010
there's a conversation much like
what happens with the internet.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.750
And everyone learns,
and then they go back.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.220
And not only is that formative
for the creative thing,

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.990
this new thing that the
world has never seen before,

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.070
which goes through this cycle of
communication with the public,

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.220
but it's actually
deeply pleasurable.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.230
So in my book, I highlight
these emotive and cognitive

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.420
dimensions, which
are pretty contrasted

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.030
to the emotive and
cognitive dimensions

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.790
that we tend to
celebrate in culture

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.620
and maybe inculcate in our
businesses and our business

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.200
schools.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.630
And so it's clear that in
the success of a Google

00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:01.360
or the success of even my
book, both sets of qualities

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.120
are important.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.930
There are times
when we're at battle

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.080
and there are times
where we are discovering.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.650
And the qualities that lead
to the successful warrior

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.190
are pretty defiantly
not the qualities that

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.870
lead to the successful pioneer.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.870
And one of the challenges
in writing a book

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:26.710
or bringing great value to the
world in a company like Google

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.780
is, how do you
balance these two?

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:36.010
In my book, I am focusing mostly
on this patch of blue and red,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.060
and the cycle of creating that
allows for these qualities

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.360
to be learned, and relearned,
and ultimately shared.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.080
Now, if I asked you, what are
the qualities in the neighbors

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.080
you'd like to live with?

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.505
I can imagine which--

00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:50.620
sorry, I hope I
can imagine which

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.600
set of qualities they are.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.280
And one of the
points in my book is

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.660
while we are interested today
obviously in creating things

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.340
that matter to many over a
very long period of time,

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.650
this future that we're all
looking for really starts

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.670
today, right?

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.850
And it's as much as it
relates to this thing

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.390
that you're mattering, it
relates even more fundamentally

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.390
to how you create
this thing, right?

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:23.830
And so this way of living,
passionate curiosity, empathy,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.810
intuition, innocence,
humility, all of which

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.200
I describe more
fundamentally in the book,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.940
is critical, I believe, to
introduce into our schools,

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.940
into our companies,
and into culture.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.360
And indeed in my book, I talk
about how that's happening.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.640
So the last part of
my book emphasizes

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.380
the grassroots creator
movement, which

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.510
I identify as beginning
around the time

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.460
of the first tweet, the first
Maker Faire, "Make Magazine."

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.380
Over the last 10, 15 years as
you've thrived here at Google,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.670
the world has radically
changed, as we all know.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.390
But one of the things
that's most striking to me

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.600
is that over a short period
of time, much of the planet

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.630
has now placed itself in
a position of creatively

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.450
expressing itself in a way
that never happened before,

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.690
and expressing itself
in ways that endure.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.900
Much of this creation
may be viewed

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:25.270
by many as trivial, or not
interesting, or even profoundly

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.500
irritating.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.220
But it is fundamentally,
and in many cases,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.440
not to make money, not to make
a name, although that happens,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.620
but to express oneself
and express an experience

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.850
that one has had.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.040
That aesthetic
creation is, I think,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.274
fundamental to creating
the world that we all

00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:45.940
wish to live in.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.860
And indeed, it's
starting to restructure

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.410
how we run companies,
the kinds of environments

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.140
that companies are
thriving in, and it's quite

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.610
reflected by your own campus.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.130
And so I've been very involved.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.440
I've opened a
restaurant in Cambridge

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.250
and have my students
making things.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.771
And so I'm really interested
in this grassroots creative

00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:07.270
movement.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.645
And one of the things that
fascinates me and I talk about

00:17:09.645 --> 00:17:14.260
in the book is that we're
seeing this self-association

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.970
that creators,
grassroots creators make.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.980
And these happen
online, obviously,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.540
but they also happen in
physical environments.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.650
And these could be Habitat for
Humanity kinds of gathering,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.650
or they could be weekend
food-making gatherings.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.240
These could happen in classes,
lots of maker activities.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.230
But these are often
self-associations

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.070
of creators who want to create
together, maybe write fiction

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.000
together.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.420
And they come together
really very frequently

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.300
for the pleasure of
creating together.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.100
And they learn, as I write in
the book, these same qualities,

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.760
these aesthetic dimensions
of creating that are not

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.100
only fundamental to
creating over a very

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.740
long period of time,
but having fun,

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.770
and personal self-satisfaction.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.590
So I'm going to end
really quickly here

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:18.554
by talking about two
innovation activities

00:18:18.554 --> 00:18:20.720
that I've been very engaged
with over these 15 years

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.500
as I've been learning myself
and creating environments that

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.340
foster this kind of learning.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.960
And one of these relates
to my work in Africa

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.470
in the early 2000s.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.960
I was one of the first Gates
Grand Challenge grantees,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.230
and was focused on inhaled
vaccines and antibiotics

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.020
for tuberculosis, and set up a
not-for-profit in South Africa.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.706
And I became struck
by the middle 2000s,

00:18:46.706 --> 00:18:48.580
there was relative
affluence coming to Africa

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.980
by these mounds of trash
that were growing outside

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.800
of the cities, and this sort
of importation of diseases

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.990
that we thought, until
then were fundamentally

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.560
developed world diseases,
like cardiac, and depression,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.810
and other kinds of illnesses.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.450
And shifted my work
for many other reasons

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:10.960
to food, and ultimately
for a significant amount

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.347
of my creative time
to food packaging.

00:19:13.347 --> 00:19:15.430
And I came up with this
idea that, well, we really

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.910
should make packaging like
nature makes packaging,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.780
and the ultimate water
bottle is the coconut,

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.550
and so I began to reflect
on how that would be done.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.660
Now, this was for
many years curated

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.320
in a cultural context where
we did an exhibition in Paris

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.240
at the Laboratoire,
this cultural center

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.940
that I opened in 2007, and
invited the public to eat water

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.480
bottles.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.910
And for two or three years,
this kind of wikifood

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.930
was a cultural
experiment, and we set up

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.290
an underground
restaurant in Paris.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.990
And this led to a
company eventually,

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.340
and to products that sell
particularly on the East Coast,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.010
and ultimately to this product
of which I have some here,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.740
which you can now make
any fruit in the form--

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.670
or any food, really,
in the form of grapes.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.140
And the product that
is now launched,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.730
and that you can
taste are fruit.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.580
Kids are not eating fruit
anymore because the trend is

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.497
going down because fruit
is complicated to eat,

00:20:19.497 --> 00:20:21.080
and parents are
concerned about skins.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.300
But you can remake fruit
with these edible packages,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.560
if you will, or skins.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.470
And this work now through
a number of collaborators

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.940
is moving to an
effort in Africa,

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.380
particularly Sierra Leone,
to develop local food forms

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.700
that are environmentally
sustainable

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:53.410
and that are highly
vectorized by micronutrients.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.020
So what began as
an idea in Africa

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.640
moved through a
cultural environment

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.680
for a time that might
have been indeterminate.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.830
It certainly was in the process.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.020
Became a company, a
venture-backed company,

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.420
and is now coming back to
Africa all through a process

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:14.230
that kind of needed to have this
open-ended and driving force

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.420
that was other than pure
commercial interest.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.580
Now, I'll just finish
by saying that I've also

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.055
been interested since
my first company related

00:21:21.055 --> 00:21:24.080
to inhaled insulin and
delivering health and wellness

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.670
through the air, and have become
fascinated since the Nobel

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.630
Prize in 2004 with the
revolution happening

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.380
in olfactory biology.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.660
The largest subclass
of the human genome

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.790
is a factory receptor subclass.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.760
Olfactory receptors are
not just in your nose.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.022
They're throughout your body.

00:21:43.022 --> 00:21:44.980
And so there's this
amazing conversation that's

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.670
going on sensorially inside
of you that we understand now

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.890
is fundamentally
related to olfaction,

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:54.840
and clearly plays a major
role in metabolic health

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.200
and neurologic health.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.950
And getting that
right, we believe,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.120
is partly related
to righting some

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.210
of the metabolic and
neurologic dysfunction that's

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.500
happened here over the
last 30 or 40 years.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.640
And so we've developed this
platform for digitizing scent,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.270
and begun to work and
collaborate with Questlove,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.780
and thinking about
synesthesia, and how

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:25.090
these kinds of experiences
can improve well-being

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:30.910
and experience even of
music, and ultimately come

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.700
into work environments
looking how sensory design can

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.230
improve the workspace.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:41.410
And finally, we're coming out
with our first real mass market

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.570
product here this
year, which I can

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.140
share with you, which
is a way of creating

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.220
flavor images, either
autonomously or over any food.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.480
You can color any food
with a flavor of chocolate,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.730
or popcorn, or rum.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.752
And then in consuming
that food, your brain

00:23:01.752 --> 00:23:03.460
tells you that that's
just what I've had.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.080
And so it's a really
interesting way

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.401
to address some of the
food addiction issues

00:23:08.401 --> 00:23:09.650
that we're dealing with today.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.590
So once again, this project
began blue sky, actually,

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.600
with some of my
students developed

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.490
in a cultural environment
for a long period of time,

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.300
and finally, through
commercial forces,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.250
is moving into the marketplace.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.350
So I'd like to
just end by saying

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.670
that these sorts of culture
lab environments that

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.670
began to show up in
Europe in the middle 2000s

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.090
are now increasingly showing
up in companies like yours.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:42.400
I view what I know of Google,
in part, as a culture lab.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.420
We moved the Laboratoire
Culture Lab to Cambridge in 2014

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.790
and began the World
Frontiers Forum.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.920
And the World Frontiers
Forum is a gathering

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.210
of leaders from
around the world.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.110
We bring them to experience
15 frontiers of tomorrow

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.465
from contemporary
art to biology,

00:23:58.465 --> 00:24:01.330
a significant collaboration
with the United Nations,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.680
and we try to hatch every year
a project that can scale rapidly

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.090
in the developing world
and address one or more

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.840
of the sustainable
development challenges.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.150
And so this gets back
to this notion of,

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.230
how do you capture the energy of
the grassroots creator movement

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.130
and help guide it
towards sustainability

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.850
of the human condition in the
long time that has always been

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.640
our biological self-interest?

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.217
Thank you very much.

00:24:29.217 --> 00:24:32.486
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:35.196 --> 00:24:37.070
I'm not sure how we do
questions and answers,

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.850
but I'd really love
to talk with you.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.070
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
what your thoughts are

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.990
if you've looked
at this difference

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.390
in the creative space
between people who

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.185
are kind of, like,
the visionaries,

00:24:48.185 --> 00:24:50.560
and how this idea, like, oh,
this product would be really

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.435
cool, and then they
assemble a team of people

00:24:52.435 --> 00:24:54.880
to get that done,
versus the creatives who

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.510
are more on the side of the
actual people who are building

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.520
the products, and
creating the technologies,

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.765
and kind of like what the
different qualities of people

00:25:03.765 --> 00:25:05.640
on those different sides
of the equation are.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.480
DAVID EDWARDS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.650
And I find it always helpful--

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.840
so the question for those of
you who didn't hear that clearly

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:22.720
is, how do you
combine the visionary

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.360
with the creatives who are
bringing vision to practice?

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.817
And I think implicitly,
you're suggesting

00:25:30.817 --> 00:25:32.650
that as I kind of did,
that there are really

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.590
different qualities that lead to
success here and success here.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.690
And often, those cultures
don't really mix very well.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.640
And, of course, this has
been true throughout history.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:47.230
And I think today in
the highly specialized

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:52.570
world that we live in, and the
way we educate and organize

00:25:52.570 --> 00:26:00.550
ourselves, the barriers between
those two cultures are greater.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:06.040
I think that very successful
cultural innovation

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:11.820
environments-- and I view
Silicon Valley would be

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.740
an example of such
an environment,

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.920
Boston maybe for biotech,
New York maybe for Broadway

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.790
theater--

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:23.800
tend to create subcultures.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.190
And I think that generally,
you have a learning culture,

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.640
where visionaries
often thrive, you

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.550
have an experimental culture
where people can fail and get

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.690
paid for it, actually, and
you have an environment where

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:36.960
people produce.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.080
And any of those are
sort of relatively easy,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.450
and you find them in
many, many places.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.370
It's very hard, however,
to create a culture

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.430
where ideas and people
move between them

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.610
and where there's a trust
that allows that to happen.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:56.457
And that is the pixie
dust of creating tomorrow.

00:26:56.457 --> 00:26:59.040
And, again, it's something that
I talk more about in the book.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.800
I think that to be a little bit
more concrete, partly because

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.670
of the nature of the world
that we are living in today,

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:14.850
and frankly, the risky
nature of the world

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.920
we're living in today
probably has a lot more

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.560
to do with our
evolutionary conditions

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.930
than the world of big
offices and sure paychecks.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:36.800
We can thrive less
well with the luxury

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.470
of considering myself
a pure visionary,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:46.040
or considering myself
a pure applied creator.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:52.700
And we're needing all of
us to tolerate and thrive

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.230
in the conditions of
pioneering vision,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:04.850
as well as be engaged in
the complexity of sharing

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.760
that vision with others
and learning from others.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.985
So the ivory tower is under--

00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:15.610
I don't know if it
ever really existed,

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:19.200
but it's very hard
to rationalize today.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.270
And I think honestly, it's
very hard to be a visionary

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:26.020
and not be engaged
in what you're

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:30.200
describing as that creative
exchange with the public.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.000
It used to be we understood
better what people needed.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.970
And I think increasingly, we
need everyone to tell us that.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.420
So I'm hopeful that those two
cultures are coming together.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.510
And in any case, I
think environments

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:48.499
need to do a lot to just
help both sides communicate.

00:28:48.499 --> 00:28:51.852
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:51.852 --> 00:28:53.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.540
So I agree with you.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.610
There's a lot of
exciting empowerment

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.560
and personal creativity.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.170
But at the same time,
I see increasing trends

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.560
toward rewarding short-term
gains, shorter and shorter

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.120
product life cycles,
which is where

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.940
we get these piles
of trash, and so on.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.840
So how do we start to shift
towards our culture valuing

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.822
longer-term contributions?

00:29:18.822 --> 00:29:20.530
That seems like a real
challenge to this.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.940
DAVID EDWARDS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.990
And as was true in the
Italian Renaissance, any sort

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.660
of Renaissance period,
on the one hand,

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.990
we like to talk about the
heroes of the Renaissance.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.510
But it was a very tough
time to be living.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:38.530
Everything was kind of caving,
and all of the institutions

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.540
were pointing us in
the wrong direction,

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.270
and that's even more
profoundly true today.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:50.770
And so it's hard to look at
anything almost in the media,

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:56.560
if nowhere else, and not realize
that the qualities that I'm

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.680
highlighting that I believe
are really critical to creating

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.700
a world we all want to live
in are not very frequently

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.370
the qualities that are being
propagated in our institutions.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.700
I think one of the things
that I'm saying for sure

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.120
is that those qualities
of short-termism

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.980
are not sustainable.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.700
And so I'm personally less
interested in spending

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.670
my energy in figuring out,
how do I wake people up to--

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.450
and there are a lot of
people who are awakened.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.430
And I think that in the
spirit of the pioneer,

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.950
I prefer to be with
those pioneers making

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:37.570
tomorrow, and just assuming that
the unsustainable activity here

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.300
well will stop at some point.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.230
AUDIENCE: I had a
similar question

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.645
to build on his about
short-term thinking

00:30:43.645 --> 00:30:44.880
and long-term thinking.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.860
We have many
institutions, including

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.860
the government in the US,
where you elect officials

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.120
every four years.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.990
Companies like Google, you have
annual or quarterly performance

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:57.200
reviews and things like that.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.760
You have to show some
progress towards a goal.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.910
How do you bridge that
gap between needing

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:08.020
to show some short-term
progress, short-term goals

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:15.070
and solving long-term problems,
like asteroids hitting Earth 20

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.720
years from now, 50 years?

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.290
DAVID EDWARDS: So
great question.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:25.130
And as I also write
about in the book,

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:29.590
and maybe did not
emphasize enough here,

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.640
I don't believe personally
that the value that a Harvard

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.390
University brings to
the world or a Google

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.000
brings to the world,
both institutions being

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.240
under extreme
pressure to deliver

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:46.330
value today, and this semester,
or this quarter and both,

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:52.640
however, being highly
invested in the future of 30

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.390
years from now.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:59.000
So there's the big question,
which is what you just asked.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.860
Well, how do you
balance the fact

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.500
that we do have students
showing up this semester?

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.810
They really do need
to take a class.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.280
And maybe it's true that we
need to rethink education

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:08.780
completely.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.040
But meanwhile,
you've got students

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.970
you've got to teach
today, and you

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.053
can't tell them what we're
figuring it out, right?

00:32:13.053 --> 00:32:16.140
And so that's kind of the issue.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.570
So I think what de
facto is happening,

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.730
and it explains my role
at Harvard University,

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.980
and I think from my
understanding of Google

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:37.280
and a lot of the California
technology scene,

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.340
enlightened leadership
that is giving space

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.230
to whether it's
giving all of you

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:50.270
time to think out of the box or
letting you create a company,

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.640
and move off
campus, and creating

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.240
these experimental
sandboxes where

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.640
we can dream about the future.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.680
And that itself is
relatively simple.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.150
What's difficult,
actually, is how

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.790
to create that sandbox
where not only do you go off

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:09.870
and think long-term, but what
you do matters to me back here.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.137
So that's the bigger issue
is, how do I stay in touch

00:33:12.137 --> 00:33:13.220
and not lose sight of you?

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.280
Why do I keep caring?

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.680
And that is really an
enlightened leadership issue.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.980
And I think, getting
back to this point

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.210
that I tried to make
earlier, the good thing

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.800
about where we're
at right now is

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.270
that it's so urgent
that we pay attention

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.420
to the longer-term
future that we just

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.290
can't afford to send you off
to think about the future,

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.730
and then forget about you.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.830
And so I think that
there's clearly

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.970
an awakening happening
today that I am hopeful

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.080
will lead to more of that.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:50.180
But it is a complicated
balance that I think all of us

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.640
in a way strike in our lives.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.390
And if you think
back, childhood--

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:57.050
I have kids now, 15, 17, and
19, and I've learned so much

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.750
from them, and I still do.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:05.840
But if you think back
on the qualities that

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.190
made you survive
adolescence, where

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.040
you needed at the same
time to be profoundly

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.482
in the moment and local,
and at the same time,

00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:17.690
you had to think, well, I'm
going to college, and I--

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.560
[MUMBLING]

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.260
And you had to think, and
you were in this sort of--

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.679
that's really what
life is about, right?

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.590
And I think that there's been
too much now for too long where

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.540
we kind of assume
that, well, that ended,

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.510
and then you kind
of, and then this.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.790
We need to balance all
those things, for sure.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.620
AUDIENCE: I just want
to hear your thoughts

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.810
on AI and creativity.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.179
I think with artificial
intelligence today,

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.940
we tend to see more
and more of things

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.060
that we are already thinking
and that other people were

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.659
thinking.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.340
But how you go outside
the box and how you

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.247
see AI playing a role in that.

00:34:53.247 --> 00:34:54.080
DAVID EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.320
Well, again, this is
another big, big question,

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.010
and I think my innocence will
help simplify the answer.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:09.770
So let me just first say that
one of the things I read about

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.960
in the book and
that I experience

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.430
every semester
with my students is

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:18.020
this first day
where I'm presenting

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.100
the concept of the class.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.472
You got to create something
that matters, and in one year.

00:35:22.472 --> 00:35:23.930
And I write about
this in the book.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.900
A student asks this question,
and this gets asked every year

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.840
in one form or another.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.860
What if I don't have an idea?

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.266
And the complement to that
is the student who says,

00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:36.140
I got an idea, and the
next thing, goes like,

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.180
but I found it online.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.440
Like, this is out there already.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.530
And my point to both of those
young people is the same.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:50.490
That if you-- we're getting
to artificial intelligence.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.580
I just want to finish
this little thought.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:36:00.830
That I think what makes you
matter now more than me,

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.890
in a certain way, is that
you own your experience,

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:05.990
and I don't.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.649
And that experience tells
you something about now

00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:11.190
and about the needs
and opportunities

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.090
now that only you know.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.610
And if from that, you
observe, you're mindful enough

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.360
to kind of just notice, and
you have an idea, a want,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.125
that is coming from
this intuition,

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:25.250
a lot of observations you
couldn't even articulate.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:28.100
And so yeah, a wheel, I
want to create a wheel.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.800
And then you say,
well, my god, people

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.380
have created wheels
for a long time.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.839
But I will say to
you, but forget

00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:34.130
about what people have created.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.090
Why the hell did
you say a wheel?

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.810
What does that mean for you?

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.770
And as you dig into
it, and you dig

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.970
into that big bank of
knowledge, which is intuition,

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:48.480
you will have created
something unique, your wheel.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.540
So I say all of
that to say that I

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.820
think two things about
artificial intelligence

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.620
from my really
distant perspective.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.590
One, the obvious thing that
really what's happening

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.396
is the natural and artificial
are kind of merging,

00:37:01.396 --> 00:37:02.020
and we're all--

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.228
it's kind of going to be
difficult to really separate

00:37:04.228 --> 00:37:05.720
between the two,
and it already is.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.890
The whole notion
of consciousness

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.840
as being something that's
biological is crazy.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.020
It's clearly distributed.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.550
And so clearly, there's
this merger going on.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.160
Not fairly, so a
big issue and that

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.820
is learning, learning to
adapt to this [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.852
we don't all learn, so
that's a huge issue.

00:37:23.852 --> 00:37:25.310
I think the second
thing-- and this

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:29.090
gets to thriving humanity
in the long term.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.960
I think that my intuition is
that what is happening here

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.630
with the advance of
artificial intelligence

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.390
is what makes us
human, most human?

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.970
Which is not
probably the calculus

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:44.240
that I learned when I was,
like, 20 years of age.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.820
But it's actually that intuitive
bank of knowledge of my moment.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.780
I own that.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.940
And I own that in a way that
no computer, however smart,

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.340
who wasn't there, can know.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.510
And so being able to mine that.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.550
And as you know, as we're
advancing so rapidly

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.470
towards this future of
artificial intelligence

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.200
and present, we're
discovering that biology

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.550
is like a black hole, in
terms of the complexity

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.950
and sophistication.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:22.250
And so my guess is that
there will be a coexistence,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.050
again, not without pain.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:25.820
And I think there
are a lot of issues,

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.545
as I say, related to equity
and how we manage this.

00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:33.920
AUDIENCE: I'm trying really
hard to resist the temptation

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.792
to just meander
and ramble, so I'm

00:38:35.792 --> 00:38:38.000
going to try to make this
as short as I possibly can.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.470
DAVID EDWARDS: I'm
happy with meandering.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.000
AUDIENCE: But it sort
of piggybacks off

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.550
of Tom's comment, and I don't
know your name, but the comment

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.920
you had after, and
something you said

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.230
about the Italian Renaissance.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:53.630
I recently read the new
biography of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:56.270
And one of the things
that struck me was--

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.100
and this is according
to the author--

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.660
how often that he had a
patron who just gave him

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.186
so much leeway,
and so much time,

00:39:05.186 --> 00:39:07.560
and then he spent the time
just doing whatever he wanted,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.536
or moving on, and
procrastinating.

00:39:12.536 --> 00:39:17.270
So he left angry patron
after angry patron.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:21.110
But that freedom that he
had to do whatever he want

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:24.320
led to two or three
amazing masterpieces

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:32.840
and a lot of half-finished
stuff, a lot of exploration.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:40.370
And as the other two
commenters alluded to, now,

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.760
and as you said, now,
we're so goal-oriented,

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.840
and so quarterly goal,
yearly goal-focused

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.570
that I know you said in
response to both of those

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.332
that the policy is
not, like, I guess

00:39:52.332 --> 00:39:54.290
the focus of what you're
thinking on with this.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.430
But it does seem like
a natural next step

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.442
to seeing, how can we unlock
more potential from people?

00:40:01.442 --> 00:40:02.900
There are a lot of
creative people.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.030
How do we unlock it?

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.863
DAVID EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:40:04.863 --> 00:40:05.960
Can I respond to that?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.590
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.090
DAVID EDWARDS: OK, cool.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:15.370
I read this, so in fact, I go
more into this in the book.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.390
Take Leonardo.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:20.600
As you say, the patron,
or what I call activator,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.740
played a big role.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.420
Patrons look different today.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.310
It's true, we have
the Larry Pages,

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.810
and we have the Bill Gates.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.544
But the radical change in
patronage, if you will,

00:40:30.544 --> 00:40:32.210
is that it's gone
grassroots, so there's

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:36.140
a kind of-- but
activators are everywhere,

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.210
but the activators matter.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.730
And the second thing is this
what I call cultural lab,

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.140
like in Florence.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.291
He was super lucky to
have been born in Florence

00:40:45.291 --> 00:40:46.790
when he was born
in Florence, right?

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:48.990
So there's all this
stuff going on,

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.560
and experimentation
was being invited.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.190
And there was a
culture that could

00:40:55.190 --> 00:41:01.340
look at the experiment of the
Duomo and call it beautiful.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:07.850
And so there was this ability
to see the new as potentially

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:08.810
being very beautiful.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:09.710
And so it invited.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.610
So there was a
culture that mattered.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:20.030
And finally, Leonardo
would be a real model

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.640
of the kind of dimensions
that I'm referring to.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:28.160
And so we do need
this environment

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:36.360
that includes people willing to
bet on you, and in particular,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.020
bet on your ability to
realize a dream that

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.090
matters to more than you.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:47.430
We do need you to be surrounded
by those who can appreciate it,

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:53.520
and we do
fundamentally need you.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.670
So I think that while, again,
getting back to the earlier

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:02.590
point, we are, and you
are here at Google,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.820
and I am, to the extent
that I am at Harvard,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.680
in environments
where you see a lot

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:14.130
of the success of the last 20,
30, and maybe more years kind

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:20.220
of an intertial wave that we're
a part of that may be a little

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.872
bit overwhelming, particularly
if we try to move away from it.

00:42:22.872 --> 00:42:25.205
So we're just [? kind of ?]
getting [? carried ?] along.

00:42:25.205 --> 00:42:26.200
AUDIENCE: Very much so.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.220
DAVID EDWARDS: But
fortunately, that

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.830
is not the whole of human
experience right now.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:33.810
And I think that
all I can say, which

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:37.260
is how I manage my relationship
with Harvard University.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:42.120
I'm super delighted and
lucky that Harvard still

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.335
calls me one of their
faculty members.

00:42:44.335 --> 00:42:46.710
But I spend a lot of time
away, and I spent a lot of time

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.190
in my own space.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.240
And I think that
depending upon who

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.710
you are and the kind of
pioneering you want to do,

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:00.551
an enlightened organization,
I'm sure Google should give you

00:43:00.551 --> 00:43:01.050
that space.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.330
Now, it's just important
to understand that Leonardo

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.040
led a really risky life.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.880
He was not happy
a lot of the time,

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.064
and he didn't feel he
was getting credit.

00:43:11.064 --> 00:43:11.980
He had a lot of stuff.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.840
And so being out alone,
you have to realize

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.970
that hanging by
your fingernails,

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.510
it looks great when you then
got to the top of Mount Everest,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.450
but you're mostly
hanging from fingernails,

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.070
and you've got to--

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:30.800
I personally feel that we
need to all do more of that.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.940
So that was a rambling response
to your rambling question.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.740
AUDIENCE: Well I have a very
directed short follow, I guess.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.948
DAVID EDWARDS: I'm sorry, OK.

00:43:38.948 --> 00:43:40.950
AUDIENCE: What are some
of the interventions--

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:43.050
I guess specifically, you
mentioned the foundation

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:44.430
that went to Cambridge.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.130
And then I'm sure in your
development of insulin,

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.710
that you had opportunities
or things that

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.517
unlocked that ability for you.

00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:52.350
DAVID EDWARDS: Yeah.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.760
AUDIENCE: And so I
was just wondering,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.160
without getting too much into
the weeds of policy, what

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.620
are specific things you've seen
besides what you've already

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.640
mentioned that have worked
for people who maybe otherwise

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.166
would not have had
the opportunity?

00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:17.660
DAVID EDWARDS: Well, let
me say that in my case--

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.730
and again, I write
about it in the book,

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:23.130
and I also point this out
in other creator lives--

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:33.810
I have found that in pursuing
my dreams to the extent

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.760
that my dreams matter
more than just to me,

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.930
I have very frequently
come to the edge

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.810
where, my god, this could be it.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:49.260
And I always found someone
who came and helped.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.510
And this notion of
activator, which

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.090
obviously in the
Italian Renaissance,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.506
there are some
really famous ones.

00:44:54.506 --> 00:44:55.950
But they're
everywhere right now.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.790
And one of the great joys
of my own creative life

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.150
is the discovery
that I'm not alone,

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.620
and that there's this network.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:12.115
And so in the inhaled insulin
case, I was a theoretical guy.

00:45:12.115 --> 00:45:13.490
I'd written a
couple of textbooks

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.530
that five people in the
world had read, and published

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:17.320
this article.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.150
And I had a series of people, a
venture capitalist I mentioned

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.370
who was more than a venture
capitalist who played

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.630
a really big role in my life.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.070
But many, many,
many, many people.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.980
So is there a recipe?

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.060
I don't know.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.430
I have lived for
many years in Paris,

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.960
and have had lots
of conversations

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.010
with the French government,
and academia in France about,

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.994
how do we create
Harvard in Paris?

00:45:40.994 --> 00:45:41.785
Is it an endowment?

00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:42.900
Is that what we need?

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.460
And so my big point-- and maybe
this is the most concrete thing

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.560
I can say--

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.580
there's an amazing education
in France in many ways,

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.560
and really such bright people,
and such a rich culture.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.990
But one thing that does not
thrive there, speaking really

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:09.380
generally, is as a student,
when I leave the university,

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.840
there's not a possibility
to take a big risk

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.190
and do really, really
well really quickly.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.810
It's more of a climb the
ladder kind of phenomenon.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:30.570
And I think that the creating of
opportunities for the dreamers

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.660
is the most important thing
that we can possibly do.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.960
And I think it is a
challenge for big successful

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.820
organizations to create
those, because it's

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.630
hard to measure the value
of the little experiment

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:46.390
in the context of
the big, big mission.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:48.360
But that's betting.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.190
And maybe I'll
finish by just saying

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:54.270
that I was just in Atlanta
speaking to some people,

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:59.730
and the question was, well,
what can we most do to our kids,

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:03.480
and to help them create a world
that they want to live in,

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.295
and create what matters?

00:47:05.295 --> 00:47:07.920
And my point to them again, it's
the point I make in the book--

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.040
is that the best thing we
can do, I think, to our kids

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.420
is help them see
that they matter.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.530
And so I think that
you can't create

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:20.170
anything that matters if you
don't feel you matter first.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:24.780
And so that, mattering for
me has generally been people

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.990
from my dad to lots of people,
my wife, lots of people

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.750
who've bet on me in a certain
way and said, you matter.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:34.995
And so that's the easy answer.

00:47:34.995 --> 00:47:37.959
AUDIENCE: What does
it mean to matter?

00:47:37.959 --> 00:47:39.750
DAVID EDWARDS: What
does it mean to matter?

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:43.740
Well, as I say a little bit,
and I say more in the book,

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.190
almost anything
matters at some moment.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:48.390
A raindrop matters that
some moment, right, and so

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:49.480
everything matters.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.820
So it's a provocation.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.430
But what it means in
the title of my book,

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.520
these are things that matter
not just to you, but to many,

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.390
and for a long period of time.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:01.200
And so a way to translate that--

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.418
even that, if you dig
into it is kind of--

00:48:03.418 --> 00:48:08.290
but they matter so much that
people want them to endure,

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.890
and so they will
help them endure.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.590
It's like what you want of your
kid when your kid leaves home.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.110
You want the kid to thrive.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:19.280
And that's not just your girl
being really entrepreneurial,

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.280
but people wanting her, people
wanting her in the room.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.240
And so creating
something that matters

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.130
is creating something
that's alive

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.220
and that has a right to live.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.570
[APPLAUSE]
