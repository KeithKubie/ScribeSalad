LANCE ALERTSON: My name
is Lance Albertson.

00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:04.132
I'm with the Oregon State
University Open Source Lab.

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:04.840
I'm the director.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.550
And I run the lab.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.341
The Open Source Lab
provides infrastructure

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.640
hosting for medium to large
open source Foss projects.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.900
So we host projects like
drupal.org, Apache Software

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.140
Foundation, Python
Software Foundation,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.700
and 150 other
different projects.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.610
The Open Source Lab has been
a mentoring organization,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.930
I think, since 2005 or 2004.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.470
I don't remember which.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.580
And I have been a mentor
with OSL since 2008.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.950
The Open Source Lab experience
and GSoC 2013 was great.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.700
We had four great students.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.070
We have two students
working on a project

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.580
actually at the lab
called Ganeti Web Manager.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.990
And one of them was working
on a new visualization

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.440
tool for virtual machines
within a virtualization cluster.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.240
Another student was working
on improving the installation,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.040
the ease of installation
of the project,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.290
which is a huge
problem we've had.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.090
So it'll make a
really big impact.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.590
And that particular
student actually

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.840
has been with the program
since GCI in 2010.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.290
So he's been GCI one year and
GSoC two years in a row now.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.260
We had another student
at a Ganeti provider

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.130
to the Vagrant Project,
which we use quite a bit

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.730
at the lab, which is great.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.820
And then the final student
worked on an Android

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.350
application dealing with
conferences, open conferences.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.900
So we had this
Android application

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.276
we created a couple years
ago we'd kind of abandoned.

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:24.650
There's a lot of
forks on GitHub.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.608
And so we are trying to
merge that all together

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:27.464
and updating it.

00:01:27.464 --> 00:01:28.880
At the Open Source
Lab, I'm really

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.500
hoping that we'll eventually
do more infrastructure related

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.072
coding project with GSoC.

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:35.530
We've kind of been stuck on
the same one for several years.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.260
And it's great.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.630
But it's kind of nice
to have some variety.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.254
So we have some other ideas that
we've just never gotten around

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:43.497
to we need to flush out before
we can make it a GSoC program.

00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:45.830
If anybody wants to get
involved in the Open Source Lab,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.470
just hang out on
our IRC channel,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.380
pound OSUOSL on FreeNote.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200
It's a great way to get started.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.660
Check the bug tracker
code at ocosl.org

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.790
and see any bugs in the
Gateway Manager Project.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.912
And just comment to check out
the code, that sort of thing.

00:01:58.912 --> 00:01:59.870
There's a variety ways.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.240
We're trying to figure out a
volunteer system for people

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.910
actually helping
the lab in general.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.796
We just haven't
figured that out yet.

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:06.980
But we're still trying to.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.854
Hopefully we'll get that
going within a year.

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:12.210
My personal reward with
GSoC is seeing the students

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.060
that we've had
over the years grow

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.309
that keep coming back and
seeing them excel and move

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.350
and figure out what they
want to do in the world.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.440
So we get to do that
locally in Oregon at OSU.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.400
But being able to do
the same thing globally

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.710
is really a big thing.
