00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.340
There are four quadrants
of your consciousness.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:09.218
Upper left is what you know
and what people know about you.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.556
Upper right is what you know
about yourself but nobody knows.

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:17.893
Lower left is what other people
know about you that you don't know.

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:22.023
And lower right is what you
don't know and what nobody knows.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.651
Whims come from there,
impulses come from there,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.738
and that's where art comes from.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.498
When did you first start
taking pictures of people?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.755
1976, I was finishing Boston Views,
the pictures people call topographic,

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.215
and I got tired of it,

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.966
and day by day,
just people started to creep in.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.471
The minute you get
to a certain distance,

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:57.368
a certain closeness of the person,
then it's all about the person,

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:58.790
and the background becomes something

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:00.353
that has to be integrated
with the frame,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.605
but it's not about
the overall view anymore.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.523
Jan Groover said a good thing once.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.125
When she went from painting
to photography, she said,

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:09.820
“It took me a while to figure it out
but in photography the problem

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.573
is making the grass
as interesting as the cow.”

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.496
The Brown Sisters is a series
of 41 photographs

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:22.541
of my wife Bebe
and her three sisters.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.295
I've taken it every year
for 41 years.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.046
I use the same camera every year,
8-by-10,

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.966
and they stand in the same order.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.470
The only thing I really ever say is
“Get closer, please”

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.388
if the space between them is boring.

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:38.891
If they’re like here,
you have to stand further back,

00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:40.310
and so their faces are smaller,

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:43.270
therefore less voluptuous
and less powerful physically.

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:44.713
So the closer they are together,

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:47.368
the more the physicality
of their faces and gestures,

00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:49.151
the larger it is in the frame.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.593
Okay, so it's going
to be half a second.

00:02:25.438 --> 00:02:28.356
Okay, the cheek one again, please.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.361
Now that I'm trying
to make digital work,

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:37.408
I started a series of two people
putting their faces close together,

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:41.311
touching, and letting
whatever feelings of discomfort

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.915
or comfort or amusement, fear, show.

00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:45.666
Okay, close close.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.003
I think it's letting me
be a little more intimate

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:53.256
and physical with people
than I've been able to be before.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.385
How is the process different?

00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:59.930
The process is just about my comfort,
that doesn't matter that much.

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:02.641
The more important thing
is how are the pictures different.

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:06.896
I want to get rid of the idea
that they have their private space.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:08.435
They don't have any
in these pictures.

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:10.416
They're all in the same place,
like a subway.

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:12.230
They're all in a place
where they're forced

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.151
by the truc of the project
to do something unnatural

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.825
in order for something intense
to come out.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:24.163
The slice of time that it takes
to take the picture is smaller,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.376
so now it might be
a hundredth of a second

00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:28.083
instead of an eighth of a second.

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:31.090
With an eighth of a second,
the person has to be aware of it

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.213
in a way that they
don't the other way.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.135
I tend to like them to be aware of it
even with a digital camera anyway,

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.053
so I tend to do it the same way.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.595
I want it to be longer lasting,
and have the meaning

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:46.768
be not about grabbing the moment
but about dancing with the moment,

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:49.151
collaborating with the moment.
