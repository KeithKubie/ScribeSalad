You know what? This is such
a deep part of my childhood.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:06.005
I can't go to who's hotter
in the Brady Bunch.

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.340 line:92%
Yeah.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.608 line:92%
That's too hard?

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.144
Well maybe Cindy, but Cindy
may have hit rough times.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.478
You know,
youngest child syndrome.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:13.846
Do you wanna see
Brady Bunches now?

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.081
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.315
Okay.
I go Alice.

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:17.583
I remember when-
I'm an Alice guy.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:18.818
Oh my God.

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:20.019
Fucking Ann B. Davis?

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.220
Goddamn right.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:22.522
You're an Ann B.
Davis guy all day.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.257
Call me Sam the Butcher.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.364
It's The Bonfire, Comedy
Central Radio, Sirius XM 95.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.732
It's very important.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.267
Jacob is getting us
all wired up, how important.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.469
Where is he? Aw man,
he would love that you did that.

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.837
How much did I nail it?
Did what?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.940
We're saying Comedy
Central Radio, Sirius XM 95.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.508
Oh, you identified.
Yes.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.810
Just to make sure we weren't

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.411
a communist radio station
in the 30s.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.013
Yeah. This has been taken over
by Russian people.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.281
No, don't do the voice.

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:50.716
You know what I think
we can stop?

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.185
I think we can stop saying,
"Comedy Central Radio,

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.620
Sirius XM 95, Big Jay Oakerson,
Dan Soder,"

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:55.822
every time we come back in.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.023
People know.
I think it's not-

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.291
After the first one ...
They get it by this point.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.525
You just said it.
Yeah, see.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:00.793
Yeah.
Set it up.

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:02.996
But we say it every time.
It's moronic.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.332
Our guests joining us
in the studio right now,

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.134
Pete Holmes and Judd Apatow.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.335
Oh. Oh my God,

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:10.703
I didn't know there were
hundreds of people here.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:11.904
Stadium seating.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:13.406
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pete, Pete,
Pete.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.640
Thousands.

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:16.309
They'll do whatever you say.
Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.477
Loyal. Very loyal.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.178 line:92%
Watch, they'll do Judd too.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.581
Judd, Judd, Judd, Judd, Judd,
Judd 

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.815
It got quiet.

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.016
Judd, Judd.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.685
We can even do last names.
It took them a second.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:26.886
Apatow.
It took them a second.

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.187
Apatow, Apatow, Apatow.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.655
See? You can switch it up.
They're good.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:30.890
Can they do blood?

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.091
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.593
Like a scary one?
Sure, sure.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.361
Yeah, it's a

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.396
Blood, blood, blood,
blood, blood.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.664
They've been drinking.

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:40.266
Yeah, 
been drinking.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.667
We're all vaped up.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.069
I would ... No.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.737
I mean, you could be
in a vape commercial, Jay.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.139
I mean, I would buy it.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.608
Not even for the weed ones.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:49.809
The ones where he looks
at the guys.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.378
I look like everybody
in those videos of guys

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.947
making that fancy vape.
You ever seen fancy vape videos?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.149
I've never realized that.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.350
Yeah, you look like-

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.253
Yes. My kids have shown me
people do amazing smoke things.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.721
But those things like the Juul

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.723
are the most addictive
thing on the earth,

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:08.294
and all middle schoolers
are like crack heads with Juuls.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:09.929
That's my question
for you as a parent.

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:14.100
Because I started smoking at 12,
but I was smoking cigarettes.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.469
So Juuls now for middle
school kids, it's less-

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:19.172
You sound like you started
smoking when you were 12.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.140
Yeah Pete, I'm only
25 years old.

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:22.575
My daughter told me last night-

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:23.809
I'm 22.

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:25.044
First of all,
my favorite thing was this-

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:26.312
I didn't mean to interrupt
your anecdote.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:27.547
Oh no.
This isn't the kind of show

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.748
where you can jab in
and have them finish.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:29.949
Yeah, no.
Jump all in, dude.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.184
Fire away.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.085
This is sloppy.
We have no structure here.

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:35.254
My daughter said last night ...
Because [Christine 00:02:34]

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:38.224
was looking for her Juul,
and my daughter goes,

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.759
"Juul, is that
the long rectangle one?"

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.093
Like shut the fuck up.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:42.361
Shut up. Shut up, dork.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:43.863
You know you have.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.097
She absolutely knows
which one is,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.033
but didn't they say
her school ...

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.434
I don't if this
is dangerous or not.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.203
Are they magnetizing
the bathroom

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.438
because it makes the Juuls
won't work or something, right?

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.839
That's troubling ...
They put detectors.

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.775
When you have to magnetize
the whole space.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.476
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.111
They've polarized
the entire room.

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:02.348
We've put one fatal flaw
inside of the Juuls.

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:05.685
Guys, is it just me,
or is my Juul not working?

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.119
It's like a pyramid

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:10.323
where if you touch this one
brick the whole thing goes down.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.026
My Juul's operating under
the fourth prime directive.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.828
Do not work in school.

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:18.531
Dude, that's a fucking
hilarious thing

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.300
to equip the bathrooms
with anti-Juul ...

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.702
That's what I always appreciate.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:25.271
They said Wawa made
all the lights ...

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:28.374
the lighting
in their bathrooms blue

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:29.875
so you can't find a vein

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:31.143
to shoot up heroin
in the bathroom.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:32.378
Really?

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.380
And they make a quality sandwich
24/7.

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.383
How big of a junkie was the guy
that pitched that?

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.051
He goes, "Guys, I mean,
we could do blue lights.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:41.320
Can't find a vein
if you wanna shoot some H."

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:42.722
Whoa.
I'm trying to stay clean.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.923
I feel like there's
a whole world

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:45.191
I don't know much about.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.425
Yeah.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.527
Oh, gas station sandwiches
is our specialty.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.630
Oh, Wawa bathrooms?
Wawa bathroom lighting?

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.831
Wait, what's a Wawa?

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.366
Wawa is a east coast-

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.600
A child asking for water?

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:55.801
No.
It could be.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:57.536
It's a east coast sandwich shop.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.771
East coast sandwich.

00:03:58.804 --> 00:03:59.972
But it's a sandwich ...

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.407
It's a gas station
sandwich shop.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.642
Oh, so it's a gas station?

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:03.909
Yes.

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:05.711
Well, it's a sandwich shop
first and foremost, Pete.

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:06.946
Yeah.
Show a little respect.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.681
I would say you go
for the sandwiches,

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:10.016
and if you need to refill,

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.250
it just so happens
to be a location.

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:13.219
No, you start selling unleaded,
that's your number one.

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.587
I mean, they also

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.123
do diesel, so let's not
paint them in a corner.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.392
That's how they lure you in.
Then you get into the store.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.160
Look at this store.
You calling that a gas station?

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:22.662
You saying that's a gas station
right there?

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:25.364
You've never been more Philly
than you are right now.

00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:27.066
Yeah.
That's a store!

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.801
I feel like if you're a long ...

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:32.605
you're a trucker and you're
driving long distances,

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:33.939
you want food
that clogs you up.

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:35.174
Yeah.

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:36.876
You don't want food
that keeps it moving.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.244
Yeah. 
Regularity?

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:39.445
Yeah.

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:40.980
If you're a trucker
and your route

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:43.916
has blessed you
by passing a Wawa

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.251
and you don't stop in there ...

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.687
I mean, unless you're
looking to shoot heroin.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.355
Yeah, that's looks
like a 

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.290
How funny would that be
if you're just with someone

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.192
and you go, "Can't go to Wawa.
They got blue lights."

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:54.727
And you're like, "Hey D, are you
going through something?"

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.228
He's like, "That's fine.
No, I smoke meth,

00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:57.396
so it doesn't matter.
I don't need lights."

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:58.597
He goes, "I actually like
the blue lights.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.832
They calm me down.

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.534
They take me down
from my violent stage."

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.135
What else would the blue lights
stop you from doing?

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:04.537
I don't know.
That's it. 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.805
Blowing a Smurf (bleep)

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.440
It'd make a poster look sick.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.875
And also wear a t-shirt
with a mustard stain on it.

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:11.243
You'd go, "I thought ...

00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:13.112
Son of a bitch, I thought
this thing came out."

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:15.448
What would it do?
Show all of your fake teeth?

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:18.884
Show all of your dental flaws?

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:21.354
That does look like a store
you'd have to be road hypnotized

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.989
by a 90 mile haul
to think it's a store.

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:25.257
Or be Jay.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.859
I wish we could ... Yeah.

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:28.728
You could just be Jay
looking to tailgate.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.962
Yeah, or just be Jay.

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:31.997
I wish we had Wawa sandwiches
for you guys

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.766
both to eat in front of us to-

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.134
I'm good on diarrhea.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:36.402
There's no diarrhea
involved here.

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.472
As you said, stopping up.
It's gonna clog you.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.073
Clog it up. It's the cork.

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:42.274
I don't even feel cloggy.

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:43.776
I think it almost
makes you regular.

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.644
It's fantastic food.

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:47.613
But what if you're a trucker
and you're like okay,

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.949
I gotta drive.
I've got 2000 miles ahead of me.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.251
And then you get in your car
and you have your coffee,

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:53.919
and then 30 seconds later
you're like,

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:55.488 line:92%
I gotta take a shit.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.090
But that happens every
20 minutes for 2000 miles.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:05:59.458
You put it in second gear.

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:02.261
That's the code
for filling up them trousers.

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:03.496
Oh really?

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.165
You go, "I think this guy
in front of me's downshifting."

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:08.434
Pete, I didn't know
you spoke CB.

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:09.802
You speak ham radio?

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:11.570
He goes, "Why? Do you got a guy
on the line with you?"

00:06:11.603 --> 00:06:13.472
He goes, "Breaker, breaker,
one, two.

00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:14.907
Yeah, are you shifting
down into second

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.142
to drop a load in your pants?"

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:18.444
Yeah.
Did you just drop a ham radio?

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:20.380
Yeah.
I dropped a full ham radio.

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:22.882
Jay, has anyone ever thought
when you said,

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:26.085
"My name is Big Jay Oakerson,"
that you were spelling it out

00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:27.653
and that it was Jokerson
with a capital J?

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:28.888
Yes.

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.089
What's your name? Big J.

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:31.357
Big Jokerson.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.558
Oakerson.

00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:34.326
Yeah, start with the J,
then go Oakerson.

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:36.095
That'll get you all there.

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:37.563
I never noticed it myself

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:40.499
until somebody would
just make my name on ...

00:06:40.532 --> 00:06:43.102
When I did the ...
starting the black circuit,

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:44.703
sometimes they would
just write "Big"

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:46.172
and then the letter J.

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.973
That's not how I ever thought.
I was always-

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:49.241
Like Big Jay.

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:51.510
Yeah, I 
But this was the letter J.

00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:53.913
So Big J Oakerson
looks like Big Jokerson.

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:55.247
Is it true ... Yes.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.917
Wasn't Bill Burr, when he did
the black circuit, Billy Burr?

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.151
Wasn't that his thing?

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:00.719
I think he was Billy Burr
across the board, and then one

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:03.122
Across the board Billy Burr.

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:04.557
His headshot at The Cellar

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.758
says "Billy Burr."
It does?

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.026
Yeah.
Can I tell-

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.294
I think one day he just said,

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.095
"How old do you have to get
and still be called Billy?"

00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:11.330
Hilarious.

00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:12.531
That was it.
It's what he told me.

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:14.233
He was like, "Yeah, I can't
be called Billy anymore."

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:17.369
I only ever knew Bill
as the greatest and a legend.

00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:20.206
And I opened for him
when I was first starting out,

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:22.608
and he was headlining.
It was at Peoria.

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.277
It was a place called The Ice
House or something in Peoria.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.012
It doesn't matter.
So I get back to ...

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:28.614
I get to New York.
I see Gaffigan.

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:31.250
This is 10, 15 years ago,
and I go, yeah,

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:33.385
I was just in blah,
blah opening for Bill Burr."

00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:35.188
And he goes, "Billy Burr?"

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.123
It was so long ago

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:40.593
that he couldn't believe
that Bill Burr was headlining.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.827
Really?

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.263
He knew him. Can you ...
Just let that soak in.

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:48.167
There was a time that we knew
Bill Burr as a strong middle.

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.504
He can't believe
Judah Friedlander's headlining

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:53.239
now either apparently.

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:55.107
Dude, that's hilarious
just to think there was a time

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.509
that someone was like,
"Richie Pryor 

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:57.877
You're gonna have
that guy fucking ... "

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.111
That's what I'm saying!

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:00.646
Little Dick Pryor?
Little Dick Pryor?

00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:01.981
I think that's what Merv Griffin
called him

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.315
on the first appearance.

00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:04.683
Oh really? It was Richie Pryor?

00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:05.885
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:07.520
Let's welcome Little
Richie Pryor.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.989
Georgie Carlin
is looking to do an ...

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.223
That guy's doing an hour?

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:12.725
He's never gonna be able
to fill an hour.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:15.528
Billy Cosby, a real lady
killer in the back.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.231
What do you think
he's doing right now?

00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:20.432
Bill Cosby?

00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:22.234
Oh man, fucking sharpening
the back of a toothbrush,

00:08:22.267 --> 00:08:23.569
fucking get extra cornbread.

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:24.803
Here's what I was-

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:26.005
(bleep)

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.273
I was trying to figure out,

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.041
is he bragging about
being Bill Cosby

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:30.609
or trying to tell people
he's not Bill Cosby?

00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:31.911
I don't know.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.145
No, I think they have him
in a wing

00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:34.880
where he doesn't see
any other gen pop.

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:36.215
Gen pop.

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:37.416
Yeah, he's not in there.

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:38.617
He's not in there
with the animals.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.852
He's in

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:41.654
I think he's got that milky eye
just sitting in a corner

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.989
telling old war stories
smoking a cigar.

00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:48.661
Are you familiar with the 70s?
Son, pull up your pants.

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.096
He's still telling him pull up
their pants in fucking prison.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:52.965
They go, "Yo man,
I murdered a guy."

00:08:52.998 --> 00:08:54.233
I speak English.

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:56.235
I speak English, and the Ebonics

00:08:56.268 --> 00:08:59.572
will not work
in this certain play area.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:02.041
Cell block D speaks English.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:04.277
Why is the light blue
in the bathroom?

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.245
Is it for the veins?

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:08.280
Have you ever looked for your
veins and you can't find them?

00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:10.149
Where are my veins?
Where did they go?

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.217
You're looking for the veins
and the

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.421
We were trying to think
of the worst stand up material

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:17.856
that you could do for
Dov Davidoff for his character

00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:19.892 line:92%
Jason, and what we landed on

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:21.126
On Crashing HBO.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.361
On Crashing for HBO.

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:23.662
30th

00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:24.930
at 10 p.m.

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:26.398
Comedy Central Radio Sirius,
this is Big Jay.

00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:27.633
There you go.

00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:30.936
And what we decided
was the worst bit that we made

00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:35.207
a stand up bit out of was
Bill Cosby's graduation speech

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.478
from a long time ago
where his big running joke

00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.881
was that he was mocking
the concept of consent.

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:44.850
And that was his thing.

00:09:44.883 --> 00:09:48.421
So you gotta ask people?
How's that gonna work?

00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:51.724
And he literally did a whole
routine at a graduation.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.459
Jesus.
That's fucking ...

00:09:53.992 --> 00:09:55.194
Cosby did?

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.629
Yes.
Wait, that's a real thing?

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:59.598
No, yeah, and it's in a book.
He put it in one of his books.

00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:01.500
Cosby mocked consent
at a fucking ...

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:02.835
Talk about ...
I didn't know that.

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:05.237
That's what serial killers
do to fucking wave a thumb

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.905
in the nose
of the detectives.

00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:09.208
Yeah.
The level of sociopath ...

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:12.177
I left you all the clues.
You ignored them for years.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.213
Just when they busted in his
house in Philadelphia he goes,

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.414
"It took you long enough.

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:19.485
I've had the clues
out there for years."

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.387
He turned in a chair
and he goes,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.124
"Gentlemen, I've been expecting
you since the late 70s."

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:29.461
What took you gentlemen so long?

00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:32.264
I've gone through
several plates of jello.

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:35.200
The bodies were all there.
Everything was there.

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.636
Even I started to believe
I didn't do it.

00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:39.372
There it is.

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:41.807
He's the snowman killer.
That's what you're saying.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.342
Yeah, exactly.
That's exactly it. They say-

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.610
Yeah, here it is.
There's a whole article

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:45.978
they're pulling up.

00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:47.246
Wow.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.049
Where they found
his weird speech.

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.217
Yeah, in the book Cosby
tells readers

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.786
how lucky they are
to have graduated

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.889
since they no longer have
to deal with campus sex police.

00:10:56.922 --> 00:11:00.893
In a chapter titled "No More
Pre-Caressing Agreements,"

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:04.496
Cosby describes how silly it is
that men need to get permission

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:07.400
to have sexual relations
with women they find attractive.

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:09.735
I mean, say what you will about
Bill Cosby.

00:11:09.768 --> 00:11:12.037
Guy stayed on brand
for decades.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.239
The guy operated on
Cromag law.

00:11:14.272 --> 00:11:15.641
Yeah. Cave man law.

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:17.276
law.

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:20.312
Flip them over to the dome
and drag them by their feet

00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:22.648 line:92%
so you don't mess up the

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.116
and get the hair
dragging with the

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:27.052
I mean, it's fucking crazy.

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.387
They gotta keep him
by himself in prison.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.655
Yeah.
Because everyone ...

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:30.989
I bet there's a lot of people
that are like-

00:11:31.022 --> 00:11:32.257
Because they'll fuck anybody.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.593
Yeah. They're like,
"I wanna fuck Dr. Huxtable."

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:36.428
But he probably wants to be
around people

00:11:36.461 --> 00:11:39.031
so he can tell his stories
and brag and ...

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.100
"I was into I Spy."

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:43.368
And they're like, "Yeah, we saw
it. It's an Owen Wilson movie."

00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:45.437
"No, it was a Robert Cope"

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.739
Dammit. I wonder if-

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:48.774
Now only one of my eyes can spy.

00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:52.778
Yeah. I wonder if he pitched
a stand up night to the guys

00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:54.079
just to try to get his set in?

00:11:54.112 --> 00:11:55.280
Oh, I bet he did.

00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:57.382
He goes, "Maybe for moral
I can go up there

00:11:57.415 --> 00:11:59.351
and tell some jokes about
how I took the ladies

00:11:59.384 --> 00:12:01.453 line:92%
and I put them to the sleep

00:12:03.088 --> 00:12:04.923
You can only do material
about your conviction.

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:07.426
Yeah. It's like fucking
talent night in the ...

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:09.995
Now you do 20 minutes
about that murder.

00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:11.797
Richie over here is an arson.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.633
He's gonna tell everybody
how he feels

00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:16.902
when he sees the buildings
burning and the crackling

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:18.470
and the 

00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:20.506
Rashad over here did a drive by

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:22.775
and got the driving
and the shooting and the bipping

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.877
and the booping
and the bopping.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.545
Him just describing,
he becomes ...

00:12:26.578 --> 00:12:29.014
You know how they always find
some old wise guy in prison

00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:31.483
to help them with
their fucking ... to get ...

00:12:31.516 --> 00:12:32.684
Yeah, to become a Muslim.

00:12:32.717 --> 00:12:33.919
Yeah, but to make bail.

00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:36.155
We were talking about that
with Jimmy Martinez.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:37.456
I wonder if Cosby
becomes their ...

00:12:37.489 --> 00:12:38.690
Because he's a doctor.

00:12:38.723 --> 00:12:40.559
They're like, "Hey doctor,
can you help me out?"

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:41.860
"What did you do?"

00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:43.962
And trying to argue him
in front of the parole board.

00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:45.197
Because he's a stand up.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.431
You know he misses
doing stand up.

00:12:46.464 --> 00:12:51.036
He must want a gaggle of people
around him all day long.

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:53.139
I don't think he's
sitting alone in there.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.408
He's trying
to volunteer somehow.

00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:57.976
Yeah, I'd probably
try to pony up to him.

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:59.278
I'll do the laundry.

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.113
You would?
You'd protect the Cos?

00:13:01.146 --> 00:13:02.681
And if I was like ...
If I was in there-

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:04.183
Oh, pony up on him.
Does that mean attack him?

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.551
No, no, no.
I'd try to be friends with him

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:07.052
because you know there'd
probably be some good security.

00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:08.253
This guy with his gen pop.

00:13:08.286 --> 00:13:09.555
I don't know what he's
saying half the time.

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:11.156
Listen Pete, some of us
got some dark pasts.

00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:13.659
I speak English. Have you been
to prison? You've never been-

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:15.761
Some of us eat Wawa and some
of us were in some gangs

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.563
we're not too proud of,
but you do it to survive.

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:18.831
You think the ultimate
punishment

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:21.533
is he has to eat off
brand pudding in prison now?

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:22.768
No, they just make it. They go-

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:25.070
It's viscus in a way
I don't care for.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:28.073
Can they please
be given to me sealed?

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:29.274
I don't trust you.

00:13:29.307 --> 00:13:31.777
But that is a hard thing
when you've been eating

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.445
from your personal chef
for 50 years.

00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:34.713
Yeah.

00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:38.984
That's gotta be part of what is
unpleasant about his situation.

00:13:39.017 --> 00:13:40.352
And the beds ... The beds ...

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:42.621
He's been wealthy
for over four decades,

00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:45.424
so his beds are this
thick in paddings,

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.527
and now he's just on
that slime ... that thin slab.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.929
If you think Wawa is a store,
you won't mind prison.

00:13:50.962 --> 00:13:52.598
Yeah. That's actually been
our motto our whole-

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:53.966
But if you've been having
a personal chef,

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.701
like an omelet chef
every morning ...

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:59.137
If you think Wawa's a store,
you're just correct.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.808
And you just have traveled
this great land.

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.943
If prison food
is like Wawa food,

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:06.345
well then sign this guy up.

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.813
I'm gonna shoot this guy
in the head.

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.047
Yeah.
Right now.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.549
What do you wanna do?
Off DJ Lou?

00:14:10.582 --> 00:14:12.284
Yeah, I'll do it on camera.

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:13.552
I'll do it on camera.

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:14.786
You telling me I get
Wawa everyday

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:16.522
and I get to talk to the Cos?

00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:19.859
I get to write my slam poems?

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:22.427
But you know somewhere
there's a lab for all

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.463
the Wa food,
and there's a moment

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.465
where one of the heads
of the company

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:27.766
is trying the new hamburger.

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:29.034
Yeah.

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:31.136
[inaudible 00:14:28] like,
"This is fantastic."

00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:33.906
You know there's a massive
process for every product there.

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:35.173
Yeah. Oh absolutely.

00:14:35.206 --> 00:14:36.942
And they do little
test tube drops.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:39.211
Now that tastes like ranch.
