00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.570
David, what did you write it down?

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.520
&gt;&gt; So I said that the four fundamental
things a Watson must be able to do to

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.470
play Jeopardy are first read the clue,
then search through it's knowledge base,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.490
then actually decide on it's answer, and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.290
then phrase it's answer in
the form of a question.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.530
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.660
And during this course, we'll
discuss each part of David's answer.
