00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.255
PATRICK CLARY: All righty,
welcome, everybody.

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:11.330
Woo, that's right.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.570
We're here to talk today
about accessibility, great.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.810
So my name's Patrick Clary,
I'm a product manager

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
on accessibility here at Google,
and I'll be kicking things off.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.230
We also have a great group of
presenters from different areas

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.450
across Google with
me here today.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.270
And there's a few things
that I want you to take away

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.730
with you as you leave today.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.810
The first one is why
designing for accessibility

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.390
is really so important
and benefits our users.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.850
And this isn't just
users with the disability

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.070
or an accessibility
need, but I want

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.892
to get across that this
actually helps all users.

00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:52.350
The second thing
you'll learn about

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.330
is accessibility on Android.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.610
You'll hear about what's
coming in Android O,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.720
and you'll see some awesome
new demos of these things.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.080
And then third is tips on
user research for users

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.270
who have an accessibility need.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.696
You'll hear about this, and
you'll also see an inside look

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:11.070
with a couple of examples on
things we've done at Google,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.602
how we perform research on a
couple of different products.

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:14.310
So very exciting.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.850
So first, why accessibility?

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.640
So accessibility
is something that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.230
is near and dear to my heart.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.890
But I want to give you a few
reasons why it's important--

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.390
and I'm speaking
to the developers--

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.330
why it's important to
developers to consider, as well.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.520
So here's a metric that I
actually find very compelling.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.860
One in five people will have a
disability in their lifetime.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.610
This is just a
staggering number.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.820
So addressing accessibility
can have a direct benefit

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.810
on these users.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.660
It's a huge benefit.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.240
It's actually a life
changing benefit.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.250
So for these users, it
actually means the difference

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.500
with connecting to
friends, family,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.900
it's really taking
advantage of the technology

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.315
that mainstream users
really use and enjoy.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.810
The second, as I mentioned,
is that designing

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.297
for accessibility really
benefits all users.

00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:14.880
And let me give you
a couple examples.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.060
So first, think about
designing a product that's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.190
meant for a blind or
a low vision user.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.590
So when you're doing
this, you actually

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.140
help users that might just
have their eyes occupied.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.079
So perhaps they're
driving, they're

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.370
looking at another screen,
they're not looking directly

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.050
at their Android device.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.140
Another example is
designing for a user that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.470
might have a motor impairment.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.410
So an example would be a tremor.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.854
This is an impairment
that affects

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:40.020
their use of a touch screen.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.020
It makes it difficult for
them to use a touchscreen.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.810
So designing effectively
for these users

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.057
actually benefits mainstream
users who otherwise,

00:02:49.057 --> 00:02:50.640
they just can't use
their touchscreen.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.100
Maybe they're holding groceries,
maybe they're cooking,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.760
but they can't use their
touchscreen effectively.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.450
And when you think
about it this way,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.430
designing for
accessibility is really

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.330
about designing for the widest
possible range of abilities

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.360
within the widest possible
range of situations.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.130
It's not really about
designing for disabilities,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.150
it's about designing
for all users.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.260
So where does Android fit in?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.700
So in Android, we have a series
of settings, APIs, and services

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.320
for accessibility.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.180
So settings, these
really allow users

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.800
to customize how their device
looks and feels, right?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.100
APIs allow developers
to build out their apps

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.100
in ways that meet the needs of
users who have accessibility

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.220
needs, and also allows us to
build accessibility services.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.540
So an accessibility service
is a long running, privileged

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.780
program that runs on your
device that either changes

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.290
the way users consume the
content of your device,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.380
or it changes the way they
interact with your device.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.400
And we have a few here.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.770
These are four that
Google has developed.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.610
TalkBack, BrailleBack, Switch
Access, and Voice Access.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.230
So TalkBack and
BrailleBack, these

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.090
are services designed
for users who

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.900
are blind or have low vision.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.930
TalkBack is our screen reader.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.030
What this allows users
to do is basically

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.110
interpret the content of their
device through an audio stream.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.100
So users will listen to what's
on their device using TalkBack.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.280
BrailleBack is similar, but
instead of an audio stream,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.430
the content goes to a
refreshable braille display.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.860
This is a little
handheld braille device

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.930
where a user can scan
their fingers across it

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.570
and interpret the
content on the screen.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.730
We also have Switch
Access and Voice Access.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.250
These are two services
that are targeted to users

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.210
with motor impairments.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.940
So for example, as I mentioned,
users that have a tremor.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.440
These are users that typically
can't use a touch screen.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.130
So with Switch Access
and Voice Access,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.480
we actually provide
full Android control

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.910
without ever having
to touch the screen.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.820
So with Switch Access,
users typically

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.707
use an adaptive switch device.

00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:58.540
You'll see an example
of one of these later,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.007
but this is a physical
hardware switch

00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:03.340
that a user might have mounted
in front of them, mounted

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.650
to a wheelchair, and
they'll tap on the switch

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.440
to linearly scroll through
things on their device.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.260
Voice Access actually
allows users to control

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.130
their device purely by voice.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.220
So you'll issue
voice commands that

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.690
correspond to touch controls.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.530
These are things like
scroll up, scroll down,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.350
tap, Gmail, go home, et cetera.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.170
So that's what we
have on Android.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.650
For a deeper look into the
upcoming version of Android,

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.240
I'll hand it off
to Maya and Victor.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:44.850
VICTOR TSARAN: Hello.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.210
Thank you, Patrick.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.740
My name is Victor
Tsaran, and I'm

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.020
a technical program
manager on the Android

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.370
accessibility services team.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.520
For Android O, our
major focus was

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.740
to increase
productivity for users

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.420
of accessibility services.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.700
In particular, we looked
at users who are blind

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.540
and vision impaired, and
use TalkBack screen reader,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.730
we're introducing
accessibility APIs

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.090
to help developers who
develop accessibility services

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.800
for people with
physical disabilities.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.015
Once such service you
guys already heard about

00:06:18.015 --> 00:06:20.210
is called Switch Access.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.510
Last but not least, we're
introducing a new accessibility

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.900
service which will
help people with print

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.770
and learning disabilities to
read information on the screen.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.057
But let me start with new
features for talk back.

00:06:35.057 --> 00:06:36.890
The first feature I
would like to talk about

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.530
is called accessibility volume.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.460
Behind the fancy words
is an ability for someone

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.580
who is blind or vision
impaired or specifically

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.970
uses TalkBack screen reader
to adjust the volume of speech

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.210
independently from the
volume of media, for example,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.650
when watching a YouTube
video or listening to music.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.970
We're doing this by introducing
a new audio stream in O

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.090
we call the
accessibility stream.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.680
As a developer of an
accessibility service,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.290
what that means
to you is that you

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.880
will have to request
this feature when writing

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.110
your accessibility service.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.300
Otherwise it is not
available to you.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.455
So let me show you how
this feature works.

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:25.830

11k views.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.860
VICTOR TSARAN: So here's
a typical situation.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.379
I'm trying to
listen to talk back,

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:02.920
and this thing is
talking back at me.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.382
Oh my God, I can't
hear anything.

00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:05.590
AUTOMATED VOICE: More button.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.215
VICTOR TSARAN: What
I can do right now,

00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:09.340
I can completely shut off
the volume of the video--

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.256
AUTOMATED VOICE: Like
this video, more button.

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:13.304
VICTOR TSARAN: And I can
still hear it talk back.

00:08:13.304 --> 00:08:14.470
AUTOMATED VOICE: Like this--

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.090

Up next, autoplay.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.638
VICTOR TSARAN: So this is
essentially how this works.

00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:24.700
So TalkBack user is now able to
adjust the volume of the speech

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.630
independently from
the media volume.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.947
AUTOMATED VOICE: 100-- 035 of--

00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:30.030

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.263
AUTOMATED VOICE: 100 expand.

00:08:31.263 --> 00:08:33.361
YOUTUBE VIDEO: Chrome 59
beta is now available--

00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:35.110
VICTOR TSARAN:
Incidentally, you will also

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.799
notice that there is now a new
accessibility volume slider

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:39.940
at the top of the screen.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.130
So that, again, allows you,
if you're a visual user,

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.360
you can adjust this slider
as well from the volume tray.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.730
AUTOMATED VOICE: Rewind.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.100
Pause video.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.071
Play video.

00:08:53.071 --> 00:08:54.904
Home screen one of two.

00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:56.320
VICTOR TSARAN: So
the next feature

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.490
I would like to
talk about has to do

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.640
with new gestures for TalkBack.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.830
We many of the new
Android devices

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.700
use a fingerprint sensor at
the back of their device.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.410
So we decided, why not
utilize the fingerprint sensor

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.250
for additional gestures to
allow TalkBack users activate

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.550
some of the favorites
of their features?

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.010
So we are introducing an ability
for accessibility service

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.020
such as TalkBack to
utilize fingerprint sensor.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.700
The gestures
available to the user

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.980
are swiping left,
right, up, or down.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.980
These gestures are
assignable, so the user

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.170
can decide what
TalkBack features

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.170
each gesture will launch.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.510
Again, as a developer of
an accessibility service,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.810
you will have to request
a special flag in order

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.710
to be able to take advantage
of fingerprint gestures.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.160
Fingerprint gestures
work only on O devices.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.870
I just wanted to point that out.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:03.630
And let me show
you how this works.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.020
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Device unlocked.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.840
3:10 PM.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.300
Home screen one of--

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.490
inbox, Chrome, camera.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.990
VICTOR TSARAN: So I'm going to
attempt something very brave.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.800
I'll take a selfie.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.150
AUTOMATED VOICE: Camera.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.780
Camera.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.988
VICTOR TSARAN: And I'll be
using fingerprint gestures

00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:23.550
to do that.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.930
AUTOMATED VOICE: Photo gallery.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.130
Shutter.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.940
Switch to front camera.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.960
Switch to back camera.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.230
One face, right,
with 50% of screen.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.280
Very close.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.420
Zero faces.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.400
Shutter.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.830
Photo taken.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.250
Photo gallery.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.640
One face, center,
with 50% of screen.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.202
Very close.

00:10:49.202 --> 00:10:52.108
Home screen one of two.

00:10:52.108 --> 00:10:53.566
VICTOR TSARAN:
Thank you very much.

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:56.070
These are the
fingerprint gestures

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.340
on Android O for accessibility.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.170
The next feature I
would like to talk about

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.690
is multi-lingual support.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.660
One of the things we
realized since Android

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.210
has been used so much
outside of the US,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.190
we badly need to support
international users.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.150
And in O, we're introducing
an ability for the Google text

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.970
to speech engine to
automatically recognize

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.020
languages that are appearing
on the screen and switch

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.642
text to speech to speak in
that particular language.

00:11:26.642 --> 00:11:28.100
If you're a developer
and you would

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:34.500
like to trigger language
automatic switching,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.050
you have to wrap your
strings in locale spans

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.090
to trigger that change.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.530
But before you get
excited, let me

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.460
show how actually the language
switching feature works.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.854
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Device unlocked.

00:11:46.854 --> 00:11:51.420
3:11-- home, overview, overview.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.070
Home, home.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.620
Home screen-- inbox,
messages-- inbox.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.880
Inbox.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.700
Remember-- subject,
beautiful day.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.270
Remember to.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.090
From Kara-- to me.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.040
May 11th, more menu.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.550
Hi there.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.430
Come-- hi there.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.910
VICTOR TSARAN: OK, so
my lovely wife likes

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.940
to pull little jokes at me.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.070
Well, in this particular
case, this is not a joke.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.070
She sent me a message
a few days ago

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.430
try to invite me for dinner.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.870
And she does a lot
of things in style.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.960
So in this particular
case is no exception.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.420
So she decided to send me a
message in four languages.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.310
Because, you know,
we're so cool, right?

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.326
So let's see how TalkBack deals
with this particular situation.

00:12:38.326 --> 00:12:39.450
AUTOMATED VOICE: More menu.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.470
Hi there.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.670
Comment lost-- hi there.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.400
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.450
Let's have dinner tonight.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.130
VICTOR TSARAN: OK.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:06.807
Yeah.

00:13:06.807 --> 00:13:13.200
[APPLAUSE] Thank you.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.700
So luckily, both of us can
speak all those languages,

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.810
so I was able to
understand what she said.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.000
So the languages were French,
Polish, Ukrainian, and Chinese,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.927
just for the information.

00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:26.760
And the last feature
we'd like to talk about

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.030
is the new
accessibility shortcut.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.450
For quite a bit of time, users
have been asking us for ability

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.880
to turn off their
favorite accessibility

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.730
service regardless of
which screen they're on.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.610
So they wanted a shortcut
key that they can press

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.100
and the search service
will toggle on and off.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.780
For example, if a
blind person walked

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.720
into the store that
sold Android phones,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.250
they wanted to be able to launch
TalkBack and start exploring

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.070
the phone to decide
whether this is something

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.810
they wanted to purchase or not.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.470
Well, in O we're introducing
this accessibility shortcut.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.900
By default it's configured
to launch TalkBack.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.720
However, it can be
reconfigured to launch

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.810
any of the available
accessibility services

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.680
on your device.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.030
I want to point out that
this works on any screen

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.730
even after you access
the Setup Wizard.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.830
So once the shortcut
is configured,

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.220
it will be available to
the user at all times.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.200
As a developer of an
accessibility service,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.680
you will have to request
this feature at runtime

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.180
when your service runs.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.940
Otherwise it is not
available to you.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.630
So it's only available to
accessibility services.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.240
And as you can guess, the demo
is going to be pretty simple.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.900
So I'll show how this works.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.139
AUTOMATED VOICE: Home.

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:43.680
VICTOR TSARAN: All
I have to do right

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.150
now is press two volume
keys at the same time.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.820
And accessibility
service is off.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.231
If I press them again,

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.480
AUTOMATED VOICE: Talk back on.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.436
Inbox.

00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:01.477
VICTOR TSARAN: That's it.

00:15:01.477 --> 00:15:04.985
And that's how the
accessibility shortcut works.

00:15:04.985 --> 00:15:11.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.750
So as you can imagine, I
just scratched the surface.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.930
There's much more
coming up, but I

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.080
would like Maya to talk about
these other exciting services

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.160
and APIs.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.910
Thank you.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.243
MAYA BEN ARI: Thank you, Victor.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.960
Thank you, Victor,
for the lovely demos.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.080
My name is Maya Ben Ari, I'm
a product manager on Android

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.180
accessibility.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.400
The next set of feature
we're going to talk about

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.210
are new APIs to framework
to support new accessibility

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.000
functionality.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.610
We're adding
continuous gesture API.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.050
In Android Nougat,
we added an API

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:59.040
to allow performing gestures
on behalf of the user.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.050
In Android O, we are extending
this API to make it easier

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.960
to perform continuous gestures.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.040
What does it mean?

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.440
Is that, for example,
it will be easier

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.180
for users using a wheelchair
mouse or a hat tracker

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:21.390
to perform gestures such as
drag and drop, text selection,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:25.015
answering phone calls, and
zooming in and out of maps.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.890
The next feature I'm
very excited about,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.020
it's called the accessibility
button in the navigation bar.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:40.390
What we added here is a
new accessibility button

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.550
to the right of
the navigation bar

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.300
to quickly invoke context
dependent accessibility

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.470
features.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.200
Let's give an example.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.270
Right now we had magnification.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.440
So a user using
magnification can triple

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.300
tap to magnify the screen.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.620
However, some users find
it challenging to perform

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.130
the triple tap gestures.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.440
In Android O, we are
adding an alternative

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.599
to invoke magnification.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.145
So let me show you
how this works.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.829
So I have the
accessibility button

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.180
the bottom right of the screen.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.740
I can simply tap the button.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.700
And if I tap anywhere
on this screen,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.950
I will magnify the content.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.860
Now I can move this
around using two fingers,

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.940
and if I want to demagnify
it, I will just press

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.790
the accessibility button again.

00:17:44.598 --> 00:17:48.350
Back to the slides.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.240
Now, this is
optionally supported

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.920
by developer for devices with
software-rendered navigation

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.740
bar.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.040
At the button will
be shown there

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.530
only if there is an
accessibility service

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.760
or feature that supports
it and is turned on.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.650
The next set of feature are for
people with print disabilities.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.090
Print disabilities
are people who have

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.370
difficulty of reading text.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.700
Those include people with
dyslexia, far sighted,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.450
low vision, illiterate,
or even people who just

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.790
want to learn a new language.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.110
We recently launched a service
called Select to Speak.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:39.260
Select to Speak is
part of TalkBack 5.2.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.550
And what the service does is it
vocalized content on the screen

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.580
by allowing users to
select elements to read.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.257
Now, this service is available
from lollipop MR1 and up.

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:58.790
Now, this is an example of
how Select to Speak works.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.430
You can see a floating
action button.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.710
Then the user can
either tap an element

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.620
or marquee select
elements to read,

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.040
and the content will
be read out loud.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.830
In Android O, we're adding
additional functionality

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.850
for Select to Speak,
including reading

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.810
the whole page,
advanced controller

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.220
to move backward and
next, or adjust the speed.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.830
We add also word
level highlighting,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.330
and we integrated this
service into the setup wizard.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.255
Now let me show
you how it works.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.710
So I have here the
accessibility button,

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.070
and if I long press on
the accessibility button,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.400
I can show that also
I have a service which

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.220
uses this button
called Select to Speak.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.070
I will select that one.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.400
And if I will tap
the button again,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.620
then I will be shown
a controller bar.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:05.390
At this point I can drag and
drop or move the controller bar

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.060
on the screen.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.270
Now I can either support the
functionality I already have--

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.340
for example, I can marquee
select, or tap an element--

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.170
AUTOMATED VOICE: Maps, clock.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.540
MAYA BEN ARI: And it
will be read out loud.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.460
Now what I can also have
is continuous reading.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.300
AUTOMATED VOICE: 69
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.680
Wednesday, may 17.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.730
Maps, clock, Play
Store, Chrome, Drive.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.980
MAYA BEN ARI: Close
down that one.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:41.360
Now, we also have
this Select to Speak,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.870
it can read the
whole page, and it

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.180
can read the whole sentences.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.360
And I can go backward and
forward with the sentences,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.810
and also increase and
decrease the speed

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.150
and by pressing the
plus and minus button.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.515
Let me show you how it works.

00:20:58.022 --> 00:20:59.230
AUTOMATED VOICE: Navigate up.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.180
Select to Speak.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.390
Settings.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.780
When Select to Speak is on,
you can tap specific items

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.056
on your screen to-- first
tap the-- then you can--

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.430
(SPEEDING UP) tap a specific
item, like text or an image.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.390
Drag your finger
across the screen

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.431
to select multiple items.

00:21:10.431 --> 00:21:11.250
Items.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.390
Tap the Play button
to hear everything.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.390
MAYA BEN ARI: Thank you.

00:21:19.872 --> 00:21:23.750
And this is Select to Speak,
available in Android O

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:29.210
and with TalkBack 5.2.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.510
The next section
is about testing.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.740
We'd like to make Android
more accessible for everyone,

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.030
and developer are a crucial
part of this mission.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.740
You can develop
better experience

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.200
for people with
disability, but a lot of it

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.340
has to do with how you test
your app for accessibility.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.310
In the next section,
I'm going to talk

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:56.720
about manual and automated
testing for accessibility.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.805
Now let's start
with manual testing.

00:22:01.472 --> 00:22:02.930
The first thing
that you want to do

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.060
is you want to get
familiar [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.190
yourself, and understand how
the experience work with Android

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.160
accessibility services,
specifically with TalkBack

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.910
and Switch Access.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:20.090
So download TalkBack, turn
it on, and cover your eyes,

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.200
and try to go through the
experience in your app.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.840
You'd like to notice whether
your app is representing

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.720
correctly the
content for TalkBack.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.170
For example, maybe you
have unlabeled bottles,

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.100
or maybe you're missing
context description,

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.900
or maybe you have controls
which are hard to interact with.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.180
Pay special attention
for issues that

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.840
may impact users
efficiently while you

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.810
are performing common flows.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:57.880
Now, if it works
well with TalkBack,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.135
it will also likely work well
with BrailleBack and Select

00:23:02.135 --> 00:23:03.140
to Speak.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.240
Because what you're
doing is you are actually

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.850
testing your output.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.240
You are testing whether you
are representing correctly

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.325
your content to the
accessibility services.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.030
The next thing that
you want to test

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:22.380
is you want to test
with Switch Access.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.930
As Patrick mentioned,
Switch Access

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.650
is a service targeted for
user with motor impairment who

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.800
has difficulty interacting
with their device.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.830
In that case, the user
connects something which

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.460
is called an adaptive switch.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.790
This is an example of
an adaptive switch.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.240
Now, the adaptive switch
can contain two buttons,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.980
less, or more.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.200
And in that case,
the user can map

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.800
one button for a next
operation, and one for an enter.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.610
Now, if you don't have
an adaptive switch

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.950
you can just connect
an external keyboard

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:01.350
and map your keyboard buttons
to specific activities

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.960
in Switch Access.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.760
Now, after you do that, you
want to go through common flow,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.030
and you want to note whether
Switch Access interacts

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.570
correctly with your app UI.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.750
Now, if it works well
with Switch Access,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:22.320
it will also likely work
well with Voice Access.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.270
Because what you're
doing at that point,

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.540
you are testing your app input.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.700
With Switch Access
and TalkBack, you

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:36.310
are testing both your
app output and input.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.210
Now, testing with Switch
Access and TalkBack

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.240
is the best way for you to
understand the experience

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.460
that you are providing for
users with different needs.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.900
But this is not
all, because there

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.910
are multiple other features
available on the platform,

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.490
including magnification,
enlarged text.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.510
To facilitate the
accessibility testing,

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.085
we also provide a tool which is
called Accessibility Scanner.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.950
Accessibility Scanner
is a standalone app

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.700
which you can download
free from the Play Store.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:19.760
And the app is targeted for
app developer and QA testers,

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.670
and it suggests ways
for you to improve

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.750
the accessibility of your app.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.210
How you can use it?

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.840
Just download it, turn
it on, and then you

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.670
will see a floating action
button on your screen.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.760
Bring the UI you are
interested into the foreground,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.000
press the button, and
then Accessibility Scanner

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.090
will analyze the UI and will
show some suggestion of how

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.830
to improve your accessibility.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.290
And in this example,
it's shown examples

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.880
for improving your
text contrasts.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.560
We shipped this app
in March last year,

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:07.100
and we're very happy to
announce that in the last year,

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.030
user used Accessibility
Scanner to find over

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.460
1 million opportunities
for improving their app

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.600
accessibility.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.390
Definitely check it out and
download Accessibility Scanner

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.400
from the Play Store.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.200
And a bit about
automated testing.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.510
We also created accessibility
testing framework

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.720
to allow you to perform
automated testing.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.140
Accessibility Testing Framework
is an open source library

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.860
that provides that
provides runtime evaluation

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.240
on real Android UI post tracks.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.390
We integrated this
testing framework

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.090
into two common test
frameworks called

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.180
Robolectric and Espresso.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.500
If you're already using
those testing framework,

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.520
you can simply turn
on accessibility test

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.280
functionality within
those framework,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.270
and then you might see
some of your test start

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:17.900
failing because they could
have an improved accessibility.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.790
Lastly, we launch a new
section about accessibility

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.880
on developer.android.com,
and this

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.020
can help you guide to better
understand how to implement

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.320
accessibility in your app.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.940
Specifically, we have a
page about testing your app

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.400
accessibility.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.930
In general, we recommend a
balance between manual testing

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.500
and automated testing for
making your app accessible.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.500
With this page,
the page summarize

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.140
how you can develop
a holistic test

00:27:54.140 --> 00:28:00.650
strategy that improve both
manual and automated testing.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.970
But with all this testing,
there is no better way

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.580
than interacting
with actual user

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.580
and conducting user research.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.760
And for that, Astrid
and Melissa are going

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.970
to tell you all about that.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.060
ASTRID WEBER: Thank you, Maya.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.060
I'm Astrid Weber, I work
on user experience research

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.229
for accessibility
engineering at Google.

00:28:29.229 --> 00:28:31.020
MELISSA BERNHART: And
I'm Melissa Bardhart,

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.100
and I'm a UX
researcher on Android.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.300
ASTRID WEBER: So what
is actually UX research,

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.340
and why do we need it?

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.760
Imagine you have a
dream of opening a bar.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.690
I mean, how many of
us haven't had it

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.110
at some point in our lives?

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.690
You have these cool design ideas
for the interior of your bar,

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:56.120
you know exactly what you want
to serve on your drinking menu,

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.630
and you really know that the
music you're going to play

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.760
is what you basically
have at home,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.545
and you play yourself the most.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.220
Basically, while you're
building your bar,

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.420
you're imagining how perfect a
bar could be if it would just

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.180
be the perfect place
for someone with exactly

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.700
the same tastes like yourself.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.800
Basically, your users, they
are just like yourself, right?

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.300
Chances are, unfortunately,
that your bar might be empty,

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.290
and your business idea might
be failing like over 50%

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:38.660
of all bars and restaurants are
failing within the first year

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.970
of their existence.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.700
And I'm pretty sure that
all the owners of these bars

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.290
and restaurants really wanted
to create a good experience,

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.750
and really made
choices that they

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.730
would have taken themselves.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.530
And this brings us up to the
importance of user experience

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.700
research and design, for
restaurants and bars,

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.340
but also for
technology development.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.870
Because unfortunately, the
failure rate among startups

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.350
is at 90%, which is much
higher than actually

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.450
the one around restaurants.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:17.100
At the same time, research
shows that if you are testing

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.480
your own assumptions and your
user needs often and early,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.420
your chances
increase so much more

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:31.020
that you will end up with a well
rated app and satisfied users.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.110
Which brings us very
close to the definition

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.430
of actual and objective
UX research, which really

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.460
is all about changing your
own perspective to that

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.670
of your users to
understand their needs,

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.930
including all the
accessibility needs.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.690
User research focuses on
understanding user behaviors,

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.230
needs, and motivations for
various research techniques.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.130
It is the process of
understanding the impact

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:03.180
of design on an audience.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.190
Now that we have a
common understanding

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:10.710
of the concept of UX research,
what does it actually entail?

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.070
UX research is a set
of research methods

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.520
that can help you during the
whole process of your product

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.050
development cycle.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.250
UX research methods, such as
field studies, interviews,

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.830
or competitive
analysis, are very well

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:29.580
suited in the beginning of
your product development work,

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.970
because they are
especially useful in order

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.120
to understand how
technology usage works,

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.600
and how new innovative
fields work.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.400
Once you have
decided what to build

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.430
and you have a first
prototype, research methods

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:49.920
such as usability studies,
participatory design exercises,

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.380
or remote research
are actually really

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.810
useful for you to
understand what works

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.810
and what doesn't work in
the hands of your users.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.050
And lastly, once your product
is out there in the market,

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.660
you really want to understand
how it's doing, right?

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:17.850
Research methods such as
log analysis, diary studies,

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.770
as well as remote
testing, really

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.890
help you at that stage of
your product development

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.590
to understand how the app
is doing in the market,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.880
and if people really like it.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.000
And with that, I hand
it over to Melissa,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.280
has a very concrete
example for you

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.314
from our recent accessibility
Android development on O.

00:32:36.314 --> 00:32:37.480
MELISSA BARNHART: All right.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.050
Thank you, Astrid.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.900
So today I'd like to
show you exactly how

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.820
accessibility
research has informed

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.890
the design process for Android.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.020
Let's take the
example of settings.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.310
We want all users to be able
to easily access and understand

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.060
settings that are
relevant to them,

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.050
including users with
accessibility needs.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.840
Here we have a screenshot of
the accessibility settings

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.710
page for Android N. When
planning for Android O,

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.440
we had some assumptions
about this page.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.290
Firstly, we felt that it
was a bit unorganized,

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.650
making it difficult for
users to find what they need.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.720
Secondly, we questioned
whether or not

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.200
categories like
services and system

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.560
had any real meaning to users.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.160
So we turned to research
to check our assumptions

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.250
and make more informed
design decisions.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.340
We used two research
methods, usability studies

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.330
and intercepts.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.790
And as Astrid just
mentioned, these methods

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:40.520
are well suited for the
design develop stage.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.710
So we started with
usability studies.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.620
In these studies, we invited
people with visual impairments

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.320
to our offices and
prompted them to interact

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.230
with the accessibility
settings page you just saw.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.300
Now, we immediately
observed some issues.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.850
Specifically, the
participants could not always

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.070
find the settings we
asked them to find.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.290
And even when they did,
they weren't always sure

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.970
what those settings would do.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.410
Now, our approach
to this research

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.600
was iterative, so we'd
learn things in one study,

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.679
adjust the design, and then
retest the adjusted design

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.030
in the next study.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:16.000
But we wanted to hear from a
wider, more diverse audience.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.800
So we went to a conference.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.010
In January, we attended the
Assistive Technology Industry

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.920
Association Conference
in Orlando, Florida.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.190
With just a clipboard,
pen, paper, and phone,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.199
we approached
conference attendees

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:33.070
and asked them for 10 minutes of
feedback on our latest designs.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.550
These intercepts allowed us
to gather a lot of feedback

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.750
in a relatively
short time frame.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.440
In just two days, we
talked to 15 people

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.949
with visual, cognitive, and
motor impairments, as well as

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.620
AT professionals and educators.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.020
As a result of this
research, we verified

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:55.150
a lot of our assumptions
and fine tuned our designs.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.120
And here's a sneak peek at
the accessibility settings

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.980
page for Android
O. On the right,

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.130
you'll see that we're
introducing categorizations

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.330
by utility.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:07.510
So instead of categories
like services and system,

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.290
you'll find categories like
screen readers, and display.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:15.520
Also we've added colorful icons
to make Android services pop.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.120
Lastly, below each setting we've
included a short description

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.280
to explain what
the setting does.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.410
Now accessibility
research helped

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:28.820
guide this design approach,
and it can help you, too.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.090
So if you want to build
products for the widest possible

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.660
audience and genuinely
improve people's lives,

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.090
consider incorporating
accessibility research

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.800
into your current process.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.710
I promise you don't need fancy
equipment or a big budget

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.120
to get started.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.970
Think creatively about
how you can talk to users

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.770
with accessibility needs.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.500
Maybe you attend a
conference like we did,

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.280
maybe reach out to a local
organization or university

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.550
or maybe you have a friend
with dyslexia or colorblindness

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:00.050
who would be willing
to try your app

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:02.400
and give you 15
minutes of feedback.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.420
Try to include one person
with accessibility needs

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.300
in your next research study
and see what you learn.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.300
The difference between zero
and even a little bit of data

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.117
is astounding.

00:36:13.117 --> 00:36:15.200
And with that, I will hand
it back over to Astrid.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.180
ASTRID WEBER: Thanks, Melissa.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.090
Those of you working on
consumer facing apps hopefully

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.130
already marked
your calendars now

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.190
to conduct some accessibility
research as soon as you're back

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.010
in the office.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.310
Those of you who work on
developer facing applications

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.820
might be wondering, but
what about my target group?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:45.440
Well, the good news is they can
also benefit from UX research.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.920
And we have an example of our
very own Accessibility Scanner

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.890
app about how the
UX research really

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.860
helped us to develop
a better application.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.760
We tested Accessibility Scanner
with designers, test engineers,

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.230
developers, and
product managers.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.600
We did the early
stage prototyping

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.910
with some paper marks.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.610
In addition to that, we
also tested the name itself.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.500
Yes, you heard correctly.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.040
Accessibility Scanner was
not born with that name.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.110
We had a long list of options.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.680
But rather just following our
own intuition or preference,

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.260
we asked our users
in interviews.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.690
Because we wanted to
understand which name would

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.790
be most memorable,
and what people

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:32.880
are associating with
each of the options.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.120
Thanks to UX
research, we also made

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.640
some visual and
interaction design changes

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.260
to the application.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.170
One of the visual
design changes entails

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.540
that we do not
use colors anymore

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.110
to distinguish the kind
of issues being detected.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.450
Having a diverse
sample of users really

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:54.260
helped us there, because
the colorblind participants

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.310
of our study clearly signal
to us that they felt left out

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.580
of the experience if you use
color because they could not

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.960
necessarily distinguish the
elements based on that factor.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.950
We also improved the overall
flow of the application

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:14.180
by making it easy to just click
on any element of detection

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.910
and then get a short
description of the issue.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:21.410
This way the application became
especially useful and usable

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:24.530
to those new to
accessibility testing.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.600
And on that note,
I will hand it back

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.210
to Patrick with
our final thoughts

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.980
and an outlook on what's next.

00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:38.430
PATRICK CLARY: All right.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.200
Thank you, Astrid.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.819
So I hope everyone's
inspired to go home, work,

00:38:44.819 --> 00:38:46.860
look at your own products,
look at your own apps,

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.810
think about accessibility,
the benefit that it

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.180
can have on these users.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.400
Along those lines, I
have a few challenges

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.980
to the developers
in the audience.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.750
So the first one is,
familiarize yourself

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:01.470
with accessibility services and
these APIs that were mentioned.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.260
So when you go home,
turn on TalkBack,

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.990
turn on Switch
Access, put yourself

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.760
in the shoes of these users
and run through your app,

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.990
see what things you uncover.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:16.480
The second is to download
Accessibility Scanner.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.890
Download it, it's very easy.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.830
You can get it, you
can test your app.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.420
Very easy to find
some low hanging

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.760
fruit, some quick and
easy ways to improve

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.740
the accessibility of your app.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.190
And finally, think about
performing user research

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.650
with users that have
an accessibility need.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.390
So find a family
member or friend,

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.150
someone in your community,
go to a conference,

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:38.370
sit with them as
they use your app,

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:42.605
and I bet you'll be surprised
with things you learn.

00:39:42.605 --> 00:39:44.480
We have a few other
really interesting things

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.922
happening at Google
I/O for accessibility.

00:39:46.922 --> 00:39:48.380
So we have a couple
other sessions.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.690
Designing for the
Next Billion Users,

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.990
and Pragmatic Accessibility
tomorrow on stage 5.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:57.050
We also have a sandbox
just back here.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.360
This is your chance
to come talk to us,

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.350
learn more about
accessibility, see these demos,

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:07.380
speak to a Google or one on
one and get more information.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.257
We also have on
Thursday at 6:30,

00:40:12.257 --> 00:40:14.090
we have the Google Play
awards, and there'll

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:17.540
be an awesome award for the
best accessibility experience.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.890
So I recommend you
check that out.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:22.310
