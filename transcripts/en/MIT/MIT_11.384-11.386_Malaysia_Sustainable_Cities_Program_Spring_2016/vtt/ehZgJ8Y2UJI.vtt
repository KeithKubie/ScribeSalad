00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.435
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.930
SORIYA YIN: Hello.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.570
My name is Soriya Yin.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.970
I am a visiting scholar in
MIT-UTM Sustainable Cities

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.560
Program.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.650
In this video, I will be
reviewing the Segget River

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.180
Restoration Project as a good
example of sustainable city

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.530
tourism development in Malaysia.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.240
For centuries, people
have lived along rivers.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.160
Rivers are a source of life.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.730
They provide water, food,
transportation, places

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.830
for recreation, and much more.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.590
For these reasons,
cities around the world

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.580
are connected to rivers.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.680
As more and more people seek
to live in cities, driving up

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.970
land prices, many
urban rivers have

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.920
been filled in to make space
for growing populations.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.410
Unfortunately, filling in rivers
can worsen flooding and water

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.010
pollution problems.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.450
Some countries regret having
filled in their rivers

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.550
and are trying to restore them.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.240
Malaysia is one such example.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.800
The Segget River flows
through the center

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.060
of Johor Bahru, the capital
of Jehovah State in Malaysia.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.860
The Segget River used to be the
primary waterway and a source

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.830
of life for many people.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.230
When Johor Bahru
was a small town,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.970
people sold their
products from their boats.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.440
For many, the Segget
River was a source

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.700
of their cultural identity.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
Johor Bahru has become
the second largest city

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.660
in Malaysia.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.050
It was also seriously polluted.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.100
Many people avoided
going near the river.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.070
Because of its
strong odor, tourists

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.590
had no interest in
coming to the city.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.720
They use it only as a
layover on their way

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.020
to Singh Kippur, Kuala
Lumpur, or Malacca.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.740
In 2005, the city
decided to cover up

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.530
the river to use it as a
sewage system and amend road.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.660
When the cover was
added, flooding wasn't.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.100
Now Johor Bahru wants to
become a world-class city.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.750
It seeks to expand tourism.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.860
To achieve this
goal, the city wants

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.490
to restore the Segget River.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.510
To do this, it will
take the cover off,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.610
build water treatment plants,
introduce flood mitigation

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.790
systems, and beautify
the river, making

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.210
it attractive for
recreation and business.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.520
Mr. Abd Halim, a project
management officer

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.260
from the Iskandar Regional
Development Authority,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.940
explained the rationale.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.540
ABD HALIM: We added the
[INAUDIBLE] Johor Bahru.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.200
So first what we call it
a [INAUDIBLE] syndrome,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.420
where there's no population,
declining businesses, then

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.914
no activities.

00:02:58.914 --> 00:03:03.220
The River Sungai Segget
is heavily polluted,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.050
and they say that Johor is
smelly because of untreated

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.230
[INAUDIBLE] of pollution.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.370
Again, no pollution, no
business and all that.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.790
So with that issue, or what we
call it [INAUDIBLE] syndrome,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.360
we initiated this Johor
Bahru transformation program,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.180
and then we seek government
funding, federal government

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.020
funding.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.060
This initiative
started 2010 in detail.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.070
We do all the design
calculation, design detailing.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.745
So [NON-ENGLISH] we successfully
secured government funding,

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:51.320
a ceiling cost of about 240
million for this project.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.300
SORIYA YIN: At first,
digging up the river

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.800
in the middle of the city
sounded like a crazy idea.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.620
The cost would be substantial,
and a lot of people

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.020
would be affected.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.470
My recent study
of Johor's effort

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.970
to promote sustainable
city tourism

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.760
found that the Segget River
Restoration Project is

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.770
a valuable and noteworthy idea.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.490
Mrs. Norbaizura
Binti, a city planner,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.130
explained how Johor
Bahru is seeking

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.810
to promote environmental
and cultural conservation,

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.670
foster economic development,
and ensure physical connectivity

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.860
and walkability.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.060
NORBAIZURA BINTI: So the lesson
learned, by covering the river,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.870
is only the upper-- the
short-term solution.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.080
For the long-term solution, this
is what we did on this side.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.710
We tried to settle the
environment issue, the flood

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.580
issue.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.540
We tried to make the river
as the heart of the city.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.780
To make a vibrant city,
we have to do that.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.820
There's a lot of history
for Johor Bahru's center,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.690
so it's so important for
[INAUDIBLE] sanitation.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.880
We want to increase the
economic value, the environment,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.020
and the identity of Johor Bahru.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.510
And now we are trying
to rebranding the image

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.970
and identity of Johor Bahru.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.770
We want the new brand for
Johor Bahru city center.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.380
So we benchmark [INAUDIBLE],
just [INAUDIBLE] like that.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.320
We want to promote Sungai Segget
as a new product in [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.920
center, the must-visit place.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.560
It's good for environment.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.260
It's good for the
image of the city.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.440
It's good for the
public, the tourists.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.050
If you can see the future
image for Sungai Segget,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.930
I think all the Johor
area will be part, yes.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.720
SORIYA YIN: The Segget River
Restoration Projects also

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.670
illustrate importance
of democratic governance

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.460
as a part of sustainable
city tourism development.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.880
Johor Bahru has been able
to make great strides

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.500
by consulting with stakeholders,
minimizing social impacts,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.740
providing fair compensation, and
building strong partnerships.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.090
Mr. Abd Halim explained how
democratic governance has been

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.030
used to win the public support.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.330
ABD HALIM: We do a lot of
engagement with stakeholders.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.910
We call it a focus
group discussion,

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.190
meetings and workshops
and one-to-one discussion.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.660
The first one, we started
with all the building owners,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.800
the big, big players like
[INAUDIBLE], City Square Public

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.400
Bank, and all the big, big
business owners in this area.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.230
So we want to know,
what is their acceptance

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.030
towards this project, including
what kind of environment

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.320
that they want to
see within this area?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.500
The first proposal
design for this area,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.440
we want to make it as
fully pedestrianized.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.970
There's no motor vehicle to
be at Jalan Wong Ah Fook.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.190
So we want to make
it pedestrianized.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.840
So after we engage with all the
stakeholders, they not agree.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.565
They say that the Jalan Wong
Ah Fook is a main thoroughfare

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:12.900
of Johor Bahru.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.170
There's no benefit
of doing this.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.730
So we come back to a combination
of river rejuvenation

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.700
and some sort of
public transport.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.390
SORIYA YIN: Though
his shop was badly

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.570
affected by the
construction, Mr. Chan Lim

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.901
was happy with the project.

00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:33.150
CHAN LIM: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.030
SORIYA YIN: Minimizing
social impact

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.010
is important for public
project management,

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.700
but having a long-term plan,
such as a city master plan,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.780
is a major asset
for the project.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.450
The plan provides
an overall framework

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.870
and attracts resources.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.340
Mr. [INAUDIBLE], a board member
of Johor Area Rehabilitation

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.190
Organization, a local
social service NGO,

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.085
has a great hope
for the city plan.

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:19.115
SORIYA YIN: This river
restoration Project

00:08:19.115 --> 00:08:22.240
in Johor Bahru
offers six lessons

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.670
for other cities in developing
world seeking to promote

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.310
sustainable city tourism.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.190
First, conserving and
beautifying urban environment

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.080
is a key to promoting
sustainable city tourism.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.440
This may involve restoring
ecological features for use

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.490
by both city residents
and tourists.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.470
Second, sustainable
city tourism needs

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.300
to conserve urban
cultural heritage.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.280
This is what makes
each city unique.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.010
Cultural heritage
attracts tourists.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:00.310
Third, physical connectivity,
particularly walkability,

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.260
is at the heart of
sustainable city tourism.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.960
Tourists must be able to walk
around a city to enjoy it.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.940
Fourth, sustainable city
tourism can and should

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.740
expand the economy of the city.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.250
The goal is to enhance the
well-being of both locals

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.220
and tourists.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.220
Fifth, democratic governance
is crucial to building

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.600
public support for
sustainable city tourism.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.660
Public investment in
infrastructure, for example,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.600
are more likely to
serve the general public

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.870
when the public is consulted on
design and finance strategies.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.180
Last and most important,
never mess up your river.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.580
The river will take good care of
us, if we take good care of it.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.930
