00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:02.052
- [Voiceover] Now let's apply the formula

00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:03.400
we came up with the last video

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.929
sometimes known as the Einstein
velocity addition formula.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.530
And we'll see that it's
a pretty neat thing.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.034
So let's say, so this is once
again me floating in space,

00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:14.953
my frame of reference is just
the s frame of reference,

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:16.392
Let's say my friend over here,

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:18.343
she's flying away from me, her velocity,

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:19.620
let's give it some numbers.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.176
Let's say she's flying away from me

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:23.590
with a velocity of, let's say,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.770
0.7c, so seven tenths
of the speed of light

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.860
or 70% of the speed of light.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.646
And let's say this third
character right over here,

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:34.016
let's say they're flying towards me,

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:38.009
so let me change the
direction, the velocity vector.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.517
So let me erase that.

00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:41.933
Gee, that doesn't look like a pure black

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:46.229
but it looks fairly
erased, so there you go.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.410
And let me give the velocity
vector in the other direction.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.538
So the velocity vector,

00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:54.548
this character is flying towards me

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:57.490
at let's say, so u is
going to be equal to,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.069
so it's flying towards me

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.701
x is decreasing with time,

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.851
let's say it's negative,

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.871
- 0.5c,

00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:09.331
so flying towards me at
half the speed of light.

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.514
And once again, both of these velocities

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:14.417
are given in my frame of reference.

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.785
Now if we were in a Newtonian world

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.246
or if we used the
Galilean transformations,

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.568
and this is released as
something on your highway.

00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:23.890
If I'm on a highway and if
I'm going in one direction

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.862
at 70 miles an hour, and
someone is coming towards me

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:30.554
at 50 miles an hour, it'll look to me

00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:33.921
like they are coming towards
me at 120 miles per hour.

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.057
We would essentially
add these two together.

00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:37.914
And so, if we were in a Newtonian world,

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:40.608
this person is flying at 0.7c

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:44.207
and this person is
flying this way at 0.5c,

00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:46.250
you would, in a Newtonian world, say okay

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.456
from this point of view it will look like

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:50.476
this blue character is approaching

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:54.041
at 0.7c plus 0.5c

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.061
or at 1.2 times the speed of light

00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:59.415
which we know violates
the laws of the universe.

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:01.876
And that's where this
formula is really handy.

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.827
Actually let me even
make the spaceship point

00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:05.847
in this direction just
so we don't get confused.

00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:09.421
So the spaceship is going

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.661
in that direction just like that.

00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:13.718
And once again, the
magnitude of the velocity

00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:15.924
coming towards me is
half the speed of light.

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:17.224
I put the negative there to show

00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:18.339
that it's coming towards me,

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:22.100
that x is decreasing over time.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.513
Well, lucky for us in the
last video, we came up with

00:02:25.513 --> 00:02:29.391
this Einstein velocity addition
formula, so let's apply it.

00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:31.527
From this friend's frame of reference,

00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:33.710
the s-prime frame of reference,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.917
the velocity of this character

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:37.216
which is change in
x-prime over change in t

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:38.841
is going to be this.

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:40.095
So what do we have here?

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:44.344
So u is the blue velocity
in my frame of reference,

00:02:44.344 --> 00:02:48.918
So that is -0.5c.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.472
v is my friend's frame of reference,

00:02:51.472 --> 00:02:52.401
the frame of reference

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:55.210
that we're trying to get the velocity in.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.945
So that's 0.7c,

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:01.105
so let me do it in that color.

00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:05.055
So that is 0.7c.

00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:08.561
And then, on top of uv over c-squared,

00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.209
so once again, u is

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.759
- 0.5c.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.782
I know I wrote it really small.

00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:19.854
And then, v is

00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:23.454
0.7c.

00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:24.954
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.414
Well, the numerator -0.5c

00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:30.194
minus 0.7c,

00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:32.222
that's going to be negative.

00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:34.543
Our numerator, right over here

00:03:34.543 --> 00:03:36.706
is going to be

00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:40.686
- 1.2c.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.902
And this is the velocity
that you would expect

00:03:42.902 --> 00:03:45.642
if we were dealing in a Newtonian world.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.360
This person says, "Hey, this person looks

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.498
"like they're coming towards me

00:03:48.498 --> 00:03:50.402
"at 1.2 times the speed of light."

00:03:50.402 --> 00:03:53.560
That's what our Galilean
transformations would give us.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.184
But luckily, we have all
this business at the bottom

00:03:56.184 --> 00:04:00.131
that keeps us from
violating the absoluteness

00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.965
of the velocity of light,

00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:04.519
this notion that nothing can travel faster

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.353
than the speed of light.

00:04:06.353 --> 00:04:07.723
Because in our denominator,

00:04:07.723 --> 00:04:12.250
we're going to get 1 minus 0.5c

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.100
times 0.7c.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.732
Let's see, 0.5 times 0.7

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:20.712
is going to be 0.3.

00:04:20.712 --> 00:04:24.209
So 0.3, I could say 0.30 if I liked,

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:28.551
but I'll just write 0.3c squared.

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:29.619
It'll be a negative.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:31.384
I have a negative times a positive.

00:04:31.384 --> 00:04:32.591
So I could put the negative there

00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.472
but if I'm subtracting a negative,

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:36.051
that's just going to be a positive.

00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:38.396
And I'm just going to divide by c-squared.

00:04:38.396 --> 00:04:40.369
And so, that cancels out.

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:42.622
And so notice, we're going to be dividing

00:04:42.622 --> 00:04:47.149
- 1.2c by something that's
slightly larger than 1.2.

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:49.224
So this is going to be

00:04:49.224 --> 00:04:52.584
- 1.2c

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.524
over 1.3.

00:04:55.524 --> 00:04:57.434
1.3

00:04:57.434 --> 00:05:01.266
And so, lucky for us, this
is going to be less than c,

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.704
or this absolute value is
going to be less than c.

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:07.837
So it's going to be, let's
get a calculator out.

00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:11.641
So, if we have

00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:16.441
1.2 divided by 1.3,

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.981
this is equal to approximately 0.92.

00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:23.426
So this is going to be approximately

00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:27.556
- 0.92c

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:29.245
which is cool.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.196
It kind of goes with our,

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:32.635
let me write it over here.

00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:36.545
So this delta x prime over delta t prime

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:40.705
is -0.92c.

00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:43.943
So it makes sense that from our
friend's frame of reference,

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:46.567
this ship will look like
it's approaching her

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:49.005
faster than from my frame of reference.

00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:51.106
It looks like it's approaching
me in my frame of reference,

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:53.521
it looks like it's coming to
me at half the speed of light.

00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:54.589
In her frame of reference,

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.513
it looks like it's coming at
0.92 times the speed of light.

00:05:58.513 --> 00:06:00.788
The negative is just
specifying the direction.

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:03.760
But we didn't violate
the fundamental postulate

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.943
of special relativity,
that nothing can go faster

00:06:05.943 --> 00:06:07.220
than the speed of light.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.217
The speed of light is absolute.

00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:10.215
So this is pretty cool.

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:12.444
I've often even thought about
making a video game somehow

00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:13.814
where you leverage this,

00:06:13.814 --> 00:06:17.460
where things are flying in
different relative velocities

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.084
but special relativity applies.
