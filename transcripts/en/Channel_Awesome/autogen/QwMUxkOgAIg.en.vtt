00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.110
much as we don't want to deal with
 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.450
much as we don't want to deal with
certain elements as much as we want to

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
certain elements as much as we want to
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.700

there are most likely going to be

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:57.890
there are most likely going to be
 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.910
there are most likely going to be
exceptions to the rule and and that's a

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:00.920
exceptions to the rule and and that's a
 

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.100
exceptions to the rule and and that's a
tough thing to deal with um I I just

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.110
tough thing to deal with um I I just
 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.970

what they have so far and they could do

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240
what they have so far and they could do
 

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.409
what they have so far and they could do
it as professionally as they have but

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:35.419
it as professionally as they have but
 

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.240
it as professionally as they have but
this is one of those elements where okay

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.250
this is one of those elements where okay
 

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.459
this is one of those elements where okay
you want to dabble with this and it's

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:39.469
you want to dabble with this and it's
 

00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:42.339
you want to dabble with this and it's
effective but it could have been more

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:42.349
effective but it could have been more
 

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:46.690
effective but it could have been more
effective maybe a little bit more

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:46.700
effective maybe a little bit more
 

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.110

them I mean the idea of keeping them
 

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.940
them I mean the idea of keeping them
alive and just starving them

00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:58.950

a nasty thing to do but and it does tie
 

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.650
a nasty thing to do but and it does tie

in to doing like what they did to her in
the prison so it makes sense just to

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:08.400
the prison so it makes sense just to
 

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.740
the prison so it makes sense just to
keep them alive just barely alive uh but

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:12.750
keep them alive just barely alive uh but
 

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.270
keep them alive just barely alive uh but
if you really want to go into like the

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:14.280
if you really want to go into like the
 

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.060
if you really want to go into like the
real evils of this you kind of got to go

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.070
real evils of this you kind of got to go
 

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.730
real evils of this you kind of got to go
all the way but I understand I

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740
all the way but I understand I
 

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.280
all the way but I understand I
understand you can't and you couldn't um

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.290
understand you can't and you couldn't um
 

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.290
understand you can't and you couldn't um
that does raise the question whether or

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300
that does raise the question whether or
 

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.200
that does raise the question whether or
not this should have been done then in

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.210
not this should have been done then in
 

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.260
not this should have been done then in
this manner I think it's okay to serve

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.270
this manner I think it's okay to serve
 

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.740
this manner I think it's okay to serve
okay like hey this is a taboo thing but

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:33.750
okay like hey this is a taboo thing but
 

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.850
okay like hey this is a taboo thing but
they don't go quite enough into it it's

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860
they don't go quite enough into it it's
 

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.110
they don't go quite enough into it it's
more hinted at why it shouldn't be done

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120
more hinted at why it shouldn't be done
 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.240
more hinted at why it shouldn't be done
and why it is too much power

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.250
and why it is too much power
 

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.220
and why it is too much power
um so I don't know it's a good episode I

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.230
um so I don't know it's a good episode I
 

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.860
um so I don't know it's a good episode I
mean there's it's by no means bad it is

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:51.870
mean there's it's by no means bad it is
 

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.560
mean there's it's by no means bad it is
it is good and it's effective and gets

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.570
it is good and it's effective and gets
 

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.220
it is good and it's effective and gets
the point across

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:55.230
the point across
 

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.050
the point across
just enough yeah but again I it's it's a

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060
just enough yeah but again I it's it's a
 

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.690
just enough yeah but again I it's it's a
tough position to be in it's if you

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700
tough position to be in it's if you
 

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.460
tough position to be in it's if you
can't do this idea all the way do you do

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:04.470
can't do this idea all the way do you do
 

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.530
can't do this idea all the way do you do
it at all and that's it that's a

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540
it at all and that's it that's a
 

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.040
it at all and that's it that's a
difficult compromise especially in a

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.050
difficult compromise especially in a
 

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.760
difficult compromise especially in a
family show especially on a show like

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:13.770
family show especially on a show like
 

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.920
family show especially on a show like
this which is I mean in my opinion just

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:15.930
this which is I mean in my opinion just
 

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.410
this which is I mean in my opinion just
push the envelope on what family shows

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420
push the envelope on what family shows
 

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.010
push the envelope on what family shows
can do and get away with so yeah it's

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.020
can do and get away with so yeah it's
 

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.140
can do and get away with so yeah it's
