00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.610
we're going to talk about try perfect

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620
we're going to talk about try perfect
 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.130
we're going to talk about try perfect
numbers try perfect numbers we've heard

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140
numbers try perfect numbers we've heard
 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.749
numbers try perfect numbers we've heard
of perfect numbers having wait we've

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
of perfect numbers having wait we've
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.670
of perfect numbers having wait we've
done that on numberphile before if one

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
done that on numberphile before if one
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.470
done that on numberphile before if one
of our first ones wasn't it I think we

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
of our first ones wasn't it I think we
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.450
of our first ones wasn't it I think we
need to do a quick recap of what a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
need to do a quick recap of what a
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.830
need to do a quick recap of what a
perfect number is because that's going

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
perfect number is because that's going
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900
perfect number is because that's going
to be relevant to what a try perfect

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
to be relevant to what a try perfect
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.210
to be relevant to what a try perfect
number is so a perfect number is a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
number is so a perfect number is a
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.210
number is so a perfect number is a
number like six six is a perfect number

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
number like six six is a perfect number
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.019
number like six six is a perfect number
and that's because factors of 6 are 1 2

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
and that's because factors of 6 are 1 2
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.439
and that's because factors of 6 are 1 2
3 and 6 itself in fact what we're going

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
3 and 6 itself in fact what we're going
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.089
3 and 6 itself in fact what we're going
to do we're going to ignore the number

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
to do we're going to ignore the number
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.359
to do we're going to ignore the number
itself if we add up the other factors so

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
itself if we add up the other factors so
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.790
itself if we add up the other factors so
we'll have 1 plus 2 Plus 3 we're going

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
we'll have 1 plus 2 Plus 3 we're going
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.620
we'll have 1 plus 2 Plus 3 we're going
to end up with the original number we're

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
to end up with the original number we're
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.860
to end up with the original number we're
going to have 6 the next perfect number

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
going to have 6 the next perfect number
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.310
going to have 6 the next perfect number
is 28 and it works the same way if you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
is 28 and it works the same way if you
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650
is 28 and it works the same way if you
look at the factors of 28 and add them

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
look at the factors of 28 and add them
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110
look at the factors of 28 and add them
up you'll get the original number the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
up you'll get the original number the
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680
up you'll get the original number the
next one is going to be 496 that's a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
next one is going to be 496 that's a
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479
next one is going to be 496 that's a
perfect number the next one after that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
perfect number the next one after that
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.729
perfect number the next one after that
is 8,000 128 and they keep going right

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
is 8,000 128 and they keep going right
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.099
is 8,000 128 and they keep going right
so those are quite rare we think there's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
so those are quite rare we think there's
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.399
so those are quite rare we think there's
infinitely many of them but we found 50

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
infinitely many of them but we found 50
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.830
infinitely many of them but we found 50
so far the largest one we found is the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
so far the largest one we found is the
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.230
so far the largest one we found is the
most recent which is a perfect number

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
most recent which is a perfect number
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.420
most recent which is a perfect number
that is 46 million digits long so we do

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
that is 46 million digits long so we do
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190
that is 46 million digits long so we do
think there's infinitely many of them

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
think there's infinitely many of them
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.710
think there's infinitely many of them
although we haven't proven that to be

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
although we haven't proven that to be
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260
although we haven't proven that to be
true and all the perfect numbers we

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
true and all the perfect numbers we
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.249
true and all the perfect numbers we
found are even we haven't found an odd

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259
found are even we haven't found an odd
 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.570
found are even we haven't found an odd
perfect number yet so that's something

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
perfect number yet so that's something
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060
perfect number yet so that's something
that hasn't been proven yet but this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
that hasn't been proven yet but this
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.399
that hasn't been proven yet but this
definition I gave you was kind of weird

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
definition I gave you was kind of weird
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.190
definition I gave you was kind of weird
because I ignored the number itself so I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
because I ignored the number itself so I
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350
because I ignored the number itself so I
said out of all the factors except the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
said out of all the factors except the
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.020
said out of all the factors except the
number itself you could just add all the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
number itself you could just add all the
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.179
number itself you could just add all the
factors including the number itself

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
factors including the number itself
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.030
factors including the number itself
that's perfectly fine and then you could

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
that's perfectly fine and then you could
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340
that's perfectly fine and then you could
say a perfect number is you add up all

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
say a perfect number is you add up all
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499
say a perfect number is you add up all
the factors and you get double the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
the factors and you get double the
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.590
the factors and you get double the
original number that's absolutely fine

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600
original number that's absolutely fine
 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.700
original number that's absolutely fine
what happens if we add up all the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
what happens if we add up all the
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.609
what happens if we add up all the
factors and get triple the number that

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
factors and get triple the number that
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.850
factors and get triple the number that
is a tri perfect number well the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
is a tri perfect number well the
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.760
is a tri perfect number well the
smallest tri perfect number is 120 if we

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
smallest tri perfect number is 120 if we
 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.450
smallest tri perfect number is 120 if we
look at the factors of 120 you have 1 2

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
look at the factors of 120 you have 1 2
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.850
look at the factors of 120 you have 1 2
3 4 5 6 8 10 12 15 20 is a factor

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860
3 4 5 6 8 10 12 15 20 is a factor
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.310
3 4 5 6 8 10 12 15 20 is a factor
for 30 40 60 and will include 120 itself

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320
for 30 40 60 and will include 120 itself
 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.920
for 30 40 60 and will include 120 itself
so those are the factors of 120 and if

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
so those are the factors of 120 and if
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.400
so those are the factors of 120 and if
you add them up you will get 360 you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410
you add them up you will get 360 you
 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.430
you add them up you will get 360 you
will get 3 times the original number so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440
will get 3 times the original number so
 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.340
will get 3 times the original number so
that is the first try perfect number let

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350
that is the first try perfect number let
 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.410
that is the first try perfect number let
me write out the next few let's start a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420
me write out the next few let's start a
 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.860
me write out the next few let's start a
list here with 120 and the next one is

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870
 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.770
672 the next try perfect number after

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780
672 the next try perfect number after
 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:50.890
672 the next try perfect number after
that is 520 3776 the next one after that

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900
that is 520 3776 the next one after that
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.140
that is 520 3776 the next one after that
is 459 million eight hundred and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150
is 459 million eight hundred and
 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.670
is 459 million eight hundred and
eighteen thousand 240 the next one after

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680
eighteen thousand 240 the next one after
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.710
eighteen thousand 240 the next one after
that is 1 billion 476 million three

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720
that is 1 billion 476 million three
 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.170
that is 1 billion 476 million three
hundred and four thousand eight hundred

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180
hundred and four thousand eight hundred
 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.710
hundred and four thousand eight hundred
and ninety-six and the next one that I

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720
and ninety-six and the next one that I
 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.210
and ninety-six and the next one that I
might put this one in I'll put it here

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220
might put this one in I'll put it here
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.860
might put this one in I'll put it here
51 billion and 1 million hundred and

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870
51 billion and 1 million hundred and
 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.920
51 billion and 1 million hundred and
eighty thousand one hundred and sixty so

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930
eighty thousand one hundred and sixty so
 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.960
eighty thousand one hundred and sixty so
I've got six they're written out and

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970
I've got six they're written out and
 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.729
I've got six they're written out and
that's all of them that's all we know

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739
that's all of them that's all we know
 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.490
that's all of them that's all we know
and we also think that's a complete list

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500
and we also think that's a complete list
 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.380
and we also think that's a complete list
we think there's finitely many of them

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390
we think there's finitely many of them
 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.810
we think there's finitely many of them
we think there's six of them only that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820
we think there's six of them only that
 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.330
we think there's six of them only that
is a complete list there are six try

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340
is a complete list there are six try
 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.460
is a complete list there are six try
perfect numbers now that's not proven

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470
perfect numbers now that's not proven
 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.250
perfect numbers now that's not proven
but we really do believe that this is a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260
but we really do believe that this is a
 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.680
but we really do believe that this is a
complete list couple of reasons for this

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690
complete list couple of reasons for this
 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.110
complete list couple of reasons for this
we have searched for them and we've

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120
we have searched for them and we've
 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.940
we have searched for them and we've
searched quite a long way we've searched

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950
searched quite a long way we've searched
 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.690
searched quite a long way we've searched
huge numbers like numbers that are 350

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700
huge numbers like numbers that are 350
 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.240
huge numbers like numbers that are 350
digits long like really big numbers but

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250
digits long like really big numbers but
 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.820
digits long like really big numbers but
they just stopped so we have a try

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830
they just stopped so we have a try
 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.100
they just stopped so we have a try
perfect number in the hundreds we have

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
perfect number in the hundreds we have
 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.740
perfect number in the hundreds we have
try perfect numbers in the thousands we

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750
try perfect numbers in the thousands we
 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.780
try perfect numbers in the thousands we
have them in the millions we have them

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790
have them in the millions we have them
 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.150
have them in the millions we have them
in the billions and then they just stop

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160
in the billions and then they just stop
 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.030
in the billions and then they just stop
and it would be really weird if there

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040
and it would be really weird if there
 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.160
and it would be really weird if there
was a zip sums of massive try perfect

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170
was a zip sums of massive try perfect
 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.680
was a zip sums of massive try perfect
number so there's this massive massive

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690
number so there's this massive massive
 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.400
number so there's this massive massive
gap and then another try perfect number

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410
gap and then another try perfect number
 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.069
gap and then another try perfect number
suddenly appears that would be really

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079
suddenly appears that would be really
 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.740
suddenly appears that would be really
weird if that's true now we don't know

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750
weird if that's true now we don't know
 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.620
weird if that's true now we don't know
that this is a complete list but it

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630
that this is a complete list but it
 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.990
that this is a complete list but it
would be really weird if it wasn't a

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000
would be really weird if it wasn't a
 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.410
would be really weird if it wasn't a

meet list and there is other reasons why

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270
meet list and there is other reasons why
 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.420
meet list and there is other reasons why
we think this is complete list because

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430
we think this is complete list because
 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.970
we think this is complete list because
it's also related to perfect numbers

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980
it's also related to perfect numbers
 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.700
it's also related to perfect numbers
fact it's related to odd perfect numbers

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
fact it's related to odd perfect numbers
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.440
fact it's related to odd perfect numbers
if you remember I said we haven't found

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450
if you remember I said we haven't found
 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.280
if you remember I said we haven't found
any odd perfect numbers yet and there is

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290
any odd perfect numbers yet and there is
 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.770
any odd perfect numbers yet and there is
a relation between odd perfect numbers

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780
a relation between odd perfect numbers
 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.840
a relation between odd perfect numbers
and tri perfect numbers if you had a

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850
and tri perfect numbers if you had a
 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.060
and tri perfect numbers if you had a
number let's just call it n and if that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070
number let's just call it n and if that
 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.340
number let's just call it n and if that
is odd perfect

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350
is odd perfect
 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.510
is odd perfect
then 2n is tri perfect so that means

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520
then 2n is tri perfect so that means
 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.090
then 2n is tri perfect so that means
that if we do find an odd perfect number

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100
that if we do find an odd perfect number
 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.130
that if we do find an odd perfect number
one day and it's going to be massive if

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140
one day and it's going to be massive if
 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.230
one day and it's going to be massive if
we ever find it if we find it one day

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240
we ever find it if we find it one day
 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.450
we ever find it if we find it one day
then automatically we're going to find a

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460
then automatically we're going to find a
 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.330
then automatically we're going to find a
new tri perfect number so either we're

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340
new tri perfect number so either we're
 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.950
new tri perfect number so either we're
going to find this odd perfect number

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960
going to find this odd perfect number
 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.840
going to find this odd perfect number
and this list is not complete after all

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850
and this list is not complete after all
 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.920
and this list is not complete after all
or this list is complete which means

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930
or this list is complete which means
 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.010
or this list is complete which means
that aren't any odd perfect numbers

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020
that aren't any odd perfect numbers
 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.730
that aren't any odd perfect numbers
which we also believe not proven but we

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740
which we also believe not proven but we
 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.080
which we also believe not proven but we
strongly believe that's true James I'm

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090
strongly believe that's true James I'm
 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.740
strongly believe that's true James I'm
glad you asked because yes absolutely so

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750
glad you asked because yes absolutely so
 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.720
glad you asked because yes absolutely so
there are four perfect numbers five

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730
there are four perfect numbers five
 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.850
there are four perfect numbers five
perfect numbers I show you them we can

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860
perfect numbers I show you them we can
 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.830
perfect numbers I show you them we can
look at them I've got them yeah and the

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840
look at them I've got them yeah and the
 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.380
look at them I've got them yeah and the
smallest four perfect number that we

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390
smallest four perfect number that we
 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.010
smallest four perfect number that we
know is thirty thousand two hundred and

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020
know is thirty thousand two hundred and
 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.020
know is thirty thousand two hundred and
forty so if you look at the factors of

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030
forty so if you look at the factors of
 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.850
forty so if you look at the factors of
that number and add them up you'll get

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860
that number and add them up you'll get
 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.910
that number and add them up you'll get
four times the original number there are

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920
four times the original number there are
 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.290
four times the original number there are
36 known for perfect numbers and then

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300
36 known for perfect numbers and then
 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.810
36 known for perfect numbers and then
the list of stops again and then we

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820
the list of stops again and then we
 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.940
the list of stops again and then we
can't find any more so we think again

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950
can't find any more so we think again
 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.640
can't find any more so we think again
we've got a finite list here and we

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650
we've got a finite list here and we
 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.280
we've got a finite list here and we
think we have all the four perfect

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290
think we have all the four perfect
 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.200
think we have all the four perfect
numbers you can take it a step further

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210
numbers you can take it a step further
 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.630
numbers you can take it a step further
of course look at five perfect numbers

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640
of course look at five perfect numbers
 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.770
of course look at five perfect numbers
the smallest five perfect number is 14

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780
the smallest five perfect number is 14
 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.430
the smallest five perfect number is 14
billion 182 million four hundred and

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440
billion 182 million four hundred and
 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.000
billion 182 million four hundred and
thirty nine thousand and forty there's

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010
thirty nine thousand and forty there's
 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.820
thirty nine thousand and forty there's
sixty five of those that we know of that

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830
sixty five of those that we know of that
 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.830
sixty five of those that we know of that
we found and again it's the same thing

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840
we found and again it's the same thing
 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.570
we found and again it's the same thing
it looks like it's a finite list because

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580
it looks like it's a finite list because
 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.700
it looks like it's a finite list because
we found 65 of them and then it just

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710
we found 65 of them and then it just
 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.280
we found 65 of them and then it just
stops and we can't find any more so we

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290
stops and we can't find any more so we
 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.290
stops and we can't find any more so we
think maths a finite list as well same

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300
think maths a finite list as well same
 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.810
think maths a finite list as well same
is true for six perfect numbers and

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820
is true for six perfect numbers and
 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.210
is true for six perfect numbers and
seven perfect numbers we think we found

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220
seven perfect numbers we think we found
 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.810
seven perfect numbers we think we found
a complete list then they just stop if

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820
a complete list then they just stop if
 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.460
a complete list then they just stop if
