1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.980
Homeless people and they shipped him out there and buses.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.070
They could vote from the town that gave them jobs and identities and these

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.670
people were extremely happy.
That was what?
It was crazy.
It's like a,
I'm sure up.

4
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:09.630
Some of them were troubled,

5
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:12.600
but for a lot of them they finally had a sense of purpose.

6
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.630
They just been taken into this place as family.
So they made Utah,

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.180
they basically made a town in Utah.

8
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
I've always respected and what I did see part of this movie geek at three in the

9
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.200
morning like,
Oh shit.

10
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.690
Why is it that white hippie like people trust Brown people with beards so much?

11
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.530
Well,
they want to believe in enlightenment and in all the media portrayals of

12
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:37.800
enlightenment and all of,
you know,
when people talk about mystical experiences,

13
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.790
they had an India.

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.900
It's always that part of the world that emphasizes spirituality.

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.760
And the idea that the Hindu religion is a,
is a,
a more ancient,

16
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:50.590
more Comcast's spiritual religion as a,

17
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.620
as to the Indian Yogi figure is the white Jesus figure of white people 100%.

18
00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.840
So for why people who don't know white Jesus in the black community is a

19
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:04.290
mythical creature that has enormous power,
right?

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.070
It's insane for anyone to believe in a deity that doesn't look like them.
Right?

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.480
So,
but in the black community we're just in love with renaissance paintings and

22
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:13.950
Jesus is why as fuck.
All right,

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.870
so we have the same infatuation that you're weird hippy art has with Indian men

24
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.000
with long beards and their mysticism.

25
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.630
We have that wear white jeans so that you've just helped me understand cause

26
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.610
I've always wondered like what the fuck is it up?

27
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:30.870
Well white people and east Indian people that cause Vikrum who directed trigger

28
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.670
warning also has a documentary where he creates a fake religion and convinces

29
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.300
you know,
white middle class people to follow.
That is a crazy one.

30
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:43.890
The white cheese.
This one,
right?
A white Jesus.
A motherfucker bro.
Like,
like,
man,

31
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.100
I'm going to get me a shirt that says white people want to stay woke.

32
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.180
And what I mean by that is Western civilization,

33
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.510
it's,
this is the latest phase.

34
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:58.590
Like people have to understand there have been many empires and civilizations.

35
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.340
There was a time where Mali in Africa and Kim and in Africa with the biggest

36
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.300
civilizations and colonizers on earth later,
Persia,
biggest cock,

37
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:07.770
like you've had systems.

38
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:11.370
And right now the West has just for the last thousand years or so has been

39
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:12.780
kicking and dominating ass.

40
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.890
A lot of what we see on the news between the West and what we call the Middle

41
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.830
East now,
what was wanting western per dre at western Asia,

42
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.080
this is thousands of years war.
You know,

43
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.150
you're hearing Islam versus Christianity,

44
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.420
but it's really two ideologies that have been fighting for thousands of years

45
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:30.660
over how the globe should be governed.
So with,
with that shit man,

46
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:34.230
it's like there's no,
there's no stopping this shit and split white.

47
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:39.231
Jesus springs out of that and kind of goes everywhere and colonizes everything.

48
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:44.580
So you know,
the church pops up.
We candy for kids bibles for you.
And by the way,

49
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.570
we're going to be gone in a while,

50
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:48.270
but we're going to leave this guy here on the wall so you know what the ideal,

51
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.380
what God's son look like.

52
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:53.610
So if God's son looks like a dooby brother can sell this God,

53
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.410
God looks like Jim Morris,
Jim Morris with a full beard.

54
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.090
He's straight the fuck.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's really,

55
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.740
Jesus would probably a Tan guy with dark hair and curly curly hair and Brown

56
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.070
eyes that was saying shit that the government and the church didn't like.

57
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.130
So they knocked him the fuck off.
Yeah.

58
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.850
Why do you think that each race looks for someone of another race to be their

59
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.050
advisor?
Because I don't think people trust the divinity in themselves.

60
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.580
You know,
I think,
I think that once you understand that as human beings,

61
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.820
we really only looked different because of subtle differences and atmosphere and

62
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.160
changing.
You know,
who you mixed with win.

63
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
But I think that all those books that are moms paid Oprah to sell us of self

64
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:40.660
help and inward looking.

65
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.020
Reverend Ike had told my grandmother's generation ad in the seventies you know

66
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:44.680
what I mean?

67
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.920
And I think that we're scared to turn off the lights and at some point see

68
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:51.310
something divine within ourselves.
Because once you do that,

69
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:53.440
that requires you act differently.

70
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.920
And I think that people need to be told what to do.

71
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.820
Not that they actually need it,
but they want to be instructed,
you know,

72
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:05.020
versus knowing or going on a gut feeling or experiment and getting something

73
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.591
wrong.
You know,

74
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:10.120
my grandfather was one of the most kind moral men I've ever met.

75
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.480
He was always gentle with children.

76
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.390
He only put a belt on my butt twice in my life and shit.

77
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.300
I think he cried harder than that same man at 14 years old.

78
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:22.690
Shot a man in church for kicking the spike down.
You know,

79
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.670
he grew up in between 14 and 54 when I was born.

80
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.770
And he had experiences that he had learned to regret and he had dealt with that

81
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:37.240
and he had become something that by the time I was a child,
he was raising me.

82
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.180
My grandfather was divided in my eyes almost.
You know what I mean?

83
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.270
Not because he was perfect because he was genuinely good and moral.

84
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.330
But as a 14 year old boy who had grown up fatherless,

85
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.960
who dropped out of school in the third grade,
and who had,
who understood it,

86
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.710
that I must protect my mothers and sisters,
he refused to be bullied by anyone,

87
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.710
even an adult until the point of putting a bullet in him.
You know what I mean?

88
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.090
So I think that a lot of times we're afraid to see that divinity in ourselves

89
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:04.360
also.
Because then you have to acknowledge the darkness and you have to deal with

90
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.840
that.
And it's easier to get instructed by someone else and it's easier to see.

91
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:10.690
The evil is outside too.
It's easier to see.

92
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.050
That is something that I can't control.
It just happens versus I'm compliant.

93
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.870
I'm complicit in it.
You know?
That's,
uh,
it's also a consequence of,

94
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.700
<v 1>you know,</v>

95
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.860
one of the things that bothers me the most when people talk about people that

96
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:25.870
commit crimes or think about people that commit crimes.

97
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.400
So much of who a person is as a consequence of things that had nothing to do

98
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.330
with them.
Absolutely.

99
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.050
They get had been born in a terrible neighborhood to horrible parents,

100
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.660
been abused sexually and physically and,

101
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.440
and by the time you get to them that broke their life is already a mess.

102
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.610
It's a shambles row.

103
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.590
And for you to try to think that they are going to look at life and just figure

104
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:51.400
it out with no assistance whatsoever is,
it's crazy.
It doesn't work like that.

105
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.210
One of the weirdest things about our culture is that we haven't put more of an

106
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:58.070
emphasis in finding the spots that are

107
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.860
<v 0>there,
the ghettos and the terrible neighborhoods in this country,</v>

108
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.800
and figuring out a way to build them up and just make it even.

109
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.060
We know you're out away.

110
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.300
We know on unequivocably where jobs and commerce are precedent and economic

111
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:14.000
opportunity and prosperity occur,
Dessa,

112
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.900
dramatic reduction and elimination and gang violence.

113
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.930
Yet we do not put resources into building institutions that will create

114
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.880
entrepreneurs or work on a soft skill so the kids can be working at and around

115
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.380
production houses to the els.
We put that money into prisons.
Yeah.

116
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.810
And then we use prison labor to undercut things like call centers,
um,

117
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.420
things like that,
that jobs,

118
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:43.100
I mean factories may need and we are doing a disservice by doing that.
We,

119
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.330
and I always say we,

120
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.650
because we looked at our quote unquote leaders and blame them when so many times

121
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.150
we allow it,
you know,

122
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.570
we allow this to happen by not paying attention and not voting.

123
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.970
We allow it to happen by not raising our voice,

124
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.150
even though we know someone in prison and saying this is wrong.
You know,

125
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.910
the last people,
I don't believe just for the record,

126
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:04.640
I don't believe in the big three.
They Abrahamic religions,
I'm not into them,

127
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.870
but the books I've read and they're amazing graphic novels,

128
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.730
I of read them like I can look like a graphic novel of sorts.
Right.

129
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.940
And when you look at the people who Christ died with,
right?
It was,
he was,

130
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.460
he was up,
there were thieves.

131
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.810
The last person he saved before he got out of here was a thief.
I was like,

132
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.110
what's a confessed?
Steve was dying right next to him.
And he was like,
you know,

133
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:27.030
we're going to go on this together.
That sets an amazing things.

134
00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:30.080
So as you're serving your savior,
your messiah,

135
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.620
you need to be thinking about who he spent this time with.
You know,

136
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.290
he was with liars and thieves,
he was in the streets,

137
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:38.120
he was with people who are alleged to be prostitutes.

138
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.650
And I think that if we start to turn our attention to those places and we put

139
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:47.120
our intentions and good there,
we do produce on the out on the other side better.

140
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.880
But as long as we look at religion to something that makes us holy,

141
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:53.990
makes us clean and washed us of our sins and we become pious in that,

142
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.260
I think religion will be something that's forever kind of harmful.

143
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.440
It helped to create that.
And I think that that,

144
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.430
that believing that some people are good or evil doesn't allow us to say,

145
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.370
well what could we do to fix those ghettos to fix those depressed areas?

146
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:10.310
Cause for every ghetto where I'm from,
for every ghetto that's in the city,

147
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:11.144
in the south,

148
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.420
I can show you a mountainous region with a trailer park that's just as bad for

149
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.530
sure.
And those and those.

150
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:20.030
And those kids deserve a life better than oxycontin addiction and turmoil and

151
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:21.620
pain to 100% yeah.
