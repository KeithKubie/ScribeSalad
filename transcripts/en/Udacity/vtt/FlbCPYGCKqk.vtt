00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.810
What we have here is somewhat similar to what we did with the circles, for

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.350
each one of our data points.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.130
Since we use this over and over again, in practice, I would most likely abstract

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.480
this IF conditional into some function outside of this block of code.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.630
But, for clarity's sake and understanding, I've written it out, and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.060
with this legend, these groups we've just created.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.190
I'm going to append a circle for each of the bound datapoints.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.500
Set the y attribute of that circle to be some variable i times 30.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.670
Previously we've only used accessor functions like

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.830
this to access the datum that was bound.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.222
But if we specify in our function, two arguments,

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:49.970
(d, i) in this case, we actually get the index of the data point.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.280
In this case, we only have two data points, home team and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.110
others, so i of zero is going to be home team.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.470
I of one is going to be others.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.019
And depending on which position we're at in the array we passed to the data

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.580
binding function, we're simply going to increment the y position by 30 pixels.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.820
This might seem silly, for a legend that only has two items in it.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.490
But let's say we had a complex chart that maybe had ten different lines or

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.680
types of circles or shapes we've drawn.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.160
We wouldn't have to want to specify either in the data some value or hard code

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.530
in the exact pixel every one of those ten lines should show up at in the legend.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.450
For the radius and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.420
the fill, nothing new here, we simple check, is the datum home team,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.830
if it is, we're going to draw it to be the same size as the home team circles.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.400
Radius times multiplier.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.560
And if it's not the Home Team just draw it the same size as

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.270
all the other d circles.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.130
And for the fill, if it's the home team fill it to be red and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.850
otherwise make it blue.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.980
I'm going to comment out this last bit of the legend code that appends text,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.290
save my file and see what shows up on the page.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.730
Refreshing the page.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.420
We have our initial chart and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.590
here we see two circles that seem to be floating in space.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.940
But again we haven't appended the text that corresponds to what each of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.620
these circles represents.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
We've only drawn a circle the same size and color as the one we want to label.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.120
So now let's go back to the code and actually add text so that a reader knows

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.420
what the small blue circles are and what the larger red circles are.
