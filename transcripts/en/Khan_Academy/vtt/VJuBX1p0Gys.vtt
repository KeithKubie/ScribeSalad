00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.240
As we enter into the 1900s

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:11.428
imperial Russia is under the absolute control of the czar and [a] [czar] an analogous term would be emperor he has

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.059
absolute control over Russia, and he's part of the Romanov dynasty

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.580
Romanov Dynasty

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.719
That has had control that has ruled over imperial Russia since the early 1600s, so for Roughly

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.669
300 years, but as we see from the late 1800s through through the early 1900's really over the course of TSAr

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.058
nicholas II rule you see ever increasing tensions between the ruling class between the royalty and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.069
the aristocracy and the labor class sometimes called referring themselves as the proletariat the proletariat comes from an

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.669
Enrollment Society it was the the lowest class the people who [were] kind of doing the labor in Roman society?

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.669
But they proudly referred to themselves as a proletariat and as we'll see the the revolution that occurs in

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.128
1917 that's really the culmination of the struggle between the laborers the ones that are working under ever increasingly harsh conditions in

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.959
factories in Urban centers or the ones that are working in the fields and and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.540
The ruling class and this tension just keeps getting worse and worse and worse [as] we [get] into

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.500
1905 and 1905 is one of the more notable events that show that things aren't going all that well for the tSAr in

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.119
January of that year you have a an orthodox priest

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.019
Leading a a strike leading a protest

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.589
Trying to get this is in St.. Petersburg trying to March to the TSAr's palace, and it's an unarmed

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.430
It's a peaceful protest

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.269
But they want to be heard they want to explain to the tSAr. How hard the working conditions are for laborers under in in

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.889
Imperial Russia and the Tsar isn't actually in town at the [time]

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.709
But his force [is] actually opened fire on these peaceful protesters and that that that event in which

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.369
There's all these casualties of these peaceful protesters is called Bloody Sunday

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.849
Bloody and this was in January

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.509
Bloody Sunday, which is in January of 1905 and this sparks an attempted revolution?

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.890
Where [are] it people who are sympathetic to those protesters they start taking [to] the street throughout Russia?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.690
You start having the government forces suppressing them wherever they are but eventually that that revolution is put down

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.170
It's an unsuccessful

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.720
revolution but it increases the tension even further and frankly even folks who might have been

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.730
Somewhat sympathetic to the TSAr before almost viewed him as a bit of a father figure now are thinking hey

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.109
You know this guy's forces open open open fire on peaceful protesters

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.279
maybe he's really not on our side and those tensions continue to increase as we go all the way into

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.119
1914 which we've seen in [other] videos is the start of world war one and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.530
like happens

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.380
And we've seen it in both world war one and world war two russia tends to take the brunt of these things and world war

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.769
one is Incredibly difficult [on] Russia first of all all of the a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.300
Good fraction of the young men have to go fight, then a lot of the economy has to be

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.260
repointed at

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.519
supporting the war effort at the supplies for the troops the food for the troops and so it starts to really hurt the conditions for

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.370
the average person

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.840
Which [were] already bad remember they were protesting in 1905 and now things are getting worse as we go through World war one

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:30.910
For the average individual now to make a bit of a concession [to] the general public and to move somewhat into a more representative

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.119
world after the revolution of 1905 the TSAr does create the Duma which is a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.560
representative assembly

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.700
Representative assembly that didn't have a ton of power

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.609
But it did start to give the people voice and every time

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.059
They assembled to him whether the TSAr was actually not too pleased with it

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.890
He's like who are all of these people who seem to be very aggressively anti me and he kept getting the Duma

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.380
dissolved and then a new Duma would be elected and this kept going on and on and on all the way until we get to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.589
The beginning of World war [ron] now as I said World war one

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.919
conditions start to get worse people start to get even more

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.290
Skeptical of Tsar rule to make things [even] worse when [TSAr] [nicholas] II has left, st.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.739
Petersburg to really help

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.619
Lead the Troops or in his mind lead the troops near the front of the war the country

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.899
Or the empire is really goes under the control of his wife the CzArina, Alexandra

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.429
And she is heavily under the influence of this gentle right over here

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.538
Gregory Rasputin and Rasputin is one of these fascinating

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.529
Characters from history because he was this mystical faith healer type guy who was able to really?

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.709
Manipulate the the Czarina and to some degree the TSAr and so people started getting suspicious of well

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.830
Who is this guy this?

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.609
Mysterious guy who's hanging out in the palace and seeming to have very strong influence over our?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.240
rulers and there were even suspicious of the Czarina at this time [the] lot of the royalty they married between

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.680
countries and the Czarina

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.189
She was actually born in

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:08.679
Germany and her father was German she grew up in Germany and her mug rand mother was actually Queen Victoria of England and you might

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.139
Remember that that Russia is now at war with Germany. So they're like hey. We have this German

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.829
Czarina essentially controlling the country under the the sway of this mysterious shady figure gregory

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.779
rasputin people do not like the way that this is going and so by

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:32.619
1917 things come to a head and in February and especially march of 1917 the

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.799
They are able to force the tsAr to abdicate to say hey enough is enough

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.979
We're taking it straight to you you have to

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:46.569
You have to give up your power, and it's called the February revolution

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.429
But the TsAr doesn't actually abdicate until march so you could argue that you could call it the March

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.539
Revolution now once the [tSAr] abdicates you have a provisional government

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.240
You have a provisional government

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.758
Take control and all of this is happening in

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:08.409
1917 but people are also not happy with this provisional government remember the war is continuing to go on it's not really looking that well

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:16.148
For Russia they're continuing to lose people the economy is continuing to tank and what you have is workers start to to

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.359
Start to assemble start to organize in the various cities

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.139
And they form these workers councils these councils and the word and russian for them is soviets

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:34.659
These soviets start to form and you fast forward into october of that year and these soviets are able to

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.338
along with the Bolsheviks, which is a party are able to Force the

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.080
provisional government

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
to

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.419
To abdicate its power or to give up its power and then you have the control by a soviet [Council] and in the soviet Council

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.710
the Bolsheviks

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.699
Led by Vladimir Lenin are the ones who are [actually] able to take power now revolutions?

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.799
I mentioned you know what revolutions are happen

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.609
Or they're the culmination of decades of increasing tension and as we've seen multiple times in history revolutions are not clean things

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.520
it's not like the tSAr abdicate or the government abdicates and [another] government takes over and then everyone's all nice the

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.699
Bolshevik Revolution which installs which it now has this

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.209
council of soviets which [we're] the Bolsheviks aren't control led by

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.489
Vladimir Lenin you can imagine the people who are royal who are loyal to the king the monarchists?

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.759
They're not happy you can imagine people who are more aligned with

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.210
Capitalist models of government because the soviets and the the bolsheviks they are strongly strongly

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.429
Socialist they they're followers of Marx. They imagine an ideal state that has a

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:42.099
That has very limited

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:49.089
private property rights and on and on and on and so this sparks [a] the russian [Civil] [war] which lasts from

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:51.710
1917 to

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:58.269
1922 and like Most Civil Wars it is incredibly Bloody you have two to three million casualties

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:06.069
Two to three million casualties as part of that [civil] war and casualties those could be deaths those could be injuries

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.169
but in the end the

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.819
Bolshevik Red Army is victorious and sometimes that Civil war is viewed as a

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:19.269
conflict between the red Army of the Bolsheviks the one that favoured Socialism extreme socialism Communism really and

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.519
The white Army the army that was either on the side of the monarchists or they're more capitalist

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.199
But they're definitely against the red army

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:30.309
And there's also another group the green army which is you know not aligned with either one of them

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.779
So let me let me write this down. It's really the civil war is red Army

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.680
versus

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.680
versus white Army

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:45.039
Versus white army and then there's even the notion of a green army which is not aligned with either of these verses

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.729
The Green Army and this continues all [the] way through

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:56.839
1922 until the Red Army is able to be victorious, and that's really the official of the soviet Union in

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:04.879
1922 and Lenin is the first premier of the soviet union, So he is the premier of [the] soviet union?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.029
But he does not last long he eventually dies from from natural causes [a] Few years later in

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.320
1924 where he is followed by Stalin and you might be asking well, what happened to the TSAr and his?

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.539
Family after they abdicated well, it's not that great of an outcome and it's it's at least for them

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.230
And it's one of these famous things in history where his entire family

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:34.909
His entire family actually gets executed the summer after he abdicates and so this was an entire family every member of his [family] was

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:41.300
Was executed there were some theories that that one of that his daughter right over here, anastasia might have actually escaped

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:49.070
But it was later lee later conclusively proven that she too was was also executed so you see that right over here the [tSAr]

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.709
Abdicating in nineteen abdicating in 1917 and then the next summer his entire family is

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.370
actually

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:03.260
Executed so it's a bloody beginning. It's a bloody period But this this is kind of what happens when you have

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:05.779
significant revolutions
