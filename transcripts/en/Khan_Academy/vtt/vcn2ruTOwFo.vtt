00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.180
Find all of the factors
of 120.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.160
Or another way to think about
it, find all of the whole

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.650
numbers that 120 is
divisible by.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.040
So the first one, that's
maybe obvious.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.560
All whole numbers are
divisible by 1.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.090
So we could write 120 is equal
to is to 1 times 120.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.990
So let's write a factors
list over here.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.390
So this is going to be our
factors list over here.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.900
So we just found two factors.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.910
We said, well, is it
divisible by 1?

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.940
Well, every whole number
is divisible by 1.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.630
This is a whole number, so 1
is a factor at the low end.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.490
1 is a factor.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.580
That's its actual smallest
factor, and its

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.330
largest factor is 120.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.580
You can't have something larger
than 120 dividing

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.500
evenly into 120.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.400
121 will not go into 120.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.710
So the largest factor
on our factors list

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.080
is going to be 120.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.470
Now let's think about others.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.200
Let's think about whether
is 2 divisible into 120?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.910
So there's 120 equals
2 times something?

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.680
Well, when you look here,
maybe you immediately

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.760
recognize that 120 is
an even number.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.000
It's ones place is a 0.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.430
As as long as its ones place is
a 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, as long

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.110
as it's an even number, the
whole number is even and the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.540
whole number is divisible
by 2.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.440
And to figure out what you have
to multiply by 2 to get

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.690
120, well, you can think of 120
as 12 times 10, or another

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.480
way to think about it,
it's 2 times 6 times

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.890
10, or 2 times 60.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.340
You could divide it
out if you want.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.690
You could say, OK,
2 goes into 120.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.420
2 goes into 1 no times.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240
2 goes into 12 six times.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.270
6 times 2 is 12.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.410
Subtract.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.100
You get 0.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.090
Bring down the 0.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.910
2 goes into 0 zero times.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.010
0 times 2 is 0, and you get no
remainder there, so it goes

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.430
sixty times.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.050
So we have two more factors
right here.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.420
So we have the factors.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.070
So we've established the next
lowest one is 2, and the next

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.110
highest factor, if we're
starting from the large end,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.310
is going to be 60.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.880
Now let's think about three.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.780
Is 120 equal to 3
times something?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.060
Well, we could just try to test
and divide it from the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.410
get go, but hopefully,
you already know the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.630
divisibility rule.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.220
To figure out if something is
divisible by 3, you add up its

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.910
digits, and if the
sum is divisible

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.600
by 3, we're in business.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.540
So if you take 120-- let
me do it over here.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.180
1 plus 2 plus 0, well, that's
equal to 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 0

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.700
is 3, and 3 is definitely
divisible by 3.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.610
So 120 is going to be
divisible by 3.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.050
To figure what that number that
you have to multiply by 3

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.840
is, you could do it
in your head.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.140
You could say, well, 3 goes into
12 four times, and then

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.440
you-- well, let me just do it
out, just in case, just for

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.030
those of you who want to
see it worked out.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.090
3 goes into 12 four times.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.570
4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.460
You subtract.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.690
You're left with nothing here.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.680
You bring down this 0.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.730
3 goes into 0 zero times.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.940
0 times 3 is 0.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.510
Nothing left over.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.077
So it goes into it
forty times.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.110
And the way to think of it in
your head is this is the same

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.860
thing as 12 times 10.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.280
12 divided by 3 is 4, but this
is going to be 4 times 10,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.630
because you have that
10 left over.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.740
Whatever works for you.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.070
Or you can just ignore the 0,
divide by 3, you get a 4, and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.290
then put the 0 back there.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.370
Whatever works.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.650
So we have two more factors.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.780
At the low end, we have 3, and
at the high end, we have a 40.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.600
Now, let's see if 4 divisible
into 120.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.030
Now we saw the divisibility
rule for 4 is you ignore

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.300
everything beyond the tens
places and you just look at

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.040
the last two digits.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.700
So if we're going to to think
about whether 4 is divisible,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.130
you just look at the
last two digits.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.130
The last two digits are 20.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.430
20 is definitely divisible
by 4, so 120 will be

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.220
divisible by 4.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.180
4 is going to be a factor.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.250
And to figure out what we have
to multiply 4 by to get 120,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.100
you could do it in your head.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.430
You could say 12 divided
by 4 is 3, so 120

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.210
divided by 4 is 30.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.890
So we have two more
factors: 4 and 30.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.670
And you could work this out in
long division if you want to

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.940
make sure that this works out,
so let's keep going.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.750
And then we have 120 is equal
to-- is 5 a factor?

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.630
Is 5 times something
equal to 120?

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.750
Well, you can't do that simple--
well, first of all,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.550
we could just test
is it divisible?

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.650
And 120 ends with a 0.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.400
If you end with a 0 or a 5,
you are divisible by 5.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.340
So 5 definitely goes into it.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.690
Let's figure out
how many times.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.575
So 5 goes into 120.

00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:00.830
It doesn't go into 1.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.750
It goes into 12 two times.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.780
2 times 5 is 10.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.850
Subtract.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.130
You get 2.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.830
Bring down the 0.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.290
5 goes into 20 four times.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:18.620
4 times 5 is 20, and then you
subtract, and you have no left

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.120
over, as we expect, because
it should go in evenly.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.760
This number ends with
a 0 or a 5.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.640
Let me delete all of this so we
can have our scratch space

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.680
to work with later on.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.810
So 5 times 24 is also equal
to 120, we have two more

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.950
factors: 5 and 24.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.400
Let me clear up some space here
because I think we're

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.510
going to be dealing with
a lot of factors.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.230
So let me move this
right here.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.400
Let me cut it and then let me
paste it and move this over

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.680
here so we have more space
for our factors.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.580
So we have 5 and 24.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.590
Let's move on to 6.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.470
So 120 is equal to
6 times what?

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.050
Now, to be divisible by
6, you have to be

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.370
divisible by 2 and 3.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.630
Now, we know that we're already
divisible by 2 and 3,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.530
so we're definitely going to
be divisible by 6, and you

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.140
should hopefully be able to
do this one in your head.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.300
5 was a little bit harder to do
in your head. but 120, you

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.930
could say, well, 12 divided by 6
is 2, and then you have that

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.140
0 there, so 120 divided
by 6 would be 20.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.550
And you could work it out in
long division if you like.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.925
So 6 times 20 are two
more factors.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.850
Now let's think about 7.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.230
Let's think about 7 here.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.490
7 is a very bizarre number, and
just to test it, you could

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.900
think of other ways to do it.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.130
Let's just try to divide
7 into 120.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.300
7 doesn't go into 1.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.070
It goes into 12 one time.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.130
1 times 7 is 7.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.020
You subtract.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.150
12 minus 7 is 5.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.000
Bring down the 0.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.610
7 times 7 is 49, so it goes
into it seven times.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.650
7 times 7 is 49.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.480
Subtract.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.820
You have a remainder, so it
does not divide evenly.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.515
So 7 does not work.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.770
Now let's think about 8.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.680
Let's think about
whether 8 works.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.360
Let's think about 8.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.850
I'll do the same process.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:26.540
Let's take 8 into 120.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.890
Let's just work it out.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.640
And just as a little bit
of a hint-- well, I'll

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.270
just work it out.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.390
8 goes into 12-- it doesn't
go into 1, so it

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.500
goes into 12 one time.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.250
1 times 8 is 8.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.240
Subtract there.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.160
12 minus 8 is 4.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.150
Bring down the 0.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.280
8 goes into 40 five times.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.190
5 times 8 is 40, and you're left
with no remainder, so it

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.940
goes evenly.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.250
So 120-- let me get
rid of that.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:08:02.630
120 is equal to 8 times 15, so
let's add that to our factor

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:09.440
list. We now have an 8
and now we have a 15.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.920
Now, is it divisible by 9?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.870
Is 120 divisible by 9?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.300
To test that out, you just
add up the digits.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.430
1 plus 2 plus 0 is equal to 3.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.350
Well, that'll satisfy our 3
divisibility rule, but 3 is

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.320
not divisible by 9, so our
number will not be

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.700
divisible by 9.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.380
So 9 will not work out.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.950
9 does not work out.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.730
So let's move on to 10.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.450
Well, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.679
It ends in 0, so we will
be divisible by 10.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.559
So let me write that down.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:46.610
120 is equal to 10 times--
and this is pretty

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.780
straightforward-- 10 times 12.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.560
This is exactly what 120 is.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.800
It's 10 times 12, so let's
write those factors down.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.500
10 and 12.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.220
And then we have one
number left.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.740
We have 11.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.440
We don't have to go above 11,
because we already went

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.670
through 12, and we know that
there aren't any factors above

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.270
that, because we were going in
descending order, so we've

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.610
really filled in all the gaps.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.830
You could try 11.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.040
We could try it by hand,
if you like.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.370
11 goes into 120-- now you know,
if with you know your

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.880
multiplication tables through
11, that this won't work, but

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.900
I'll just show you.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.250
11 goes into 12 one time.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.250
1 times 11 is 11.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.630
Subtract.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.460
1, bring down the 0.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.010
11 goes into 10 zero times.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.960
0 times 11 is 0.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.500
you're left with a
remainder of 10.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.150
So 11 goes into 20 ten times
with a remainder of 10.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.900
It definitely does
not go in evenly.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:45.220
So we have all of our factors
here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:51.260
12, 15, 20, 24, 30,
40, 60 and 120.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.750
And we're done!
