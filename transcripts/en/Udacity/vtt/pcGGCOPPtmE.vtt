00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In lecture, we said the number of rabbits in a given month was = to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the number of rabbits the previous month + the number of rabbits 2 months ago.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In the new model, we have the same number of growth of rabbits,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but instead we're going to subtract the number of rabbits that are 5 months old

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to account for them dying.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Astute readers will know that this doesn't actually model death correctly of rabbits,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but it's a good example for coding a recursive function.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So with this in mind, let's get to the programming.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So the first thing I've done is at our base case,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which was defined in the problem statement.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And if it's not the base case, we're just going to plug in the formula

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that we got from the problem statement.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So this may look like it's finished, but there's one issue,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and that is, what we'd do and say n = 3, when 3 - 5 is a negative number,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we don't have anything to account for that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We're just going to continue forever, basically,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because we're never going to hit the base case of 1 or 2.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So we need to actually add a second base case.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And our second base case, basically, says if we had a number that's not 1 or 2,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
or below a 1 or 2, then we're going to return 0 and not effect the count

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
of the number of rabbits alive for that month.
