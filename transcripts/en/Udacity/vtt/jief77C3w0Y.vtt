00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.002
In order to understand social cognitive theories of personality, let's just

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:07.166
look at this graph of two hypothetical people. A and B. So the basic idea is

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:13.296
that these two people bring different interpretations to each situation. In

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:18.167
this case, nine different situations. So on the horizontal axis, we have these

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:22.955
social factors or the situation. And on the vertical axis, we have the

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:28.640
probability that the person will act in a certain way, in this case, hostility.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.735
So overall you can see, this profile, that person A acts more hostility than

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:39.146
person B in many of the situations. But not all. And if you took an average

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:44.769
across all situations, person A would be more hostile than person B. So, social

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.978
cognitive explanations of personality therefore argue that behavior is a result

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:54.593
of this interaction. Between the personal and that is cognitive believes and

00:00:54.593 --> 00:00:58.871
the social, that is the situational factors, that is between internal and

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:04.239
external forces. Some different people bring different beliefs and

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.560
interpretations to each situation and therefore have different personalities.
