PAUL GOUGE: Playdemic
is a mobile game

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.260
developer and publisher.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.760
We are based in
Wilmslow, Manchester

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.177
and we make free-to-play
mobile games.

00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:15.760
Our hit product is a game called
Golf Clash, one of the top 30

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.740
grossing mobile
games on Google Play

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.270
and the number two sports
game on Google Play.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.440
Playdemic was founded by
myself and Alex Rigby.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.900
Alex is a longstanding
friend of mine,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.480
and he and I really
grew up together.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.590
Gaming was always something
that we loved to do.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.890
In fact, we actually wrote
a fanzine about video games

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.559
at one point, which really shows
the depths of our geekiness.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.100
Our vision for Golf Clash was
to create something that really

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.579
was less about golf and
more about a competitive,

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.870
fun-to-play game you could
simply play in three or four

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.440
minutes standing in the queue
or the bus stop or at home.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.120
After testing many
ideas, we found

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.310
that golf in its purest
sense-- simply getting

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.220
a ball into a hole-- was
something that really appealed.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.410
We wanted the player to be
able to pick up that game

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.630
and play it with one thumb.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.090
One thumb gaming is something
that's very important to us.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.640
That simple easy to access
mechanic that we believe

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.430
Golf Clash really expresses.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.870
Golf Clash has done
incredibly well since launch.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.620
We've had many
millions of installs,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.340
and we're now played
by a million players

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.490
every single day, which makes
us very happy as developers.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.320
We've been amazed
by the engagement.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.440
On Google Play, we see an
average of 44 minutes a day

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.980
committed by our players to
the game over three sessions.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.849
We've also seen
great monetization.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.640
The average revenue
per user on Google Play

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.300
is the same as on
the other platforms.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.814
Half of our business is now
generated by Google Play.

00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:33.230
GARETH JONES: Over
the years we've

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.430
been making free to
play games, we've

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.070
learned live apps are vital
to really entertaining

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.220
engaging players to play the
game over long periods of time.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.920
As developers, we
need to come up

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.000
with ways of
surprising our players,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.620
giving them fun content
that engages them,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.820
and as a result of that, they
may go on to spend more money.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.320
The tournaments were
our first version

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.712
of a live app in the game.

00:01:57.712 --> 00:01:59.420
We knew that the users
wanted tournaments

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.760
from the feedback
they were giving us

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.330
through the ratings
and the review.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.990
So we developed a system
that ran for a week.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.940
We cosigned it to run
alongside a real world golf

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.550
event for the players that
really do follow golf.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.665
And it proved a huge success.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.290
PAUL GOUGE: In fact,
we saw our revenue

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.831
double during that
week, which really

00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:18.670
showed how much the players
enjoyed that experience.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.920
GARETH JONES: That will
now become a stable part

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.110
of our live app strategy.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.420
We'll have a regular
cadence of tournaments

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.320
we can drive live data so we
don't need to do a new release.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.835
And we'll up with a
cadence of tournaments that

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:33.100
keep the players on their
toes so they don't know when

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.750
to come back for a tournament.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.960
We'll do a lot of social
media around those events

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.130
but just keep refreshing
the content in the game

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.607
and make it surprising
and fun for the players.

00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:45.190
PAUL GOUGE: I'm really lucky to
make video games for a living.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.840
And there are very few
people in the world that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.756
can say that they get
up in the morning and go

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:50.170
do something they
love every day.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.860
I feel very fortunate to be
able to say that I do that.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.300
We were on a mission to be
one of the biggest mobile game

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.299
publishers in the world.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.280
And that remains our
focus and our passion.
