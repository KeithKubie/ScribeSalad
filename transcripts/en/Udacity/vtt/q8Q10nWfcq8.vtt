00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.290
So let's see now if we
understood way prediction.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.710
We can use way prediction
in what kind of a cache?

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.952
A fully associative cache,
an 8-way set-associative cache,

00:00:10.952 --> 00:00:15.100
a 2-way set-associative cache,
and a direct-mapped cache.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.150
Check all of those that can
benefit from way prediction.
