00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Hey everybody! My name is Daria and I'm going to telling you 10 interesting psychology facts about human feelings.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.680
So, listen on if you want to know

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.780
Number 1: There's actually a phobia for losing one's phone.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.420
"Nomophobia" is a term describing the fear of being without a mobile device

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.420
or beyond mobile phone contact.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.200
According to a study, 54% of those who were asked

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.000
actually said that they've experienced 'Nomophobia' before.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.380
And overall, women were more likely to suffer from 'Nomophobia' than men.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.040
Number 2: Without realising it, we're actually affected by other people's moods.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.860
Researchers call this phenomonon 'Emotional Conjugation

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.440
This is a natural process that pre-wired our brain, through mirror neurons, that allow us

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440
to sense and reflect on other's emotions.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.520
And as stated in the 'Chamelion Effect', we have the natural tendency to imitate another person's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
speech inflections and physical expressions.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.520
We usually mimic the actions of those we surround ourselves with.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.240
Number 3: In the past few years, psychology researchers have found a good literal truth

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.560
embedded in the metaphorical phrase comparing love to pain

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.340
Mirror imaging studies have shown that brain regions involved in processing physical pain

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.420
overlap considerably with those tied to social anguish.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.920
'Broken Heart Syndrome' is categorised by normal coronary arteries,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.860
regional wall motion abnormalities that extend beyond a single vascular bend,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.660
and often a precipitating stresser.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.720
It's temporary that this is often brought up on social situations such as the loss of a loved one.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.120
Number 4: When we hug, the chemical that the brain releases is a hormone called 'Oxytocin';

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.880
a hormone recognised for it's role in social attachment and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.740
facilitations of social interaction. It's also important in the formation of trust.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.080
Number 5: It was proposed in one study, that the normal, unremarkable experiences associated with

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.380
everyday living could deplete one's capacity to resist moral temptations.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.760
The study proposes that most likely, people have less self-control when they're tired.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.000
Another study concluded that the average adult has less self-control as the day wears on,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.300
becoming more likely to become "immoral" by the end of the afternoon.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.380
Number 6: Desensitisation is defined as the diminished emotional responsiveness to a negative or aversive stimulus

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.360
after repeated exposure to it.  In a study conducted recently, parents who were subjected to watching movies

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.740
that contained violence and sex have shown that there is an increase in acceptance to both types of content.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.500
Even to the extent of willingness to showing it to their children.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.840
There is also evidence among people who play video games.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.040
Number 7: I don't think it's a new thing that we consider chocolate as the new 'love drug'.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.140
Chocolate has been widely known as being a staple for showing love.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.020
But why is that so? It contains

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.200
'Tryptophan', a chemical in the brain that is used to produce 'Serotonin' the 'feel good' brain chemical

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.720
that plays a major role in positive mood, emotional health, proper sleep and balanced appetite.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.540
It works by stimulating the brains pleasure centers and reaches it's peak level during orgasm.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.120
Number 8: Psychological researchers classified 6 facial expressions which correspond to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.780
distinct universal emotions.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.500
Disgust, Sadness, Happiness, Fear, Anger and Surprise.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.520
Theorists have also hypothesized that the universals are to be found in the relationship

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.460
between distinctive moments of the facial muscles and the particular emotions.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.260
Number 9: Mirror neurons are the brains hardware floor,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.460
harmonising individuals to their environment.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.860
The mirror neurons when you blush when you see someone else humiliated, flinch when someone

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.840
someone else is struck, can't resist the urge to laugh in a big group of people

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.760
when seeing the group stuck with giggles.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.220
It's been said that these neurons have given us the capability of empathy,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.300
allowing us to feel what other people feel, both physically and emotionally. :)
