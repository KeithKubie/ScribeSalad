KELLY BAILEY: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.220
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.290
I'm Kelly Bailey.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.800
I'm a recruiter in the
JTAG organization here.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.270
So I'm really, really excited
to be here to introduce Emily.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.440
So she is an author.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
And she specializes in
science and culture.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.000
Her stories have been featured
in a variety of publications,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.120
like the "New York Times" and a
couple of my favorite podcasts,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.060
like "This American
Life" and "RadioLab."

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.070
And she is also a recipient
of the Pulitzer Traveling

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.190
Fellowship, which,
I think, allowed you

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.647
to travel and
research for the book

00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:41.230
that you're here to
talk about, today,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.140
"The Dragon Behind The Glass."

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.420
So welcome.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.680
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.064
EMILY VOIGT: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:50.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.301
Thank you.

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:54.930
KELLY BAILEY: I know yesterday
was the official release.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.950
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah, that's right.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.690
KELLY BAILEY: How'd it go?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.731
EMILY VOIGT: It was good.

00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:59.930
It was really exciting
to finally see it out.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.250
It's been a long time coming.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.854
So yeah.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.145
It was really, really exciting.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:04.836
KELLY BAILEY: Well,
congratulations.

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:05.550
EMILY VOIGT: Thank you.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.530
KELLY BAILEY: Thank
you for taking time out

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.680
of your busy schedule.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.980
I know you just had a little
one, too-- so super busy.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.810
But would you like to give
us all a quick summary

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.040
of what your inspiration
was for the book?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.790
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.400
So I thought I would just start
by telling people how I first

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.190
heard about this fish,
the Asian arowana

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.285
that "The Dragon Behind
The Glass" was about.

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:31.590
It was back in 2009--
so seven years ago.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.510
I was doing a radio story
about the exotic pet trade

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.870
in New York City.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.050
And I went with a pet
detective up to the South Bronx

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.440
to investigate reports
of an alligator there.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.657
Guy was offering an alligator
for sale on Craigslist.

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:48.740
KELLY BAILEY: It's normal.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.990
EMILY VOIGT: It was a big
bust in a housing project

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.615
and everything.

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:53.470
But we didn't find
the alligator.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.070
So I was pretty disappointed.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.550
But he kept telling me about
these illegal super expensive

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.210
fish that were being smuggled
into the city from Southeast

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.090
Asia.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.560
And he said that they
were considered good luck

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.360
in certain cultures.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.989
They were thought
to bring prosperity.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.030
And for that reason, they
had been over harvested

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.490
from the wild and were
commanding these high prices.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.370
They were protected by the
US Endangered Species Act,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.720
so you can't bring them across
the border of the United States

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.260
legally as a pet.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.600
So anyway, actually
I was totally not

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.350
thrilled to hear this
because I was hoping

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.870
to find some kind of huge
animal that you wouldn't expect

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.920
to find in the
city for my story.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.810
So I kept trying to
steer him away from fish.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.440
But then I got home and I kept
thinking about-- he told me

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.520
that this one Wall Street
banker had broken down

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.500
in tears when he had his illegal
fish confiscated from him.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.530
This is pretty wacky.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.940
I wonder what would make
somebody so compelled

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.970
to own a species that they would
take such risk-- because people

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.450
actually go to prison
for this in some cases.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.380
So I looked up the species.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.200
And I started doing
some research.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.922
And I was just absolutely
astounded by what I found.

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:15.630
So I thought what I
would do is start off

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.800
with a very short reading
from the book explaining

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.180
what happened after I got home
from that failed alligator

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.940
bust.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.590
So this is what I read.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.480
"Forget oil and diamonds.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.190
The next big thing in
Southeast Asia is fish,

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.080
I read in the hobbyist
magazine, Practical Fishkeeping,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.630
which described how 50
specimens, collectively valued

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.710
at $1 million had been placed
under 24 hour guard in Jakarta,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.330
Indonesia.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.150
While these fish may be
disappearing from the wild,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.480
their popularity amongst Asia's
richest is ever increasing.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.250
In some instances,
the species was

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.590
reared on farms that could
pass as prisons, facilities

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.820
protected by nested walls,
watchtowers, and rottweilers

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.520
that prowl the
perimeter at night.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.950
The reason for
the heavy security

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.740
became clear as I dug deeper
into the international news

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.390
archive that chronicled
a spate of fish thefts

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.360
across Southeast Asia.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.580
In Malaysia, five arowana
stolen from a woman's house

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.940
were worth more than all her
other possessions combined.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.010
Singapore, which boasts
one of the lowest crime

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.740
rates in the world, once
reported four such heists

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.460
in a single week.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.250
One thief punched
out an elderly woman

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.264
who chased him as he made
off with a prized fish

00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:27.672
in a sloshing bucket.

00:04:27.672 --> 00:04:29.380
He was sentenced to
three years in prison

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.572
and 12 strokes of a wet cane.

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:33.440
As for who was
taking the fish, some

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.130
surmised that thieves were
fish lovers who could not

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.570
afford the astronomical prices.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.370
Others suspected that
a crime syndicate

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.390
was behind the thefts, a
sort of shadowy fish mafia.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.050
Bolstering this theory was a
harrowing case in Indonesia

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.850
where an arowana dealer and
his heavily armed cronies

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.860
allegedly kidnapped and held
for ransom a Japanese buyer.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.660
Despite all this
criminality, however,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.750
the trade in the farmed fish
was legal, not only in Asia,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.270
but throughout
most of the world,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.440
including Canada and Europe.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.090
The one major exception,
other than the United States,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.340
being Australia which
bans the species

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.540
to protect its own
tropical fauna.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.440
A few years back, a
45-year-old housewife

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.820
was arrested at the
Melbourne airport trying

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.710
to enter the country
with 51 fish,

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.207
including an Asian arowana
hidden beneath her poofy skirt.

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:23.290
'We became suspicious after
hearing these flipping

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.770
and flapping noises,' a customs
officials later told the press.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.540
Such absurd tales
of smuggling kept me

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.140
up late as I pored
through the 100

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.550
some articles I'd printed out
and spread across my living

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.010
room floor.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.580
The picture that
gradually emerged,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.930
however, looked less like
the illegal drug trade

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.960
and more like a parody of
Manhattan's overheated art

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.960
scene, complete
with record breaking

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.050
prices, anonymous
buyers, stolen specimens,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.990
unsavory dealers, and
even clever fakes.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.720
Whatever the best
metaphor, it seemed

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.290
the Asian arowana had a long
history of driving human beings

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.820
to dangerous extremes.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.820
One summer in college,
I read Jane Goodall's

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.640
"In the Shadow of
Man," and ever since, I

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.140
dreamed of venturing
into the jungle

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.330
to write a great
story about wildlife.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.490
Around the time my curiosity
in the arowana began,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.060
I've been awarded a fellowship
intended to fund a reporting

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.600
project abroad.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.890
Now, I knew how I'd use it.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.890
I would go see for myself where
all these smuggled arowana were

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.490
coming from and what made
the species so irresistible.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.850
Goodall had her noble
tool wielding primates.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.596
I would have the bad
tempered, bony tongued fish.

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:28.730
It was obvious where to start.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.300
At the center of
the glamorous world

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.890
of Southeast Asian
aquaculture reigned

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.370
a flamboyant Singaporean
tastemaker known as Kenny

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.800
the Fish, a chain
smoking millionaire

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.480
fond of posing nude behind
strategically placed

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.210
aquatic pets.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.920
The Fish's real
name was Kenny Yap.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.520
And he was the executive
chairman of an ornamental fish

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.970
farm so lucrative that it
was listed on Singapore's

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.000
main stock exchange.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.230
Recently, the Singaporean
press had dubbed him

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.240
one of the city's most
eligible bachelor's

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.690
and called for him to host a
national spin of Donald Trump's

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.040
reality show, "The Apprentice."

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.370
To enter his website, I had
to click on his belly button.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.030
I've since come to think of
this navel as the rabbit hole

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.090
into which I fell not to
emerge from some three

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.540
and a half years."

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.830
KELLY BAILEY: Oh, my gosh.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.870
I'm not going to lie.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.870
When I first started
reading this book,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.820
I thought it was fiction because
this Kenny the Fish character

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.400
sounded so outlandish.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.570
He sounds like he's straight
out of "The Godfather."

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.940
So could you tell us what your
expectations and impressions

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.190
were-- because you actually
had the opportunity

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.411
to see him in his natural
environment and meet him?

00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:42.660
So what were your impressions?

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.780
EMILY VOIGT: Right.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.750
In his natural habitat.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.104
KELLY BAILEY: In
his natural habitat.

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:49.270
EMILY VOIGT: So Kenny really
drew me into the story.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.770
And I was thinking back on it.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.580
And for me, he's a little
bit like the Wizard

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.610
in The Wizard of Oz.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.060
So I kind of started with him.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.710
And then I went off on
this strange adventure.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.880
But he was always kind of
the man behind the curtain.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.010
There was this
glamorous world that I

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.544
was trying to get behind.

00:08:12.544 --> 00:08:13.460
KELLY BAILEY: Totally.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.390
EMILY VOIGT: And he represented
the public face of that.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.742
Singapore actually
exports more pet fish

00:08:19.742 --> 00:08:21.200
than any other
country in the world

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.200
so that it makes sense
that I would start there.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.530
And he's kind of like the
kingpin of this industry.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.810
They used to be famous--
it's been true of a long time

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.799
that Singapore is
the hub of the trade.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.630
But they used to be
famous for guppies.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.956
They were called guppy kingdom.

00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:38.039
And I mean-- the guppy
versus inverse the arowana.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.669
Big difference.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.710
KELLY BAILEY: Little bit.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.668
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah, not
just in size-- the guppy

00:08:41.668 --> 00:08:44.770
is like this big and the
arowana is pretty huge--

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.510
but also in price, and
mystique, and so forth.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.220
So Kenny had come
along at a point where

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.650
there was a sexy make over
of the ornamental fish trade,

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.970
a very traditional trade.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.458
And he knew how to give
it this exciting new face.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.350
And he has a very
carefully crafted image.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.500
So for example, he came
up with his own nickname,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.260
Kenny the Fish.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.030
And he was actually-- he told
me was getting a passport

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.870
photo taken when he
was suddenly inspired

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.594
to strip down to a g-string
and just pose with a fish.

00:09:19.594 --> 00:09:20.760
KELLY BAILEY: That's normal.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.510
I think we've all been there.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.387
We've all been there.

00:09:22.387 --> 00:09:23.470
EMILY VOIGT: Right, right.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.840
So I'm sure that the
photographer was surprised,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.090
but probably also thrilled.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.970
So he definitely
represented a lot of color.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.460
He calls himself naughty a lot.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.770
So he would say,
I'm just naughty.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.870
I'm just playful and naughty.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.900
But the truth is-- but it's all
in this very innocent fun way--

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.250
And sort of shiny,
happy, smiley way.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.490
I say, he always has a practiced
expression of ecstatic delight

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.350
because his face is
plastered everywhere,

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.692
not just on his farm, but
also throughout Singapore.

00:09:57.692 --> 00:09:59.650
And so my associate, he's
a bit of a celebrity.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.531
So he's always just
beaming in ecstasy.

00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:06.160
But when I asked
him about-- and so

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.010
he offered me this
wonderful entry point

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.040
into the world of the arowana.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.620
But when I asked
him about-- well,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.870
what about all these fish
robberies that I read about.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.260
He was like, what
fish robberies?

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.222
I didn't think the answer.

00:10:21.222 --> 00:10:24.420
So it was always this weird
tension between the fact

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.140
that the fish hobby is--
pet fish themselves.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.410
They're these very
innocent things.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.150
We associate them
with childhood.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:39.170
And the hobby itself is very
educational and kind of sweet.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.930
There was this
tension between that.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.920
And then the fact that there
was indeed a darker side

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.770
to the trade.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.540
And there is a genuine
sense of menace

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.880
that's connected with this.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.880
So for example, a Malaysian
member of parliament,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.490
while I was reporting on
this, received a text message

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.910
with a dead arowana.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.870
And they took it seriously
as a death threat.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.460
KELLY BAILEY: Oh, my gosh.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.990
EMILY VOIGT: And
actually, even stranger,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.940
while I was reporting on this,
the head of the Indonesian

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.160
national police, the Chief
Detective of the Indonesian

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.390
National Police, which is
the equivalent of the FBI,

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.990
was brought down by the fish.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.620
So he landed in
prison over a bribe

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.290
that he had taken related
to one of these fish farms.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.140
So it just always
seemed like the fish was

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.850
connected to very high places.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.380
And you can never quite
tell what was true.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.300
I talked to one of these farms.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.126
It took me a while
to find a farm that

00:11:39.126 --> 00:11:41.500
was willing to talk about some
of the fish robberies that

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.010
were going on.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.370
Some were reported in the press.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.900
But largely, people would say
that they hadn't heard of it.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.380
And finally, I
found this guy who

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.270
said he had been robbed eight
times in the last decade.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.700
So he had been tied up.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.050
And there were just
bandits coming and taking

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.290
the fish in the night.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:02.140
And nobody was quite sure who
was behind it and so forth.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.440
So that kind of thing.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.790
And there were rumors even
of fish related murders.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.130
And it took me a very long
time to pin down whether there

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.282
is any truth to that.

00:12:15.282 --> 00:12:16.490
KELLY BAILEY: Yeah, I'm sure.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:21.800
And with a character like Kenny
the Fish, where do you start?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.680
So Kenny the Fish isn't
the only very outlandish--

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.570
I want to say character.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.390
But they're real
people in this book.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.800
So I do feel like
sometimes just the lines

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.420
between fiction and nonfiction--
I was constantly confused.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.800
But as you were writing
the book, what would

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.260
you say were some of
your greatest challenges

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.850
when you were
researching and meeting

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.730
these different
characters and people,

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.292
looking for the arowana?

00:12:55.292 --> 00:12:57.750
EMILY VOIGT: So you talk about
how outlandish the world is.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:02.840
And so the whole book is
definitely nonfiction.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.890
And so because I was
doing a nonfiction book,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.480
I really needed to know
what the truth was.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.790
And it's definitely a
smoke and mirrors world.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.230
So separating myth
from reality was

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.020
one of the biggest challenges.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.020
It took a long time
in some instances.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.270
So one of the first things
that I wanted to find out

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.667
was that-- so the
fish actually-- it's

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:27.750
a lot like the art market.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.285
As I said before--
most of the fish

00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:32.910
sell when they're about the size
of a finger, when they're just

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.520
babies.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.730
And they sell for maybe
like $1,000-- $2,000.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:39.830
But it goes up from there.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.790
And it depends on all kinds
of very particular details

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.290
of the fish.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.020
Like it's finnage-- which is
not a word I used to use a lot.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:53.570
And its scales, the
shape of its eye.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.892
And it's personality.

00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:57.600
You want a fish that's
pretty aggressive.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.745
You don't want one
that's nice, apparently.

00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:15.610
Basically, the highest recorded
prices were in the six figures.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.390
But it was always
an anonymous buyer--

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.430
like some anonymous
Japanese man who

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.316
bought this fish for $150,000.

00:14:21.316 --> 00:14:23.130
And you're like, did
that really happen?

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.367
Is that just some kind of--
so I was really, really

00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:26.950
determined to get
to the bottom of it.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.160
And I attended-- so when I
went to meet Kenny the Fish,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.720
I was incredibly fortunate.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.630
It was a really opportune moment
to have landed in Singapore

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.070
because Aquarama was going on.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:41.480
Aquarama is-- it's
this huge event.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.460
It's the Westminster
Dog Show of pet fish.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.430
So little show fish show
up in their plastic baggies

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.310
and compete for top prizes.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:57.560
But the arowana are, by far, the
star attraction of this show.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.330
So when I was there, the biggest
thing that happened that year

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.790
were that there were
these 10 albino arowanas.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.940
As albinos were the ones
that sold for the most money,

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.540
historically.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.270
But they would appear
on the market--

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.484
I don't know-- it was like a
rare Vermeer coming to light.

00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:17.900
But this was like-- all of a
sudden, there are 10 of them.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.520
Nobody knew where they came
from, or who owned them,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.560
or what was going on.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.450
So I tracked down the
guy who had bred them.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.588
And it was this crazy story
about this Indonesian coal

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:31.520
tycoon who was
crazy about albinos.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.080
And he had a zoo in Borneo
that was just albino animals.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:41.220
And so word that came to
him of birth of an albino

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.230
at one of these farms.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.700
And he traveled to the see it.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.040
He stared at the fish all night.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.540
And then he said to the farmer,
you must stop selling fish.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.841
And then he started-- it
was this long seven year

00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:53.590
period of breeding
them, and then breeding

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.840
the offspring with each other.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.780
And eventually, they
bred these albinos.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.470
So the idea was
that they were just

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.130
going to sell them to
celebrities and royalty-- one

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.990
to each country.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.210
Reminded me of the golden
tickets in "Charlie

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.150
and the Chocolate Factory."

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.590
And so he told me the Sultan
of Johor had bought one.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.990
A high ranking member of
the Chinese Communist Party

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.310
had bought a fish, supposedly,
for he said, $300,000.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.000
KELLY BAILEY: Oh, my gosh.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.416
EMILY VOIGT: So I
was like, I have

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:22.072
to meet one of these people.

00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:24.170
I wasn't willing to
believe that it was true.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.640
So he actually
arranged for me to go

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.090
meet the guy who had bought
one of these fish in Taiwan.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.745
He was a plastics magnate who
made his fortune manufacturing

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:38.640
toothbrush bristles of all
things and barbie hair.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.610
And when you think about
it, they're very similar.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.480
So he made all this money off
of his toothbrush bristles.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.630
And he spent $150,000 on
his fish, according to him.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.070
It's like the art market.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.170
There's no downside to saying
that you paid a certain amount.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.380
So both the dealer and
the buyer will sometimes

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.022
inflate the prices.

00:16:59.022 --> 00:17:00.980
But I do believe they
sell for a lot of money--

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.025
whatever the exact
figure may be.

00:17:03.025 --> 00:17:04.800
KELLY BAILEY: I still
can't wrap my mind

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.730
around how much some of the
fish in the book that you were

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.520
describing were being sold for.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.040
So speaking of the arowana--
you guys have seen the cover.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.970
This is the arowana.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.380
It is really dramatic.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.633
When I first picked up the
book, I was like, what is this?

00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:26.130
Is it actually a fish?

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.520
I thought it was a dragon--
like, legitimately.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.640
What would you say are--
well, first, I guess,

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.690
is this the actual
super red arowana

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.130
that you were looking for?

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.070
And then how did you go about
choosing this particular image?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.775
How did you choose
this for the cover?

00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:44.900
EMILY VOIGT: Well, I agree.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.880
I love the cover.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.000
So the publisher did that.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.880
Scribner did that.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.570
And they did a beautiful job.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.904
I think they did a gorgeous job.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.361
KELLY BAILEY: Yeah,
it's beautiful.

00:17:53.361 --> 00:17:56.160
EMILY VOIGT: But it is the
super red-- which nobody in here

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.660
knows what we're talking about.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.450
So arowana-- I should also
just back up for a second

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.770
and explain that it's
a family of fish.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.970
So there's seven species across
the tropics of the globe.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.040
And the really expensive
one is the Asian arowana.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.390
That's also the
most endangered one.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.260
And it comes in these
different color varieties.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.490
Because of the islands
throughout Southeast Asia,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.120
you have different
populations that have evolved

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.370
in these different landmasses.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.660
So there's three main
ones, green, gold, and red.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.756
Green-- psh-- forget about it.

00:18:28.756 --> 00:18:30.700
You don't want a green one.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.880
I'm not sure why.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.690
But gold and red
are very valuable.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.050
Gold is sort of a
more recent-- it's

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.900
more popular more recently.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.556
But the classic one is this
fish called the super red.

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:53.220
And it comes from a single lake
system in the heart of Borneo.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.130
And I actually
became-- so I wanted

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.900
to know if the fish still
existed in the wild.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.220
And I became somewhat
obsessed with it,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.230
especially beginning
on that first trip when

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.690
I had gone over to
Singapore because I was

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:08.920
hearing all kinds of things.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.469
Oh, yeah-- they're still there.

00:19:10.469 --> 00:19:11.760
They're in the heart of Borneo.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.260
It's fine.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.050
The population is
doing really well.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.720
Other people say
it's totally gone.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.020
It doesn't exist anymore.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.380
So I was like, OK,
I'm going to find out.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.880
So I end up canceling
my flight home

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.320
after I went to see the
Taiwanese toothbrush bristle

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.820
tycoon.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.830
And I flew back to Borneo
to try to get there.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.190
And basically, I ended
up knee deep in a swamp

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.270
realizing I have no
idea how to do this.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.410
How do you know if
a fish is there?

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.970
It took me so long
to get to the swamp.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.340
And then it's like black water.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.700
So you can't even see into it.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.120
And I had never been
fishing a day in my life.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.600
I didn't speak the language.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.790
I went home, and I felt
like a total failure.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.980
So I felt like I
had failed at that.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.210
And I kept thinking
about this man who I felt

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.460
could have helped me.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.630
He was the one who I
had met at Aquarama.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.899
He's a superstar
in the fish world.

00:20:09.899 --> 00:20:10.940
His name is Heiko Bleher.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.100
He's a German
ichthyological explorer.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.780
In fact, he is a
third generation

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.623
German ichthyological explorer.

00:20:19.623 --> 00:20:23.490
So his grandfather had one of
the biggest ornamental fish

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.762
farms in the world in 1900,
at the turn of the century

00:20:27.762 --> 00:20:28.640
in Frankfurt.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.205
And then his mother took
him and his three siblings-

00:20:33.205 --> 00:20:36.590
so her four children to
the Amazon rain forest

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.880
to another uncharted
section of the Amazon,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.480
which is still pretty wild
today-- but in the 1950s.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.980
This was just
completely unheard of.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.530
He was seven years old.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.060
She took them to go
find what was then

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.300
the most expensive
pet fish in the world.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.280
It was a fish called
the discus, which

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.190
is this perfectly
round fish that

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.070
looks like the Greek discus.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:02.360
So she went in search of
this elusive discus fish.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.270
And then they got lost.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.840
And they ended up living
among cannibals for two years.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.019
Yeah.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:11.830
So I was like, huh?

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.750
So Heiko Bleher.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.720
Since then, he had
basically never stopped

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.890
in the manic pursuit
of new species.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.610
I mean, he was just
all over the world.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.270
I would run into him
and he would say,

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.560
I've been to Tajikistan
and Australia.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.490
He was just everywhere all the
time, constantly traveling.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.641
He was kind of like
the Jacques Cousteau

00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:31.766
of freshwater or something.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.500
So I started thinking
about this man

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.770
and thinking that he was the
one who could have helped me.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.370
And the book came about
when he looked me up

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.620
when he came through New York.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.980
And I just got this
idea that the two of us

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.810
would go find this
fish in Borneo.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.920
And that would be
how the story went.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.920
And of course, you know
that it took many twists

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.829
and turns that I
had not expected.

00:21:57.829 --> 00:21:58.620
KELLY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.970
I mean everyone
should read this book.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:05.360
It was absurdly, absurdly--
I was at the edge of my seat.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.008
EMILY VOIGT: Thank you.

00:22:07.008 --> 00:22:08.660
KELLY BAILEY: So
I guess-- I was--

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.220
get you to pivot a little.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.020
I was surprised going
through the book--

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:17.700
I was expecting an Indiana
Jones pursuit of this arowana.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:23.333
But what kind of struck me was
how much conservation came up

00:22:23.333 --> 00:22:25.740
throughout the-- I just feel
like notes of conservation

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.300
and just the environment
came up throughout the book.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.080
And you explain, at some
point, that because of supply

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.880
and demand, there's
these fish farms.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.500
And they're breeding these
arowana and other rare fish,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.510
which may be causing
a negative effect

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.210
with the natural
wild population.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.740
And I thought that was
just very surprising

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.700
and something I hadn't
really thought of before.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.380
What would you say are a
few of the surprising things

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.900
that you've learned
while writing

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.295
"Dragon Behind The Glass"?

00:23:02.295 --> 00:23:04.444
EMILY VOIGT: So one of the
first surprising things

00:23:04.444 --> 00:23:06.360
I learned came right out
of the mouth of Kenny

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.874
the Fish when I
landed in Singapore.

00:23:07.874 --> 00:23:10.290
I was talking to him about
what made the fish so valuable.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.706
And I thought he was going to
talk about Feng Shui and all

00:23:12.706 --> 00:23:15.160
these-- some kind of ancient
Chinese tradition basically.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:15.895
And he didn't.

00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:18.270
He was just talking about some
treaty that's administered

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.186
by the United Nations.

00:23:19.186 --> 00:23:21.510
And that the fish is on it.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.920
And I didn't put it
all together at first.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.890
But basically, I
thought that there

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.520
would be this deep history to
this fish in Asian cultures.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.790
And there simply wasn't.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.810
Just a few decades back,
people were eating this.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.550
This was what you ate
for dinner in the swamp.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.770
And it wasn't even
a good food fish.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:43.770
That's kind of an aside.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:48.380
But people complained it's
kind of bony and bland.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.860
In the 60s, southeast Asia was
losing a lot of its jungles

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.930
to development.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.800
And at the same time-- this fish
is-- it's a very large fish.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.776
It's an apex predator.

00:23:58.776 --> 00:23:59.900
And it's a slow reproducer.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.350
Some of them can take up
to six years to reproduce.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.770
So the populations
were dwindling.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.444
And it was right
at the time that

00:24:07.444 --> 00:24:09.610
the international community
was trying to figure out

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:14.940
how we could organize the
trade in animals and threatened

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.130
animals so that we could get our
act together and protect them

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.720
from the international trade.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.260
And it's almost as a fluke
that this fish ended up

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.050
as a test case in conservation.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.640
It got put on this
list called CITES,

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.210
which is now one of the
largest conservation

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.630
agreements in the world.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.330
But at the time,
it was brand new.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.350
It was put on
appendix 1, which is

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.180
like the rarest of
the rare species.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.330
And it was subject to an
international trade ban.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:45.880
And very soon thereafter, it
became this coveted commodity.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.430
Now, it's very difficult to
prove causality vs correlation.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.330
But what I can say is it
just was not a phenomenon

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.340
until it had this
official stamp of rarity.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.720
And that now conservation
biologists-- some of them,

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.870
have looked and said
that, in fact, you

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.256
do have to be careful about
the perception of rarity

00:25:04.256 --> 00:25:06.130
and when you're declaring
an animal in danger

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.600
that it doesn't suddenly spike
its price on the black market.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.020
But it's interesting,
too, looking

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.574
at this fish-- it really is an
encapsulation of the history

00:25:14.574 --> 00:25:16.740
of conservation-- the modern
history of conservation

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.570
because, originally, the idea
was just to ban everything.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.700
That was what we
started out by doing.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:28.700
And then gradually, there was a
move towards sustainable trade.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.970
So the example that's
often given-- and I talk

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.428
about it a little
bit in the book--

00:25:32.428 --> 00:25:35.310
is crocodilians--
crocodiles and alligators.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.800
They were pushed to the
brink of extinction--

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.530
a huge number of
the species on Earth

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:48.680
were just in a terrible
way after World War

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.090
II because they're is so much
demand for crocodile leather.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.830
And then, they tried banning
it-- banning the trade

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.620
in crocodilians.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.870
It didn't really work.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.270
What worked was ranching them.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.750
So you basically would go
into their natural habitat,

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.000
collect some eggs, raise
them on these farms,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.680
and then sell their skins.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.510
And this was probably the
greatest conservation success

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.090
story of the last quarter
of the 20th century.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:25.260
And for that reason-- when
the arowana was in a bad way--

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.610
the Asian arowana--
in the 90s, they

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.230
tried doing the
same thing with it.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.030
So they had this farming
program that arose.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.470
But there's a difference between
ranching an animal, where

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.660
you have a connection
with the wild population,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.460
and farming an
animal, where it's

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.440
a closed system and the
whole life cycle of the fish

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.990
is within the walls of a farm.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.410
So very rapidly, you start
to domesticate the creature.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.180
That's one issue.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.620
And the other is that
there's no value placed

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.537
on preserving the wild habitat.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.920
Some people still think
that it's a good way

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.790
to go for certain
threatened species.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.310
And I would say to take it
on a case by case basis.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.310
But people who
oppose it-- they say

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:13.490
it's because it creates a market
where there wasn't one before.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.280
So after CITES came in
and started these farming

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.985
programs-- so when you buy
the fish on the legal market,

00:27:20.985 --> 00:27:22.800
it has a little
microchip in it that

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.850
shows that it comes
from a certified farm.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.910
There's a rigorous
certification process.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.860
So they're not coming from
the wild for the most part.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.680
They really are farmed.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.110
But it created this
huge-- I call it

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.954
a mass produced endangered
species because, now, it's

00:27:40.954 --> 00:27:41.620
just everywhere.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.230
It's been sold-- more
than a million of them

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.700
have moved that we know of.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.540
And so far, they're
trapped between borders.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.540
But probably many more
because that doesn't take into

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.725
account the markets
within the countries

00:27:54.725 --> 00:27:55.850
that actually produce them.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.880
KELLY BAILEY: Sure.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.510
So I guess you kind of touched
on it a little bit already.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.850
But I was wondering if there
were any key takeaways that you

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.960
were hoping, in relation
to the environment,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.982
that you're trying to get
across to your readers.

00:28:11.982 --> 00:28:13.940
EMILY VOIGT: When I set
out to write this book,

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.350
I didn't want to write a
book about the environment.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.261
I was really attracted
to-- I don't think it

00:28:18.261 --> 00:28:19.510
says something great about me.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.450
But I was attracted
to the ridiculousness

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.520
of the story and the humor and
high drama of the fish world.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.350
And the old lady getting
punched out for her fish.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.190
I was very into that.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.030
But the truth is,
you really can't

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.630
write about the
arowana or any fish,

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.920
I think, today,
without coming face

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.180
to face with an
enormous amount of loss.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.860
And this is particularly
true of freshwater fish.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.170
So a lot of times when we
talk about the state of fish

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:57.550
today, people tend to focus
on marine species, especially

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.700
big ones like the tuna.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.830
And the tuna is not doing well.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.940
So I don't mean to
suggest that tunas are OK.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.000
But the truth is
that marine fishes

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.840
are in much better shape
than freshwater fishes.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.545
Freshwater is 2.5%
of the earth's water.

00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:17.420
And then-- you might
have heard this before--

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.440
but then available
freshwater-- so

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.111
surface freshwater, freshwater
that's not frozen or buried

00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:25.110
deep beneath the ground.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.460
That's one hundredth of
1% of the Earth's water.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.360
And it actually
supports nearly half

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.800
of the world's fish species.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.490
So there are about 30,000
fish that are known today.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.710
And nearly half of them
live in freshwater.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.310
And the reason for that is
that it kind of functions

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.030
like islands.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.660
It's like aquatic islands.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.100
So the same reason
that islands tend

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.300
to be hotbeds of speciation--
same thing with freshwaters.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.130
And so it's really a crucible
of the Earth's biodiversity.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:59.800
And these are incredibly
vulnerable habitats.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.040
We've done just a terrible
job in terms of dams,

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.340
in terms of pollution.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.260
And a lot of these
fish-- we haven't

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.300
paid a tremendous
amount of attention.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.120
What happens is
that you'll put up

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.820
a dam somewhere in the Amazon.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.040
And then fish go extinct
that we didn't even

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:24.640
know existed because frankly
the numbers are-- most fish

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.830
live in the tropics.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.460
Most Freshwater fish-- the vast
majority live in the tropics.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.350
And they've just been
very poorly studied

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.391
and poorly characterized.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.510
KELLY BAILEY: Going
back to the beginning

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.962
with the lieutenant up in the
Bronx that you were shadowing.

00:30:41.962 --> 00:30:45.070
It really seemed like you had
only just scratched the surface

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.540
of the issue with exotic
pet trade in the US.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.280
And then they kind of
went all over the globe.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.420
If you had the option or
perhaps the time, resources,

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.360
what would you want to learn
more about exotic pets,

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.410
specifically in the US?

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.460
EMILY VOIGT: That's a
really good question.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.830
Yeah, I definitely did
just scratch the surface.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.781
It was really crazy.

00:31:11.752 --> 00:31:14.420
I feel like there
were so many stories.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:20.310
And the arowana was the one
that caught me in particular.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.680
But when I called up
this pet detective,

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.430
initially, he was telling
me about 1300 turtles

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.350
living in this Soho apartment.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.815
And the owner didn't
have room for a bed.

00:31:34.815 --> 00:31:39.570
And a guy in Harlem with
a tiger and an alligator

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.784
that were best friends
according to him.

00:31:42.784 --> 00:31:43.950
The detective was skeptical.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.520
There's just so many stories.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.970
And the truth is it's not a
highly-- during my reporting,

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.090
I think I mentioned I
ended up visit-- a man went

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.380
to prison in New York City.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.850
Actually, he was sent to a
prison where we put John Gotti

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.740
Jr. And also the
Al Qaeda member who

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.861
was going to blow up the New
York subway system-- he got

00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:09.860
sent to the same prison.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.110
And then there was
this guy who was

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.450
in there for having pet fish.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.260
And so I went to visit him.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:21.090
And he was a pretty sweet
guy-- not to say-- I mean,

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:22.090
he was smuggling them.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.000
KELLY BAILEY:
Smuggling fish, yep.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.930
EMILY VOIGT: He was just
very genuinely enthusiastic

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.040
about this fish.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.370
His fish Rosie-- we wasn't
allowed to know where she was,

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:36.870
now.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:37.726
She was confiscated.

00:32:37.726 --> 00:32:39.850
But he believed she was
living in a Texas aquarium.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.780
And he was dying to get out
so that he could go visit her.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.620
This story is-- it's very
strange in some cases--

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.280
the criminalization of
some of these things.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.900
I think that there's just
so many stories to be told.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.715
Arowana was my particular
passion, I guess.

00:33:00.715 --> 00:33:02.336
The one that I started on.

00:33:02.336 --> 00:33:04.960
KELLY BAILEY: And I think you've
mentioned it already, but just

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.070
for the audience, I
thought the arowana was

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.720
this small goldfish.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.836
But it's quite large, right?

00:33:10.836 --> 00:33:11.640
It can get--

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.520
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.290
It's the size of
a samurai sword.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:16.910
But they do sell
when they're small.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.922
So when they're smuggling them,
they would usually be little.

00:33:19.922 --> 00:33:22.380
I think that was actually one
of the most basic questions I

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.470
lose sight of now.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.580
I've been on this subject
for so many years.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.329
I think one of my first
questions was how--

00:33:28.329 --> 00:33:30.370
KELLY BAILEY: How do you
smuggle a samurai sword?

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.090
EMILY VOIGT: How do
you smuggle a fish?

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.250
Like what do you--
you know what I mean?

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.041
KELLY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:33:34.852 --> 00:33:36.560
EMILY VOIGT: The guy
who went to prison--

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.960
he just had them in a suitcase.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.940
So he put them in plastic
baggies with water.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.300
And then they can make it.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.725
That's how the aquarium
trade ships fish anyway.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:52.790
Fish smuggling.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.350
But they do get big.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.450
KELLY BAILEY: They do get
they do get very large.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:55.680
EMILY VOIGT: And
they're carnivorous.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.710
They're called the bony
tongues because they

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.150
have these bony tongues.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.160
But they use them
to catch the prey.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.020
So they'll leap out of
the water many feet.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:10.260
And they'll grab things that
are on low hanging branches--

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.969
so even birds, snakes--
most of their diet

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.780
was probably smaller
fishes and bugs.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.909
They love cockroaches.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.694
They're huge on cockroaches.

00:34:20.694 --> 00:34:22.485
Actually, most of the
people who keep them,

00:34:22.485 --> 00:34:25.110
they feed them live
food, which makes them,

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.386
I think, a somewhat
difficult pet to maintain.

00:34:27.386 --> 00:34:28.719
KELLY BAILEY: I'm not going lie.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.443
It would be a little
bit scary to feed

00:34:31.443 --> 00:34:36.600
samurai sword fish live prey.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.040
EMILY VOIGT: Don't Google
arowana eats duckling.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.170
Do not.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.295
KELLY BAILEY: I almost feel
like we should put this

00:34:42.295 --> 00:34:43.174
up here right now.

00:34:43.174 --> 00:34:43.596
EMILY VOIGT: I wouldn't.

00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:44.096
I wouldn't.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.540
KELLY BAILEY: So your journey
across-- this entire story

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:56.330
takes you over 50 different
nations, countless meetings,

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.560
and a surprising
number of-- there's

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.790
a lot of scientific rivalry,
fish collecting rivalry,

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.440
just rivalries all
around in the book.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.570
Were there any specific
events or maybe

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.810
relationships that you
came across in your trips

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.740
that really stood
out and impacted you?

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.924
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah.

00:35:14.924 --> 00:35:17.785
So you brought up the
scientific rivalries.

00:35:17.785 --> 00:35:18.630
That's true.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.240
I kind of got
caught in the middle

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.760
of these to ichhyologists.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.480
I was a little bit
of a pawn, I think.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.892
KELLY BAILEY: You don't
hear that very often.

00:35:26.892 --> 00:35:28.762
EMILY VOIGT: A pawn
between ichthyologists.

00:35:28.762 --> 00:35:30.595
That maybe the first
time it was every used.

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:33.086
KELLY BAILEY: I don't think
I've ever heard that before.

00:35:33.086 --> 00:35:37.570
EMILY VOIGT: So I ended up going
after a new species of arowana

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.140
in Myanmar.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.695
And that was probably one of
the more striking experiences

00:35:45.695 --> 00:35:47.320
in the book for me
because it was still

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.560
very closed at that point.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.630
It was like just
as it was starting.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.047
Actually, the truth is where
I went, it's still closed.

00:35:53.047 --> 00:35:55.380
I heard recently from somebody
who came back from-- it's

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.588
the southern tale of Myanmar.

00:35:56.588 --> 00:35:58.210
That's next to Thailand there.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:02.995
It's the site of the longest
running civil war on earth.

00:36:02.995 --> 00:36:05.170
So even though things
are looking a little bit

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:09.910
up for the region now, it still
is just a very closed jungle.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.006
You can't go there easily.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.670
I think I was surprised
by how many fish remained

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.150
to be discovered in the world.

00:36:21.577 --> 00:36:23.160
I don't think I'm
giving anything away

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.960
when I say that there--
this new Myanmar

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.240
arowana-- there actually
was a new species that

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.610
is now in the books.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.710
And this is like the
last kind of fish

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.320
that you would expect
to find undiscovered

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.290
in the modern world.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:38.320
It's a large fish.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.440
It's a high profile fish.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.510
It was just bizarre.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.550
And the fact that I
could show some interest.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.989
And then it would
turn out to be--

00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:50.530
I don't know-- this thing had
been lurking in the jungles all

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.900
these years, not being noticed.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.670
It was strange.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:55.730
And I think it's just indicative
of how little attention is

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.117
paid to freshwaters in general.

00:36:57.117 --> 00:36:58.700
And it also kind of
reflects something

00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.910
that's happened in biology.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.840
So if you look back at
the history of biology,

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.650
straight back to
the very beginning,

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.490
Aristotle was actually--
the father of biology

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.790
was a big fish man.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.820
Long story short--
basically, he thought

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.290
he would take over Plato's
Academy, his mentor,

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.320
after Plato died.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.690
But he got passed
over for the job.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.730
So he was very irritated.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:21.370
He takes off.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.270
He goes to Lesbos, which
is an island that's

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.770
now in the news a lot because
the Syrian refugees are coming

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.270
through.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.620
And that's where he
essentially invented biology

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.654
by studying the fish.

00:37:29.654 --> 00:37:31.070
He wrote his story
on [INAUDIBLE],

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.153
which is his longest work.

00:37:32.153 --> 00:37:36.050
But it's also his
most neglected.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.830
He was the first person
to sit down and start

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.708
to write a natural
history of what was what.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:50.570
So in the 1950s though, up to
the middle of the 20th century,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.697
biologists use to divide
themselves-- kind of specialize

00:37:54.697 --> 00:37:55.780
in one group of organisms.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.430
So you had ichthyologists
who specialized

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.100
in fish or people
who specialized

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.960
in birds or earthworms.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.490
It got very specific.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:07.230
And then came the
molecular revolution

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.220
with the discovery of
the structure of DNA.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.550
And the funding
really shifted so

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.910
that specialists
in whole animals

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:19.570
started to get pushed out.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:23.120
And today, it's just--
somebody told me

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.180
that ichthyology is a bit passe.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.690
And I think that
that's-- I mean.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.674
That was an ichthyologist
who said that.

00:38:30.674 --> 00:38:32.460
So it's an insider view.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.440
But it's true.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:39.070
I feel like that is-- we're
losing a tremendous amount

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.810
of knowledge because
of just the way

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.290
that the funding
is structured now.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.309
When the current
generation dies,

00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:49.600
there are going to be whole
groups of animals for which

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.870
no living expert remains.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.054
KELLY BAILEY: Has
Heiko had any children?

00:38:54.054 --> 00:38:54.950
EMILY VOIGT: Heiko?

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:55.280
KELLY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.010
Has he had any children
to carry on this--

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.760
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.650
Oh, actually, he
has a little girl.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.010
He named her after
his mother-- the one

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.290
who took him into the Amazon.

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:05.620
KELLY BAILEY: OK.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.244
So then we at least
have that to go on.

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:10.200
EMILY VOIGT: She is well
on her way to-- it's true.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.724
KELLY BAILEY: To continuing
the trade-- the family trade.

00:39:12.724 --> 00:39:13.890
EMILY VOIGT: Important work.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:14.920
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.850
KELLY BAILEY: So I know,
at the end of your book,

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.380
you said that you're
done chasing after Heiko

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.790
because there are quite a
few parts throughout the book

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.060
where you're just kind
of like-- where is he?

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.212
Is he going to show up?

00:39:29.212 --> 00:39:32.540
At least for now--
so I'm just curious,

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.360
what are you
currently working on

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.950
or what are you hoping to
dig your research into next?

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.150
EMILY VOIGT: I did spend
a lot of time waiting

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.574
for Heiko around the globe.

00:39:43.574 --> 00:39:45.240
I think I say in
there, I waited for him

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.107
on four continents
at this point.

00:39:48.107 --> 00:39:49.690
KELLY BAILEY: It's
got to be a record.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:50.440
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.040
At this point-- so I
just had a baby recently,

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.450
a few months ago.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.240
So I'm kind of focused on that.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.312
But the interesting thing
to me, actually, as I

00:40:06.312 --> 00:40:07.020
was writing this.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.800
I was thinking about-- it's
a very male dominated world--

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.510
aquarium world.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.410
And especially
the arowana world.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.470
It's a very masculine fish.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.020
And all the hobbyists
that I met were

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.810
men with maybe one exception.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.550
And also I was writing
about the history

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.740
of exploration and science.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.712
And so also a very
male dominated.

00:40:25.712 --> 00:40:26.920
KELLY BAILEY: Male dominated.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.919
EMILY VOIGT: But there
were these two characters

00:40:28.919 --> 00:40:33.110
that I think spoke to me.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.890
So one was in the 1850s-- this
Austrian explorer, Ida Pfeiffer

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:42.255
who discovered the lake--
or is often credited,

00:40:42.255 --> 00:40:45.450
at least, with discovering the
lake where the super red comes

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:46.740
from in the heart of Borneo.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.970
So she was a housewife.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.340
And she raised two sons.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.450
And she was a piano teacher.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.930
And she just had
dreams of traveling.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.660
And when they were fully grown--
when her sons were fully grown,

00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.797
she just took off.

00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:01.380
She told them she
was going to Brazil.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.963
But she didn't tell
them she was going

00:41:02.963 --> 00:41:04.850
to go home the long way around.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:08.190
So she circumambulated the
globe, which at that time

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:11.440
would be like being
gone for two years.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.406
She was really an
extraordinary woman.

00:41:14.406 --> 00:41:16.919
And so I admire her a lot.

00:41:16.919 --> 00:41:18.460
And then there's
another model, which

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.043
is Heiko's mother,
where you just take

00:41:20.043 --> 00:41:22.300
the kids to the jungle, right?

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.967
So those things
are all on my mind.

00:41:24.967 --> 00:41:26.875
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:30.606
KELLY BAILEY: So what your plans
for child care for your child?

00:41:30.606 --> 00:41:31.854
EMILY VOIGT: Exactly.

00:41:31.854 --> 00:41:33.120
I just bring him along.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.570
So the Baby Bjorn in the Amazon.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.100
So actually, right now,
I'm working on an essay

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.475
about-- it's much
closer to home.

00:41:41.475 --> 00:41:43.933
I was like, I have to write
about something closer to home.

00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:46.860
So it's about my bird feeder,
which sounds incredibly boring,

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.966
but let me warn you that
pet fish also sounded boring

00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:52.090
when I told everybody I
was writing about pet fish.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.730
And they were not.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:57.310
I live on the 25th floor of an
apartment building in New York.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.290
So it's kind of hard
to have a bird feeder

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.050
because if you put it
outside the window,

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:04.508
it's going to fall
and kill people.

00:42:04.508 --> 00:42:07.420
So I found one that
goes inside-- the bird

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.530
comes inside the house.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:13.437
And initially, the guy who
sold it to me up in Maine

00:42:13.437 --> 00:42:15.270
was like, you're not
going to get any birds.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.940
And we ended up getting
some house finches.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.390
Now, this connects
back to this fish story

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:25.030
because there's a whole
elaborate saga of what happened

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:26.860
with the house finches.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:31.810
Spoiler alert, a hawk ate
one in our living room.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.729
But it turns out that
the house finches

00:42:33.729 --> 00:42:35.020
are an introduced species here.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.780
They were brought
over in the pet trade

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:41.680
from the west coast in
1940, I think it was.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.570
And just a few of them were
released on Long Island

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.990
because the dealer knew that
it was illegal to have them.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.880
And he got worried.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880
And so he released them.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.213
And now there's like a billion
of them on the east cost.

00:42:55.555 --> 00:42:58.320
I think that this book certainly
has informed the way that I

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.880
just look at every animal now.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.887
And that may be my
next pet trade subject.

00:43:04.887 --> 00:43:05.970
KELLY BAILEY: I love this.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.580
You're like the new generation
Ace Ventura Pet Detective,

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.330
Emily Voigt.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:17.410
But I guess I'd love for us
to open it up to Q&amp;A if anyone

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.350
out there has questions.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.250
I think there was a--
maybe we have mic.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.450
No, it's over there.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:31.070
AUDIENCE: Did you ever
feel-- did you ever

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:35.490
feel like you were in danger in
some of the places you visited?

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:36.450
EMILY VOIGT: Yeah.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.145
I always felt like
I was in danger.

00:43:38.145 --> 00:43:43.720
But whether I was
actually in-- I

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.990
said last night with the
book launch-- somebody

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.990
asked the same question.

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.410
And I said that,
basically, I was always

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.630
worried about something.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.130
So for example, when I had to
get to the heart of Borneo,

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.610
I was worried about these
three different things.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:57.986
People had warned me that
there were Islamic terrorists

00:43:57.986 --> 00:43:59.610
in the jungle and
there was an election

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.870
about to happen in Indonesia
so that they would potentially

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.545
want to kidnap somebody.

00:44:04.545 --> 00:44:06.920
So I couldn't even get a travel
agency to help me at all.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.590
And I was worried about that.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:12.410
I was worried about
the fish mafia

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.640
because I could never tell
if it was real or not.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.550
So I'd be talking to
people and wanting

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.630
to ask about the fish
mafia, but also wondering

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.160
if they were part of it.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.600
It sounds very funny,
but at the time,

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.530
I was a little nervous about it.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.560
And the other thing
was headhunters.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.340
So the indigenous people
that live on this lake

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.360
were traditionally headhunters.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.370
So I got warned that there was
still headhunting going on.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.320
And that I thought was
totally ridiculous.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.230
I'm like, this is-- it
doesn't happen anymore.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.110
It's this like horrible
characterization

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.850
of a peaceful tribe.

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.820
I was wrong about that.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.770
So I was always worried
about something.

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.900
And I was always
worried about the thing

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.460
I shouldn't have been
worried about and not worried

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.501
about what I should have.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.570
So that was happening.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.110
But it kept getting worse
and worse in a way, too.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:08.860
So by the end of the
book, I was like, OK,

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.818
I'm just going to go to
the Amazon really quick

00:45:10.818 --> 00:45:11.680
and meet Heiko.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.100
And then he sent
me the itinerary.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:19.250
And it was like the hub of
the FARC activity in Colombia.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:23.850
And I felt like this fish had
put me through the wringer

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:24.500
by the end.

00:45:27.302 --> 00:45:28.266
So the answer is yeah.

00:45:33.399 --> 00:45:33.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.960
Thanks for coming.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.360
I look forward to
reading the book.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.380
Should I invest money and time
into genetically modifying

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.990
the fish so that I can
make my own super red

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.130
to sell to people in Asia?

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:48.130
And also, what do
you expect your book

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.565
to be received in Asia?

00:45:51.565 --> 00:45:53.440
EMILY VOIGT: Oh, OK
These are good questions.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:57.210
The first thing is-- so Kenny
the Fish might be ahead of you

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.410
on that.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.690
And so they are working
on genetically modifying

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.826
the arowana.

00:46:04.826 --> 00:46:06.190
But it's surprisingly tough.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.100
They still can't do in
vitro with the fish.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.630
So that makes it really hard.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:12.230
Arowana are super picky lovers.

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:15.350
They insist upon
picking their own mate.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.360
They wont just mate
with any other fish.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.660
Actually, a surprising
number remain mated for life.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.520
So you could.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.900
But I don't know
how you're going

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.700
to get the fish into the US.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:38.167
And I would warn you against
going down this path.

00:46:38.167 --> 00:46:39.500
So what was your other question?

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.716
It was-- oh, reception in Asia.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:48.855
I think that there's-- there's
so much interest in the fish

00:46:48.855 --> 00:46:55.094
that, so far, people seem
pretty excited about the book.

00:46:55.094 --> 00:46:56.510
It's really different
from-- there

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:59.110
are a lot of arowana
books that exist.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:00.596
But they're all like fish care.

00:47:00.596 --> 00:47:02.470
So a lot of times people
will think that I've

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:05.790
written a fish care book.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:09.410
I think I am, right now,
number one in fish and aquarium

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:10.390
care on Amazon.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.270
I don't mean to boast.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:22.230
I think we'll have to see
what people think of it.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.290
But I think that they'll
probably be interested

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:28.380
because it's-- the thing about
the aquarium hobby is that

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:33.330
there's something so admirable
about it because these people

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:35.600
know the names of things.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.710
They know the names of species
that-- the scientific names

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:43.900
of species that most
of us have no idea,

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.210
and how they fit together
in terms of the evolution,

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:49.110
and where they're
from, and so forth.

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:52.210
And they're really interested
in the natural world

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.750
and, and in the
wild, and holding

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:54.791
onto a piece of the wild.

00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:56.870
I think that's what
attracts people

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:01.301
to it as much as the looking
like a dragon and the good luck

00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:01.800
stuff.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.310
I think it's also a
deeper kind of desire

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:05.612
to connect with nature.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:09.090
So, yeah.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:10.464
I wouldn't be
surprised if people

00:48:10.464 --> 00:48:14.540
are very interested in
exploring the history of that.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.695
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:16.695 --> 00:48:19.340
Is Asia part of your book tour?

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.892
EMILY VOIGT: Is Asia
part of my book tour?

00:48:21.892 --> 00:48:23.810
So Aquarama just moved.

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:25.600
So it just moved
from Singapore, where

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.660
it's been since like '89, to
Guangzhou because what happened

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:34.250
is, with the rise of the
Chinese middle class--

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:38.590
the arowana became popular
first in Taiwan, then Japan,

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.420
and now it's China.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.510
It's all about China.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:45.750
And so that's had big
consequences on the trade.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:50.500
And so Aquarama's happening
in the fall in Guangzhou.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.070
So I may be there
with the Baby Bjorn.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.555
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:55.555 --> 00:48:56.935
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:48:56.935 --> 00:48:59.340
Is the fish world--
the black market--

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.850
is it a very small world
that everyone knows everyone?

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:04.100
And they're like why is
this blonde lady poking

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.560
around kind of thing?

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.700
Or is it just big,
and it's random,

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.337
and they didn't know about
you before you met them?

00:49:10.337 --> 00:49:11.920
EMILY VOIGT: No, it
was the first one.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.699
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:49:12.699 --> 00:49:13.240
Really small?

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.230
EMILY VOIGT: It was
definitely the first one.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:18.220
And also, I stuck out
a lot because it's

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.600
a hobby that's pretty much
predominantly Asian men.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.590
So I would go to these
fish conferences.

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:25.210
And it was kind of obvious.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.470
And at first, people were
incredibly welcoming.

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:29.020
So it is kind of a closed world.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:35.236
But the US is also the
largest market for pet fish.

00:49:35.236 --> 00:49:37.520
So the fact that
it's a closed market

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.740
is not great for the industry.

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.956
And so there's an interest
in opening up the US.

00:49:42.956 --> 00:49:45.080
And they've been trying to
communicate with the US.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.000
And I have to say
that-- American policy--

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.280
it's not exactly informed.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.769
There's not deep knowledge
about the fish that informed

00:49:51.769 --> 00:49:53.060
the fact that it's banned here.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.600
Whether or not it should be--
that's a different question.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.910
But they were just
happy to have somebody

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.326
who was paying
attention, finally,

00:49:58.326 --> 00:50:01.574
who might be able to communicate
the real message of the fact

00:50:01.574 --> 00:50:03.240
that these fish are
farmed and so forth.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.740
And so I found that gave me a
lot of access, which was great.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.690
But what was funny was
that as the project went on

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:11.300
for years and years--
like I would run

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.780
into them all over the world.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.520
So at a fish
convention in Jakarta.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.890
And then the next fall,
they see me in Guangzhou.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:21.190
It became apparent to
them that I was just

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.030
chasing this fish all the time.

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:25.324
And they would tell
me, what are you doing?

00:50:25.324 --> 00:50:26.740
You haven't written
your book yet?

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:31.270
I would say, no, no, I'm
studying your obsession.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:33.507
And they would look
at me and like--

00:50:33.507 --> 00:50:35.090
you should examine
your own obsession.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:41.150
They're going back
to their daily jobs.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.990
The fish is a fun
side thing for them--

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:48.090
even the most passionate,
whereas I was like,

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:51.250
I'm going to find this
thing in the wild.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:52.450
Yes.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:54.540
I definitely was noticed.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.690
I didn't go under cover.

00:50:59.162 --> 00:51:00.392
Any other questions?

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.276
AUDIENCE: So what makes
a fish worth $100,000

00:51:07.276 --> 00:51:12.630
versus $10,000 versus
$50,000 in the arowana world?

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.590
EMILY VOIGT: So I
know probably more

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:21.220
than I care to about the details
of what makes a fish valuable.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.500
It's really rarity and
the perception of rarity.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.540
So in the case of
the albinos, the idea

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.450
was that they don't
come-- that's what's

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.040
so ridiculous about
the albinos, too.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:34.800
Because the normal fish is
valued for its coloration.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.690
And super red is valued
because it's super red.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.260
It's right there in the name.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.380
So if you have a fish that's
born not being red at all,

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.370
it seems like it
would be worth less.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.250
But it's totally white.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.794
But it's cool because
it's something

00:51:51.794 --> 00:51:52.960
that people don't see a lot.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.067
And it has this
perception of rarity.

00:51:56.067 --> 00:51:57.400
And it's really a status symbol.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.483
So if you can have something
that nobody else has,

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:01.310
that's the big draw.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.610
And so that's why the
albino sell for six figures.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:09.180
In terms of the other fish,
it's how red they are,

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:09.970
it's their scales.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:16.550
So there's all these things
that can go wrong on the fish.

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.220
Basically, you don't want
the fish to look depressed.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.140
And sometimes-- they have these
large eyes, kind of like coins.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.880
When they're in tanks--
I'm not exactly sure why,

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.310
but it has to do
with where they look.

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:31.280
They're normally in dark water.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.537
And so I think they're
just looking all over.

00:52:33.537 --> 00:52:35.370
And when they're in a
tank, for some reason,

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.576
they look down a lot.

00:52:36.576 --> 00:52:37.200
They look down.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.030
Maybe they are depressed.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.571
I don't know.

00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:41.220
But they get these fatty
deposits up here so

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.707
that-- it's almost like-- I'm
going to do a car metaphor

00:52:44.707 --> 00:52:47.290
and I'm going to totally mess
it up because I don't know cars.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.560
But when the wheels
are misaligned,

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.000
you have to get them rotated
or something like that.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.400
So there's a plastic
surgery that can be done.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.760
There's a whole cottage
industry in fish plastic

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.760
surgery now for the arowana.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.550
And I've actually witnessed
some of these procedures.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.296
And there's a lot
of drama because you

00:53:08.296 --> 00:53:09.920
have to take the fish
out of the water.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.740
You put it under.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.410
You take it out of the
water and it lays there.

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:14.410
But you've got to get
back in so it can breathe.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.270
So these guys have
to move really fast.

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.090
But you remove
the fatty deposit.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:19.340
And the fish gets an eye lift.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.190
And it looks happy.

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:24.510
The other thing is you don't
want a fish that's PLJ.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:26.170
That means Protruding Lower Jaw.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:30.190
And it's really
like-- like that.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:31.260
Also depressed.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.780
Maybe these fish are depressed.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.950
I don't know why they're having
these different features.

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:37.750
So you can also get a chin tuck.

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:46.609
So if your fish were to develop
a PLJ, you can get a chin tuck.

00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:47.650
So these are some things.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:51.470
So you do have some control
over the value in that regard.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:55.196
But really, it's the
stuff you would expect.

00:53:55.196 --> 00:53:57.680
You want a really red fish.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.989
That's what you're looking for.

00:54:05.321 --> 00:54:08.472
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
some counterfeit fish?

00:54:08.472 --> 00:54:09.550
EMILY VOIGT: Oh, yeah.

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:10.050
Yeah, I did.

00:54:13.836 --> 00:54:16.820
So the way you
fake an arowana is

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:22.160
by manipulating the
coloration so that it looks

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.711
like it's a variety it's not.

00:54:23.711 --> 00:54:25.710
So there are these different
pockets of arowana.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:28.600
I mentioned that green--
you don't want a green.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:34.780
But there's also different
kinds of gold or different kinds

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:35.280
of red.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.321
So there's something called
the banjar red, which

00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:39.110
is not as red as the super red.

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:43.450
But if you keep it in a
certain kind of environment,

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.850
it will start to turn redder.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.640
And then, it will
sell for more money.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.020
And then you put it in
a different environment.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.640
And it just gets back to the
sort of orangy hue that it is.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.780
So this actually works
most for the gold.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:00.360
If you keep a gold fish in
a tank that's totally white,

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.090
it will start to kind of
adapt to it's environment.

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:05.219
They don't camouflage
themselves,

00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:06.760
but they do manipulate
their coloring

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.960
based on what they see.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.210
Actually, this is interesting.

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:12.090
There was a black
arowana I saw once.

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:15.130
And it turned out that-- it
wasn't true of this fish.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.660
But generally,
when that happens,

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.480
it's because they're blind.

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.910
So they're mimicking their
perceived environment

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:23.807
of total darkness.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.886
That does have some
effect on the coloration.

00:55:28.886 --> 00:55:30.760
The other thing is-- I
should point this out.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.600
The fish doesn't take
on its coloration

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.752
for three years for the gold
and six for the super red.

00:55:35.752 --> 00:55:37.210
So when they reach
sexual maturity,

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.670
that's when they come
into their full blush.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:44.310
And that means that if
you're buying a fish,

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:46.580
they're usually sold
at about six months--

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:50.860
you're buying a fish whose
color you have to guess.

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.840
And so I actually went
with a Japanese buyer

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.190
to assess-- this is
professionally what he does.

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:56.720
He assesses the babies.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:02.020
And he tries to guess
what they're going

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.460
to look like when they get big.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.847
So you could potentially
sell somebody a green fish,

00:56:06.847 --> 00:56:07.680
tell them it's gold.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.200
And then three
years later, you're

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.240
gone when it doesn't turn gold.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.287
So that's the kind of
fish fraud and fakes

00:56:15.287 --> 00:56:17.664
that I'm talking about.

00:56:17.664 --> 00:56:18.580
KELLY BAILEY: Awesome.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.630
Well, I think that's all the
time we have for questions.

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.919
But thank you so much for
joining us and telling us--

00:56:23.919 --> 00:56:25.460
EMILY VOIGT: Thank
you for having me.

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:26.740
KELLY BAILEY: Yes.

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.880
Telling us all about your book.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.949
So thank you everyone
for coming out.

00:56:30.949 --> 00:56:32.240
Let's give a round of applause.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:32.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.090
EMILY VOIGT: Thank you.
