00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.080
When people think of the Emory University hospital system,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.500
a lot of things may come to mind, but laundry probably isn't one of them.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.460
"They do not realize the magnitude and how much linen is processed."

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.520
Blankets, hospital scrubs, sheets, pillowcases, and more. Today Emory's laundry services

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.500
picks up, cleans, disinfects sorts and distributes over

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.280
600,000 pounds of linen every month.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.540
That's more than 7 million pounds a year at a cost of nearly $5.5 million annually.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.020
To keep expenses down, most of the enterprise is managed by Emory.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.200
"We service 12 distribution points of service every day including on weekends."

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.560
It's an intricate operation with many moving parts.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.599
"If one of the links is not in place, then this

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.420
chain kind of gets all wiggly and the patient care is affected by that."

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.520
While the rest of us sleep, Emory's laundry staff are busy collecting and distributing linens.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.300
Their work day starts at midnight so they don't disrupt

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.430
clinical operations during peak hours.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.369
For the 29-person staff there is love of the job and a good deal of pride in what they do,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.189
as is evident by the low turnover rate in their department, in spite of the arduous demands of the work.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.699
"It's a physical job because of the the pushing and the pulling and the stooping and the bending,

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.919
and also the the weight of the of a carts. One exchange cart can weigh up to 500 pounds."

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.350
Workers collect carts filled with sealed bags of dirty linens and load them into these box trucks.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.209
The drivers then haul the load to Emory's distribution center in Clarkston, Georgia,

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.629
where staff sort and ready to linens for transport to Crothall Laundry Services in Rome, Georgia.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.209
Here, plant employees, with the help of industrial machines, clean, sterilize, dry,  and fold the linens.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.849
12,000 pounds of fresh laundry per truckload is shipped back to the Clarkston facility,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.509
where it will be resorted and loaded back onto the box trucks for delivery to the various hospitals and clinics.
