00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.000
So when I got to the ancestry portion, I sort of wanted to start with, you know,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.250
where I was, my deep ancestory history, where I originated from. And

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.780
it showed that I was around, not surprisingly, 20% from the British

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.040
Islands and then the rest were from some unidentified

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.740
European countries, but about 1 percent was from

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
Sardinia, a little island off of Italy, which I find really fascinating.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.360
&gt;&gt; Well I want to know, when you got the results back,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.410
when 23 and me, I think they send you an email saying the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.800
results are ready, what were you feeling as you, when you got the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.360
results, rather the notification. what, what

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.890
were you actually feeling in the process?

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.710
&gt;&gt; I was feeling very overwhelmed because I knew that there

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.780
was a potential for me to find out from the relative finder

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.490
section, you know, my biological parents,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.170
and, or biological siblings, or biological aunts,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.500
or any relatives and information that I never had Because as you know, my

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.920
adoption was closed, and they didn't release any of that information, and I felt

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.080
always that I had reached a dead end, but this was a potential

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.850
It could potentially further my, finding my, my

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.730
biological birth parent. So I was very anxious very

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.540
overwhelmed, very nervous, like clicking through everything. I

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.600
even tried to like, go through all the other

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.670
parts of 23andMe before I got to that just so I could sort of, you know, calm

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.570
myself down. and then I clicked on the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.900
relative finder. Okay, so you opted into the relative

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.600
finder, and you, you, you clicked on it. what did you see?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.310
&gt;&gt; Well, I saw a whole host of third to fourth cousins.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.000
quite a few from both England and Eastern

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.310
North Carolina, which was, which was where I was

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.930
born and raised. the closest though, I did find

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.200
one second cousin. It didn't come up at first,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.370
after about a week, a week of having

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.910
the original results. evidently, this person opted it in.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.850
Or 23 made was able to match her DNA

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.310
a little bit better, and this person showed up.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.910
And it basically said that they were male and that they were

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.460
from North Carolina and they shared

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.250
about 0.97% of the DNA that I had.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.100
And then in the advanced tools section of 23andMe you can look at your actual

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.370
chromosome pattern and see what bands of chromosomes

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.320
match, and there were quite a few bands which lead me to

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.410
believe that, you know, we had somewhat close, you know, DNA lineage.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.450
&gt;&gt; Wow. So, did you, did you reach out to this person?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.500
&gt;&gt; I did. I was sort of debating whether I would,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.460
you know, contact them. Sort of open up the can of worms

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.840
or the pandora's box. Sort of get this new person involved in

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.980
my life. And I reached out and basically, I said my name,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.720
age, where I was from, and that I was adopted and that I would love to know more

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.020
about their background, and after about three days, an email was sent to me for

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.130
this person, who gave me His name, how old he was and that he was from

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.480
eastern North Carolina. And he gave me a

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.340
bunch of surnames, hypothesizing his four grandparent's last names,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.830
which is a very common name in the community

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.930
I was born and raised in. So I mean, it

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.070
sounds like you connected with somebody who is, I

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.450
mean, who the surnames, the family names you're familiar with.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.060
&gt;&gt; I know. It was, it felt like a bit of a soap opera that I

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.980
was sort of, like becoming apart of, I called my adopted real parents, I called

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.980
them and you know. I told them I'm participating in this course, as

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.270
well as participating in 23and me and. They were not hesitant, they were

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.930
okay with it and when I told them a

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.480
list of names my mother pulled out all the phone

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.040
books from Eastern North Carolina because she collects those

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.160
evidently and was trying, like, this certain name that could

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.420
be in the county where she knew that three

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.170
other names were in. And she was calling my aunt,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.900
to see if she knew this person, and so

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.070
it's just started this sort of domino thing where everybody's

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.560
trying to be Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.210
to try to figure out Who this cousin is.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.610
I'm still debating about, you know, where to take

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.910
this, how, how, involved I should get with this person.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.820
you know, I, I don't know how receptive this

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.960
person will be. And it's a second cousin which,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.620
you know, isn't an aunt or an uncle. This,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.540
you know? It's still a little far out. And so

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.510
for me to say I'm adopted. Do you know anybody that you may

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.310
be related to, who had a child put up for adoption? The likelihood

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.130
of that is still low, however, I am hopeful that, you know, maybe,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.260
maybe they do know. I, I'm still debating about how to pursue this.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.330
&gt;&gt; So overall, how would you

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.570
describe your emotions? Excited, nervous, happy, sad?

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.990
&gt;&gt; My emotions about this process are varied.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.700
I'm excited and happy for the most part, and

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.410
hopeful. I think those describe how I'm feeling about this right now.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.570
&gt;&gt; Would you recommend this for other people who are

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.640
adopted and are interested? Do you think that it has the

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.280
ability to Fill gaps in their knowlege or, do you think

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.000
that it's a positive experience that you recommend to other people?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.370
&gt;&gt; I think it depends on the person. I think that, it depends

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.040
on where the person is an how, an their identity as being, adopted.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.000
You know, are they, if they're interested and

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.750
curious, I think this is a perfectly legitimate

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.170
ada, avenue to pursue. I think that everyone

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.350
who does pursue this as an avenue for

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.510
trying to find biological relatives, should enter into

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.410
it with a mindset that, they may not

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.580
find anything. or they might find very distant

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.415
cousin. Because this is all dependent on other people

00:06:18.415 --> 00:06:19.920
[COUGH]

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.010
opting to send in their DNA to the company. With that said, I think that as,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.320
you know, genetics is coming to the forefront

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.900
of our everyday lives and our health, more

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.940
and more people are going to opt to send their DNA in to be sequenced and to

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.980
be analyzed and to be compared with other

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.030
individuals. So, I think that this is a very

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.550
hopeful enterprise for adopted individuals.
