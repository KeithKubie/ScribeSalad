Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.900
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Father Lush
Gjergji is a Roman Catholic priest

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.790
in Kosovo where he was born.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:37.120
He has known Mother Teresa, now
Saint Mother Teresa, since 1968.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.760
He was ordained in 1973.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.410
And his 1975 doctorate
in psychology is

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.210
from the Sapienza University
of Rome.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.800
He has authored over 60 works
on psychology and religion,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.460
as well as 16 books dedicated to
the life, works, and spirituality

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.890
of Saint Teresa of Kolkata.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.380
He will discuss her life and works,
as well as her Albanian origins.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.450
Father Lush writes in
Albanian, Italian, and Croatian,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.040
so he's quite multilingual.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.890
English would not be
his strong language,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.290
so we have a wonderful
interpreter here for this event.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.510
Father Lush's works have
been translated into English

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.490
and several other languages.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.420
His talk, as I said, will
be interpreted for us.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.000
So I will turn this over to you.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.300
Thank you so much for being here.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.440
I should also say Father
Lush has donated four works

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.670
about Mother Teresa to the Library

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.340
of Congress today,
and he signed them.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.080
And so, later, if you want
to look at those, please do.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.500
Please leave them for me.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.190
Saint Teresa will not be
happy if you take those away.

not have been possible.

from the sacred scripture from
Saint Luke the Evangelist, who said,

Albanian sentiment,

but also the humanity
sentiment with the headline

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.520
"The centuries had been
waiting and preparing,

In order to understand the person
as an individual in a relation

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.230
to family, society,
nationality, faith and culture,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.410
one must consider the surroundings,
environment, and living conditions.

Because without these distinguishing
characteristics, the roots,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.350
we may somehow lose the essence
of the identity or personality.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.640
I've met Mother Teresa Bojaxhiu
many times over the course

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.290
of our long friendship, working
together in different hemispheres

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.900
around the globe since my first
meeting with her face-to-face

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.510
in the fall of 1968 in Rome.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:07:54.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.300
At that time, I was a student
in my second year of philosophy

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.060
at Pontifical Urban University.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.000
I accompanied her on all five
of her visits to Kosovo --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.950
1970, '78, '80, 1982, and 1986.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:15.230
I was with her in Oslo in 1979 when
she received the Nobel Peace Prize,

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.040
many times in Eastern Europe,
in particular to Kolkata

and the neighboring
countries in 1989.

Every time I met her, it seemed like
the first time and the last time.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.390
I was struck by her simplicity,
genuineness, kindness, generosity,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.790
patience, caring and love for the
poorest of the poor, the lepers,

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.180
the unwanted, and her
longing for the homeland,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.580
that strong spiritual link with
the Albanian people and the church.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.480

I've investigated and
researched her foundation,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.110
the origin of this
profound and passionate love

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.320
and dedication for the whole world.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.700
My conclusion is this --
there are two unique sources

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.000
that had prepared her to
be gifted to the world.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.900
Her family's life experiences and
the inherited ancient traditions

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.980
of the Albanian people,
which are based on these holy

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.080
and meaningful principles.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.900
First, bread, salt, and heart.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.850
As well, the house belongs
to God and to the guest.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.030
Along with life filled
with Christian love,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.000
both in her household
and in the parish

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.040
where Christ's words
meant for all run through.

With 16 books dedicated to
Mother Teresa translated

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.050
into many languages,
I've tried to dissect

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.670
and document these two bottomless
wells for Mother Teresa --

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.510

sister, and for all humanity.

as well be burning
questions for you as well.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.630
And I will try and give
some answers to those.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:14.510
So my first question is,
"Who was Gonxhe Bojaxhiu?"

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:37.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.340
Gonxhe Bojaxhiu was a daughter

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.340
of Kolë Bojaxhiu,
originally from Prizren.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.020 position:56%
And Drane Bojaxhiu, her maiden name,

was Barnaj from Novo
Sella outside Gjakovës.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.370
But more than that, Mother
Teresa was the daughter

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.290
of our 2000-year-old Christianity,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.510
the daughter of Albanian
tradition, culture, and martyrdom.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.280
The other question is, "How is
it that she was born in Skopje?"

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.660
Gonxhe Bojaxhiu's family was
uprooted from Prizren and forced

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.440 position:56%
to relocate to Skopje due to Turkish
persecution against Albanians,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.950
especially those of the Catholic
faith because of various diseases

that befell Prizren,
particularly the cholera epidemic

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.980
that reduced the city's population
in half between the years 1850

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:04.510 position:56%
to 1855, and like other families in
search of better work opportunities.

"Who were her parents?"

Kolë Bojaxhiu -- born
in 1872, died in 1919 --

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.250
was a well-known merchant,
a builder, musician,

polyglot, a true patriot.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.920
But above all, he was a chartable
man and father to the poor

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.790
of Skopje and surrounding areas.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.170
He paid for his activism
and equality and rights

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.280
with his own life as he
was apparently poisoned

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.070
in Belgrade simply because he
defended basic human rights,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.510

homemaker, a dedicated mother,

for everyone in need.

She was Gonxhe Bojaxhiu's
first teacher.

The Bojaxhiu family had
two other children --

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.020
Lazar Bojaxhiu and Age Bojaxhiu.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:17.570
Lazar died in 1981,
while Age died in 1973.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.090
of environment was Gonxhe
Bojaxhiu born and raised?"

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:27.640
She was born in Skopje, August 27,
1910 -- some claim August 26th --

during Turkish Ottoman rule

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.110
in an atmosphere both ethnically
and religiously diverse.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.500
She completed the first
four years of education

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.230
at Sacred Heart Catholic
School in Skopje.

at high school were

at state-ran public
schools also in Skopje.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.700
She was raised with the example
of love through sacrifice

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.250
and charity initially by her
family, and secondly by the parish.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.320
They taught her about universal
fellowship, serving God

suffer physically and spiritually.

is, "How did she come

to the vocation of
consecrated life?"

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:38.400
For six years, she battled with
God, from the age of 12 until 18.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.110
When after much prayer, counseling,
and many retreats to Letnica,

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.320
she finally decided, "I
want to be a missionary nun

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.420
to help the poor of the world."

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.510

"Why go to Kolkata, India?"

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.790
Because she had read and heard
from the fathers in Skopje

that there were missionaries in
Kolkata and throughout Bengal

Gonxhe first and foremost
sought from her parents --

a new one in the consecrated life.

baptismal name to Sister Teresa

part of the holy order known

&gt;&gt; I'm ignorant of
Albanian geography,

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:21.330
so I would like to know whether
Mother Teresa's family --

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:25.420
I think you spoke of the place
where her mother and father --

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.830
where the family came from.

I'm wondering if the place where her
family came from before they lived

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:36.720
in Skopje was in the
present-day boundaries of Albania.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.550
I also want to ask -- I
understand that Mother Teresa

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:45.730
at some point met the wife of
Enver Hoxha I believe in the '80s,

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.310
and I wonder if you know
anything about that.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.850
And I cannot resist asking also
whether you have any comment

about the honor done to the Albanian
nation and to a son of Albania

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.640
in the last week by Pope Francis

The first answer.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:49:08.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.480
So her father was from Prizren.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.360
&gt;&gt; That's in present-day Albania?

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:16.690
&gt;&gt; Father Lush Gjergji:
Present-day in Kosovo.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:17.990

It's the cultural capital of Kosovo.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:31.040
Her mother was born -- the maternal
grandparents are from [inaudible]

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.120
in border with Kosovo and Albania.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:42.550
Then they were moved to Novo
Sella, which is close --

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:46.050
[inaudible] by the way,
this is my insert here --

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.350
[inaudible] is the short name

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.000
for [foreign language],
which means rose.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.490
So it's short name for rose.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:54.200
So she was born in Novo
Sella near Gjakovës.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.240
And then shortly after she was
born, her family moved to Prizren.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.830
So we can easily say that both her
parents are citizens of Prizren,

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:04.630
which is a city in Kosovo.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.080
Regarding the second
question, meeting the widow

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.510
of Enver Hoxha, yes,
he has knowledge.

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.790
And he says, "Yes, she did."

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:27.400
Nexhmije Hoxha (that's her name)
received actually Mother Teresa,

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.530
and she accompanied her to
the tomb of Enver Hoxha.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:39.690
And there is apparently a
misunderstanding for many people

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.350
because Mother Teresa put
flowers at the dictator's tomb.

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:44.650
And it's true.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:47.120
She put flowers and she
kneeled and she prayed.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.430
And apparently when
she finished praying,

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:53.420
she noticed that Nexhmije
Hoxha was not feeling well,

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.720
was not feeling good.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:59.390
So Mother Teresa actually reached
out, trying to console her,

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:01.120
trying to say that, "Look,

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:08.280
he thought that he was doing
something good for his country."

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:15.460
Because he says that her message is
that the evil cannot defeat evil.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.490
Only good can defeat evil.

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:23.210
And not only that she forgave those
who gave harm, but she prayed.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:32.170
And prior to that, Father said that
after she [inaudible] that feeling,

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.430
she, at that moment,
after she consoled her,

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:38.640
she asked where the tomb of
her mother and her sister were.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.910
Because for those who
know the story, her mother

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:47.050
and the sister were separated by
her on the 13th of October, 1928,

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:48.740
and they never saw each other.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:52.310
So a lot of damage was done there.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:53.780
And I might have missed
the rest of it,

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.510
but basically that
was the context of it.

Regarding now cardinal-to-be, Ernest
Troshani, he is one of the priests

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:20.930
that survived the religious
persecution.

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:25.540
So he suffered about 27
or 28 years in prison.

He's one of the priests
that are alive today

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.060
who survived the persecution.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.980
There were about 30
of them who survived

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:36.180
because the rest were executed.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.680
Two years ago when Pope
Francis visited Albania

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:44.850
at Saint Paul Cathedrals,
he heard first-hand witness

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:52.750
from this cardinal-to-be, and he
heard Ernest Troshani's story.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.280
And the pope was very
shaken and very touched.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.840
And if you remember,
pope got in tears.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.650
And usually a priest would
try and kiss the hand

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:06.750
or kneel before the pope, and
the pope didn't allow that.

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:11.830 position:56%
Instead, he kissed Ernest Troshani's
hand, which is something unheard of.

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.350
So this year is very
special for Albanians

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:18.050
because we have Mother
Teresa's canonization,

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:22.190
we have Ernest Troshani, which is
a martyr -- basically, he's alive,

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.930
but he is a martyr of faith.

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:28.310
And then we have also the 38
martyrs will be proclaimed

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:34.700
on November the 5th with, as
we will say, the beatification

know the Albanian as a nation rather

towards the Albanian people.
