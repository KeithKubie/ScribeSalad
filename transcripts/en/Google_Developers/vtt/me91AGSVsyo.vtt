00:00:02.315 --> 00:00:04.040
Hello, I'm Timothy
Jordan, and this

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.070
is your update about the
coolest developer news

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.870
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.600
Now, a few of you
asked in the comments

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.260
of last week's update, Timothy,
why do you look so tired?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.060
Well, it might be
because Google I/O

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.990
is in just about three weeks.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.210
Three weeks!

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.075
OK, if you're as excited as I
am, this first link is for you.

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:27.280
You can now start planning
your Google I/O 2016 schedule.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.790
Yay!

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.610
Just head on over to the link
in the description below.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.920
Tilt Brush is a new
app that enables

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.450
artists to use virtual
reality to paint the 3D

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.850
space around them.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.340
Trust me, it's awesome.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.760
But it can be difficult
to describe how it feels

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.420
without trying it firsthand.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.120
Today we bring you
a little closer

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.720
in a new Chrome experiment
titled Virtual Art Sessions.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.990
Follow the link below to observe
six world-renowned artists

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.830
as they develop blank canvases
into beautiful works of art.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.560
Each session can be
explored from start

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.300
to finish from any
angle, including

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.790
the artist's perspective.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.230
All viewable, right
from the browser.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.720
Recordings of over 30
sessions from GCP Next

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.250
are now up on YouTube.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.250
They're all awesome.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.208
But if you're wondering
where you should start,

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:14.530
try this list of the
top five, linked below.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.100
Building for round
screens with Android Wear

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.460
just got a lot easier.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.450
With Android Wear API 23, we
introduced a new round resource

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.850
identifier, which helps
you separate resource

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.790
files between round
and square devices.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.920
Get all the details on the post.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.070
Also on Android
Wear, if your app

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.590
is using BIND_LISTENER intent
filters in your manifest,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.330
you should know that this
API has been deprecated

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.430
on all Android versions.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.140
The new replacement
API introduced

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.870
in Google Play
Services 8.2 is more

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.550
efficient for Android devices.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.280
You should migrate
to this as soon

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.500
as possible to ensure
the best user experience.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.570
All the details are in-- you
got it-- the post linked below.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.140
The latest version of Chrome
supports the Credential

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.150
Management API.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.610
It's a standards-track
proposal at the W3C that

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.810
gives developers programmatic
access to a browser's

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.470
credential manager and helps
users sign in more easily.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.790
To learn more and get started
integrating it into your site,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.220
And that's your
update for the week.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.170
Remember to click on
all the links below.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.640
Oh, and with I/O
getting so close,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360
make sure to use the
hashtag #AskDevShow

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.750
to let us know who
you'd like me to talk to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.440
and what questions to ask.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.420
We'll try to add
them to the lineup.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.460
I'll see you next week.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.810
