00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.120
Wow

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.740
Right off the bat that's pretty impressive. Hey, what's up guys welcome back to lab today?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
I am here with cody from Cody's lab. You know this guy you love this guy

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.110
I got him here today because we're playing with Mercury

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
Now the inspiration for today's video comes out the comments from Brown thunder who says do a video explaining

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.680
What the inches of mercury mean so I have cody here from cody's lab to help me explain?

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.639
Exactly why we measure in inches of Mercury so this vacuum Gauge here,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.289
which is a very common type you'd see here in the us you see these outer numbers here. They're actually

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.520
referencing inches of Mercury. See Mercury used to be used as a way to,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.570
uh, Measure differential pressure, cause a heavy liquid and it takes a lot to pull it up the Tube and it takes, ya know

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.789
If you measure the distance you're pulling of the tube you can know how much of a vacuum you have. This gauge

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.149
just does it without Mercury now back in December

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.579
I tried a project where actually built this vacuum chamber

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.939
Just using simple materials from the story in this case a glass cookie jar

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.840
And I have this liquid filled gauge on the top and as we suck the air out of the jar

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.029
We measure things in inches of mercury. I got three pounds of liquid Mercury right here, the purest stuff

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.349
I've had and what I find is really impressed about these these are very very tiny bottles be like an ounce of water

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.919
But when you pick these things up, they are impressively heavy it don't drop

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.250
I mean

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.110
This is about 1 pound of Mercury if you can imagine that so it's actually it's a little bit of a mind blow to feel

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.449
That it feels about same weight as brass or copper

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.309
Maybe a little bit heavier, so these bottles are actually full of dental mercury

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.189
This is what dentists used to use to make fillings. You know mix this with powdered silver push it into a cavity and it

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.989
Harden up and be chemically resistant and quick fix your tooth which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about putting mercury in your mouth

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.209
Now what would actually happen if we got mercury in our mouth would that be concerned as metallic mercury. It's actually fairly

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.489
Okay, spit it out. You'll be fine. Okay

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.159
It's only when it's dissolved into a solution that can be absorbed another body. It's really a problem. So this is a branded

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.089
Argenteum now that's actually the word for silver

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.330
And I'm pretty sure this is just referencing that this is quicksilver. Which is another name for Mercury

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.080
Yeah, I always thought quicksilver had to do with surfing so like the shirts I used to wear quicksilver

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.959
But actually quicksilver in a second term is mercury

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.619
I think it's called quicksilver because it's silvery in color and if you drop it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.039
It moves quickly a couple it moves very quickly, and we don't want to drop that today

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.039
So mercury is an extremely heavy liquid

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.610
It's very dense 13 times heavier than water and so if you try to pull it up a tube, you'll reach a point

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.069
Where you cannot pull it up any more because you know you're not really sucking a liquid of the tube just the atmospheric pressure

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.529
pushing it up into the vacuum

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.860
You're creating at sea level you get about fourteen point seven pounds per square inch pushing down and so you should be able to lift

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.949
The equivalent of 14 pounds of Mercury so we have a long glass Tube here

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.660
it's very narrow and cody just challenged me to see if we could put one end into a bottle of mercury and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.880
Suck the other end like a straw and see we could suck a hard enough to get the mercury in our mouth so that is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.329
A risk I'm willing to take for you can we suck Mercury vertically through a Tube?

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.329
You know a distance of four and a half feet

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.209
So drop down to the comment to take a second to tell us who you think sucks more?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.030
You really?

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.869
Alright guys a quick update these rods are a little bit too long, so kota

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.099
Just used his cool little glass cutting tool when we trimmed them down to about 36 inches or about three feet

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.439
so I have one job and my only job right now is to make sure the bottom of this measuring stick stays level with the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.089
Top of the Mercury when cody starts sucking we're going to be able to measure in real inches of Mercury

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.190
How much vacuum he's able to pull all right cody you ready for this all right? Let's see what you got

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.280
Wow, right off the bat that's pretty impressive. He's already up to 20, so you got 19 inches of Mercury

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.620
And go any harder than that

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.160
Maybe if I tried really hard all right, let's try it again all right 19. Inches is good. It's not that impressive

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.429
You start freezing nitrogen around 22? Oh?

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.340
There's 22

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.920
But all we can do what do you see there 22 and 3/4 okay here? It comes LfO bounces on the way up

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.940
boom okay, so at 21 22

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.689
It's kind of bouncing there so stuart settles out for about 21 and 3/4 how's your mouth stealing cody ah?

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.479
It takes a lot of work

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.269
So I'm just like kind of pumping the air with my tongue trying to evacuate as much of the air out of Tube as I

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.650
Can especially as hard as I possibly can and I was unable to pull the mercury all the way up to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.549
The vacuum pump that I'm using says it can pull 25 inches of Mercury

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.200
And I filled with a lot of the reactions

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.999
I do it's right around 22 inches of mercury that I see balloons expanding I see water boiling xSede liquid nitrogen

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.459
Freezing cody got up to 21

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.359
It's like almost 20 to 21 and 3/4 which actually wasn't too bad

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.120
So theoretically if you could suck hard enough for long enough you might be able to freeze liquid nitrogen like yourself

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.299
That's cool. All right. I'm going to jump in and see what I can do

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.300
We'll do that 4.4

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.820
the best licks more

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.979
Shall we get to the point where saliva boiling?

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.960
Ya

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.639
Mean want to pull out, but yet

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.529
Hey, oh yeah. See there's none of that oh

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.699
Whoo that was interesting though it felt like as I was moving the tube up the mercury is actually dropping back down the Tube

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.460
Like it was jiggling even though I was moving yeah as you move the rod up. You know a mercury actually went back down

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.379
Yeah, Mercury is always going to stay at the same height above the surface of the Merc which is interesting right?

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.339
it's not like you can just plug it and move this thing around it's like as I moved it up the Mercury went down as

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.340
I moved it down the Mercury went back up

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.029
This time I'm going to try and pull it out, and I'm going to set it back down beside the disks there, okay here

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.030
we go

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.090
oh

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.960
Yeah, career fect oh that's amazing. Let's take a second to just talk about what happened there

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.890
So what we saw?

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.080
Here is actually pulled a vacuum above the mercury the air pressure pushed some retreat up the Tube

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.469
And we weren't able to get a perfect vacuum, but we were able to actually get a pretty decent vacuum. We pulled the mercury of

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.230
23 something check out my tongue I

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.420
Was trying to hold the vacuum with my tongue. It's like sucking my tongue down inside. I think it's an interesting point

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.719
It's not necessarily that I was sucking the liquid up

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.360
It's just I was reducing the pressure and the outside air pressure

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.330
Was pushing the mercury back ups all right and since mercury is so heavy the distance that air pressure can push it up is

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.349
Just a couple of pieces yeah once you get up around there 24 25

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:06.350
It gets very very difficult to go any higher like what would you consider a perfect vacuum in inches of Mercury so at this altitude?

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.750
We're not at sea level right now

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.490
25 inches of Mercury would be about a certain vacuum if you're at sea level would be about 29

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.839
That's really interesting because when you think about it the closer you get to sea level the more

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.040
Atmosphere you have pressing down and so when you reduce the atmosphere inside the Tube

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.770
There's actually more pressure to push it up so at sea level

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.509
29 inches of Mercury might be close to perfect vacuum and our altitude here

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.080
It's closer to 25, so that's very interesting that by sucking it by mouth

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.800
We can actually approach very very closely to those numbers however that last inch of mercury is kind of where all the magic happens

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.050
Now we're going to hook the vacuum pump up and see how high the vacuum pump can pull the mercury

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.289
When I bought this vacuum pump here it claims to be able to do 25 inches of Mercury

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.180
Which we read on our gauge all the time

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.190
So we're put that to the test with real mercury and real inches and observe the difference exactly

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.600
Cody's over here trying to rig everything together with glass and torches and do everything professional

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.830
I think I'm just going to shove this down the tube use a little electrical tape and see if we can Jimmy rig it that

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.830
way

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:13.579
All right, what do you think that can do it? Yeah? We'll get a

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:23.209
Glass Tube connected to the poly vacuum Tube. We're going to draw with the machine power and see how machine compares all right here

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.210
We go man versus machine let's kick on the pump

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:27.949
Well, that's back

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:31.848
So it's like to turn men women can go ahead

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.299
Yeah, a little bit of momentum there probably turn it on now

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:43.219
top of the Mercury

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.999
25-ish be a high-pressure day

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.249
There's a little over 25 yeah 3 almost on a twenty six

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:58.339
Twenty five and three quarters and the bottom of the ruler is matching the top of the mercury it is

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:02.898
1325 and three quarters. Yeah, is it creeping its way up a little bit more

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.170
Not really. It's just kind of hold. I know you always knew you're right, but now I know why you're right

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.880
right on right on

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.429
So cool. Let's talk about this for a second kody sucked the mercury up almost 22 inches of Mercury

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:29.089
I got almost to 24, and I think this elevation a full vacuum would be somewhere around 25 little more than 25

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:31.099
We've got this way up to 26 - is that really accurate

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:38.000
Both the air pressure is high you know it's this nice day then the pressure will be higher and the Mercury will go a lot

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.820
More fact that's how barometers work and to go over to my channel. That was a little ordinary building next

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:46.429
So very cool experiment man versus machine

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.899
I think what we saw is the machine actually sucks about an inch or two of Mercury more than we do

00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:57.379
But what's interesting is that inch or two makes all the difference in watching the actual reactions inside of a space?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.669
Another thing is just making sense to me now is the reason that they probably use Mercury's in the old

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.009
Thermometers is because it's such a dense metal

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.270
So it takes a lot to move it and that way you can compact it into a small space. It's one reason

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.249
I mean if you used like a really light metal like aluminum your thermometer would have to be like ten times bigger

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:20.840
Yeah, like the old alcohol thermometers actually had a spiral because out and so mark no kidding. That's cool

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:27.770
So on the periodic table of elements Mercury is actually listed. HG correct great. That's why if you look at the gauge

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.150
You're actually going to see a little in Hg. It's actually measured in inches of Mercury now

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.120
you know

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.520
If you guys like these mercury experiments and the things that we're doing to glass tubes check out what we're doing on

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:44.810
Cody's Lab's channel. We're building barometers to actually measure the differential and pressure around us. Like on a good day

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:50.330
So the pressure is higher than on a rainy day, and a barometer can be used to predict that very old technology

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.129
But still very relevant today, and we use it all the time you just don't know about it because now it's on Google weather

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:02.479
so hopefully this helps answer the question of why gauges are measured in inches of Mercury that puts a little visual with it and of

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.740
Course a big thanks to our friend brown thunder for requesting this in the comments below you can go ahead and check your YouTube inbox

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.520
Brown thunder or sending 25 bucks. Thanks for joining us for this experiment today

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.520
We'll be looking for you the next one talk to you there

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.199
It comes a little bit numb from stretching so hard

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.320
Don't put Mercury in your mouth guys
