00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.992
For our third problem, y would be equal to 8. Great work for getting that one

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:08.170
correct. You might have had trouble with the set up, so let's see how we can do

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.049
that. We know x varies directly with y, so they should be directly across from

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.630
each other in our proportion. But for z, x varies inversely, so z should appear

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.608
in the denominator. I want to start by plugging in the values of my first case

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:28.866
first, x1 is 5, y1 is 5, and z1 is 3. In my second case, I don't know this value

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:33.434
of y. It's what we're looking for. So I'd be sure to list y2 as my variable. Or

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:39.844
just y. The second value for x is 6, and the second value for z is positive 4.

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:43.820
Now we have an equation we can solve with a rational expression. We multiply

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.153
these two fractions together, to get 20 divided by 3y. Then we cross-multiply to

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:55.345
get 15 y times 120. And finally we divide by 15 to get y is equal to 8. Again, I

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:59.278
think the setup to this problem is probably the hardest. You want to make sure

00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:02.690
that when you're varying directly, things are across from one another. Whereas

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.913
if things vary inversely, they're diagonally across from one another.
