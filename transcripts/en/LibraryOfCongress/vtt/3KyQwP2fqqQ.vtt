From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.390
Hi, I'm Anya Creightney
and this is the Letters

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.530
About Literature video
series Today we'll be talking

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.660
about the Letters About
Literature program.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.640
As you may know, the Letters

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.220
About Literature program is a
writing competition For students

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.800
on grades four to twelve Wherein
participants polish their

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.150
reflective skills By writing
a letter to an author,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.750
living or dead These letters
explain how an author's work

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.420
changed a student's view of him
or herself and/or the world.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.520
Now let's talk about
how to write a letter

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.970
for the competition It's as easy
as following these simple steps.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.240
First, we have to find our book.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.760
A book that makes us feel
something unique or special.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.650
It could be a book your parents
read when you were little,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.170
A book you take pride
on being able to read,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.030
Or a book that has
changed you over time.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.090
To help you think of a book,
let's do a little activity.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.650
First, think of three books that
have a special meaning to you.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.000
Then, think of the responses
you had while reading the books.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.340
How did the book make you feel?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.020
How did you identify
with the book?

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.920
What did the book
help you imagine?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.850
After thinking of
these responses,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.380
write them down on
a sheet of paper.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.110
Remember, great reader
responses are not solely based

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.610
on the physical level, like the
color of a character's hair;

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.490
Your response should go under
the surface, Like describing why

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.290
and how the story or its
characters affect you.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.840
After you finish this list,
you are ready to pick a book!

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.330
Choose one of the three books
based on your reader's response!

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.740
After making your selection,
find the author of the book.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.390
Remember, your author can
be any gender, any age,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.170
any color It's just
important you relate

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.330
to the author you choose.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.200
If you're stumped, don't
hesitate to ask your teachers

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.070
or librarians for
authors suggestions.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.280
I am sure they are more
than happy to help!

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.270
Now that we have your
book and its author,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.510
let's get to the fun
part: writing the letter!

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.270
For this part, imagine you are
sitting down with the author

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.470
and sharing your
personal thoughts.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.140
What do you want to say?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.620
Your letter should be
personal and sincere,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.660
More like a private
conversation rather

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.050
than a book report
or a fan letter.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.050
In your letter, remember
to share specific details

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.570
about your reaction to
the book, Always thinking

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.500
about what you read and
the meaning you gleaned

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.910
from the author's words.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.220
After you finish your
letter, ask your teacher,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.800
parent or guardian to help
you submit your letter

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.640
To Letters About Literature.
