00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.605
What drives someone to kill in cold blood?

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:12.035
What goes through the murderer’s mind?

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:15.505
And what kind of a society 
breeds such people?

00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:17.725
Over 150 years ago

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.465
Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky 
took these questions up

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:26.025
in what would become one of the 
best-known works of Russian literature:

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.146
"Crime and Punishment."

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:32.806
First serialized in a literary 
magazine in 1866,

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:37.016
the novel tells the story of Rodion 
Romanovich Raskolnikov,

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:40.217
a young law student in Saint Petersburg.

00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:42.907
Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty,

00:00:42.907 --> 00:00:47.357
and at the start of the story has run 
out of funds to continue his studies.

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:50.953
Letters from his rural home 
only add to his distress

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:56.513
when he realizes how much his mother and 
sister have sacrificed for his success.

00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:57.861
Increasingly desperate

00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:01.781
after selling the last of his valuables
to an elderly pawnbroker,

00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:05.861
he resolves on a plan 
to murder and rob her.

00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:09.331
But the impact of carrying out 
this unthinkable act

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:12.801
proves to be more than 
he was prepared for.

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:17.571
Though the novel is sometimes cited as one
of the first psychological thrillers,

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:21.837
its scope reaches far beyond 
Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil.

00:01:21.837 --> 00:01:24.407
From dank taverns to dilapidated 
apartments

00:01:24.407 --> 00:01:26.967
and claustrophobic police stations,

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:30.857
the underbelly of 19th century Saint 
Petersburg is brought to life

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.817
by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose.

00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:36.937
We’re introduced to characters 
such as Marmeladov,

00:01:36.937 --> 00:01:41.497
a miserable former official who 
has drank his family into ruin,

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:46.272
and Svidrigailov, an unhinged 
and lecherous nobleman.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.468
As Raskolnikov’s own family 
arrives in town,

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:52.998
their moral innocence stands 
in stark contrast

00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:55.297
to the depravity of those around them,

00:01:55.297 --> 00:01:58.807
even as their fates grow 
increasingly intertwined.

00:01:58.807 --> 00:02:01.167
This bleak portrait of Russian society

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:06.517
reflects the author’s own complex life 
experiences and evolving ideas.

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:10.470
As a young writer who left behind 
a promising military career,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.470
Fyodor had been attracted to 
ideas of socialism and reform,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.670
and joined a circle of intellectuals to 
discuss radical texts

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.326
banned by the Imperial government.

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:22.576
Upon exposure,

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:26.276
members of this group, including 
Dostoyevsky, were arrested.

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:27.916
Many were sentenced to death,

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:33.836
only to be subjected to a mock execution 
and last-minute pardon from the Tsar.

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:38.056
Dostoyevsky spent the next four 
years in a Siberian labor camp

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:41.135
before being released in 1854.

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:45.883
The experience left him with a far 
more pessimistic view of social reform,

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:49.381
and his focus shifted toward 
spiritual concerns.

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:53.281
In the 1864 novella "Notes from 
Underground,"

00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:56.991
he expounded on his belief that utopian
Western philosophies

00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:01.651
could never satisfy the contradictory 
yearnings of the human soul.

00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:05.953
"Crime and Punishment" was conceived 
and completed the following year,

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:08.593
picking up on many of the same themes.

00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:09.413
In many ways,

00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:12.083
the novel follows a common 
narrative thread

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:17.053
where a promising youth is seduced and
corrupted by the dangers of urban life.

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:20.125
But its social critique cuts far deeper.

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:23.135
Raskolnikov rationalizes that 
his own advancement

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:26.355
at the cost of the exploitative 
pawnbroker’s death

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:29.235
would be a net benefit to society.

00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:30.245
In doing so,

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:34.045
he echoes the doctrines of egoism 
and utilitarianism

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:38.455
embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s 
contemporary intellectuals.

00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:43.429
And in believing that his intelligence 
allows him to transcend moral taboos,

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:47.369
Raskolnikov cuts himself off from 
his own humanity.

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.459
Yet although the book is deeply 
concerned with morality,

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.299
"Crime and Punishment" never comes across
as merely moralizing,

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.309
with each character given their own 
distinctive and convincing voice.

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.118
One of the most remarkable things about
"Crime and Punishment"

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:03.858
is its ability to thrill

00:04:03.858 --> 00:04:08.578
despite the details of the central murder 
being revealed in the first act.

00:04:08.578 --> 00:04:11.030
Raskolnikov’s crime is clear.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.620
But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s 
gripping account

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.250
of the ensuing social and 
psychological turmoil

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.830
that we learn the true nature 
of his punishment–

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.550
and the possibility of redemption.
