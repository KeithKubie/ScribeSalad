00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:02.317
- [Voiceover] Kleiber's law, above,

00:00:02.317 --> 00:00:05.150
relates the basal metabolic rate, B,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.317
measured in kilocalories per day,

00:00:07.317 --> 00:00:10.184
of an animal to its body mass, M,

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:11.950
measured in kilograms.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.283
If the body mass of an
elephant is 10 to the sixth

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.584
times that of a mouse,
which of the following

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.750
best compares their basal metabolic rates?

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.050
Alright, well, let's think
about this a little bit.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.418
So, let's just say B sub lowercase M

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:29.917
that the basal metabolic rate of a mouse,

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:32.517
well, that's going to be equal to 70

00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:36.817
times the body mass of a mouse,

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:39.617
that's why I wrote the subscript
lowercase M, for mouse,

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:42.350
to the zero point seven five.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.917
Now, based on that, what's going to be

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:47.083
the basal metabolic rate of an elephant?

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:49.585
Well, the basal metabolic
rate of the elephant

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:53.351
is going to be 70 times, I could write

00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:58.351
the mass of an elephant to the
zero point seven five power,

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.350
but we know that the mass of an elephant

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.253
is 10 to the sixth times that of a mouse.

00:01:03.253 --> 00:01:04.984
So, instead of writing
the mass of an elephant

00:01:04.984 --> 00:01:08.194
right over here, I could instead write

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:12.350
10 to the sixth times the mass of a mouse,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.917
to the zero point seven five power.

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:16.051
And once again, I don't want this notation

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:19.184
to confuse you since I'm referring to

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:21.220
B for a mouse and B for an elephant,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.022
I'm using the subscripts to differentiate.

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:27.184
This is the basal metabolic,

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:29.150
the basal metabolic rate

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.084
for a mouse, this is the basal metabolic

00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.350
rate for an elephant.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.718
This is the body mass of a mouse,

00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:37.617
this is the body mass of an elephant,

00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:40.550
which is 10 to the sixth
times that of a mouse.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.884
I could have written, I
could have, over here,

00:01:42.884 --> 00:01:46.550
this is the same thing as
the mass of an elephant.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.284
We know that the mass of the elephant

00:01:48.284 --> 00:01:50.550
is, or of an elephant, is 10 to the sixth

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.617
times that of a mouse.

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:55.917
And the reason why I did that
is once you write it this way,

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:57.751
we can now express this in terms of

00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:02.018
the basal metabolic rate of a mouse.

00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:03.283
What am I talking about?

00:02:03.283 --> 00:02:05.117
Well, let's use a little
bit of exponent properties

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:06.517
to rewrite this.

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:09.317
So, this is going to be equal to 70.

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:14.317
And then all of this stuff
in, that I'm squaring off

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:17.283
in green, well, if i have
the product of two things

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:19.317
raised to an exponent,
that's the same thing

00:02:19.317 --> 00:02:21.150
as raising each of these two exponents

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.661
and then taking the products.

00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.819
So, this is gonna be 70
times 10 to the sixth,

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.884
to the zero point seven five,

00:02:28.884 --> 00:02:33.884
times the mass of a mouse to
the zero point seven five.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.451
And now I can rearrange it.

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.150
This is going to be equal
to, stay true to the colors.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.752
70 times the mass of a mouse

00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:47.984
to the zero point seven five power.

00:02:47.984 --> 00:02:50.817
And then you're going to have this thing.

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:52.517
Times.

00:02:52.517 --> 00:02:54.984
So, 10 to the sixth to the
zero point seven five power.

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:56.650
If I raise something to an exponent

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.417
and then raise that to an exponent,

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:00.650
that's just like raising
the 10 to the product

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.684
of six times zero point seven five.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:07.251
So, what's six times
zero point seven five?

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:11.384
Let's see, that is going
to be, that is going to be

00:03:11.384 --> 00:03:14.453
four point five.

00:03:14.453 --> 00:03:15.384
One way to think about it, that's gonna be

00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:17.583
three fourths of six.

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:20.250
So, zero point seven
five is three fourths.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.517
So, six times three over four

00:03:23.517 --> 00:03:26.717
is going to be 18 over four,

00:03:26.717 --> 00:03:29.283
which is the same thing
as four and a half.

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:31.554
So, raising 10 to the sixth power

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:33.817
and then raising that to
the zero point seven five,

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:35.317
that's the same thing as raising 10

00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:37.450
to the four point five power.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.985
Now, why is this interesting?

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:42.818
Well, this part of the
expression right over here

00:03:42.818 --> 00:03:46.617
is the basal metabolic rate of the mouse.

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:49.884
So, this is equal to the basal
metabolic rate of the mouse

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:54.884
times, times 10 to the four point five.

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:57.751
So, what we're able to
show, just like that,

00:03:57.751 --> 00:04:00.384
is that the basal metabolic
rate of an elephant

00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:03.984
is 10 to the four point five times

00:04:03.984 --> 00:04:06.617
the basal metabolic rate of the mouse.

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:08.383
So, let's see if any of
these choices say that.

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:10.003
The basal metabolic rate of an elephant

00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:12.517
is zero point seven five
times that of a mouse?

00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:16.150
No, it's 10 to the four point
five times that of a mouse.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.517
So, let's rule that one out.

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:19.150
The basal metabolic rate of the mouse

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.750
is 10 to the four point five
times that of an elephant.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.650
Nope, doesn't make any
sense 'cause this is saying

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.313
the mouse has a higher metabolic rate,

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:29.118
basal metabolic rate in terms of how many

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:30.518
kilocalories per day it burns.

00:04:30.518 --> 00:04:31.484
You wouldn't have to do any math,

00:04:31.484 --> 00:04:33.317
you just say this seems crazy that a mouse

00:04:33.317 --> 00:04:35.917
would burn more calories than an elephant.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:37.519
The basal metabolic rate of an elephant

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.855
is 10 to the four point
five times that of a mouse.

00:04:39.855 --> 00:04:42.717
Well, that's exactly what we came up with.

00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:44.317
The basal metabolic rate of an elephant

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:47.217
is 10 the sixth times that of a mouse.

00:04:47.217 --> 00:04:49.619
And we already know that that's
not going to be the case.

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:50.950
Now, another way that
you could have tackled it

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.783
is you could have just looked at this.

00:04:52.783 --> 00:04:53.884
You could have just looked at this

00:04:53.884 --> 00:04:57.351
and said, okay, look, if I increase M

00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:00.427
by 10 to the sixth, if I
increase it by a factor

00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:03.184
of 10 to the sixth, I'm gonna increase B

00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:05.250
not by a factor of 10 to the sixth,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.783
but by a factor of 10 to the sixth

00:05:06.783 --> 00:05:09.884
to the zero point seven five.

00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:14.537
To the zero point seven
five, and 10 to the sixth

00:05:14.537 --> 00:05:17.784
to the zero point seven
five is the same thing

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:22.517
as 10 to the sixth times
zero point seven five.

00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:27.284
Which is equal to 10 to
the four point five power,

00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:30.551
which we have right, right over here.

00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:32.317
So, these first two,
you could have actually

00:05:32.317 --> 00:05:33.683
probably knocked out just off of

00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:35.950
a little bit of deductive reasoning.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.083
And even this last one to some degree

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.117
'cause you can say look, you know,

00:05:39.117 --> 00:05:41.721
if I increase this by a certain factor,

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:43.886
because I'm raising this to an exponent,

00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:46.861
this, the basal metabolic
rate won't increase

00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:49.117
directly by that same factor.

00:05:49.117 --> 00:05:50.383
So, but either way, we were able to

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.867
figure out exactly, as well.
