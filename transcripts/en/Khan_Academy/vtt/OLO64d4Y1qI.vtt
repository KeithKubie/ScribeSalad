00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.040
We are faced with a
fairly daunting-looking

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.870
indefinite integral of pi
over x natural log of x dx.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.340
Now, what can we
do to address this?

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.730
Is u-substitution
a possibility here?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.500
Well for u-substitution,
we want to look

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.660
for an expression
and its derivative.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.860
Well, what happens if we set u
equal to the natural log of x?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.280
Now what would du be
equal to in that scenario?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.130
du is going to be the derivative
of the natural log of x

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.920
with respect to x,
which is just 1/x dx.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.360
This is an equivalent
statement to saying

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.330
that du dx is equal to 1/x.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.020
So do we see a 1/x dx anywhere
in this original expression?

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.120
Well, it's kind of hiding.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.520
It's not so obvious, but
this x in the denominator

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250
is essentially a 1/x.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.210
And then that's being
multiplied by a dx.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.010
Let me rewrite this
original expression

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.485
to make a little bit more sense.

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:03.110
So the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to take the pi.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.651
I should do that in
a different color

00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:06.940
since I've already
used-- let me take the pi

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.510
and just stick it out front.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.640
So I'm going to stick the pi
out in front of the integral.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.970
And so this becomes
the integral of--

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.010
and let me write the 1 over
natural log of x first.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.891
1 over the natural
log of x times 1/x dx.

00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:24.390
Now it becomes a
little bit clearer.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.430
These are completely
equivalent statements.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.230
But this makes it
clear that, yes,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.540
u-substitution will
work over here.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.170
If we set our u equal to
natural log of x, then

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.980
our du is 1/x dx.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.320
Let's rewrite this integral.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.280
It's going to be equal to pi
times the indefinite integral

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.805
of 1/u.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.220
Natural log of x is u-- we
set that equal to natural log

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.130
of x-- times du.

00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:06.330
Now this becomes
pretty straightforward.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.630
What is the antiderivative
of all of this business?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.210
And we've done very similar
things like this multiple times

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.250
already.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.460
This is going to be equal
to pi times the natural log

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.580
of the absolute
value of u so that we

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.200
can handle even
negative values of u.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.040
The natural log of the
absolute value of u plus c,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.870
just in case we had a
constant factor out here.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.830
And we're almost done.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.860
We just have to
unsubstitute for the u.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.630
u is equal to natural log of x.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.220
So we end up with this kind
of neat-looking expression.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.690
The anti of this
entire indefinite

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.050
integral we have simplified.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.110
We have evaluated
it, and it is now

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.050
equal to pi times the natural
log of the absolute value of u.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.100
But u is just the
natural log of x.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.220
And then we have this
plus c right over here.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.220
And we could have assumed
that, from the get go,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.680
this original
expression was only

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.441
defined for positive
values of x because you had

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:11.940
to take the natural
log here, and it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.070
wasn't an absolute value.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.510
So we can leave this as
just a natural log of x,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.377
but this also works
for the situations

00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:21.710
now because we're doing the
absolute value of that where

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.220
the natural log of x might
have been a negative number.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.360
For example, if it was a natural
log of 0.5 or, who knows,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.660
whatever it might be.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.980
But then we are all done.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.520
We have simplified
what seemed like a kind

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.620
of daunting expression.
