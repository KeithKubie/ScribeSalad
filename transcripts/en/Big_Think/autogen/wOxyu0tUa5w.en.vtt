i think that that's a you know not
 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.530
i think that that's a you know not
necessary but i also think that it's not

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
necessary but i also think that it's not
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.910
necessary but i also think that it's not
really desirable i don't i think that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920
really desirable i don't i think that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
in it but I do think that people need to
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.160
in it but I do think that people need to
step back from it a little bit set aside

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170
step back from it a little bit set aside
 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.649

constantly always on way that people
tend to follow culture today that people

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709
tend to follow culture today that people
 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.620
tend to follow culture today that people
tend to consume culture today I think

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630
tend to consume culture today I think
 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.060

people need to carve out spaces in their

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070
people need to carve out spaces in their
 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.370
people need to carve out spaces in their
lives for for contemplation and for

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380
lives for for contemplation and for
 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.979
lives for for contemplation and for
working on bigger projects that to me is

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989
working on bigger projects that to me is
 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.750
working on bigger projects that to me is
the solution and that I think is the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
the solution and that I think is the
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.300
the solution and that I think is the
solution to what you're asking about to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
solution to what you're asking about to
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.160
solution to what you're asking about to
which is um you know how do you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
which is um you know how do you
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.140
which is um you know how do you
how do you sort of step back from the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
how do you sort of step back from the
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.180
how do you sort of step back from the
homogeneity which of course is a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190
homogeneity which of course is a
 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.699
homogeneity which of course is a
homogeneity that's born out of constant

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709
homogeneity that's born out of constant
 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.240
homogeneity that's born out of constant
novelty and I think that that you don't

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
novelty and I think that that you don't
 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.740
novelty and I think that that you don't
want to step away from entirely but

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750
want to step away from entirely but
 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.930
want to step away from entirely but
neither but but neither can you allow

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940
neither but but neither can you allow
 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.160
neither but but neither can you allow
yourself to just stay completely

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170
yourself to just stay completely
 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.030
yourself to just stay completely
marinated in

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040
 
 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.649
 
well i think you know we are social

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659
well i think you know we are social
 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.920
well i think you know we are social
animals and um you know we you know part

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
animals and um you know we you know part
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.429
animals and um you know we you know part
of the part of the reason why we like

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439
of the part of the reason why we like
 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.690
of the part of the reason why we like
culture is precisely that we like to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
culture is precisely that we like to
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.220
culture is precisely that we like to
talk to other people about it that we

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
talk to other people about it that we
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.170
talk to other people about it that we
like to be sharing something with other

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
like to be sharing something with other
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.729
like to be sharing something with other
people i mean you could say that culture

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739
people i mean you could say that culture
 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.309
people i mean you could say that culture
is the sort of social space between

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319
is the sort of social space between
 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.030
is the sort of social space between
people and that we would be a you know

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
people and that we would be a you know
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.339
people and that we would be a you know
not very effective humans at all if we

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349
not very effective humans at all if we
 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.789
not very effective humans at all if we
if we weren't um you know inherently

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799
if we weren't um you know inherently
 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.750
if we weren't um you know inherently
interested in the things that other

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
interested in the things that other
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.119
interested in the things that other
people are interested in um you know I

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129
people are interested in um you know I
 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.759
people are interested in um you know I
think that so yeah to me you know a lot

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769
think that so yeah to me you know a lot
 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.589
think that so yeah to me you know a lot
of this stuff about the herd mentality

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599
of this stuff about the herd mentality
 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.860
of this stuff about the herd mentality
and the bandwagon effect you know we a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870
and the bandwagon effect you know we a
 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.199
and the bandwagon effect you know we a
lot of times code that as being you know

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
lot of times code that as being you know
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.809
lot of times code that as being you know
conformity and entirely negative and we

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819
conformity and entirely negative and we
 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.729
conformity and entirely negative and we
see it you know we think about the Nazis

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739
see it you know we think about the Nazis
 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.740
see it you know we think about the Nazis
or something but of course it's just the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750
or something but of course it's just the
 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.690
or something but of course it's just the
basic stuff of what it means to be human

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700
basic stuff of what it means to be human
 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.369
basic stuff of what it means to be human
um and you know to me a lot of this kind

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379
um and you know to me a lot of this kind
 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.240
um and you know to me a lot of this kind
of internet culture what makes it so

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
of internet culture what makes it so
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.159
of internet culture what makes it so
fascinating is that the tools of the

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169
fascinating is that the tools of the
 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.199
fascinating is that the tools of the
internet allow us to see what other

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209
internet allow us to see what other
 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.719
internet allow us to see what other
people are seeing to track what other

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729
people are seeing to track what other
 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.309
people are seeing to track what other
people are viewing you know we have all

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319
people are viewing you know we have all
 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.710
people are viewing you know we have all
this data that allows us to see you know

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
this data that allows us to see you know
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.860
this data that allows us to see you know
what's what's popular and what isn't and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
what's what's popular and what isn't and
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.039
what's what's popular and what isn't and
so we have all of these tools that let

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049
so we have all of these tools that let
 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.099
so we have all of these tools that let
us see it you know where the herd is

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109
us see it you know where the herd is
 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.629
us see it you know where the herd is
going and so it makes it that much

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639
going and so it makes it that much
 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.750
going and so it makes it that much
easier to follow me
