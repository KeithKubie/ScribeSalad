00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:02.300
(whoosh and click)

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.620

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.240

(upbeat deep bass guitar music)

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.510
- Hello, good afternoon.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.753
I'm John Campbell, a philosophy
professor here at Berkeley,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.880
and I'd like to welcome you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.553
to this rainy windswept Howison Lecture.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.270
George Howison was born in 1834.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.240
He really entered academic
life as a mathematics professor

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.110
at the University of
Washington at St. Louis,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
so he began his academic life
as a mathematics professor

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210
but in St. Louis, he joined a group

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.543
who were reading Hegel's
Phenomenology of Spirit.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.770
This was a rather
rambunctious, larger than life,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.983
collection of academic characters.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.633
The St. Louis Hegelians
were a very vibrant force.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.670
They were very engaged with
and ultimately swept away

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.603
by the emerging naturalism
in American philosophy.

00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:45.411
Howison's legacy was
perhaps the most enduring

00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:49.290
of any of them.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.830
He seems to have had Josiah Royce,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.210
in particular, as his nemesis.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.090
Howison wrote:

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.970
The most depressing sign
about Josiah Royce's thinking

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.450
is that he seems perfectly aware
how this makes no provision

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.340
either for immortality or for real freedom

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.570
and yet he appears to have
no uneasiness under it

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.810
but to contemplate this
ghastly destiny of ours

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.180
with a complacency even
savoring of self-satisfaction.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.751
(audience laughing)

00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:24.933
Howison had a lot of gusto I think.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.720
He became the holder of
the first endowed chair

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.217
in philosophy at Berkeley,

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:33.450
and he built the philosophy department.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.450
He was evidently an influential
and much-loved individual,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.970
and on his death, his
friends and colleagues

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.770
put together a fund that
is funding today's lecture

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.160
to continue his work by bringing

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.993
the most influential figures
of the day to speak here.

00:02:48.993 --> 00:02:49.826
And I think we really
couldn't have a better person

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:54.700
to fill that role than
Professor Kwame Anthony Appiah.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.403
He's had many awards and honors.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.490
A representative sample
would be, for example,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.990
the National Humanities Medal,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.770
Forbes magazine put him on a list

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.910
of the world's seven
most powerful thinkers.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.311
This is not usually what happens
to philosophy professors.

00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:21.970
(audience laughing)

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.060
In his many books, he's challenged

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.400
and engaged with questions
about identity and culture

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.680
that matter to all of us every day.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.510
He said that we should live
with fractured identities,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.950
engage in identity play,
find solidarity, yes,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.950
but recognize contingency,
and above all practice irony.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.047
In a memorable passage, he said,

00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:51.787
"The truth is that there are no races.

00:03:51.787 --> 00:03:56.237
"There is nothing in the world
we can ask race to do for us.

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:59.187
"As we've seen, even the biologists notion

00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:01.467
"has only limited uses,

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:04.617
"and the notion that underlies
the more hateful racisms

00:04:04.617 --> 00:04:09.277
"of the modern era refers to
nothing in the world at all."

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.440
But he's written across a
very wide range of subjects.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.273
His dissertation was in
probabilistic semantics,

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:20.258
his first two books were
on philosophy of language.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.050
He's written three novels.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.260
It's been an extraordinary career

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.570
covering a panorama of topics,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.760
and today we are privileged
to hear the latest direction

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.850
of his current work,
which as I understand it,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.780
he's opening up the topic of idealization.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.770
So his lecture today is called
the Philosophy of "As If."

00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:48.168
Will you please join me in
welcoming Professor Appiah.

00:04:48.168 --> 00:04:51.251
(audience applauds)

00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:58.630
- Thank you.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.823
Thanks very much for
that kind introduction.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.362
Imagine you were raised in a devout

00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:08.362
Shui-Bian parsonage near
Tuebingen in the mid-19th century.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.940
That may be hard for some of you.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.790
And grew up with great respect

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.270
for the leading theologians of your age.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.030
Imagine, too, that you had
the profoundest engagement

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.130
with the ethical and aesthetic
aspects of Christianity.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.060
Suppose, finally, that you
became a serious student

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.900
of Kant and Schopenhauer Nietzsche

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.200
and that you moved in part as a result

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.150
from theism, to pantheism, to agnosticism,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.983
while retaining your Christian ethical

00:05:35.983 --> 00:05:39.920
and aesthetic commitments.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.753
Then, since like all
educated men and women

00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:41.586
of your place and time, you were familiar

00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:46.586
with classical Greek and Roman ideas,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.500
you might come to feel, quote,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.800
according to the customs of
the cultured Greeks and Romans,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.610
one may regard and treat
these myths as myths

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.340
and yet, or rather, just because of this

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.290
continue to esteem such fictions

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.533
for their ethical and aesthetic value.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.780
This was pretty much what
happened to Hans Vaihinger,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.710
the philosopher who wrote those words

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.620
in his autobiographical essay,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.825
which preceded his 1911 magnum opus

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:18.533
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:22.100
translated in 1924 into
English by CK Ogden

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.197
as The Philosophy "of As If".

00:06:26.556 --> 00:06:29.950
Vaihinger tells us there,
that he breached the view

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.630
that theology was composed
of, what he called, myths

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.000
by his mid-20s, about the
time of his graduation

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.002
from the University of Tuebingen.

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:40.730
Over the next 40 years as a student

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.950
of the history of mathematics

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.620
and the physic physical sciences

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.204
and while keeping up with
the psychology of his day,

00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:48.880
Vaihinger came to apply the same strategy

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.820
over and over again to
one field after another.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.820
Abandoning realism about a domain, atoms,

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.460
infinitesimally, imaginary numbers, law,

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.223
space, abstract objects, force,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.210
economics, freedom, the idea of freedom,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.870
but maintaining what he called his esteem,

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.723
for the corresponding ideas
because of their utility.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.660
And in explicitly connecting
this strategy with the one

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.910
that Kant had made famous in arguing

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.230
that rational agency required
us to act as if we were free,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.130
even though our theoretical understanding

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.488
showed that we were
governed by immutable laws,

00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:33.670
he claimed a Kantian
ancestry for his ideas.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.225
Indeed in the final section
of the philosophy of as if,

00:07:37.225 --> 00:07:41.060
Vaihinger records scores
of places in Kant's work

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.940
where his great predecessor
speaks of proceeding

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.373
as if what is theoretically
known to be false, is true.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.980
Vaihinger's suggestion that
large areas of our thought

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.570
are fictions amounts to this.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.390
Very often we can reasonably proceed,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.560
as if what we know to be false, were true,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.280
because it's useful for
some purpose to do so.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.720
There were shades here
of pragmatism of course,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.930
on the first page of the
general introductory remarks

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.120
on fictional constructs, Vaihinger wrote,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.010
it must be remembered, that
the object of the world

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.430
of ideas as a whole, is not
the portrayal of reality,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.710
this would be an utterly impossible task

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.870
but rather to provide an instrument

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.503
for finding our way about
more easily in the world.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.670
Vaihinger proposed in essence

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.910
that an idealization is a useful fiction.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.110
Or as he once put it that fictions are

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.920
errors but fruitful errors.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.810
And for anyone interested in
this powerful way of thinking

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.750
about idealization, Vaihinger
work is a treasure trove

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.383
of interesting resources.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.420
But there's one way
which Vaihinger differs

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.569
from at least one strand of pragmatism;

00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:02.154
he thinks that there's a
gap between what is true

00:09:02.154 --> 00:09:04.600
and what it is useful to believe.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.440
That's why he asserts that
most of our thought is fiction.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.280
If you equated the true
and the useful to believe

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.490
as people say some pragmatists do,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.970
then you would lose exactly the contrast

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.620
that guided the philosophy of 'As If'.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.730
And that book is the work
of a modern philosopher

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.190
who thought long and hard about

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.966
this particular tangle of ideas

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:27.730
and thought about its application
over the widest range.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.620
Others may have gone
deeper into idealization

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.920
in one sphere or another, but Vaihinger,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.800
is the first thinker I
know of who defined clearly

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.523
the issues I'd like to come to grips with.

00:09:41.254 --> 00:09:44.610
Vaihinger's notion of what
he called a real fiction

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.530
is I think in one way quite surprising.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.363
A real fiction he held,
involved a thought,

00:09:51.363 --> 00:09:56.363
that was not just false but
in some way contradictory.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.540
As he thought such useful ideas

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.018
as the square root of a negative number

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.600
or the atom were contradictory.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.750
On his view, when we understand the world

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.310
as composed of atoms,
remember we are in the physics

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.220
and chemistry of the late 19th century,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.890
we're supposing something
that we know to be impossible.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.440
Suppose quote, following
(speaks foreign language),

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.197
a quartet of distinguished 19th
century physical scientists,

00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:26.187
"Suppose we designate the atoms

00:10:26.187 --> 00:10:29.327
"as centers without extension.

00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:31.047
"The result," he said,

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.537
"turns out to be a very
strange construction indeed.

00:10:34.537 --> 00:10:38.027
"For an entity without extension
that is at the same time

00:10:38.027 --> 00:10:40.637
"a substantial bearer of forces,

00:10:40.637 --> 00:10:42.917
"that is simply a combination of words

00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:45.949
"with which no definite
meaning can be connected."

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:49.100
Defining an atom as a point mass

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.320
seems to require among
other things for example,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.270
that it should be, infinitely dense.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.720
What sense, Viahinger
makes one want to ask,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.543
can one make of that?

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.150
Similarly, like many in
his day Viahinger thought

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.686
there was something simply contradictory

00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:09.200
in the conception of the imaginary number,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.370
which Gauss had made
such successful use of

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.550
in the early 19th century.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.870
Viahinger's view is nicely articulated

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.840
in a famous conversation
in Robert Musil's novel,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.295
Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törless.

00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:24.000
There he describes a conversation

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.930
between Törless, the
protagonist and a friend

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.050
about imaginary numbers.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.130
Törless objects that quote,
this is my translation,

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.830
you wouldn't like to hear
me read it in the German.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.453
Törless objects that quote,
there is no such thing,

00:11:37.453 --> 00:11:40.490
any number, whether it's
positive or negative

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.030
yield something positive
when it's squared,

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.410
so there can't be a bonafide number.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.040
That's the square root
of something negative.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.090
But Törless insists, what's
remarkable, is precisely,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.170
one can really do calculations
with such imaginary

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.100
or otherwise impossible values

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.470
and end up with a tangible result.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.640
Or as Viahinger puts it in one of his

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.540
characteristic paradoxes,

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.683
the concept in question is
contradictory but necessary.

00:12:09.918 --> 00:12:12.708
Viahinger contrasted these real fictions

00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:16.970
with what he called semi-fictions
where the concepts quote,

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.840
Only contradict reality is
given or deviate from it

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.493
but are not in themselves contradictory.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.280
One clear example he gives would be

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.140
Adam Smith's rational egoism.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.430
Which Viahinger understands
as an assumption

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.460
that Smith knew to be false.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.570
But which nevertheless allowed
the Scottish philosopher

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.040
to construct a useful
predictive economics.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.320
Quote, the empirical
manifestations of human actions

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.840
are so excessively complicated,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.000
that they present almost
insuperable obstacles

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.940
when we try to understand
them theoretically

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.804
and reduce them to causal factors.

00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:55.855
For the construction of his
system of political economy

00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:59.150
this is still Viahinger, it
was essential for Adam Smith

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.141
to interpret human activity causally.

00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:03.182
With unerring instinct he realized,

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:05.700
that the main cause lay in egoism

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.240
and he formulated his
assumption in such a way

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.330
that all human actions, and particularly

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.540
those of a business or
political economical nature,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.660
could be looked upon as if

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.010
their driving force lay
in one factor, egoism.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.630
Thus, all subsidiary causes
and partially-conditional

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.700
factors such as goodwill,
habit and so forth,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.720
are here neglected.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.134
With the aid of this
abstract cause, Adam Smith

00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:34.462
succeeded in bringing the
whole of political economy

00:13:34.462 --> 00:13:36.323
into an ordered system.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.653
Nevertheless Viahinger
went on to argue, these,

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:43.265
quote, 'provisional assumptions'
are or at least should be,

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:45.166
accompanied by the consciousness

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:48.170
that they do not correspond to reality

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.290
and that they deliberate they substitute

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.070
a fraction of reality,
for the complete range

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.023
of causes and effects.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.170
Now the difficulty with Viahinger's idea

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.520
of the contradictory fiction,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.880
of the model that's literally
inconsistent is obvious.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.570
It makes it very hard to understand

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.690
how an idealization can be useful,

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.651
since, as we teach our
students in introductory logic

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:15.440
if a theory is inconsistent
we can deduce from it

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.210
anything at all.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.180
And the prediction that
something will happen

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.050
and that it won't happen,
can't surely be useful,

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.850
indeed it's not really a prediction.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.694
Of course, one can construct
paraconsistent logics

00:14:28.694 --> 00:14:31.500
in which the general thesis
that from a contradiction

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.880
anything follows, fails.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.720
But I suspect that the way that many

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.280
of our actual inconsistencies
are actually corralled in,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.290
is not by the implementation
of a non-standard logic,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.965
but by what you might
call functional isolation,

00:14:44.965 --> 00:14:48.830
so that in effect we have a
large set of families of beliefs

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.830
each of which we try to keep consistent

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.070
and these families aren't
usually brought together

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.870
in deliberation so the contradictions

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.170
are as it were kept apart.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.240
David Lewis the philosopher
once exemplified

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.150
this sort of thing in a nice way,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.210
in a story about how he
failed for a while to notice

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.720
that he acted as if a
certain Street in Princeton

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.668
was parallel to the railway
track for some purposes

00:15:09.668 --> 00:15:12.403
and orthogonal to it for other purposes.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.120
In Euclidean space that's not possible.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.070
Now, everybody has experiences

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.803
of the inconsistency
of such internal maps.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.300
Some of our colleagues working

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.530
in the philosophy of
science have suggested,

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.210
that scientific explanations
in contemporary physics

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.900
do involve mathematically
inconsistent theories

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.726
or to speak more carefully,

00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:37.590
involve the application at the same time

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.720
of models that are
inconsistent with each other,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.400
even of each of them is itself consistent.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.360
Actually using these theories
involves in effect then,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.600
knowing which lines of
inference one should

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.460
and which one should not follow.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.070
Nancy Cartwright for example,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.110
has criticized what she
calls the vending machine

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.790
model of theories, in which you
feed in certain I'm quoting,

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.610
certain prescribed forms
for the desire output,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.930
it gurgitates for a
while, then it drops out

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.020
the sort for representation,
plunk on the tray

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.703
fully formed as Athena
from the brain of Zeus.

00:16:14.537 --> 00:16:17.107
"I'd rather," she argues,
"the process involves

00:16:17.107 --> 00:16:18.547
"knowing how to take advantage

00:16:18.547 --> 00:16:20.637
"of the available formal resources,

00:16:20.637 --> 00:16:23.023
"to treat a specific phenomenon."

00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:25.410
If she's right, then Viahinger's idea

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.170
that idea our idealizations
are contradictory,

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.310
may turn out, in a way, to be correct.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.410
But that's because the
understanding of the world

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.370
implicit in the scientific theory,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.600
the knowledge it delivers, is held,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.460
not just in the abstract
statement of the theory

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.614
but in the skill of applying it

00:16:42.614 --> 00:16:45.664
to certain standard cases in particular,

00:16:45.664 --> 00:16:47.810
sorry in certain standard cases,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.890
in particular to what Cartwright
calls ontological machine,

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.520
not sorry, nomological machines,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.868
where a nomological
machine is as she says,

00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:59.577
"A fixed enough arrangement
of components or factors,

00:16:59.577 --> 00:17:02.147
"with stable enough
capacities that in the right

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:03.887
"sort of stable enough environment

00:17:03.887 --> 00:17:05.547
"will with repeated operation,

00:17:05.547 --> 00:17:08.207
"give rise to the kind of regular behavior

00:17:08.207 --> 00:17:10.653
"that we represent in our scientific laws.

00:17:11.587 --> 00:17:13.300
"A nomological machine,"

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.027
she gives the solar system as one example,

00:17:17.027 --> 00:17:19.847
"is screened off enough
from outside forces

00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:23.590
"that we can make roughly
reliable laws about its motions."

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.420
So the physicists knowledge is not held

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.360
in the formal theory,
which is one reason why

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.903
it's inconsistency should worry us less.

00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:33.900
I don't know enough about
the relevant physics

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.360
to evaluate many of these claims,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.390
but they surely do support the idea

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.163
that Viahinger was right
about something important.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.770
You can't refute the idea

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.910
that our best theories are inconsistent,

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.102
by arguing that the world
itself can't be inconsistent

00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:52.080
unless you presuppose
that our best theories,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.183
aim only at truth.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.690
There's a point here of some importance,

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.653
even if it may prove controversial.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.246
Once we grant that our
models assume what is not so,

00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:07.187
the fact that another
representation is inconsistent

00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:09.570
with the model we currently accept,

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.190
cannot by itself count,
against accepting it too.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.100
For we know, ex hypothesi,
that we already have a picture

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.280
that is untrue to how
things strictly speaking are

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.700
and the success of our current model

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.960
for some purpose or other,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.410
cannot count against
accepting another model

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.350
that is inconsistent with
it, for at least two reasons.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.150
One, is that just because our theory,

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.627
which is not strictly true,

00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:40.480
succeeds to some degree for some purpose.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.730
We cannot infer that another
theory inconsistent with it

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.740
could not also succeed, to
more or less the same degree

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.320
for the same purpose?

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.890
And the other is that, what is
successful for some purposes,

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.903
may not be successful for others.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.870
The result is that Viahinger
can give us an explanation

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.327
for why we might profit from
mobilizing a set of theories

00:19:01.327 --> 00:19:04.053
that are inconsistent with one another.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.807
Another of Vaihinger distinctions

00:19:07.807 --> 00:19:10.150
between what he called fictions

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.670
and what he called hypotheses is,

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.220
surely uncontroversially helpful.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.403
Viahinger's point was
at the very same claim,

00:19:18.403 --> 00:19:22.189
Adam Smith's claim say that
men are rational egoists,

00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:26.850
could be treated either as a
fiction, a fruitful untruth

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.800
or as something whose actual truth

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.579
remains an open possibility.

00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:34.320
And a good deal of Viahinger's
argument demands to saying,

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.240
that many theories that
are offered as hypotheses,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.057
need not be given up
because some of their claims

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:42.710
are known to be false, because
we can continue with them,

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.063
treating them now as fictions.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.830
But if idealization is Viahinger proposed

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.460
the question of useful untruths,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.280
there are now two questions
to ask that are familiar

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.300
from the discussions of pragmatist ideas

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.760
about what it is useful to believe.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.240
First, useful for what?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.166
And second, if a falsehood is useful,

00:20:05.166 --> 00:20:08.130
isn't there some truth in the vicinity

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.870
that would be even more useful?

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.710
Why stick with the useful and truth?

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.125
Won't the truth always be better?

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:16.420
And I'll return to that second line

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.340
of questioning in a
moment, but for the moment

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.323
let's stick with the
first, useful for what?

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:26.270
One old line of thought
here, it's a thought

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.110
almost as old as systematic
philosophy in the West,

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.490
is that utility means usefulness
in saving the phenomena.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.880
Simplifying idealization is useful,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.330
if it allows us to cover the past record

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.780
and predict the future
course of our experiences.

00:20:41.744 --> 00:20:44.460
But despite some passages
that suggest this picture,

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.600
I don't think this is Viahinger's view.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.510
What he thought, as I've
essentially already pointed out,

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.750
was that it was in controlling the world

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.900
that thought proved itself useful,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.980
our representations prove
themselves useful, and even though

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.760
sensation is our only means
of access to the world,

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.995
thoughts object is not to
manufacture or predict sensations

00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:09.070
but to control the world
that produces them.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.390
Viahinger's treatment
has the great virtue,

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.930
that it responds in
regards questions about

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.960
our everyday thinking about the world,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.297
that's continuous with
our scientific thinking.

00:21:18.297 --> 00:21:20.757
"Both aim," he says,
"at controlling reality,

00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:23.917
"both leave things out, in
order to make it practicable

00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:26.617
"to represent the world
we're trying to control."

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.640
So Viahinger believes our representations

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.630
are fundamentally tools that
allow us to control the world,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.453
but why must they be idealized?

00:21:36.537 --> 00:21:39.922
Let's begin by extamining a
passage Viahinger refers to

00:21:39.922 --> 00:21:42.880
in once more, a 19th century discussion

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.320
of Adam Smith's idealizations
which we've already

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.270
been talking about.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.330
He's quoting here Henry
Thomas Buckle's introduction

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.580
to The History of Civilization in England.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.117
"Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations,

00:21:58.117 --> 00:22:00.257
"simplified the study of human nature

00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:04.527
"by curtailing it of all its sympathy.

00:22:04.527 --> 00:22:07.207
"But," he continued, "this
most comprehensive thinker

00:22:07.207 --> 00:22:09.757
"was careful in his Theory
Of the Moral Sentiments

00:22:09.757 --> 00:22:11.767
"to restore the human nature,

00:22:11.767 --> 00:22:13.607
"the quality of which
the wealth of patience

00:22:13.607 --> 00:22:14.827
"had deprived it.

00:22:14.827 --> 00:22:17.927
"And thus by establishing two
different lines of argument,

00:22:17.927 --> 00:22:20.400
"he embraced the whole subject."

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.920
Now, Buckle is overreaching
here for the complete treatment

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.710
would presumably include
not just egoism and sympathy

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.780
but all the psychological factors relevant

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.700
for explaining human behavior.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.040
And as is clear from the
passage I cited earlier,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.653
one of Vaihinger's insights is that

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:38.236
it's precisely the difficulty
of embracing the whole subject

00:22:38.236 --> 00:22:42.870
that makes idealization
inescapable on his view.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.260
It's the fact that the phenomena

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.520
are an excessively complicated

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.770
that requires us to leave
out some of the details.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.620
But to say that the
complexity is excessive,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.000
is to make a point not
so much about the world

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.690
as about our capacity to understand it.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.030
The complexities exceed
our cognitive capacity

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.577
to encompass them and this
is a fact as much about us

00:23:05.577 --> 00:23:07.043
as about them.

00:23:07.043 --> 00:23:09.410
Suppose for example
that the quantum theory

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.683
were precisely true,

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.183
in (scoffs) sorry.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.078
That may stretch your
imaginative capacities,

00:23:20.078 --> 00:23:21.930
it certainly stretches mine.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.880
In principle, I suppose
that would allow us to write

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.543
a precise equation for each
of the atoms in a baseball.

00:23:27.543 --> 00:23:30.200
To describe the baseball we would then

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.300
have to solve a system of
the order of something like

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.680
10 to the 26 equations.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.246
No human being, I suggest,
knows how to do this,

00:23:37.246 --> 00:23:40.057
no machine exists that could do it either

00:23:40.057 --> 00:23:42.190
and even if there were such a machine,

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.743
what an earth use would it be to us?

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.940
If the utility of scientific fiction

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.930
derives from the excessive
complexity of the world

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.320
that is from the fact that
its complexity exceeds

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.923
our cognitive capacities,

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.370
the utility of religious
myth for Viahinger

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.900
seems to come from somewhere else.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.230
He pronounces himself here a
disciple of Friedrich Langer

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.324
who had articulated a
standpoint of the ideal

00:24:07.324 --> 00:24:09.850
that permits a metaphysical atheist,

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.720
nevertheless to hold
on to religion as myth

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.090
because of what he calls the

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.400
ethical efficacy of religious language.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.250
Viahanger did not think atheists
couldn't have moral ideas,

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.960
he did not think that if God was dead

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.250
everything was permitted

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.620
but he did think that we
more likely to be able

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.820
to live by our ideals, if we express them

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.620
poetically as it were,
in religious language.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.860
This is meant so far as I can see,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.790
is an empirical claim.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.580
And I'm not going to canvas the evidence

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.041
for or against it here.

00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:41.850
Richard Braithwaite, one
of my earliest teachers

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.930
in philosophy, argued later,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.380
that one could understand
and adopt religious belief

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.210
without an appeal to theology,

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.830
in effect, he thought, one could treat

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.665
the Creed he recited on Sundays,

00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:55.060
explicitly as fiction.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.390
And Viahinger's treatment,
certainty of argument

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.170
shows that the utility of
fictions can be conceived

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.910
not only in their power to aid us

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.571
in manipulating the world outside us,

00:25:04.571 --> 00:25:09.571
but also in their capacity
to help us manage ourselves.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.580
His thought like Kant's thought about

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.510
the inevitability of the idea of freedom

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.120
in the world of the understanding,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.045
is that we can grasp theoretically,

00:25:17.045 --> 00:25:19.330
that the ideas we're using a false,

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.490
while still finding
them practically useful

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.997
indeed, inescapable.

00:25:24.997 --> 00:25:28.245
So I suppose with Viahinger
that useful means,

00:25:28.245 --> 00:25:33.245
useful for managing the world
including sometimes ourselves.

00:25:33.374 --> 00:25:37.246
Then there's a puzzle about how
we can make good predictions

00:25:37.246 --> 00:25:39.736
by leaving stuff out.

00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:42.790
Vaihinger's answer I think,
first answer I think,

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.860
can be twofold; first,
sometimes leaving stuff out

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.620
makes too little difference to matter

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.060
for the purpose at hand,

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.930
as when we use the Newtonian
rather than Einstein

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.630
in mechanics in building a bridge.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.103
This is a very familiar thought

00:25:57.103 --> 00:26:00.180
and the example is a familiar example.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.889
But Vaihinger also thought,

00:26:01.889 --> 00:26:04.919
the question had a second
more interesting answer,

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:09.160
sometimes our idealizations
allow us to get things right

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.324
because we proceed as
it were in two steps.

00:26:12.324 --> 00:26:15.120
First, ignoring a range of phenomena

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.530
in order to build a model
of a world without them

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.500
and then once we've grasped
how that model works,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.760
adding more and more of
the world gradually back in

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.126
as he puts it, "If in fictions
thought contradicts reality,

00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:30.006
"or if it even contradicts itself

00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:32.947
"and in spite of this
questionable procedure,

00:26:32.947 --> 00:26:36.640
"it nevertheless succeeds in
corresponding to reality then,"

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.407
and this is a necessary inference,

00:26:38.407 --> 00:26:41.177
"this deviation must have been corrected

00:26:41.177 --> 00:26:44.447
"and the contradiction
must have been made good."

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.710
Viahinger was in the end,
something of an instrumentalist

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.680
about theory.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.180
He focused as we've seen
on the role of our theories

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.910
in controlling the world.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.180
But this line of thinking adamanted here,

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.770
might suggest another view,

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.440
in which we take the role
of the idealized model

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.220
as helping us not just
or not even to predict

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.160
or control the world,
but to understand it.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.408
That is a really important idea I think,

00:27:09.408 --> 00:27:13.790
I have only time here however
to note it and march on.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.750
And you know, when I finish
the book on this topic

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.913
I will say more about that question

00:27:17.913 --> 00:27:21.043
but I'm going to mark it here
is an important possibility.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.750
'Cause I wanted now to discuss a second,

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.340
more recent philosopher,

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.040
first because his work can
be taken as a case study

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.380
of Viahinger's philosophy of the 'as if',

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.540
and second because in the course

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.130
of thinking about his proposals,

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.900
we can come to see the
power of Viahinger's picture

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.376
in framing our understanding
of idealization.

00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:43.710
The philosopher I have in
mind is Daniel Dennett,

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.157
who has urged us to adopt what he calls,

00:27:46.157 --> 00:27:48.870
"the intentional stance" to many things,

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.260
ourselves among them and to
adopt "the design stance"

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.993
to many things too,
ourselves included as well.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.010
To adopt the intentional
stance towards something,

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:04.350
is to treat it or her as if
she were a rational agent

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.120
with beliefs and desires,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.070
the beliefs and desires it ought to have

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.650
given its place in the
world and its purpose,

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.530
and then to predict what
this rational agent will do

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.190
in order to further its goals.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.790
Similarly, to adopt the design
stance towards organisms

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.370
and the things they produce,

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.130
is to treat them as if they were designed

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.130
to perform certain functions

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.813
and this can allow us to
predict what they will do,

00:28:27.813 --> 00:28:31.475
just as we explain what it is
to be an intentional system

00:28:31.475 --> 00:28:34.410
by specifying the intentional stance,

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.961
so we can say what it is
to have a certain function

00:28:36.961 --> 00:28:39.070
by adopting the design stance,

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.350
by treating something
as if it had been made

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.693
by a designer with certain aims.

00:28:44.647 --> 00:28:47.890
In each case, adopting
a stance of this sort

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.445
involves treating something
as if something were so,

00:28:51.445 --> 00:28:54.540
as if it had internal
states of belief and desire,

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.380
as if it were the product
of intentional design.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.130
So Dennett too as I say, is
a philosopher of the 'as if'.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.166
I've been arguing with Viahinger,

00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:07.920
that we do this a whole
lot in many domains,

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.273
Dennett agrees.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.540
But that this is what we
are doing leads laterally

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.299
back to the question why it works.

00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:18.860
If it works, I've suggested we have reason

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.770
to go along with it, even perhaps

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.370
at the price of inconsistency.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.040
That is what Nancy Cartwright taught me

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.390
about much physics.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.150
It's what Viahinger
thought about theology,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.460
number theory, physics and economics,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.400
it's what Braithwaite thought
about religious language.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.240
But showing that it does
work, doesn't explain why.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.487
Cartwright believes, that it works

00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:43.300
because our theories latch
on to what she calls,

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.972
the real capacities of much of the world.

00:29:45.972 --> 00:29:47.856
As far as I know she's right.

00:29:47.856 --> 00:29:50.369
But I want now to explore the question,

00:29:50.369 --> 00:29:53.210
why idealization works,
by thinking through

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.920
some of Daniel Dennett's
insistence on the importance

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.753
of the as if in the case of the mind.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.410
Dennett claims at least sometimes,

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.640
that beliefs, but I've
already given you reason

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.670
for not worrying too
much about inconsistency,

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.370
so I won't point out
that another occasions

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.800
he says the opposite.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.900
Dennett claims, that beliefs and desires

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.040
are real states of
people, the states in fact

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.670
which make it possible for us
to predict what they will do

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.210
by adopting the intentional strategy.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.910
Quote, to a first approximation
the intentional strategy

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:27.240
consists of treating the object

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.740
whose behavior you want to predict,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.150
as a rational agent
with beliefs and desires

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.030
and other mental states exhibiting what

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.020
Brentano and others call intentionality.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.660
To do this you must figure
out what beliefs and desires

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.860
the agent ought to have

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.170
given its place in the
world and its purposes.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.610
Then you figure out what
desires it ought to have

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.000
on the same considerations,
and finally you predict

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.770
what that rational agent
will act to further

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.100
its goals in the light of
its beliefs and desires.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.470
The agent therefore must
be reasonable in two ways,

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.050
it must first form its beliefs and desires

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.310
in ways that are reasonable

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.810
and second it must perform
the acts that are reasonable

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.030
given those beliefs and desires.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.190
This is what it is to adopt
the intentional stance

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.130
towards it.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.960
What it is finally to
have beliefs and desires,

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.990
is to be and I quote,
an intentional system,

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.140
a system whose behavior is reliably

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.370
and voluminously predictable
via the intentional strategy.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:21.523
Now here's a question,

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.750
does it matter why the agent's behavior

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.100
is predictable in this way?

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.360
If I have beliefs and
desires and I'm rational,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.120
the reason the intentional strategy

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.510
of treating me as a
rational agent works is,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.870
well, that I am a rational
agent with beliefs and desires.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.883
It works because it
treats me as what I am.

00:31:40.883 --> 00:31:43.510
If the intentional strategy
works with something

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.840
that doesn't have both beliefs and desires

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.480
and behave rationally on the one hand,

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.754
the success of those reliable
and voluminous predictions

00:31:52.754 --> 00:31:55.483
might seem to be just a mystery.

00:31:56.359 --> 00:32:00.080
But then it serves up an
example that's supposed to show

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.370
why the success of the intentional stance

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:06.160
can in fact, be quite unmysterious.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.681
Consider, he suggests,
a computer chess program

00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:11.830
and ask yourself how to
predict what it will do.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.090
Reading the program or worse,

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.000
looking at the transistors of the computer

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.460
that is implementing, it
isn't going to be much help.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.030
It would take you too long

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.450
to read and understand the program,

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.730
at least if it's any good.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.200
A much better way to predict
what moves it will make,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.430
is to ask yourself this question,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.850
what would a reasonable person

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.210
who knows the rules and
the aim of chess do,

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.280
faced with this board?

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.600
You'd figure the computer
knows how to play chess,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.670
wants to win and will act accordingly.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.940
You would in short, adopt
the intentional stance.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.380
You would do pretty much
exactly what you would do

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.080
if you were trying to predict the moves

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.892
that a person would make.

00:32:52.892 --> 00:32:55.490
The reason this will
usually work of course,

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.480
is that this is what the
computer was designed to do.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.226
It is meant to make the
best move that it can.

00:33:01.226 --> 00:33:04.163
The better the design,
the more likely it is

00:33:04.163 --> 00:33:06.570
that the intentional strategy will work

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.540
though and again of course,
if it's really well designed,

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.390
it will see more possibilities
and opportunities

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.710
than most of us mortals and so we will get

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.700
our predictions wrong.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.010
We may understand looking
backwards why it did what it did

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:19.987
but we won't be able to predict it,

00:33:19.987 --> 00:33:22.133
'cause it's better at chess than we are.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.070
Predicting the moves of deep-blue,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:29.320
the program that beat Garry
Kasparov in 1997, is something

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.183
only possible for the
grandest of grand masters.

00:33:33.131 --> 00:33:36.150
The Scarecrow it's
around knows, knows how,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.590
wants and sees in some
of Dennett's writings

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.010
about this topic draw,
attention to the fact,

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.550
that most of us, in adopting
the intentional stance

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.800
towards a computer, and let's admit it,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.533
we all do that often,

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.930
we nevertheless take talks
of beliefs and desires

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.400
to be figurative, not literal.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.700
A facon de parler where we are clear

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.460
that our mode is a kind of fiction.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.960
With humans on the other
hand, we take it literally

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.050
and also with many other animals.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.880
I think the sheep on our farm

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.910
know that we'll feed them.

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:10.929
They don't just know it

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:14.283
and you probably have analogous
thoughts about your dog.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.490
Dennett tells us that we
should simply postpone

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:21.810
the question of whether
it really has a mind.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.840
Unfortunately, there are reasons to worry

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.680
about whether any actual thing

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.590
really has a mind on
Dennett's view, here's why.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.700
You and I are supposed to
be intentional systems.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.320
We can be reliably
predicted by approaching us

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.900
with the intentional stance.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.421
So we meet one of Dennett's criteria.

00:34:39.421 --> 00:34:42.890
But neither you nor I is fully rational.

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:45.960
Indeed, that we are going
to do irrational things

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.040
is equally voluminously predictable.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.700
So it remains a bit of a mystery

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.410
why the intentional
strategy succeeds with us

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:55.223
on the occasions where it does.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.185
Dennett does not I think,
stress sufficiently the fact,

00:34:59.185 --> 00:35:03.680
that the strategy also fails a great deal.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.810
This is in part because the
sort of rationality in question

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.530
is extremely demanding.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.010
It involves having all the
beliefs and desires we ought

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.960
to have and acting only as
we ought to act given them.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.340
And the evident fact that
many people don't believe

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.800
what they ought to, that the
president was born in Hawaii,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.290
for example or desire what they should,

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.620
to abstain from smoking for example,

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.580
is one reason why the strategy
is not guaranteed to succeed.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.200
So, if you have to be fully rational

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.680
to have beliefs and desires,

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.101
then so it seems to me I
don't have beliefs and desires

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:41.363
and not to put too fine a
point upon it, nor do you.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.630
Dennett has an answer to the question

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:49.270
why the intentional strategy
works as often as it does.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.840
He thinks we were designed
by evolution to work this way

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.830
and so as you see, unlike
many realist philosophers,

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:59.086
he thinks there is nothing
wrong in speaking of organisms

00:35:59.086 --> 00:36:03.170
or their parts as designed
by evolution to do things.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.710
This makes sense to him
because as I said he thinks

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.050
that just as we can adopt
the intentional strategy

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.470
towards people and animals and computers,

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.803
we can adopt the design stance

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:14.730
towards organisms and
the things they produce.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.660
We can treat them as if they were designed

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.050
to perform certain functions

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.041
and this can allow us to predict again,

00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:23.850
reliably and voluminously,
what they will do.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.703
Once you know what an alarm
clock or a chainsaw is for,

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.683
you know what it can do.

00:36:30.683 --> 00:36:33.730
So too, for a kidney or a heart.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.760
Here again, Dennett doesn't
think it helpful to distinguish

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.600
between what was really designed

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.570
by a capital D designer as it were

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.520
and what is merely predictable,

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.653
once we adopt the design stance.

00:36:47.096 --> 00:36:48.920
In the history philosophy many things

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.590
have been called pragmatism,

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.370
but one central candidate
for the name is the thought

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.050
that our theories are to be evaluated

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.240
by what they enable us to do.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.500
So you might think that
Dennett is here operating

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.690
in this good American
philosophical tradition.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.510
If the intentional stance enables us

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.410
to predict the behavior of a computer,

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.600
why not just accept that it has beliefs

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.207
and desires and reasons?

00:37:10.207 --> 00:37:12.393
But that is not what he actually says.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.340
What he proposes instead
is that in the cases

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.223
where the intentional stance
is a rewarding strategy,

00:37:19.223 --> 00:37:21.880
yielding a budget of useful predictions,

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.847
allowing us to manipulate
the world to our advantage,

00:37:24.847 --> 00:37:27.000
shades there of Viahinger,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.858
we should say, not that
the thing has beliefs,

00:37:29.858 --> 00:37:33.253
but that it sorta has beliefs.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.960
Dennett's use of the cosy word sorta,

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.940
he pokes fun at the style
of analytic philosophy

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.933
by insisting on calling
it the sorta operator,

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.680
is one of the more interesting things

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.400
in his recent philosophical writings.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.610
Dennett uses this operator
in two crucial ways;

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.616
first, to talk about anything
to which we can productively

00:37:56.616 --> 00:37:59.100
apply the intentional stance.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.470
If the strategy works,
then the thing sorta

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.300
believes or desires.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.780
Second, in the context of evolution

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.290
to talk about the relationship,

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.950
between species and their ancestors.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.970
Before there were bacteria, he writes,

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.570
there were sorta bacteria,

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.860
and before there were mammals
there were sorta mammals,

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.713
and before there were dogs,
there were sorta dogs and so on.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.230
It is easy to see one way in which

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.460
these two uses are connected.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.432
For among the things that sorta believed,

00:38:27.432 --> 00:38:31.486
were some of our sorta ancestors.

00:38:31.486 --> 00:38:33.580
(scoffs) Beliefs came into being gradually

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.360
through an evolutionary process

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.540
and there's no exact moment when suddenly,

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.380
hey presto, full-fledged belief appeared,

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.190
just as there's no exact moment

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.170
when the first mammal was born.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.560
There is no principle line Dennett writes,

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.640
above which true
comprehension is to be found.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.160
Now as I say, like many of his ideas

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.300
I think this one is extremely interesting.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.000
But is also I think, and also typically,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.500
a little mysterious.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.240
And the mystery just is the mystery

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.870
of why idealization is
a good strategy here,

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.130
why it so often works.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:07.066
So I want to try and unpack
this mystery a little further.

00:39:07.066 --> 00:39:11.020
In particular, let's no
longer postpone the question

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.003
whether anything has any actual beliefs.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.590
Adopting the intentional stance

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.810
involves applying a
rather elaborate theory

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.030
to predict something's behavior.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.070
You treat the putative agent
as having beliefs and desires

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.430
ascribed to it by supposing
it believes and desires

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.820
what is reasonable for it
to believe and to desire.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.390
And then you predict that it will do

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.590
what it would be reasonable to do

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.450
granted that it has those internal states.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.600
A creature that always had
the rationally required states

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.110
and did the rationally required thing,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.840
let's call it a cognitive angel,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.013
would always respond as the
intentional stance requires.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.450
Its states would be full
fledged beliefs and desires,

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.068
no sorta about it.

00:39:54.068 --> 00:39:56.745
But there are no cognitive angels.

00:39:56.745 --> 00:40:00.030
So in the actual world,
every belief is a belief,

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.690
a sorta belief, and every
desire is a sorta desire.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.060
No doubt some creatures
in our actual world

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.380
are closer to cognitive angels than others

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.280
in the sense that they will more often do,

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.344
in the circumstances of the actual world,

00:40:12.344 --> 00:40:15.340
what a cognitive angel would have done.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.980
You and I are no doubt
closer to a cognitive angel

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.803
than your dog, well at least you are.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.470
Your dog is presumably closer than an ant.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:31.030
An ant does a better
cognitive job than an amoeba,

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.240
maybe an amoeba does such a terrible job

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.310
that the intentional strategy with it

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.793
is a complete waste of time.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.210
In some, the strategy of prediction,

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.780
the strategy we use to make sense

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.990
of the behavior of all the things

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.230
we can usefully treat
as intentional systems,

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.910
is to apply an idealized model,

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.840
knowing that just because it is idealized

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.040
it won't always get things right.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.803
To say that something
sort of believes is to say

00:40:52.803 --> 00:40:54.960
that the idealized model works for it

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.585
well enough to be getting along with.

00:40:56.585 --> 00:41:00.230
If it worked perfectly, it
would be just plain true

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:03.767
that we believe, if it works
badly enough it's plain false,

00:41:03.767 --> 00:41:07.120
in between is the vaguely delineated world

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.343
of the sorta true.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.050
I doubt that Dennett
would accept this picture

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:16.210
of his proposal, as Robert's
Rules of Order rightly insist,

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.560
there is no such thing
as a friendly amendment.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.723
Still, looking it this
way, helps us to see,

00:41:21.723 --> 00:41:23.680
that the right answer to the question

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.773
whether anything at all
has a mind might be, sorta.

00:41:28.908 --> 00:41:32.960
But being sorta true is not
a lesser way of being true,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.683
it is a special way of being false.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.280
And though it's easy
to see why a true story

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.530
might make the right predictions,

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.250
again, why should a false one?

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.950
And so we're brought back to the question

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.780
whether the fact that we
approximate a rational creature

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.313
isn't something of a mystery.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.840
Dennett thinks it isn't because
he thinks we can understand

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.964
through evolutionary theory,

00:41:54.964 --> 00:41:57.810
how they came to be creatures like us.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.150
And at the heart of this understanding

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.180
is a claim he first made a long time ago,

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.410
at least as far back as Elbow Room,

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.470
his book on freedom of the will.

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.040
The world he thinks, is full of quote,

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.880
free-floating rationales,

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.830
reasons why creatures do what they do,

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.820
even though they don't know
that that is why they do them.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.240
Squirrels burry nuts,

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.491
which they will be able
to eat in the winter.

00:42:18.491 --> 00:42:20.997
They don't know this when they bury them

00:42:20.997 --> 00:42:24.260
but still, that's the
reason why they do it.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.350
They have purposes as he says,

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.170
but they don't need to know them,

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.440
the need to know principal
rains in the biosphere

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.880
and naturally sexual action itself,

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.517
doesn't need to know what it's doing.

00:42:36.517 --> 00:42:39.820
Dennett thinks that the
evolution has endowed us

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.300
on the other hand, with the
capacity not just to have

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.980
but also to know our purposes.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.830
And a proper evolutionary account

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.430
of how we came to be sorta agents,

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.910
with sorta beliefs and sort of
desires and sorta intentions

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:55.700
will make it less mysterious he thinks,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.900
that we respond to reasons demands.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.360
But notice that the explanation here

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.830
of why the intentional strategy
works for us in essence is,

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.970
that the design stance shows us

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:09.741
why we have come to be
intentional systems.

00:43:09.741 --> 00:43:11.618
And what does that mean?

00:43:11.618 --> 00:43:14.480
Well, that it is as if we were designed

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.740
to have intentional states.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.170
But the mystery of why we can be managed

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:21.210
by an intentional systems approach,

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.130
is not explained by
saying that it is as if

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.340
we were designed to work intentionally,

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.170
it would only be explained if we were

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.290
designed to work intentionally.

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:33.403
We have just replaced
one mystery with another.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.560
It is impasses such as
these that lead people

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.140
to want to say that
the fact that we can be

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.860
predicted and controlled in these ways,

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.770
shows that there is an underlying truth

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:42.640
that the theory captures.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.740
That's why Dennett in some mood says

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.780
we do have beliefs and desires.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.140
Ian Hacking has suggested
that what gives us reason

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.231
to be a realist about
things like positrons

00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:53.900
is that we can manipulate
them, intervening in the world

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.802
on the basis of our beliefs about them.

00:43:55.802 --> 00:43:58.040
Once he tells us when he was discussing

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.700
a physics experiment with a friend,

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.111
he asked how you altered the
charge on a niobium ball.

00:44:03.111 --> 00:44:05.397
"Well, at that stage," said my friend,

00:44:05.397 --> 00:44:08.107
"we spray it with positrons
to increase the charge

00:44:08.107 --> 00:44:10.820
"or with electrons to
decrease the charge."

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.007
Hacking's response, "From that day forth

00:44:13.007 --> 00:44:14.701
"I've been a scientific realist,

00:44:14.701 --> 00:44:17.197
"so far as I'm concerned
if you can spray them,

00:44:17.197 --> 00:44:19.550
"they're real." (audience laughs lightly)

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.410
And notice that like Viahinger,

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.700
his thought is not about
saving the phenomena

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.130
but about managing the world,
he's on Viahinger's side here.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.558
Nancy Cartwright, it seems
odd to mention them both

00:44:30.558 --> 00:44:33.330
regularly without mentioning
that they were once married

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.453
to one another but I won't.

00:44:34.453 --> 00:44:37.373
Nancy Cartwright as I just pointed out,

00:44:37.373 --> 00:44:40.780
thinks that the success of
the strategies of physics

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.360
gives us reason to
believe in the capacities

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.858
our physical laws, atom
break in precisely.

00:44:46.858 --> 00:44:49.629
She has a book called how
the laws of physics lie.

00:44:49.629 --> 00:44:53.820
What better reason we might
ask by parity of reasoning,

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.320
could there be than the successes

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.830
of the intentional strategy,

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.280
for believing in the intentional states?

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.533
Well, here's a better reason,

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.920
we'd have a better reason if the theory

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.900
didn't get so much wrong.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.730
In particular, if it
didn't treat us as rational

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.150
in ways we already know we're not

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.763
and predict that we will
do things that we don't do.

00:45:17.152 --> 00:45:20.140
On each trip of explanation every,

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.330
I'm sorry on each trip,
every train of explanation

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.320
comes to its last stop.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.610
Unless you think the whole world

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.180
is the working out of
conceptual necessities,

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.960
you will have to accept that there are

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.440
some brute empirical truths.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.763
And for the moment I am inclined to think

00:45:35.763 --> 00:45:38.410
that the fact that the
intentional strategy works

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:43.080
to the extent that it does,
is in that way, brute.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.510
Evolution apparently equipped us

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.330
with the intentional strategy,

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:52.210
and it was built-in but,

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.790
it was sorry, it was built into us,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.390
I seem to have lost a page here,

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.730
presumably because it was adaptive.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.240
But it seems to me that
it's not at all clear yet

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.600
why it is adaptive.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.970
What features of it led to its selection.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.650
And the hypothesis that
we really have states

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.490
that are like beliefs and desires,

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.850
is only one candid explanation.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:13.870
Now a par with the churchlands,

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.340
you can't really doubt that you yourself

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.340
have beliefs and desires.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.110
It's hard realistically to doubt

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.500
that other people have them,

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:24.530
except in the skeptical
or paranoid frame of mind

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.750
that can have you doubting
that anything at all

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.954
is really as it seems.

00:46:28.954 --> 00:46:33.629
But it could be true,
even if you were wrong,

00:46:33.629 --> 00:46:36.170
(speaks foreign language),
what cannot be doubted,

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.243
need not be true.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.630
That idealization sorta works then,

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.220
is in many cases just
something that turns out

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.883
to be simply true.

00:46:47.057 --> 00:46:49.530
There is in any case a reason to doubt

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.630
whether the question I
am asking is a fair one.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.930
You cannot ask seriously why
our idealizations work for us

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.620
except from the point of view
of a picture of the world

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.340
that includes both us
and our idealizations.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.850
A picture that is in that sense...

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.940
sorry, better than the one that
we actually currently have.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.670
So that it seems to me that there's just

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.730
a reasonable thing we can say,

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.720
which is that we cannot do anything

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.170
from the point of view of
a theory we don't have.

00:47:29.052 --> 00:47:32.510
If the question is how
to understand the fact

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.020
that our idealizations work,

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:35.510
we have to understand that question

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.450
against the background of a picture.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.530
And the picture has to be one

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.267
which includes both us
in our idealizations

00:47:40.267 --> 00:47:41.770
and if it's going to be very interesting

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.330
it had better be a better theory

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.790
than the one we've currently got.

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.680
But we can't do anything
from the point of a theory

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.680
that we haven't got.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.090
And if that's right,
this sort of idealization

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:54.113
will only be possible as it
were in the rear view mirror.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.260
And that should lead us to
revisit Viahinger's explanation

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.650
as to why idealization is necessary.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.310
The question whether the
complexity for us of the world

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.030
explains our need for idealization,

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.820
requires us to have a picture,

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.880
of our own relation to the world.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.290
If the only picture we have of the world

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:18.400
and of ourselves is an idealized one,

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.110
we have no strictly
and totally true theory

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:23.280
with which to approach this question.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.950
We can try to answer it with
these useful false theories

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.950
but they will ex hypothesi,
represent the world

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.700
as simpler than it is.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.510
So once more, it will only
be from the point of view

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.600
of theories that are better than ours,

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.190
that our question can be asked.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.003
So we can look back to Newtonian physics

00:48:42.003 --> 00:48:44.230
and ask why it worked well enough

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.930
in the circumstances of our world,

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:49.690
even though it ignored complexities
of which it was unaware.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:51.831
And we can see from where we stand now,

00:48:51.831 --> 00:48:53.730
that it would have been very difficult

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.940
with the tools both
experimental and theoretical

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.357
that the Newtonians mobilized,

00:48:58.357 --> 00:49:01.731
to represent these
post-newtonian complexities.

00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:04.190
I'm inclined to think that the question

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.730
I have been trying to
get Dennett to answer,

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:10.430
only makes sense as a
question we will ask later,

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.910
looking backwards at our present selves.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:15.120
And only then, because we will suprose

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.550
that our later theories are better.

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.470
If that is right, then here as elsewhere

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.658
in Hegel's justly famous phrase,

00:49:22.658 --> 00:49:27.420
the owl of Minerva flies at dusk.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.253
Thank you.

00:49:29.235 --> 00:49:31.485
(applause)

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.590
- [Man] I guess I'd like to ask about

00:49:41.295 --> 00:49:44.150
the idea that common
sense psychology involves

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.370
this idealization of rationality.

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:49.180
I guess what I wonder is,
isn't it just a mistake

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.596
Dennett makes to say that we actually use

00:49:51.596 --> 00:49:54.430
an idealization of rationality?

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:58.430
Suppose I own a casino and
I'm tryna set up the casino,

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:00.170
I wanna make a lot of money from this,

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:05.170
then idealizing that my patrons
have complete rationality

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.650
is (chuckles) going to make
life very difficult for me.

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:13.140
What I need, actually is
a very good understanding

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.690
of all the ways in which
they're irrational.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:19.640
I mean I could be exhibiting
my grasp of folk psychology,

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.968
I could be the apotheosis of
a skilled folks psychologist

00:50:23.968 --> 00:50:26.569
working with my clients irrationalities,

00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:29.890
I don't need an idealization
of rationality here.

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.670
So it may be true that sometimes we assume

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.990
that people will get
the easy things right,

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.720
but if you're good at
interpersonal relations,

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.510
that may involve you often assuming

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:42.880
that they're gonna get stuff wrong.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.713
- Good.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.472
I mean I agree with what you just said.

00:50:49.472 --> 00:50:53.300
I think that our capacity
to understand other people,

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.783
to predict them, to respond to them,

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.820
depends upon our knowing some truths

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.500
about the ways in which
we characteristically

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.579
deviate from all sorts
of forms of rationality.

00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:09.620
This is a truth that even economists

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.177
have finally discovered (man chuckles).

00:51:18.268 --> 00:51:19.430
I think that that shows that Dennett

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.080
sort of put it in the wrong way,

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.702
I don't think it shows
that he's clearly wrong.

00:51:23.702 --> 00:51:25.880
And this relates to the question

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.540
that I put aside for the book

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.750
about the role of these idealized models

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.003
in understanding things as
opposed to in prediction.

00:51:35.299 --> 00:51:38.830
We would like an account,
well philosophers anyway,

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.303
would like an account of what beliefs are.

00:51:42.282 --> 00:51:46.110
And it seems to me very
hard to give an account

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:47.960
of what beliefs are in a way that ignores

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.783
certain norms about how beliefs
are supposed to operate.

00:51:53.903 --> 00:51:58.740
So we do have, in our conception
of what the states are

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.100
that we're ascribing to people,

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:05.120
we have in not just in
philosophy but in ordinary life,

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.940
notions about what as you
said in the obvious case,

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:13.380
it would be reasonable
for a person to believe,

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.900
what it would be
reasonable for them to do,

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.690
given what we think they
believe in desire and so on.

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.980
Now, we also have again in common sense,

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.460
a bunch of ideas about
things that are obstacles

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.203
to carrying out the required thing.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.090
We know that there are systemic ways

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.780
in which people make
failures of reasoning,

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.750
we know that for example,
forming beliefs about yourself

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:40.300
is especially difficult because

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:43.040
we're designed to have an interest

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.159
in representing ourselves
as better than we are.

00:52:45.159 --> 00:52:48.560
There are lots of things we
know informally about that.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.110
But it's still the case
that those are explanations

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.750
that attend to beliefs as things which

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.788
in the absence of those things,

00:52:56.788 --> 00:53:00.373
would behave in the way
that reason requires.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.984
When you're building your casino,

00:53:04.984 --> 00:53:07.783
when you're managing your casino,

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:13.570
you have to treat people
both as for many purposes,

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:16.100
as doing what their beliefs
and desires require them to do.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.070
They want to play the game,

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.290
they'll be willing to give you money,

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:23.003
in exchange for chips and so on.

00:53:23.986 --> 00:53:26.790
All these things involve
treating them as having

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:29.500
desires and beliefs that are
working in the correct way

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.300
but then as you say, you will require,

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:36.640
if your casino is going to make any money,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.510
you will require them to make bets

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.727
that they ought not to make.

00:53:40.727 --> 00:53:43.450
And you know some things
as a casino operator

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.870
about what will make them do that.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.840
For example, we know
that however irrational,

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.980
however clearly and false it is,

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:54.540
people think that they can
be on a winning streak.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.100
So we should be attentive to
people who've won a few things

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.915
and encourage them to bet more,

00:53:58.915 --> 00:53:59.830
that's one of the things we know.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:04.330
Even though a properly scientifically

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:06.340
and rationally-trained
person will know that

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.720
that's the very moment
which you should realize

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.793
that you're subject to a very
characteristic human delusion.

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:16.430
But in that case, again,
we're understanding the state

00:54:18.294 --> 00:54:21.300
that the thing they're
doing that's a deviation

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.215
from what's reasonable, in
terms of what it would be like

00:54:24.215 --> 00:54:26.247
for them to do the reasonable thing

00:54:26.247 --> 00:54:28.940
and we have an explanation
for the deviation.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.160
So I think it's actually not in...

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.740
I really think that it's not
actually in predicting people,

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.210
which is anyway something
we don't do a lot of that

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.540
if you think about it,
I mean not individuals.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:45.690
We do, but in general we rely on people,

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:47.607
well that's different
from predicting them.

00:54:47.607 --> 00:54:50.330
But one reason why I knew that

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.610
you would come and
fetch me from the hotel,

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:54.880
wasn't a prediction,
it wasn't any elaborate

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.220
theoretical prediction,
you'd said you would

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.110
and I trusted you, right?

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:00.130
And you did.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.069
And that's a normal
thing in human affairs.

00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:04.450
I didn't need to know anything very much

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.400
about the rest of your internal states,

00:55:08.912 --> 00:55:10.330
to rely on you in that way,

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.204
no, nothing elaborate.

00:55:12.204 --> 00:55:15.600
If you hadn't come, I would
have entertained hypotheses

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.680
and they would have been hypotheses

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.880
that assumed you had some of
the normal desires and beliefs.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.710
I would assume that you might
had a problem in your family,

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:25.114
I mean there are lots of things

00:55:25.114 --> 00:55:26.916
that I would have guessed
might have happened.

00:55:26.916 --> 00:55:29.320
And all of those again, those guesses

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.570
would be guided by the thought,

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.650
well, what should a person,

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:35.030
with these beliefs and desires do?

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:38.593
So we'd be back with the
sort of rational thing.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.100
This is to do with how we
understand one another,

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.080
not how we predict one
another and I don't,

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.510
in general, here's something I know

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.004
because the general theory as

00:55:51.004 --> 00:55:53.393
Dennett rightly insists is holistic,

00:55:55.127 --> 00:55:57.540
I couldn't possibly know all the things

00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.041
that could be relevant to
what you're going to do.

00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:03.292
'cause anything, any proposition at all,

00:56:03.292 --> 00:56:07.286
could come to be relevant
to what you're going to do.

00:56:07.286 --> 00:56:10.800
If you came to believe
about that proposition,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.930
that if it were true
you would gain something

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:16.010
by doing certain action.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:19.070
And given the ways in which
people can come to have beliefs,

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:20.217
which include not just looking at things

00:56:20.217 --> 00:56:21.648
but being told things,

00:56:21.648 --> 00:56:26.480
pretty much anything can
come to occupy that position.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.670
I can end up caring about
where the nearest star is

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:32.393
because there's a bet available, right?

00:56:32.393 --> 00:56:34.530
If I get the right answer, I get $100.

00:56:40.081 --> 00:56:42.430
So because of the elaborate holism,

00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:46.423
the elaborate and rational holism, right?

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:53.350
If this bet is available,
it's reasonable for you

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.140
to take it if you think
you know the answer, right?

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.900
But I don't know which
of these things you know,

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.720
I don't know actually in very great detail

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.120
a lot about my own beliefs and desires.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.947
And I have some access to them,

00:57:05.947 --> 00:57:08.560
certainly don't know about
even the people I love

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.410
and know most dearly.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:13.310
So I think focusing on the
sort of prediction side

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:17.875
I think focusing on
understanding and the way...

00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:20.980
Again, this is a bit
of a different kind of,

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.050
owl of Minerva point,

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:25.110
that it's sort of looking
backwards at action very often

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:28.680
that rationality and
irrationality come into play.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:32.667
But as I say, I think
in order to understand

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:35.760
the cases which are not rational,

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.230
we start by thinking of the states

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.110
that we're invoking as
if we understand them

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.000
through what it would
be for them to operate

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.095
rationally correctly,
I think that's right.

00:57:47.095 --> 00:57:49.713
But it's different from what Dennett says.

00:57:54.008 --> 00:57:55.280
- [Man In Stripped Shirt]
Thanks for the talk.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.530
I wanted to ask you about

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:59.740
the thing you didn't wanna talk
about yet, so understanding.

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.573
- Yes.

00:58:00.573 --> 00:58:01.470
- [Man In Stripped
Shirt] That seemed to me

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:06.970
to like be in between the
two things you discussed

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:11.870
that were seeking in
trying to explain things,

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:14.412
on the one end you're
trying to discover truths

00:58:14.412 --> 00:58:18.533
and so this case where we have

00:58:18.533 --> 00:58:21.460
an idealization where we
only act as if it's true,

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.880
really fails in that regard.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.120
And then we might have this other thing

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.390
which is like pragmatic or useful,

00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:29.980
we can use it to manipulate
the world or something

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.080
but it seemed to me that
understanding was a kind of

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.895
like epistemic middle ground
between those two things.

00:58:36.895 --> 00:58:40.650
It's not just a brute fact
that acting in this way

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.754
allows us to like get something
in a kind of vulgar way

00:58:43.754 --> 00:58:47.088
and it's not that it's true necessarily,

00:58:47.088 --> 00:58:51.310
but we gain some other important
epistemic good namely like

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:54.330
coming to understand the world
we live in in a better way

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.100
and that's a really important part

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.960
of the scientific enterprise.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.840
And so, yeah, that would seem
like the natural way to go

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.390
in trying to understand
why we do this thing

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.070
where we pretend as if something's true

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.640
when we really know that it's not.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.953
And so I just want to hear what
you have to say about that.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:14.720
- I agree with what you said.

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.500
I think to make sense of it
one has to tell a big story

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.330
about something, about
understanding something

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.717
and I don't have the memory (giggles).

00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:32.143
I've got it written down
somewhere for one case.

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.790
But basically I think there is thiS,

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:38.470
so let me just say something about it

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:41.243
but won't probably seem very satisfactory.

00:59:48.722 --> 00:59:51.970
I think at the heart of
this is something that,

00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:54.270
we were saying this to
each other at lunch,

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:56.840
it's something that's
a very important part

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.832
of our natural history.

00:59:59.832 --> 01:00:03.273
Which is our capacity for make-believe.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.900
You do not have to teach
children make-believe.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.200
This is the point that Kendall Walton

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.200
has made very eloquently.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.057
Children spontaneously
treat lumps of mud as cakes,

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.310
your cellphone as a motor car and so on.

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:26.090
They spontaneously know it, we don't teach

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.830
pretending to children,
children know to pretend,

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.490
they come knowing how to prepare basically

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:30.963
and they do it all the time.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.740
Walton has argued that this
is at the heart of fiction,

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:39.350
that what happens to
children's make-believe

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:42.090
is that it grows up and
becomes the novel and movies

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:43.750
and so on I think that's a plausible view,

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:46.243
though people in literary
studies don't always like it.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.390
That is a very hard thing to understand,

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:54.540
what we're doing there.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:58.750
I want to make the point both
that we all know how to do it,

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.460
we all did it without anyone
telling us how to do it,

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.840
we understand it
perfectly well in one way.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.470
But actually it's really weird

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:07.120
what's going on there when
the child goes you know...

01:01:08.533 --> 01:01:10.480
(imitates moving car)

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:15.050
Because for example, if
you put your hand up,

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.030
the child has to decide
whether the treat that

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:20.540
as an accident, or you
interfering with the game.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:23.050
And it does one or other of those things

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.783
and it knows that they're different.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:30.530
So we know from children,
how to treat a collection,

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:33.760
and ensemble of objects as if
they were some other things

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.340
and we know what the
boundaries are of that,

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.833
we know that it isn't
really a cake, the mud pie,

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.660
we know that certain moves with the mud,

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:48.090
count as serving the cake

01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:51.050
and others count as changing the subject,

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.050
doing something else, stopping the game.

01:01:58.349 --> 01:02:00.130
And that's essentially in grown-up form,

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.262
I think a lot of theorizing is like that

01:02:02.262 --> 01:02:07.150
only perhaps we're less clear,

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:11.330
when we're doing theorizing
that that's what we're doing.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:13.040
I mean what are children
doing in this case?

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.110
They're learning how the world works,

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:17.160
they're learning to understand the world.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:19.460
They are actually picking up

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.720
on genuine features of the
world as they play these games.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.943
And we are picking up on that's the point

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:28.300
about capacities in the Cartwright account

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.770
of why theories that aren't
strictly speaking inconsistent

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:33.000
and therefore couldn't be true,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.140
can nevertheless help
us understand things.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.900
But it's a bit mysterious
how that works I think.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.580
You can say, perhaps we should say,

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:46.170
look what's going on here is
made possible by our access

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:48.820
to possibilities, to the
fact that we can understand.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.220
So that what's going on is that

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.152
we have this amazing
capacity to understand

01:02:54.152 --> 01:02:55.590
what it would be for the world

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.390
to be a certain way that it isn't

01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:59.930
and we understand the
way that the world is,

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:04.930
in terms of pictures of
ways it might have been,

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:05.933
though it isn't.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.620
I think that's true, I don't know

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.260
how deeply explanatory it is to say that,

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.227
but it is to say I think
that sort of possibilities

01:03:15.227 --> 01:03:18.260
and maybe you don't like possible worlds,

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.750
but possibilities are key to this.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:23.950
That understanding things
involves understanding

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:25.550
their possibilities, their capacities,

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:28.150
what they would do.

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.470
So take the simplest
case of an idealization,

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:33.831
the kind of Galilean story about

01:03:33.831 --> 01:03:37.363
the ball moving down the inclined plane,

01:03:37.363 --> 01:03:40.970
we tell a story in which we understand,

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:43.370
we imagine a world in
which there's no friction.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.610
There is no such world, no actual world.

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:47.950
There is no place in the world with that,

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.450
well actually there is
now, with superconductors,

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.783
but anyway, forget about.

01:03:51.783 --> 01:03:53.700
There are no actual inclined planes

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.863
with balls on them with no friction.

01:03:55.863 --> 01:03:58.710
We get the story as it were exactly right

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.540
for a world with no friction.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.260
Only that isn't this world,

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.680
it's this other world that
we know how to imagine.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.790
And I think that capacity which we display

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:09.050
from the very beginning as
children in our make-believe,

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:14.050
is the one that is key to
sort of unpacking all this.

01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:16.953
- [Man In Stripped Shirt] Thanks.

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:22.410
- [Man] So it sounds like
you're saying essentially that

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.383
philosophical systems are like toys,

01:04:24.383 --> 01:04:26.610
like they're partial without our

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:29.180
pretending that they are
something or another.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.070
And in Internet and youth culture

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.994
there's another operator, the kinda.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:33.827
(Kwame laughs)

01:04:33.827 --> 01:04:35.670
So the kinda and the sorta,

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.180
are you suggesting that
they are more accurate

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.930
or more valid or more precise in a way

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:42.453
than the definitive clauses?

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:46.560
- Well one thing I suppose
I would be inclined to say

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.560
is that there are very few
things that I know are true

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.533
but there are lots of things
that I know are sorta true.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.138
So very often if I say
something's sorta the case,

01:05:00.138 --> 01:05:03.270
I'm saying something as
it were confident of,

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:07.373
precisely because it's
a little bit inchoate.

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:10.582
If you asked me for a choate thing,

01:05:10.582 --> 01:05:13.140
I wouldn't know which choate thing to pick

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.825
from the many inchoate things that sorta

01:05:15.825 --> 01:05:18.238
covers as possibilities.

01:05:18.238 --> 01:05:21.640
I do think that what this view suggests,

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.710
I didn't say this but is that

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.570
we have...

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.630
basically I think we have
lots of pictures of the world,

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:33.840
lots of representations of the world

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.970
and they're good for you know,

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:37.803
some of them are good for nothing

01:05:37.803 --> 01:05:39.600
and so we should abandon them altogether

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.840
but many of them are good for something

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.870
and our knowledge is held,

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:48.180
our understanding of the
world in a way is held

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:51.453
in all these partial pictures.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:57.290
And many of them we don't
know what's wrong with them,

01:05:57.350 --> 01:06:00.630
that is they're as Viahinger would say,

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.560
hypotheses at the
moment, not yet fictions.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.540
But many of them are fictions

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.640
and we're still not going to abandon them.

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:10.430
Because just as...

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:15.116
philosophers of science
found it very hard to say,

01:06:15.116 --> 01:06:17.550
you could say the work of Paul Farben

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:18.700
is about this question.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.430
Why do we feel that
there's still some truth

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:24.530
in the Newtonian story after we've learnt

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.960
the answer Einsteinian story, right?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.870
Surely the Einsteinian story just shows

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:30.713
the Newtonian story was wrong.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.490
Well, yeah, but that we think
that the Newtonian story

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:42.730
is better than the
medieval impetus theory?

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:44.730
Yes. But what does that mean?

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:47.340
Better in the light of what?

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.360
For what purposes?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.320
I think it's hard to say.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.160
And one of the things that I think

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.840
reading Viahinger has made
me think about is that

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:02.150
as I said, useful means
useful for some purpose.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:04.520
I think it's often very unclear

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.760
what the purposes are with which we

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.210
mobilize our representations.

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:11.380
He says controlling the
world, that is one of them,

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.100
but as I said understanding
the world is another

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.850
and that's a great deal less clear

01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:20.150
what the criteria of
success and failure are

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:21.530
and controlling the world we succeed

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:24.380
if we sort of get what we wanted.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:28.223
Understanding, it's less
clear to me that we have

01:07:28.223 --> 01:07:29.860
sort of this solid picture.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.210
So I would say that my sort of conclusion

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:35.600
from all this is that our
understanding of the world

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.490
is held in many incompatible pictures

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.562
and that there's a reason
to hold on to some pictures

01:07:43.562 --> 01:07:46.830
that are known to be wrong

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.450
because the fact that they're wrong,

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:52.725
doesn't mean that they aren't
useful for some purpose.

01:07:52.725 --> 01:07:55.747
Though it can be unclear
what that purpose is.

01:07:55.747 --> 01:07:56.647
- [Man] Thank you.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.213
- [Campbell] I would really like

01:08:06.213 --> 01:08:09.063
to ask you one more question
and I hope I may do that.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.580
I wonder if you really need Dennett

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.437
to frame the puzzle that interests you.

01:08:15.437 --> 01:08:17.160
And there are two things in Dennett,

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.019
One is there's some
kind of instrumentalism.

01:08:19.019 --> 01:08:21.357
There's a familiar pattern

01:08:21.357 --> 01:08:22.940
where there's a lot of instrumentalism

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.040
and then there's a lot of talk about

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.610
how I'm not an instrumentalist.

01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:30.610
But suppose you were as
uncompromising a realist as you like

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.530
about the mental life,
I say consciousness,

01:08:34.530 --> 01:08:37.230
rationality, all that's just there,

01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:40.760
is got nothing to do reliable
and voluminous prediction.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.180
It's the only bit of the
universe that really matters,

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.580
that's what's important
to us the mental life.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.010
Everything else only matters

01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:50.100
because of its connection
to the mental life

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.770
and that's not to be explained

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:53.660
as instrumental for something else,

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.563
that's just there a bit
of reality to be studied.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:00.100
Now even if you have such a view,

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.272
which I take it is opposite to Dennett's

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:05.271
your puzzle it seems to
me you could still raise

01:09:05.271 --> 01:09:07.600
because it would still be true,

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.147
it would be as true as it ever was

01:09:09.147 --> 01:09:14.147
that we are using rationality
as an idealization

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.140
in understanding this bit of the world

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.274
and your question will still be live.

01:09:19.274 --> 01:09:20.930
How does that work?

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:24.284
How can it be helpful to
understand this bit of reality

01:09:24.284 --> 01:09:27.925
when we just know that we're not rational.

01:09:27.925 --> 01:09:31.744
So the as if comes in twice here.

01:09:31.744 --> 01:09:35.790
As if comes in in your picture of what

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:36.920
the psychological life is.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.720
I mean one way of putting
down its pictures to say,

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.140
you don't really have a mind,

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.930
it's only as if you have a mind

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.810
and we can use that to predict.

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:46.430
You don't need that bit.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.731
You want, we've got a
mind, whatever that is

01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:53.720
and we use this ideal and
we use this idealization of

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.730
as if we were rational
and that's the key thing.

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.460
Is that right?

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.690
- I think, yes the problem
would still arise on that view.

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:05.887
I'm a little bit interested
in Dennett's way of doing it

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:12.330
because I'm old enough to have grown up

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.640
thinking there was an interesting
problem about the minds.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.473
- [Campbell] Oh we do.
(giggling)

01:10:16.473 --> 01:10:17.921
- Lots of people nowadays seem to think

01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:18.754
that there is--

01:10:18.754 --> 01:10:21.254
(both mumble)

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:25.750
And so I'm interested in as it were

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:29.300
the reasons why we might
think that other creatures

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.207
including ourselves, have
minds, I mean each other.

01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:36.110
I agree that the reasons
why I think I have a mind

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.040
might be peculiar and distinctive

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.313
but I'm and you know return
is obviously for you.

01:10:46.332 --> 01:10:49.169
But I guess I am interested in

01:10:49.169 --> 01:10:52.520
whether we can say how it is

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.090
that it's possible given the fact

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:56.980
that the way I know what I think

01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.030
is so different from the way
that you know what you think,

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:02.280
that I can know what you think.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.540
And this whole tradition

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.120
which includes Viahinger and Dennett

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.890
is sort of broadly empiricists

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:13.570
in its attempt to understand the mind

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:17.400
as not one's own mind,
but the minds of others

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.890
including other organisms and humans.

01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:22.070
I think in a way...

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:24.043
Look...

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.250
there's no practical doubt in my mind

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:33.010
about whether other people have minds,

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:34.937
particular other people have minds.

01:11:34.937 --> 01:11:38.270
Some people sometimes have a
kind of moment when they...

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:40.940
I don't have that experience.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:45.020
But I do have that thought
about some other animals,

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:46.563
as I mentioned sheep.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:49.790
I'm interested in the question,

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:53.140
how sensible it is to think of them,

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.463
it seems to be obvious
that they have perceptions.

01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:00.150
That's not one of the
things I'm not clear about.

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.009
But I am unclear about how much

01:12:02.009 --> 01:12:04.350
one should say about them in terms of

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:08.050
the language of belief, desire,

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:11.000
I don't find myself tempted to
think that they hope things.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.410
I think they have intentions
at least sometimes,

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:17.530
but I'm not sure.

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:21.370
And in trying to decide
what that worry amounts to,

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:23.540
I think the sort of thing
that Dennett is doing

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.975
with the intentional sense

01:12:24.975 --> 01:12:27.030
is one of the kinds of answers.

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:29.590
But I agree that for you and me,

01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:30.960
the question whether...

01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:34.330
I don't understand the Churchland view

01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:36.077
that it might turn out--

01:12:36.077 --> 01:12:38.266
- [Campbell] Yeah.

01:12:38.266 --> 01:12:39.687
- It's not that their view
that we could turn out

01:12:39.687 --> 01:12:40.520
that we don't have minds,

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.353
it's their view that we could turn out

01:12:41.353 --> 01:12:43.617
to have minds that were
sort of radically different

01:12:43.617 --> 01:12:46.663
from the way they appear to us to be.

01:12:51.908 --> 01:12:54.970
I'm really interested in the
sort of thing Charlie works on

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:58.280
which is the relationship
between that story

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.225
and the neurobiological story.

01:13:00.225 --> 01:13:01.570
It's not that I don't think
that's an interesting question,

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.040
but I don't think of the
neurobiological story

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.040
as one that could force me
to abandon this other story.

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:12.860
And I'm in part saying that
because of the general view

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.750
that I just suggested, which is that

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:19.610
we need lots of stories that
are doing different jobs for us

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:23.990
and I suppose I'm arguing that actually,

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:28.990
against claims for the importance
of the unity of knowledge,

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:32.890
I'm arguing that our
knowledge is held in many,

01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:36.209
incompatible systems of representation

01:13:36.209 --> 01:13:40.726
and if we were God, maybe
we could integrate them all.

01:13:40.726 --> 01:13:42.900
If we were cognitive angels
we could integrate them

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.733
although we're not.

01:13:43.733 --> 01:13:47.290
And we never will be, so
we're always going to need

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:48.410
lots of different pictures.

01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:50.580
And one of the pictures
that I just don't see how

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:54.251
it would make sense for a human
being to try to be without

01:13:54.251 --> 01:13:55.701
is this picture of ourselves

01:13:55.701 --> 01:13:57.880
as wanting things and hoping
for things and desiring things

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.030
and thinking things and having reasons

01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:04.050
for doing and thinking and feeling things.

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:05.103
That seems to me,

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:10.490
I just don't know how I could do without.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:14.406
How we could do without.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.140
- [Campbell] Please come up.

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:22.820
- [Lady] So I'm gonna
go back to two things

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.440
that you've said about make-believe

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.060
and also about the final image

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.354
about going off into the future.

01:14:29.354 --> 01:14:31.380
From an empirical perspective,

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.860
at least one account you might have

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.224
about why kids are making believe,

01:14:35.224 --> 01:14:38.790
is that one of the
capacities we need to have

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:40.740
to make cognitive progress,

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.622
is the capacity to say here's
the belief that I hold now,

01:14:43.622 --> 01:14:47.530
here's how it fits the data,
here's an alternative belief

01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:49.190
which I currently do not hold,

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:52.620
which I currently don't think it's true,

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.930
I wanna check how that fits the data.

01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:59.010
So I have some new set of
data, I've done an experiment

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:02.560
a.k.a. gotten into
everything in my nursery

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.755
and now I have a new bunch of data,

01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:06.415
I have a current belief,

01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:08.650
I check that belief against the data,

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:10.060
but here's an alternative belief

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.550
that I'm gonna check against the data.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:14.860
and if you don't actually
have the cognitive capacity

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.830
to say here's an alternative
belief, it's false as of now.

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:23.900
But if it were true, here's
what the consequences would be,

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:24.733
here's the data.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:28.120
how does that actually fit
with the potential consequences

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.307
and the capacity to
sometimes override and say,

01:15:30.307 --> 01:15:31.140
"Oh, look at that!

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.393
"The thing that I thought before was false

01:15:32.393 --> 01:15:33.940
"and this thing is true."

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.450
Then you wouldn't be able to make

01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:37.510
the kind of cognitive progress
that we actually make.

01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:39.650
And from that perspective
what you're doing

01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:41.274
when you're making believe is essentially

01:15:41.274 --> 01:15:44.037
exercising this capacity to say,

01:15:44.037 --> 01:15:46.717
"Here's a premise, it's important

01:15:46.717 --> 01:15:48.277
"that I currently think that it's false

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:51.897
"because I don't want to get
confused about my predictions,

01:15:51.897 --> 01:15:54.197
"but I can think if it were true,

01:15:54.197 --> 01:15:55.077
"that if this were true,

01:15:55.077 --> 01:15:57.000
"then here's what the
consequences would be."

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.838
So I think there's a relationship between

01:15:58.838 --> 01:16:00.369
and I think part of the reason why

01:16:00.369 --> 01:16:02.471
it seems plausible to have idealizations

01:16:02.471 --> 01:16:06.410
is because we and as a matter
of fact also four-year-olds

01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:10.160
know that the current
belief might be susceptible

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.390
to this kind of replacement by what,

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:17.740
at the moment is just the as if, beliefs.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.910
So I think there's a
connection between those two

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:23.184
that actually makes sense
out of why it is that

01:16:23.184 --> 01:16:26.220
we would be not only entertain as ifs

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.190
when we're doing things like make believe,

01:16:28.190 --> 01:16:30.535
but the sense in which we could say that

01:16:30.535 --> 01:16:34.590
we know that the belief
that we currently have

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.990
is gonna turn out to be false,

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:38.810
but it's still useful and
important for us to hold it.

01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:41.970
And it's also important for
us to hold the alternative,

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:44.103
to be able to work with
the alternative hypothesis

01:16:44.103 --> 01:16:45.783
as if it were true.

01:16:45.783 --> 01:16:46.616
- Mhmn.

01:16:50.237 --> 01:16:52.130
I don't know what to say,
except that that seems

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:54.023
absolutely right to me,

01:16:54.023 --> 01:16:56.340
that seems absolutely right that it is.

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.920
Though I would say one
thing which is that,

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.363
I think there's a human way of doing this

01:17:01.363 --> 01:17:04.287
that is somewhat distinctive because...

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:10.400
Because animals change, other animals

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.568
change their beliefs too.

01:17:12.568 --> 01:17:15.730
But I don't think my
sheep engaged in kind of

01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:17.790
counterfactual reasoning.

01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:19.100
So I think that this capacity

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:20.870
for kind of actual reasoning here,

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:24.277
means that we're capable of a
kind of knowledge development

01:17:24.277 --> 01:17:28.710
that is very distinctive and
therefore especially important

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:31.580
because it's one of the
reasons why we can do things

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.690
cognitively that other organisms,

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.689
as far as we know, can't.

01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:38.159
- [Lady] And just for what it's worth,

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:42.953
we have historical
co-relationship between kids.

01:17:42.953 --> 01:17:47.953
Between how much they're
capable of (mumbles).

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:50.990
- Good.

01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:54.593
And as you said they're
conceptually connected, yeah.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.043
Yes, I agree with that, um, thank you.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.290
Yes.

01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:03.955
- [Man] Just a brief observation about

01:18:03.955 --> 01:18:05.890
usefulness and context.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:07.270
I think this isn't the spirit of

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:09.030
the way you're thinking about things,

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:12.570
but to say that as if way
of thinking about things

01:18:12.570 --> 01:18:16.640
is view useful, that's
something that might make sense

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.010
or might be a plausible thing to say

01:18:18.010 --> 01:18:20.170
in some context but not others.

01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:23.948
And a very natural way
of dividing up context

01:18:23.948 --> 01:18:27.064
for some of these purposes
is to is to contrast

01:18:27.064 --> 01:18:30.104
the deliberative standpoint with

01:18:30.104 --> 01:18:33.950
a retrospective or explanatory
or third personal standpoint.

01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:35.950
This is very natural in connection

01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:37.930
with this original Kantian idea

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:42.074
that we act under the idea of freedom,

01:18:42.074 --> 01:18:45.450
sort of like when you're
moving forward in life,

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:47.400
there's nothing you can really do

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.890
with a thought that it's
all determined in advance,

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:51.890
that's not gonna help you decide

01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:53.732
what to eat for breakfast, right?

01:18:53.732 --> 01:18:58.110
You've gotta make up your
mind and within that context

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:02.320
there's in some way no alternative

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.960
but to assume that it's up
to us what we're going to do.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.100
That that same assumption
when we look back

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.960
at what people have done in the past maybe

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.775
less ultimately, less useful--

01:19:11.775 --> 01:19:12.608
- Including ourselves.

01:19:12.608 --> 01:19:13.640
- [Man] Including ourselves, exactly.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.427
So I think that's a very...

01:19:15.427 --> 01:19:19.268
You were mostly talking about explanatory

01:19:19.268 --> 01:19:22.090
and interpretive context or were trying

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:24.060
to predict and explain things but

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.160
at least some of these notions

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.090
and I think the same
is true of rationality,

01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:28.410
notions of reasons,

01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:31.180
they have some predictive significance.

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.410
And certainly of some significance

01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:33.840
in the retrospective point of view

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.020
but really, again, it's hard to know

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.270
how you're gonna get through life

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:42.345
without assuming that the
fact that a car is coming

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:45.626
bearing down on you is a
reason to get out of the way.

01:19:45.626 --> 01:19:50.626
And that that idea has
tremendous significance

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.090
in that deliberative context,

01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:54.370
which might be entirely independent

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:58.310
from whether it's useful
in other concepts.

01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:00.070
Take that to be gristle
for your (mumbles).

01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:02.419
- No, no, I think that's very helpful.

01:20:02.419 --> 01:20:06.280
And the difficulty I think about

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.960
the sort of useful for what question

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.210
is that it can sometimes
be hard to articulate

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:13.660
the for what.

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.350
We do have some cases,

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:18.941
the practical what am I doing question,

01:20:18.941 --> 01:20:21.296
that's one context as
we know how to sort of

01:20:21.296 --> 01:20:24.890
define in that rather crude way

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:26.662
but still it's an important way.

01:20:26.662 --> 01:20:30.020
As I said I think it's a bit less clear

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:35.800
what it is to say that it's useful

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.510
for the purposes of
understanding to say something,

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:42.300
but nevertheless I think I
want to say that sometimes.

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:46.300
And then sometimes...

01:20:50.932 --> 01:20:53.660
Just to go back to the make-believe thing,

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.768
as I said, adults do make-believe,

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.333
that's what we're doing in the theater.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.760
We're responding as if
Juliet just killed herself

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:09.830
because she discovered Romeo
dead on the thing beside her

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.733
or is it the other way
around? I can't remember.

01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.750
And we're moved by that, as we would be

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:18.490
if we came across such an event in reality

01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:22.833
but we're not confused
about what's going on.

01:21:25.377 --> 01:21:27.463
That means it's all Kendall Walton.

01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:34.404
For what, are we doing that?

01:21:37.405 --> 01:21:38.238
I don't know.

01:21:39.274 --> 01:21:41.490
I mean it's one of the
most important things

01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:43.040
that happens to me when
going to the theater,

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.820
so it's not that I don't have any doubt

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.810
that that for what is
an important for what,

01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:49.479
it's just that I don't know that there's

01:21:49.479 --> 01:21:53.390
an interesting way of
specifying what it is.

01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:55.100
And maybe there doesn't have to be

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.970
an interesting one in the sense
of theoretically interesting

01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:00.500
maybe it's just one of the
things that human beings

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.500
either do or don't get.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.857
So that it's like the funny,

01:22:05.857 --> 01:22:07.800
or the amusing.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.420
I don't know that one can
give an interesting account

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.050
of the amusing but life
without it would be,

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:15.469
at least for me, less interesting.

01:22:15.469 --> 01:22:17.077
Yes, less amusing (laughs).

01:22:18.565 --> 01:22:21.020
- [Campbell] We're trying to get one more.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.853
Yes please.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:25.570
- Hi.

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:27.920
- There's an (clears throat) excuse me.

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:32.110
There's an approach which
seems to me obviously promising

01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:34.980
and so I'm wondering if
you have thoughts about it

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.294
or problems with it.

01:22:36.294 --> 01:22:38.720
When you talk about idealizations

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.720
and wonder how can this
fictional thing be useful,

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.915
in science and technology,

01:22:46.915 --> 01:22:50.550
there's the concept of approximations.

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:53.991
And there're elaborate techniques

01:22:53.991 --> 01:22:58.991
for evaluating their
goodness and their utility

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.983
for different purposes.

01:23:00.983 --> 01:23:05.360
Would that perhaps solve
some of your problems?

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.860
- So it's an instance
of, thank you very much.

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:11.320
It's an instance of the general question

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.143
and I didn't say much about it in part

01:23:13.143 --> 01:23:15.780
because I haven't thought
too much about it,

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.800
but also because I think it is as you say,

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.160
a relatively well-developed
area of thinking about this.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.270
That is, this is one of the places where

01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:27.840
people already have the
idea that it can be useful

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.480
to use a picture that's
strictly speaking false,

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.016
because it gets you in a certain domain,

01:23:34.016 --> 01:23:37.761
approximately the right answer.

01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:40.560
I think that's a really
good answer to the question

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.943
why you should use a certain
picture in a certain domain.

01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:51.893
But of course as was pretty
much explicit in what you said,

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.170
being sort of approximately good enough

01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:04.023
is relative to a thing
you're trying to understand.

01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:10.360
I was once years ago, actually in company

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.410
with Richard Braithwaite,

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:14.140
listening to a theoretical physicist

01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:17.590
and he was talking about
the fundamental constants.

01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:19.329
And he went through a
bunch of mathematics,

01:24:19.329 --> 01:24:23.450
very much physicists mathematic,

01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:26.370
so lot of gestures here and there.

01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:30.847
And at the end he wrote down
122 or something, he said,

01:24:30.847 --> 01:24:32.397
"That's close enough to 12!"

01:24:33.464 --> 01:24:35.020
(audience laughs) which is
the number he was getting.

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.580
Now, (audience laughing)
in a calculation where

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.800
you know sometimes
you've been 10 to this 93

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.590
and sometimes you've
been 10 to the minus 15,

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:44.620
actually 12 is pretty close 120, right?

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:46.490
But you need to know what the context is,

01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:50.453
to decide whether something
is approximately good enough.

01:24:51.359 --> 01:24:54.410
I think, again, this is well understood,

01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:56.550
I'm not telling you something that you

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:57.810
or other people don't know.

01:24:57.810 --> 01:25:01.520
That's a relatively
well-developed area of thought

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.993
about one particular kind.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.810
Well known not just by philosophers

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:09.490
but by scientists themselves
'cause they need the notion

01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:11.300
of approximation in order to do this work

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.000
and they need to be able to decide

01:25:14.034 --> 01:25:19.034
when to accept which
approximations for which purposes.

01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:22.202
But of course the point is
that you do need to specify

01:25:22.202 --> 01:25:25.400
what you're trying to do in
order to decide whether...

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:33.850
Our theory of rational agency,

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:36.020
very often predicts that someone will,

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.713
I don't know, buy something.

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:39.683
Then they don't.

01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:43.773
Now, but they buy something else.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.778
Is the theory approximately true

01:25:46.778 --> 01:25:48.623
because they bought something?

01:25:48.623 --> 01:25:49.588
(laughs) Well, that depends on

01:25:49.588 --> 01:25:52.170
whether what they bought is sort of

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:53.820
like enough to the thing that you said

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.040
they were going to buy I suppose.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.820
Or on whether alternatively,

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.110
not treating it as an approximation,

01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:03.170
an explanation for why there's a deviation

01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:05.670
between what the rational thing was to do

01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:07.600
and what they actually did.

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:11.380
They were distracted
by something and so on.

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.620
But yeah, approximation, in
the book I'm writing about it.

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.840
I'm not gonna talk much
about approximation,

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.390
not because I don't think
it's really important,

01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:19.310
because it seems to me better understood

01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:20.900
than some of these other thing.

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.490
But it's a really important
part of the subject.

01:26:23.490 --> 01:26:24.323
- [Campbell] That was a delightful

01:26:24.323 --> 01:26:26.739
and very stimulating
talk, thank you very much.

01:26:26.739 --> 01:26:31.739
- Thank you very much.
(applause)

01:26:34.891 --> 01:26:38.891
(upbeat deep bass guitar music)
