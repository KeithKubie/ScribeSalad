00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.570
Communities to practice are unique
learning and doing environments.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.270
They were detailed in great
book from 1991 called,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.480
Legitimate Peripheral Participation.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.390
And it basically suggests
that novices and

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.340
experts work together in
certain environments.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.464
And the novices actually learn
from the experts while the experts

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:16.500
are doing some task.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.058
And over time, the novices take
a little bit of responsibility and

00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:20.350
then a little bit more.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.610
And learn how to contribute to that
environment while also contributing to

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.240
that environment.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.100
So for an example that's used in that
book is the example of midwives.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.762
So when a midwife is first
being trained in certain areas,

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:35.310
the first thing she goes through is just
being in the room during childbirth.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.674
She experiences the different things
that the experienced midwives

00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:41.350
are saying and doing and
just kind of gets a feel for it.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.860
And then over time, she takes on
a couple responsibilities, and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.170
a couple more, and learns, and
learns a little bit more each day.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.130
And eventually is an expert herself,
and can start training her own novices.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.970
It's a very apprenticeship
driven approach.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.860
And that book they suggested, this is
really one of the best ways to learn.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.370
because your learning right
in the authentic context,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.270
where you'll ultimately
contribute to what you learned.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.670
But it presents a lot of
difficulties for classroom learning,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.110
because classrooms
are completely absent of this.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.930
You very rarely have classrooms
where you really are doing what you

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.830
are learning to do.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.076
You're learning in place to the idea of
being that you're going to go out into

00:01:13.076 --> 00:01:15.250
the world and then do it in a job or
do it in a career.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.782
But in the classroom you're not actually
contributing, but this learning theory

00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:21.310
suggests that that's the opposite
of a great way to learn.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.266
So the question is,

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.420
can we create these kind of
environments where this is simulated,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.025
where students are experiencing what
it would be like to contribute a little

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:32.720
more over time to this enterprise
that they're trying to learn.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.410
Technology may be able
to help us with this,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.790
because with technology we can
create these kinds of similations.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.744
We can simulate, whatever career
the students are going to go into and

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:43.800
simulate giving them some of these
responsibilities while AI agents or

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.260
the simulation itself
takes care of the rest.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.710
So we'll talk about the value
of this educational approach,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.270
as well as how we can use technology
to really bring it to life.
