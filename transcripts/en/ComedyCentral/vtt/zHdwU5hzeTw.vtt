00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:01.969
- The next round
of Roast Battle is coming up

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.738
so we wanted to remind you
why you like watching

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:07.040
comics tear each other
in the first place.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.477
- So we decided to compile
the 10 best burns

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.646
from the last
two seasons, enjoy.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:13.614
- Grrr.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.919
- Tony, the only time you've
ever made a pussy wet is

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.587
when you drownd a bag of cats.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.124
- The heat on that burn could
melt armor.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:27.794
- And it did. He had to bring
that costume back

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:28.495
within an hour.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.299
- Jimmy, you look like you
worked at Hogwarts.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.268
Which is what girls get
when they (bleep) you.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:40.741
Have you had hogwarts?

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.242
- No, but I have fucked Jimmy.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.245
What do Leah and the Armenian
genocide have in common?

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.447
They're both too
ugly for America to recognize.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.250
- You might come to a Roast
Battle to see comics

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.151
tear into each other

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.655
but you stay for the incisive
political commentary.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.291
- You know what that one
brought awareness

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.226
to a very important issue also.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:00:59.860
- Which is?

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.161
Armenian genocide.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:02.896
- What's so important about
that?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.531
- No fucking clue.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.568
- You look like if Michael Moore
got gang banged by Juggalos.

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:18.345
- I'm just glad Abe Lincoln
was alive to hear that.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.882
- Hasn't Michael Moore
been gang banged Juggalos?

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:23.917
- You know what I think
he's doing

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.152
a documentary about that.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.822
- I didn't know much about
Olivia so I went to her website

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.658
which is called
"oliviaisfunny.com".

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:33.627
I know.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.068
If she can call
her web website

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:43.603
oliviaisfunny.com
I can call mine

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.705
"Todd is really tall

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.540
and has a full head of hair dot
com"

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.176
- Todd's so easy to roast
that he couldn't resist

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:50.677
doing it to himself at the end
there.

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.680
- Todd's been roasting me
my entire career

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.915
so... fuck him.

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:58.986
- Nobody will.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.023
- Ms. Pat's pussy is so fat it's
got plates.

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.192
And it's like a coal
mine in Chile.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.227
There's 70 people at the bottom
of it

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.562
thinking they're gonna
die.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:11.732
- Oh man I miss
Ralphie. Ralphie May.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.035
Hats off to you buddy roast
in peace.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.005
- You look like MTV2 became a
man.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.443
- See kids, the key to a good
roast joke is specificity.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.712
Who else but Anna
could think of a MTV2 burn.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.881
- Anybody who's ever watched

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.984
Celebrity Deathmatch 15 years
ago.

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:32.052
Me.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.922
- Kurt likes to brag that he's
in an open relationship.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.958
And by that he means all the
cases against him

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.893
haven't been closed yet.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.498
- The real joke is the idea
that anyone would date Kurt.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.366
- Actually there was so much
sexual tension

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.035
during that battle, they were
banging

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:49.569
in the green room afterwards.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.505
- That's why it smelled like
that.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.341
Matt's a lot
like the food at my work.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.610
He's about to get served
by a Mexican.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.515
Matt's never eaten outside
of a country club

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:02.883
so who knows if he even got
that joke.

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.551
You're right. Probably didn't
even get it.

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.054
- You know, people are asking me
tonight

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.955
if I'm going to put Sarah
in her place.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.358
She's a 38 year old woman
in comedy.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.426
There isn't one.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.963
- Fuck, man.
A big shout out

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.466
to all the roasters
for not crying on stage.

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:23.036
- Seriously, those were harsh
and the battlers

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.504
have set a pretty high bar.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:27.140
But we promised Season 3
would bring even more heat.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.409
- Grrr.
