he was definitely an inspiration he was
 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.089
he was definitely an inspiration he was
one of the most brilliant theoretical

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099
one of the most brilliant theoretical
 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.070
one of the most brilliant theoretical
physicists in the world and of course he

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080
physicists in the world and of course he
 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.260

life was very difficult and very

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980
life was very difficult and very
 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.220

Hawking was something that we call a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510
Hawking was something that we call a
 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.660
Hawking was something that we call a
theoretical physicist and what that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670
theoretical physicist and what that
 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.299
theoretical physicist and what that
means is that people use the mathematics

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309
means is that people use the mathematics
 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.240
means is that people use the mathematics
of physics to explore areas of the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250
of physics to explore areas of the
 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.619
of physics to explore areas of the
universe that we can't get to very

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629
universe that we can't get to very
 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.229
universe that we can't get to very
easily you know for example conditions

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239
easily you know for example conditions
 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.549
easily you know for example conditions
right after the Big Bang the beginning

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559
right after the Big Bang the beginning
 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.350
right after the Big Bang the beginning
of the universe what were things like

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360
of the universe what were things like
 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.270
of the universe what were things like
when the universe was a fraction of a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280
when the universe was a fraction of a
 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.340
when the universe was a fraction of a
second old that's not something we can

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350
second old that's not something we can
 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.469
second old that's not something we can
create very easily in a laboratory or

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479
create very easily in a laboratory or
 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.689
create very easily in a laboratory or
not not any place we can go to but we

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699
not not any place we can go to but we
 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.000
not not any place we can go to but we
can use our mathematics to predict what

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010
can use our mathematics to predict what
 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.799
can use our mathematics to predict what
that would have been like and then test

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809
that would have been like and then test
 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.600
that would have been like and then test
our assumptions based on how the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610
our assumptions based on how the
 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.450
our assumptions based on how the
universe changed over time and one of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460
universe changed over time and one of
 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.980
universe changed over time and one of
the places that is also very difficult

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990
the places that is also very difficult
 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.170
the places that is also very difficult
to go to is could we explore a black

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180
to go to is could we explore a black
 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.779
to go to is could we explore a black
hole and this is what Stephen Hawking

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789
hole and this is what Stephen Hawking
 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.920
hole and this is what Stephen Hawking
was best known for now black holes are

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
was best known for now black holes are
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.849
was best known for now black holes are
massive objects they're made from

massive objects they're made from
 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.459
massive objects they're made from
collapsed dead stars and the nearest

collapsed dead stars and the nearest
 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.039

black hole to us is about 3,000 light

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049
black hole to us is about 3,000 light
 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.499
black hole to us is about 3,000 light
years away that one's not particularly

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509
years away that one's not particularly
 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.450
years away that one's not particularly
large that's only a couple times the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460
large that's only a couple times the
 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.940
large that's only a couple times the
mass of the Sun the the biggest black

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950
mass of the Sun the the biggest black
 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.099
mass of the Sun the the biggest black
hole that's in our galaxy is about four

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109
hole that's in our galaxy is about four
 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.380
hole that's in our galaxy is about four
million times the mass of the Sun and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390
million times the mass of the Sun and
 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.539
million times the mass of the Sun and
that actually sits right in the heart of

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549
that actually sits right in the heart of
 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.999
that actually sits right in the heart of
the Milky Way galaxy and right now you

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009
the Milky Way galaxy and right now you
 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.770
the Milky Way galaxy and right now you
and I are actually orbiting that giant

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780
and I are actually orbiting that giant
 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.359
and I are actually orbiting that giant
black hole at half a million miles an

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369
black hole at half a million miles an
 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.840
black hole at half a million miles an
hour these are incredibly exotic objects

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850
hour these are incredibly exotic objects
 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.910
hour these are incredibly exotic objects
the reason we call them black holes is

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920
the reason we call them black holes is
 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.459
the reason we call them black holes is
that the gravity is so intense it can

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469
that the gravity is so intense it can
 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.730
that the gravity is so intense it can
suck in everything including light not

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740
suck in everything including light not
 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.349
suck in everything including light not
even light you know going going through

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359
even light you know going going through
 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.539
even light you know going going through
space freely at the speed of light can

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549
space freely at the speed of light can
 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.239
space freely at the speed of light can
escape a black hole so I mean talk about

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249
escape a black hole so I mean talk about
 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:03.270
escape a black hole so I mean talk about
dramatic exotic objects that are

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280
dramatic exotic objects that are
 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.819
dramatic exotic objects that are
difficult to do experiments on Stephen

Hawking laid down some of our basic

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990
Hawking laid down some of our basic
 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.660
Hawking laid down some of our basic
understanding of how a black hole works

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670
understanding of how a black hole works
 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.880
understanding of how a black hole works
and one of the things he actually did

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890
and one of the things he actually did
 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.290
and one of the things he actually did
was even predict that black holes can

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
was even predict that black holes can
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.660
was even predict that black holes can
die you would think that a collapsed

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
die you would think that a collapsed
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.309
die you would think that a collapsed
star that forms a bottomless pit of

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
star that forms a bottomless pit of
 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.090
star that forms a bottomless pit of
gravity would exist forever

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100
gravity would exist forever
 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.370
gravity would exist forever
but Stephen Hawking used the laws of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380
but Stephen Hawking used the laws of
 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.160
but Stephen Hawking used the laws of
quantum mechanics and something called

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
quantum mechanics and something called
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.420
quantum mechanics and something called
thermodynamics how heat behaves in the

can evaporate over time and of course

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390
can evaporate over time and of course
 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.620
can evaporate over time and of course
that's a hugely significant thing one of

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630
that's a hugely significant thing one of
 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.910
that's a hugely significant thing one of
the reasons I think it's very

unfortunate he died is we're actually
right on the cusp of being able to do

right on the cusp of being able to do

right on the cusp of being able to do

Stephen Hawking showed us that black

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080
Stephen Hawking showed us that black
