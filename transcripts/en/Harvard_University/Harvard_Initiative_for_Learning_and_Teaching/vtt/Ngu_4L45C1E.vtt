00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.570
So welcome, everyone,
to our session

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.150
on "Getting the Most
Out of Faculty and Staff

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.780
Partnerships."

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.071
We're delighted to have you
here at the HILT Conference

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:14.310
in general and at this
session in particular.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.680
My colleague, Lisa Brem,
has worked very hard

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.110
on organizing this.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.140
And it's great to have you here.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.650
I think we're going to
do some good work today.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.720
The idea behind the
session is basically

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.490
to bring faculty and staff
together and think about ways

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.010
to work together,
as a partnership

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.820
would suggest, to
figure out if you're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.580
someone, whether on the
faculty side or the staff side,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.730
who often works with the
other side of the table,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.527
how you can work
more effectively;

00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:43.110
if you think you already do work
effectively, just to give you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.410
a space to step back
and theorize in some way

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.190
why it does work well so that
on those rare occasions when you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.680
feel like a partnership
has been less fulfilling,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.680
you can figure out how
and how to improve that.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.600
If, on the other hand,
you're someone on one

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.960
or the other side of this
table who is wondering,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.560
"Why don't faculty
come visit me?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.209
I have amazing handouts."

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.590
Or on the faculty side, if
you're thinking, "Gosh, yeah,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.048
I'd love to take my students
to the museum, to the library,

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:11.970
to do something with my Canvas
site to start using clickers,"

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570
any of these things, and
you don't know where to go,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.640
and it's hard to figure out
how to ask or who to ask,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.910
or you're worried about, well
I don't want to ask the wrong

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.900
question that will, in some
way, make this a transactional

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320
relationship rather than
a transformational one--

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.660
to borrow the dean of the
college's favorite opposition--

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.070
this session is
for you, to think

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.160
about ways in which you can
work together effectively

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.560
on the staff and faculty side.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.410
So we have a great crew who's
sitting around me at this table

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.000
here--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.932
Esme, Sheryl, Dan, Lisa.

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:45.390
Everyone can say
a little bit more,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.600
maybe, about themselves as they
stand up to do the round table

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.500
part of the session.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.130
But we represent, in
a sense, two examples

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.430
of ways in which a teaching and
learning center and a faculty

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.590
member or faculty team
have worked together

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.110
to do an interesting project.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.410
So we're going to share--

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.750
let me go forward the agenda--

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.090
a couple of quick thoughts
in the panel discussion

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.740
part about things
that we've learned

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.210
about when we worked
well together,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.090
how we can work better
together, to give you--

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.460
to see the discussion
in some way,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.786
to think about how
you can work better.

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:19.410
And then, we'll give
you an opportunity

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.076
with that worksheet
that's on your table

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:23.460
to design your own
partnership, in a sense.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.200
One of our goals
for this session--

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.250
we think it's really important
that both sides, again,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.940
of this-- these
partnerships remember

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.210
that the students really are the
ultimate goal, that you should

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.770
be gazing together
at the students

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.710
and not just gazing
at each other.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.450
And also, it's really
important that you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.012
have clarity around your
roles, that you understand

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:43.470
what you as a
teaching and learning

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.800
center, as a library, what
have you really offer.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.920
Because students will
seek out skills and try

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.860
to learn things and try to have
experiences, whether or not

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.885
we are here.

00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:55.260
And so the thing
is to figure out

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.920
what you as a particular
center or department

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.110
have to offer them that
does not, in some way,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.600
replace or fill a need
100% but actually amplifies

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.924
things that faculty and
students already want to do.

00:03:08.924 --> 00:03:10.590
On the faculty side,
it's important too.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.100
Faculty do not spend a lot of
time thinking about themselves

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.870
as project managers,
unless, maybe, they

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.820
have experience directing a
center or something like that.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.450
So just really think about what
they want for their students

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.160
and what it would
take to get that done

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.000
and how to work productively
with a staff member who may,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.790
at least temporarily, want you
to be a little bit of a project

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.490
manager.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.450
So it's to help you think
about clarity in those roles

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.300
and how you can really explain
to the other side what you can

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.060
do well and have a partnership
which, again, both of you

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.000
learn from.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.500
And it's not just,
I have a problem.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.124
Here's a handout.

00:03:43.124 --> 00:03:45.540
And with that, let me turn it
over to our first successful

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.000
partnership.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.490
Lisa, you can introduce
your copanelists

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.020
and talk about what
you've learned.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.110
Sure.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.500
Hi, I'm Lisa Brem, and I
work at Harvard Law School.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.730
And I am the manager of
the Teaching, Learning,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.830
and Curriculum Solutions Group.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.010
And what we do is everything--
it's completely soup to nuts.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.740
It's a small,
tightly focused group

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.314
that really tries to support
faculty in everything that they

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:13.230
would like to do around
teaching and learning,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.890
from clickers to talking
through discussion boards--

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.100
uses thereof in Canvas or not--

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.570
all the way through more complex
and difficult, long-term types

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.800
of projects.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.637
So when I started
thinking about this panel

00:04:27.637 --> 00:04:29.220
discussion and this
session, I started

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.750
thinking-- the first image that
came to mind was the pit crew.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.810
So let's talk about the
pit crew for a minute.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.870
This is the first image.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.170
We were going to have
this as our image.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.880
And it's one possible
relationship.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.510
It's one possible
type of partnership

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.240
where people are very focused.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.210
It's transactional.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.060
It's fast.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.150
It's efficient.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.040
Everybody has
their discrete job,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.170
and the faculty is
in the driver's seat.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.840
And off they go to perform
what they are great at.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.010
And that is one
way that we work.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.960
But then, when we
were talking to Adam,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.100
we talked about the caddy.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.320
So let's look at the
caddy again for a second.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.880
So this is the caddy.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.560
And the caddy is
standing sort of

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.200
behind the golfer with the bags.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.780
And for people-- how
many people know golf?

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.280
OK, this is a good--
thank goodness.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.700
So I don't know golf that well.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.160
But I do know that the caddy
has a lot of expertise.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.540
The caddy isn't just like
the sherpa of the golf clubs.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.530
They actually are able
to tell the golfer,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.795
this is the-- you want
to use the three iron.

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:36.050
Is there a three iron?

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.450
Or the eight wood
or whatever it is.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.510
Because that's going to
do the best job for you

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.670
in this particular goal.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.650
What is it about this
relationship that's

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.090
different from the pit crew
is that it's more long-term.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.190
It's more bespoke.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.110
It pivots.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.710
It is a lot more unique
to each situation

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.850
and responsive to
each situation.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.540
So like Adam was saying,
instead of a packaged good,

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.880
you're getting a real
one-on-one relationship

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.210
that takes into account the
fact that every time you

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.240
step in front of a classroom
it's a unique situation.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.480
So there are similarities to
both types of partnerships.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.110
And one thing that I think
is very important to both

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.700
is trust.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.700
So you really trust
that pit crew.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.310
You don't want that
technology that you've said

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.220
is going to be great to fail,
because that will surely

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.710
get rid of trust really fast.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.380
You want the faculty
and your partners

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.530
to really feel as though
you have some value

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.760
in this relationship.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.740
And the value that
you bring is going

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.770
to be really worth
having this relationship.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.550
So I started thinking
about the similarities

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.950
and the differences--
that we all share goals,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.100
whether this is transactional
or a more long-term project,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.370
and that they rely on the
knowledge and the skills

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.840
and the experience
of both parties.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.401
So when we think about
the projects today,

00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:05.900
certainly the products today
are-- that we are talking about

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.990
are definitely in
the caddy variety,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.530
the long-term, more
complex type of projects.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.340
I like to think about, what
are our goals for this project?

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.840
Can we clearly articulate
them from the beginning?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.900
What is the value that
we bring from both sides?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.084
If you think about,
what kind of value

00:07:26.084 --> 00:07:27.500
would you like to
have when you're

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.940
sitting in a partnership?

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.910
What would you like the other
person to bring to the table?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.310
And maybe even imagine something
that you've never felt or seen

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.100
before, some kind of
skill set or knowledge

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.950
that maybe you didn't even
know existed out there.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.360
But maybe it would be
really great to have it.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.950
So if you could imagine
what that might be.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.820
And, also, how can we measure
the success of these projects?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.610
I think that's such
an important question,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.470
and it's one that we don't ask
early enough or often enough.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.870
So how would you
describe success?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.510
Is it OK to iterate for success?

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.810
Is it OK to fail
moving towards success?

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.950
And is it OK-- is there a
place for sure experimentation?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.010
Does everything have to fit
into the organizational goals?

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.680
Does everything have to be
efficient or be replicable?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.800
So where is that space
for experimentation?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.910
How much of that space
do we have in the life--

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.400
in the daily work that we do?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.566
So those are all the things
I started to think about

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:35.740
as we talked about how to create
a session around partnerships

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.190
and I'm going to turn it over t
I'm so grateful to have Sheryl

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.549
Dickey and Esme Carmelo here
from the Office of Clinical

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.220
Programs and Pro Bono Programs.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.200
Sheryl is a attorney
advisor, and Esme

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.150
is the faculty director of
HLAB, the Harvard Legal Aid

00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:00.940
Bureau, which works with
students and low-income folks

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.540
with access to justice issues.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.237
So with no further
ado, I'm going

00:09:04.237 --> 00:09:05.320
to turn it over to Sheryl.

00:09:09.128 --> 00:09:11.032
Thanks, Lisa.

00:09:11.032 --> 00:09:13.770
I'm gonna see if I could
just leave this here.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.240
Can folks see me if
I just stay seated?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.900
Terrific.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.260
So my name is Sheryl Dickey.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.330
I'm an attorney advisor with the
Office of Clinical and Pro Bono

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.510
programs here at
Harvard Law School.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.600
And for those of you who
are not from the law school,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:36.940
a big part of our program are
clinical and pro bono programs.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.770
Our clinics are
in-house clinics where

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.660
there are faculty supervisors'
offices here at the law school

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.390
representing clients on
a wide range of matters,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.280
from housing to transactional
issues to cyber law issues.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.950
And then we also
have a pro bono part

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:59.000
of our program involving student
practice organizations, where

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.340
we also have
practicing attorneys

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.900
who supervise students.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.370
But the students do it on a
not-for-credit, and pro bono

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.900
basis.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.260
Most Harvard Law
School students go

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.140
through one of our clinics
or our student practice

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.400
organizations.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.250
Typically, it's
somewhere around 80%.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.330
So one of the things that's
somewhat unique about Harvard

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:28.640
Law School is our students can
start practicing literally,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.750
say, four to six weeks
after they arrive here

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.850
through our student
practice organizations.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.730
You can't do a clinic until
you are a second year.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.510
But as a first year, you can
participate and not-for-credit

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.420
basis in one of these
organizations where you're

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.460
actually representing clients.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.290
And of course, you
always have supervision,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.540
but that's a huge leap
when you first arrive here.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.730
So one of the things that's
really been on our minds

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.091
through the Office of
Clinical and Pro Bono Programs

00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.090
and through the clinical
faculty is, what can we

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.700
do to equip our
students so that they

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.780
are-- they have the tools
to do that work effectively?

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.070
And one key piece of
that is making sure

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.200
they understand their
ethical obligations

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.440
and that as student
attorneys, they

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.330
have an obligation to
know what the rules

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.580
of professional conduct are.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.670
So the clinical faculty
had developed some content

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.670
to expose the students
to this material focused

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.960
on confidentiality,
conflicts, and competence.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.700
And the rules are many, but
these are just three core

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.520
obligations to give
them a sense of what

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.470
it means to be an
attorney and what

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.140
they have to do to
comply with these rules

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.080
and to think about just the
fact that they're entering

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.010
this profession and now
have this obligation

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.490
and accountability
that they didn't have

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.020
six weeks before they arrived.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.340
So we had, every year, an
online ethics tutorial.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.840
And that-- excuse me,
we had a live session

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.720
that focused on these
three core concepts.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.850
And the content was good.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.220
It was focused on
these three principles

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.610
that we thought were critical
to convey to the students.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.530
We had, typically,
three faculty members

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.630
who would volunteer
to do it every year.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.590
But we would have, say, 200-plus
students in a room Friday

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:29.480
afternoon, restless, not
particularly thrilled

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.880
to be at a mandatory meeting.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.590
The limitations of
a 200-person talk--

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.089
limited interactivity,
and for me,

00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:40.880
the turning point where
I thought we really

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.560
need to be doing
something different

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.360
is where one year we
banned phones in the room.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.300
Because everybody was on their
phone or on their laptops.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.254
And then, a few people
brought phones anyway.

00:12:55.254 --> 00:12:57.170
And so we had a conversation
afterwards, well,

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.030
what do we do about
those few people?

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.207
Do we intervene, interrupt?

00:13:00.207 --> 00:13:02.040
And then, I think we
just stopped and looked

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.970
at each other and said,
what are we talking about?

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.885
This isn't working.

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:07.760
The students are on
their phone for a reason.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.100
We can do better.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.330
Is there something
else we could try

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.600
that would be more
on-demand, interactive,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.370
something that we
don't know about

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.160
that we know is happening
elsewhere in the university

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.750
and there are people who
can help us figure this out?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.730
So we had the right
content but bad format.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.605
But we knew there was
a better way to do it.

00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:28.730
So we started reaching out.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.530
We reached out to the Ed School.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.550
We wrote a grant to HILT, one
of the-- a grant proposal.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.030
And we weren't funding.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.820
But it started a conversation.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.670
We had a valuable conversation
with the HILT team.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.320
And it brought us to Lisa.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.950
And that was the start of
that valuable partnership.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.670
So today, I just wanted to
share a couple of reflections

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.580
with you on the different
type of partnerships

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.860
that we developed to
make this tutorial work.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.610
And essentially, we had
those discrete partnerships

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.990
that Lisa talked about.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.610
And those were critical.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.780
But we also had ongoing working
relationships and working

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.060
partnerships, and I just
wanted to speak briefly

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.480
about two types of partnerships.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.379
In terms of staff,
in order to make--

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:15.670
what I didn't know when we
first started out-- in order

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.840
to actually make
this tutorial work,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.660
it involved so many different
entities to produce it,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.300
to build it, to maintain it.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.060
So for example, we worked
with media services

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.674
to do the videos.

00:14:29.674 --> 00:14:31.090
We have worked
with Communications

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.787
to have photographs
to put in the videos.

00:14:33.787 --> 00:14:35.620
We've worked for the
Harvard Training Portal

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.570
to host our actual--

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.840
our ethics tutorial.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.440
We've worked with IT to
stream the videos that

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.900
go with the tutorial.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.510
And all of those
discrete partnerships

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.270
have been invaluable.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.880
And even with the
faculty members,

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.160
we had-- we've
worked with a broader

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.810
team of faculty members.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.850
And we've had some
who have helped us out

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.140
with the street portions.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.710
They have done a talk, say,
on conflicts of interest.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.640
They prepared it.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.560
We videoed them.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.600
They reviewed it and
gave us comments,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.500
and then, they were out.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.280
And with all of those
partnerships, both on the staff

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.350
side and the
faculty side, people

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.270
brought expertise, a commitment
to quality, and follow through.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.950
And that made that successful.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.170
But the thing I was
thinking about--

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.170
what Lisa was touching on--
is these more substantive,

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.520
ongoing, working relationships
that we built with the library

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.100
and that we built with
a team of faculty,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.050
with Professor Caramello being
one of the core faculty members

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.600
to really be this
ongoing working partner.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.640
And what made the partnership
with the library work?

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.790
A lot of different things.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.150
One is because of
that unique expertise

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.220
that the library
brought through Lisa.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.110
There were so many
things that we

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.174
didn't know in terms
of basic things

00:15:57.174 --> 00:15:59.090
around teaching and
learning, even developing,

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.450
for example, the videos.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.180
We thought, we want to have
different faculty members

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.100
talking about different topics.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.980
And I thought we'd just
videotape the faculty

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.800
and include it in the tutorial.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.880
And she said, no, actually,
the research doesn't--

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.980
the research shows that
that's not the best way

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.790
to engage people.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.010
People tune out
after two minutes.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.800
The way you engage people
is you overlay photos,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.114
you overlay text so
that yes, you see

00:16:25.114 --> 00:16:26.280
the person at the beginning.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.820
You see them at the end.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.230
But you don't just make a
person watch a talking head.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.820
So there were things
like that, that I

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.330
felt like Lisa just brought
value that ways that

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.500
didn't even know--

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.020
the things that we didn't know
in terms of making this better.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.750
The library gave a deep,
long-term commitment

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:51.960
to the project in terms of
Lisa's time but also in terms

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.039
of just--

00:16:53.039 --> 00:16:55.080
originally, it started
out, I think, as a product

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.640
that would last a year.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.570
And frankly, it's gone on
for multiple years, which,

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:05.369
in addition to just that
commitment and time, Lisa

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:09.839
and the library brought drive
in terms of moving this forward.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.089
Professor Caramello
and the faculty

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.540
are focused on
managing their clinics,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.290
teaching, supervising,
representing clients.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.440
They cannot be the main
drivers of a project from start

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.660
to finish, from streaming videos
to images to closed captions.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.670
That can't be their role,
because they already

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.520
have many other hats
that they're wearing.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.490
So the library
brought resources.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.260
They were able to
tap into some funds

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.660
to allow us to do this
that we didn't have before.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.630
And they brought adaptability.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.590
This project had
fits and starts,

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.870
and it stalled at
different points.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.250
But the library adapted
to those changes,

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.400
adapted to our schedules,
and made that work.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.150
And as far as with the faculty--

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:05.020
and I will leave that to
Esme to talk more about.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.570
But Esme, in particular,
gave us things

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.390
that we could only have from
a faculty member in terms

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.760
of deep subject
matter expertise,

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.610
not only in the law but also
the program and the messaging

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.850
that we wanted to
convey to students.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.990
She and the team were very
flexible as our goals changed.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.790
And it wasn't easy
as it butted up

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.220
against her other
commitments and obligations.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.960
Faculty also brought a
deep level of understanding

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.750
of adult student learning.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.780
And always, it was--

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.320
I think I was struck
by a focus on tone

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.190
as far as speaking to students
in a collegial manner,

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.560
not in a finger-wagging
ethics, do this,

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.060
or you're going
to be in trouble,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.390
but in engaged, you are
entering a profession.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.890
Let me speak to
you as a colleague.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.500
And they really brought
that throughout in terms

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.760
of just that understanding
of how to speak to adults

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.460
and how to engage adults
in something along--

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.260
of this nature.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.420
I'll leave it to
Professor Caramello

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.140
to speak of some
of the challenges.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.410
But one of the things--

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.330
I think the biggest
challenge is you

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.980
don't know what you don't know.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.430
And in terms of what
something like this

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.840
actually takes, how
much resources, people

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.090
it takes to get something
under the ground, what

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.640
it takes intensive
schedule, and that

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.540
impacted in terms of the
roles in which faculty played.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.520
The last thing I want to
say is the role of students,

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.040
which I haven't talked about.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.490
Students, essentially, have been
one of our discrete partners

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.040
in terms of they gave us
feedback on the live training.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.240
This isn't working.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.080
So we took that feedback, and
we tried something experimental

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.930
in doing this On
My Ethics tutorial.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.440
We have an evaluation
built into the tutorial.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.900
This semester, we're going
to be getting their feedback.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.470
And the one question I have
after today's talks are,

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.280
is there a way that students
could play a different role,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.630
not just as discrete partners
giving individual feedback

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.760
on a tutorial, but
maybe, for example, there

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.760
are students interested
in teaching and learning

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.050
who can provide other
kinds of feedback

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.710
to last in a more ongoing,
substantial basis, when

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.450
we know so many
students here are

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.520
going to go on to law teaching.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.270
And perhaps it's a missed
opportunity to not engage them

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.240
in a more substantive way.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.212
Professor Caramello?

00:20:33.212 --> 00:20:35.090
Well, I'm more
comfortable standing,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.554
so I'm just gonna
stand for a second.

00:20:37.554 --> 00:20:39.720
You hit a lot of the things
that I was going to say.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.292
And I think a big piece
of it is the whole,

00:20:44.292 --> 00:20:45.750
you don't know what
you don't know.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.458
And I think that's
one of the things that

00:20:47.458 --> 00:20:50.700
interferes with the
formation of more

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.050
faculty-staff partnerships.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.040
So I came to this--

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.665
I practice at the
Legal Aid Bureau.

00:20:54.665 --> 00:20:56.790
I also teach a number of
classes at the law school.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.200
I teach affordable
housing law and policy.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.710
But I also teach professional
responsibility, which

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.380
is what we call legal ethics.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.186
And I came to this as a lawyer.

00:21:06.186 --> 00:21:06.810
I was a lawyer.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:07.893
I was a practicing lawyer.

00:21:07.893 --> 00:21:11.190
And I came here, and
I was very aware, very

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.930
humble about my
ability to teach.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.640
I don't know what
teaching looks like.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.289
I mean, I've been a
student, but that's it.

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:20.330
And I know there are all
these amazing resources.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.410
I mean, I am at
Harvard University.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.112
There's no question
that if anybody

00:21:24.112 --> 00:21:26.070
has support for teaching,
it's this university.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.320
But how in the
world do I use that?

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.370
And how do I access that?

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:30.940
What's even out there?

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.739
And my sense of what I
needed was also very diffuse.

00:21:35.739 --> 00:21:37.530
So it wasn't like I
had an idea, and I just

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.300
needed to find the
right person who

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.330
could fulfill my needs with
this idea that was well

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.770
formed that I had.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.087
So I think that's why I've
never really worked with Lisa

00:21:48.087 --> 00:21:49.170
and others on my teaching.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.360
And what was really
cool about this project

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.390
is that the project came to me.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.870
So was involved in
the initial idea

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.430
to do this ethics tutorial.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.500
But beyond that, the
idea of putting it

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.094
into an interactive
tutorial, I never

00:22:03.094 --> 00:22:05.010
would have gone near
that with a 10-foot pole,

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.750
because that sounds
totally intimidating.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.580
What if it's a failure?

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.050
I don't know.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.717
It could be corny.

00:22:11.717 --> 00:22:12.800
We brought it to the dean.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.271
She's like, oh, sounds
really corny to me.

00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:17.520
And so the whole guiding
principle in this whole thing

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.505
is not corny.

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:19.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.500
If it's not corny,
we have succeeded.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.107
So it was really staff,
including Sheryl,

00:22:26.107 --> 00:22:28.440
in the Office of Clinical
Programs; Lisa in the library,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.060
forming those
relationships, making--

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.976
coming up with the idea
and then coming to us,

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:35.250
as faculty members, for our--
and what faculty member doesn't

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.110
like to be approached
with the, you

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.690
are such a brilliant
teacher of legal ethics.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.400
You know so much about that.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.870
What we need is
someone who really

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:47.040
knows the subject that you
really know and can convey it

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.700
beautifully.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.020
So here is a camera.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.322
And just show up and tell us
about the things you know.

00:22:52.322 --> 00:22:53.280
So that's irresistible.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.744
So of course, I
jumped in, as did

00:22:56.744 --> 00:22:58.410
a number of other
faculty members, which

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.360
is also really cool.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.510
And then, we're
working as a team,

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.426
and we all get to know
each other really well.

00:23:02.426 --> 00:23:04.950
And we get to know
these guys really well.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.950
But from that experience,
I have taken away--

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.870
I mean, I have sat
in Lisa's office

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.910
with this editing
software, where

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.680
she pulls out these
things and says,

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.305
what if we put
this overlay here?

00:23:15.305 --> 00:23:16.680
And what if this
photo goes here?

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.030
And I'm going to
cut this, and I'm

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.220
going to make you talk
faster here and slower here.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.659
And so I'm like aware of all
these tools that I never--

00:23:22.659 --> 00:23:24.700
if Lisa said, would you
mind coming to my office,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.100
and I'm going to show you
some editing software?

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.720
I would be like, no,
my 13-year-old son

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.990
tries to do that
every single night,

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.823
and I'm like, I'm not
going to look at that.

00:23:30.823 --> 00:23:32.150
That's too boring.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.330
But I got pulled in.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.450
And so now as I'm going through
my teaching, I'm aware--

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.700
I'm thinking in a different
way about my own teaching.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.950
I'm thinking, how can I--

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.120
what am I trying--

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.131
what's the kind of
education that would best

00:23:45.131 --> 00:23:47.130
convey what I'm trying
to convey to the students

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.010
or best engage them in what
I'm trying to talk about?

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.820
And so now, I have exposure
to a whole new set of tools

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.010
and a whole new
set of people also.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.562
But the goal is not just
for me to know Lisa's there,

00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:00.270
for me to know Sheryl's
there, but rather

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.390
for me to know that the
different forms of teaching

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.630
are there and try and
think more creatively

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.350
and convey that to my
colleagues on the faculty.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.360
So one challenge, I think--

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.130
because this felt so
different than what

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.840
I would have typically
expected to be

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.630
like faculty-student-- or
faculty-staff partnership

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.424
on a teaching
thing, was the roles

00:24:22.424 --> 00:24:23.840
were not defined
at the beginning.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.880
I think we all just were
creating this thing together.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.570
And as a result, I
got very stressed.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.570
And I think we all got
very stressed, because we

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:32.790
were like, who's is this?

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.080
Who owns it?

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.240
And by the end, we
sort of realized

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.780
that we needed to decide who
was the project manager, what

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.420
was Sheryl's role, what was
Lisa's role, what was my role.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.400
And once we did all
of that, it felt good,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.940
and I think that allowed
us each to just fully do

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.940
our piece knowing that's
what we were there for.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.900
So I wish that we--

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.900
I think we all wish we
had had that conversation

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.672
at the beginning.

00:24:57.672 --> 00:24:59.880
And one of the things-- once
we were having that role

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.296
definition conversation, and
then this is the last thing I

00:25:02.296 --> 00:25:04.310
want to say--

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.160
Lisa-- I remember Lisa
saying, all right,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.130
it's OK if this does not work.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.310
That had not occurred to me.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.530
It's OK if this is
bad and does not work,

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.110
because we are experimenting
with something like totally

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.524
new and different and cool.

00:25:20.524 --> 00:25:23.190
And if we learn it doesn't work,
then we have learned something,

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.231
and it goes in the trash.

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:27.240
And no one ever wastes
four years on it again.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.550
And if it does
work, that's great.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:34.750
So I do think, not just as
a member of the faculty,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.620
not just thinking like,
I have this problem,

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.670
this teaching problem,
and I want to solve it,

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.503
so I need to find the
right staff member who

00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:43.780
can help me solve that--

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.610
but rather to think of
myself as a resource

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.340
and also to think about these
partnerships as opportunities

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.940
for experimentation to create
different kinds of teaching

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.630
and learning.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:57.088
So thank you, guys,
so much for that.

00:25:57.088 --> 00:26:00.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.299
No, you're such a great teacher.

00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:05.340
And now we know that Lisa
has four years to spend

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.030
on any of your projects.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:07.770
So I volunteer her.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.762
But it will work.

00:26:11.762 --> 00:26:14.980
So our second partnership
involves me and Dan Smail,

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.100
the Frank B. Baird Jr.
Professor of History

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.906
and the Chair of the
History Department.

00:26:18.906 --> 00:26:20.780
You'd much rather hear
from him than from me.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.655
So I'm just going to
say one minute of things

00:26:22.655 --> 00:26:26.820
quickly about how the Bok
Center works with faculty.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.010
Like any corny
motivational speaker,

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.930
I have two triads
I'm gonna run by you,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:35.160
and the first one is the three
ways that we work with faculty.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.280
The most traditional way
that we've done since 1975,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.430
since our founding, is the
one-on-one consultation.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.020
A faculty member
or any instructor,

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.395
graduate student
for that matter,

00:26:44.395 --> 00:26:46.920
comes in with some
sort of question,

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.750
with a syllabus they
haven't tried before.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:49.480
They're new to Harvard.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.330
They wonder what Harvard
students are like.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.220
They just need to talk
to someone for an hour

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.752
or for six hours.

00:26:54.752 --> 00:26:55.710
We're happy to do that.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.430
Our door is always open.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.190
And a lot of
longer-term projects

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.310
are born out of those
one-off consultations.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.050
So we do that often.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.720
The second way is
a lot more intense.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.180
It's through our learning lab.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.820
So this is a group of--

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.770
well, it's a roving
swarm of people

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.480
at the Center of
the- the Bok Center

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.210
that has about five
permanent staff and any time,

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.780
40 to 70 undergraduate
fellows and about 10 to 12

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.790
graduate fellows at any time.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.400
Basically, it's a
design and build studio.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.680
So an instructor comes in
and says, I have a goal,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.350
like teaching ethics,
or something like this.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.940
We take a deep
dive into thinking

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.220
about lots of different
ways that you could do that.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.220
We actually design three or
four prototypes of assignments,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.217
and we give them to the 40 to 70
undergraduate student testers.

00:27:39.217 --> 00:27:40.800
And we give them a
couple of readings,

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.080
so they kind of simulate
being in the class.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.890
And they give us great feedback,
and not just basic feedback as,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.210
well, this took me a long time.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.210
Or this was hard.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.540
But they work with us to
iterate that assignment.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.840
So the first eight students
end up doing the same version.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.917
We figure out it takes
too long, or there's

00:27:56.917 --> 00:27:58.500
an opportunity we're
actually missing,

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.570
we want to add another
piece to the assignment.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.150
Students 9 through 14
do that second version

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:04.900
of the assignment.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.300
So it's a really great way
of working to give students

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.050
in the real class
something that's already

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.060
been tested in advance,
which we probably

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.160
do too rarely in higher ed.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.590
And then, we have a
very strong commitment.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.620
We don't foist on
instructors anything

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.100
that we don't support live.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.310
So if students need
a hackathon to learn

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.962
how to do a little
bit of video editing

00:28:24.962 --> 00:28:26.670
to complete the
assignment to learn where

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.360
to hold their iPhone to do
that podcast assignment,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.895
we will run that hackathon
after hours with pizza

00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:34.110
if we need to--

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.950
whatever it takes.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.440
And then we have a commitment
to assessing, evaluating

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.810
how that thing worked at
the end, whether it worked,

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.540
whether it was a failure, what
it would need for the next go

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.360
around.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.860
The third way we
work with faculty--

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.320
and this is a newer
thing for us--

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.528
is to take that learning
lab on the road, in a sense,

00:28:48.528 --> 00:28:50.100
and to start doing
some residencies,

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.415
you might call them, with
programs or departments.

00:28:52.415 --> 00:28:54.540
We've been doing this a
little bit more with gen ed

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.081
and also with the
history department,

00:28:56.081 --> 00:28:59.280
just show up at a departmental
teaching retreat, for example,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.800
with a little bit of research
on how that department looks

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.100
and works, especially from
the student perspective,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.650
to try to work with the
critical mass of faculty

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.200
within that department to
help them think not just

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.800
about making their own course
good or three courses good,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.980
but to think about how that
department can start to speak

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.830
a language that is kind
of in internal alignment

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.399
to students about
what they'll learn.

00:29:21.399 --> 00:29:22.440
So that's my first triad.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.390
My second one is
the three languages

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.070
we speak at the Bok Center.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.840
One is evidence-based
pedagogy-- what

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.120
do studies of student
learning, psych studies,

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.000
cognitive psych studies tell us
about how students learn well?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.220
This really works
for faculty coming

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.130
from quantitative disciplines
who want to see a graph.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.902
And we believe firmly in
that and speak that language.

00:29:40.902 --> 00:29:41.860
The other way, though--

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.830
some faculty come
from disciplines

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.654
that think that
psychology is just

00:29:45.654 --> 00:29:47.320
another discipline
in William James Hall

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.070
and that their own discipline
has really deeply sedimented

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.400
knowledge about how
knowledge is structured,

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.964
about how students move from
being a novice to an expert.

00:29:56.964 --> 00:29:58.380
So for them, we
speak the language

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.910
of disciplinary expertise.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.530
Here's a sociologist.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.656
This is the three or four--

00:30:02.656 --> 00:30:04.071
these are the three
or four things

00:30:04.071 --> 00:30:06.121
that are probably really
important to that person

00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:07.620
that there are
really characteristic

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.046
of that discipline.

00:30:09.046 --> 00:30:10.920
How can we get them to
make those things more

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.040
transparent to students
by talking with us?

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.590
And the third language we speak
is the language of analogy.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.590
Right Faculty comes and
says, my group activities

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.874
aren't working very well.

00:30:20.874 --> 00:30:22.290
Rather than reinvent
the wheel, we

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.290
can actually look at places
in the real world outside

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.180
of Harvard where group work--

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.370
groups work effectively,
where it's crucial

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.870
that bridge stand because the
engineers worked well together.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.582
And so we try to bring that
into the classroom as well.

00:30:35.582 --> 00:30:37.290
Anyway, that's the
less interesting part.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.570
The more interesting part
is what a real life faculty

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.610
member thinks of all this.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.690
Well, thank you, Adam.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.320
And thanks to
everyone for coming.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.120
It's just wonderful
to see you all here.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:50.400
I wanted to follow very much
in the line of what Esme said

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.416
and just give you
a sense of what

00:30:52.416 --> 00:30:54.540
it's been like from my
perspective to have a chance

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.440
to work with people like Adam
and his team members at the Bok

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.580
Center.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.190
If you don't mind,
I'd like to begin

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.937
with a couple of
stories of things

00:31:03.937 --> 00:31:05.270
that I've used in the classroom.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.885
I graduated in 1994 and
moved out into teaching.

00:31:08.885 --> 00:31:10.770
And like most people,
I was thrown out there

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.240
with very little support at all.

00:31:14.917 --> 00:31:17.250
One of the stories I used to
tell to my medieval history

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.950
class--

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.850
the learning objective
was to get students

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.480
to try to understand
the power of the horse

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.280
people of the Asian steppes.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.891
And so I told them a story about
what a wonderful thing a horse

00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:30.390
was.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.940
Because when you're
traveling, it's

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.270
not only mode of transport.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.700
But you can milk the
mares to get milk.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.200
You can take blood out from
the horse in an emergency

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.340
and use it as nourishment.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.310
You can store them in
the sacks of stomachs

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.230
for a long, long period of time.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.480
You can press the
meat that you might

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.400
have between the saddle
and the horse flesh.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.950
And it kind of gets impregnated
with the sweat of the horse.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.330
And it's a beautiful,
tasty treat

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.016
that lasts a long, long time.

00:31:56.016 --> 00:31:57.390
The other story
I would tell them

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.520
was that was a totally
apocryphal story

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:04.080
about a famous viking who was
called "the children's man."

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.810
And the reason he
got this reputation

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.430
is that unlike
the other vikings,

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.410
he did not like to play
in the game where--

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.090
when you were
pillaging a settlement,

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.680
you would find a baby and
throw it up in the air

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.060
and see if you could catch it
on the point of your spear.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.560
Now--

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.280
--before I go any further
with this, do any of you

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.164
have any experiences of
revulsion to these stories?

00:32:28.164 --> 00:32:31.482
Not yet.

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:32.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.400
Now, I don't do this anymore.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.810
I haven't used these stories
for at least 12 years

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.390
for reasons that I'll
explain in just a moment.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.790
When I first began
teaching, I taught

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.070
by trial and error, which
meant I tried a lot,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.510
and I made a lot of errors.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.870
But one of the things I figured
out over a few years is--

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.230
this is something Gary King said
about emotional experience--

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.270
students learn really
well when something

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.910
happens inside their
bodies, when they

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.530
have an embodied experience.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.580
And I figured that out.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.750
And I used these deliberately
to disgust people,

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.850
because it worked.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.440
It got their attention.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.060
They snapped into focus.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.350
And then I would move
on to other things.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:19.260
And I would drop one of these
things every 10 or 15 minutes.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.810
So that was something
that was really--

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.250
I found really interesting.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:28.290
Now, this brings me to the point
of the first set of remarks

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.350
is that there is an enormous
body of pedagogical work--

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:35.010
research out there that already
knew, or has soon learned,

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.250
what I figured out on my own.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.440
And one of the great revelations
of having a chance to actually

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.170
get--

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.470
touch this experience
is that this is not

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.780
just K-12 research,
which is what I thought

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.340
it was back in the 1990s.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.940
This is stuff that
works on my students.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.130
And this has been a
real revelation for me.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.440
So things like this, I
actually learned about.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.690
This embodied
education is something

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.040
that I worked out for myself.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.602
I wouldn't have had to go
through all of the trial

00:34:02.602 --> 00:34:04.060
and error to figure
this out if I'd

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.580
been able to work
with someone who

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.198
was an expert in that field.

00:34:08.198 --> 00:34:09.989
And then the second
point I'm going to make

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.071
is that students change.

00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:13.570
The reason I don't
use these stories

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.400
anymore is the trigger
warning phenomenon.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.710
This is too much for students.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:21.850
I now do different things to
get them to move and experience

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:22.959
in some ways.

00:34:22.959 --> 00:34:25.000
Various forms of active
and interactive learning,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.958
for example, are the
kinds of things I use now.

00:34:26.958 --> 00:34:30.100
And I'm relying on experts who
know these kinds of things.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.870
Because there's so
many opportunities

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.719
out there to learn that I want--

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.260
know just want to pick up.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.664
So let me fast forward to the
other brief set of remarks

00:34:38.664 --> 00:34:40.330
I wanted to make,
which really has to do

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:43.320
with collaborative teaching.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.670
And when I do research
now, all of my research,

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.370
in some form or another,
is collaborative.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.059
I have-- I do it laterally.

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:55.600
I work with peers and colleagues
in fields that I don't know.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.370
And I rely on them
and their knowledge

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.470
to help me get to do
what I want to do.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.990
I also do generational
kinds of learning.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.670
I work with my former
graduate students.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.044
I work with my
graduate students.

00:35:05.044 --> 00:35:06.910
I work with my undergraduates.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.670
And we are all
researching together not

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.470
just because they're
working for me,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.560
but because they can bring
expertise to the table

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.750
that I don't have.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.350
And it vastly improves
all the things

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.730
that we can do as
a research group.

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.980
This applies
directly to teaching.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.380
And this, for me, has been
one of the great revelations,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.650
is that I don't have
to teach all by myself.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.230
For me, this happened
in 2012 when I first

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:37.480
began teaching a really active
learning-based type of course.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.760
This is in the context
of what soon became

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.960
with Ann Blair, the
digital teaching fellow

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.910
program for which we got
fantastic HILT support.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.300
And one of things
I discovered is

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.450
that I can use my students,
the graduate students that I'm

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.100
working with, to
help me figure out

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.990
how to teach better
and in particular,

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.310
how to bring things like--

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.456
Sheryl mentioned
phones in classrooms.

00:36:00.456 --> 00:36:02.830
How could I teach a class
where the computer's not banned

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.080
but is an integral part of the
way in which the students are

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:05.789
doing it?

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:08.080
And we did a lot-- we worked
on a lot of things, again,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.460
a lot of trial and error.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.550
But we learned a number
of amazing things

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.530
about things that work
well in classrooms.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.530
This is exactly
the kinds of things

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.990
that we are now building up
in the history department

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.270
working very closely--

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.410
Adam mentioned the teaching
retreat we had earlier.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:24.785
We're working with
the Bok Center

00:36:24.785 --> 00:36:26.920
to try to build up
all these resources.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.320
It's particularly important
as everyone shifts--

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.690
is going to be shifting
to the 75-minute teaching.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.390
Well, no one--no student wants
to sit there for 75 minutes

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.530
at a lecture.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.644
So what do we put in the
middle of the classes?

00:36:37.644 --> 00:36:40.060
There's lots and lots of faculty
in the history department

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.935
who want to know the
answer to that question.

00:36:41.935 --> 00:36:43.300
I'm sure that's true elsewhere.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.841
And then here's
finally just a coda--

00:36:44.841 --> 00:36:49.090
I was thinking about your
caddies and the pit crew.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.101
I really love the
idea of partnerships.

00:36:51.101 --> 00:36:52.600
I don't know if any
of you have seen

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.620
the research or
the comments that

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.720
have been made about the
growth of credits in movies.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.520
Have any of you ever
gone to the-- watched

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.460
the end of The Lord of
the Rings, the third one?

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.540
It goes on and on.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.520
You eventually
get the whole crew

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.280
of people who have been fans.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.290
Gandalf the Grey
figure's in there

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.080
if you're willing to
wait 20 minutes for it.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.180
But also, the growth of
acknowledgments in books--

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.550
we now realize that authorship
is a community project.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.670
And we can't do it, in
the case of teaching,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.636
without our partners.

00:37:24.636 --> 00:37:28.094
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:30.564 --> 00:37:33.244
We only have about 20
minutes left in the session.

00:37:33.244 --> 00:37:34.660
And we want to
give you the chance

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.500
to talk more to the
faculty and elaborate

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.980
on these asked
questions and so on.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.350
But we also want
you to have a chance

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.980
to do this activity
that we've set out.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.563
So if you look on
your table, everyone

00:37:44.563 --> 00:37:47.800
should have enough copies
of this large worksheet.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.190
You can fold and take it
with you if you'd like.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:55.330
Basically, you can see there's
a faculty side and a staff side.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.120
The idea is to
use this worksheet

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.520
as a kind of brainstorming
opportunity to think about

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.520
whether you are on the
faculty side or the staff

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.050
side of this chart.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.684
The worksheet kind
of prompts you

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:07.975
to answer a bunch of questions.

00:38:07.975 --> 00:38:10.184
[CHATTER]

00:38:12.108 --> 00:38:15.190
Obviously, there are a bunch
of questions to think through--

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:20.500
again, not what kind of products
and services can you offer

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.917
or what kinds of
things concretely

00:38:21.917 --> 00:38:24.416
do you necessarily need, but
what kinds of experiments would

00:38:24.416 --> 00:38:25.300
you like to conduct?

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.940
What are the things
that, maybe, you offer?

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.100
Say that the library
offers study space,

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.690
but that's not unique
to the library.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.731
But there are some things
that the library offers

00:38:33.731 --> 00:38:36.670
that are unique to
the library, and how

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.950
you might talk about and
think about internally

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.500
what you want to get out of
those things that you offer,

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.657
or as a faculty
member, that you seek.

00:38:43.657 --> 00:38:44.990
How long you'd like to do them--

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.350
if you'd like to enter into
one of these partnerships,

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.140
are you committing yourself
for the next 50 years

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.370
to supporting this kind
of student learning,

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.520
or is it something that
you're hoping to build once

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.440
and then will be
self-sustaining?

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.130
So we thought we'd give you
about 12 minutes or something

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.760
to start filling out your
side of the worksheet,

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.700
or if you're adventurous,
both sides of the worksheet.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.480
We hope that tables have some
mixing of faculty and staff

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.890
who can talk with each other.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.580
And then, we'll share
out with the group

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.190
what we've discovered, some
great answers that came out

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.630
of here so that you can
think about your roles

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:23.320
with some clarity and what
you have to offer each other.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.180
And if our faculty
volunteers don't mind,

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.110
we can circulate through
the room sort of like people

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.170
at a wedding and drop
in on your tables

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.950
and ask you how the filet mignon
is and things and chat with you

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.050
as you work.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.238
All right?

00:39:39.238 --> 00:39:40.630
[CHATTER]

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:46.230
OK, I think we're gonna start to
wrap up and think about like--

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.090
do you have-- as you're
having your conversations,

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.100
I think one of the things
I would like to see

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.690
is, what-- do you have any
questions for the faculty here

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.920
or the staff here about
what we were talking about,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.740
and observations about
filling out the form,

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.285
or just thinking about
filling out the form?

00:40:03.285 --> 00:40:03.785
Yes.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.540
I just wanted to share some
of the learnings from us.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:18.750
It prompted a conversation
about our vis-a-vis students.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.520
Do we have access?

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.290
Do we work through faculty?

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.360
And then because
some of us teach

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.570
in exec ed or
part-time learners,

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.660
the access questions
that you asked

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.120
are very different for
our different learners

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.400
in different programs
and at different levels.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.470
So I actually posed a question
that I've been thinking

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.010
a lot on, which is maybe not--

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.350
it's a little off
the slide over here.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:58.750
And it's there the relationship
between staff and faculty

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.680
in learning from each other.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.940
Faculty are staff.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.150
Staff are not faculty.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.470
And we're often tracked in
terms of our development

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:14.080
and our productivity
and our goals

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.880
that we achieve for
the university in very

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.210
different ways and for very
specific and important reasons.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.150
But at some point,
there will be an overlap

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.840
between, I could do my
job so much better if I

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.710
had a relationship or had
access to a faculty member,

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.900
some other part
of the university

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.390
that I could then
take that information

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.430
and help a faculty
member at the University.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:41.789
So it's this circular motion how
are we helping faculty develop

00:41:41.789 --> 00:41:43.830
new skills that they can
learn from staff to make

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:44.746
their teaching better?

00:41:44.746 --> 00:41:49.270
But how is staff are using and
being helped along the path

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.720
to gain insight and knowledge
from incredible, incredible

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.380
faculty to help them do their
jobs better to help incredible,

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.760
incredible faculty?

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.680
And so it's that kind of--

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.050
where are the projects
that are successful?

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.530
And how is that being used for
staff performance development

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.020
and staff learning goals.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.040
So as a staff member,
I'm incredibly

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.750
lucky to work at
a university that

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.011
cares about so many things, but
I'm also developing as a person

00:42:18.011 --> 00:42:18.510
as well.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.610
And so how do we make successful
relationships with projects

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:27.260
that work for faculty and then
how do we keep those in step

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:31.045
with a staff member's personal
professional development?

00:42:31.045 --> 00:42:33.170
And so those are the kind
of questions that I have.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.120
How do we build that in?

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.990
And how do managers and
faculty think about that or HRs

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.340
think about that?

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.410
So you're saying giving
staff more access to faculty

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.570
in other parts of the
university as part

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.310
of a professional development.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.577
In one way, this conference
is a really good example

00:42:52.577 --> 00:42:54.410
of that and one of the
few-- we were talking

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.720
about the few examples where
staff and faculty actually

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.760
get together in sort
of a non-work way.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.960
I think that is
really important.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.240
Do you guys have any
comments about any of that,

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.440
her access to faculty or?

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.320
Well, actually, I thought
your comments were fantastic.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.810
I think all I would add
from a faculty point of view

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.890
is that one of the things
I really value about staff

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:24.430
is that the staff are often, as
important nodes in a network,

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.650
are some of the major conduits
for the flow of information

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.480
laterally.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.530
And therefore, we
rely on them, which

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:35.240
I think also means that we like
that position to grow and build

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.760
and connect.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.500
And from my point
of view, I recognize

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.090
that that should happen.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.774
It is rewarding if it
does happen in that way.

00:43:44.774 --> 00:43:46.190
It really has to
do with something

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.689
I know Peter's been concerned
about for a lot of time, which

00:43:48.689 --> 00:43:50.510
is, how do we get
news to travel?

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:54.320
It doesn't necessarily
want to travel easily.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.410
I don't tell people
about sweaty horse meet,

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.700
but I talk about zombies.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.589
Because I say, we feed
on the brains of faculty.

00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:03.380
I trick every faculty
member into giving me

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.380
a grand seminar in whatever
their courses before I

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.630
figure out how to help them.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:08.838
This is a great way to do it.

00:44:08.838 --> 00:44:10.314
So is that how
[INAUDIBLE] starts?

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:11.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.370
So over the years, I've
benefited enormously,

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:19.250
enormously from ATG, from
Bill's help for many years,

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.170
from the Center for
Geographic Analysis and so on.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.780
But when it-- that
was sort of things

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.120
that I could use in a class.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.050
But when it came to transforming
the class as we moved

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:36.000
from electric class to a blended
learning to a flip model,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.570
we didn't have any guidance,
particularly, or help.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:40.560
We just thought we
knew how to do it.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.740
And as I was saying
the earlier panel,

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.060
it was a pretty bad experience.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:44.900
The students walked.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.580
They were unhappy and so.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.020
My question for you is--

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.260
for all-- for people
and Adam is, well,

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.810
if one really undertakes
a major experiment

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:59.480
in trying to transform a
major educational experience,

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.050
how long does it take?

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:06.650
And how do we sustain--

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:09.950
I understand that we can
sustain staff commitment

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.480
to some extent, to
a greater extent.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.330
How do we sustain
faculty commitment?

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:20.370
Well, for this particular
project, the Ethics 101--

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.044
Student Attorneys
is what it's called.

00:45:22.044 --> 00:45:27.030
It is an hour-long through
tutorial, online tutorial.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.610
And it's not a small thing.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.160
And it took a lot of
really deep thought

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.710
to think about how to transform
the in-person to the online

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.250
and to do it in the right way.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:42.020
For me, I think there were
a lot of stops and stars.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:47.940
And I just felt like this was
the best option for the goals

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.470
that they had stated.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:53.790
And I was really going to
keep going until we got there,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.430
because I just felt we
needed some kind of artifact

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.500
on which to decide
whether this truly

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.110
is better than the
in-person or better

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:02.710
than some other kinds of model.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.490
We couldn't ever really tell
until we got the artifact,

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:08.086
so I just kept pushing
until we got there.

00:46:08.086 --> 00:46:09.210
And we're very, very close.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.010
We're like a week away.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.910
As far as how to maintain
faculty interest--

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.665
Uh-oh.

00:46:15.665 --> 00:46:17.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.610
Well, I do think
that it's what Sheryl

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.680
was saying about the drive--

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.770
a lot of the drive coming
from Lisa and from Sheryl--

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.780
it's very true
that I kept feeling

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.220
like I was being pulled in.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.460
And I just had a sense of
like, I made this commitment,

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.840
and I've come this far.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.330
But I'm so glad--

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.460
so now looking back
on it, I would not

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.930
worry about it taking so long.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:44.880
But I also feel like part of
the resistance is we have to--

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.570
as faculty, I see other kinds
of innovations we're making,

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.612
including around implicit
bias in the classroom

00:46:51.612 --> 00:46:52.320
and other things.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.280
And there's just a
really steep hill

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.970
to climb to persuade
faculty that the teaching

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.570
methods they're using are
not the best ones out there

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.419
or that the thing--

00:47:04.419 --> 00:47:06.960
the specific thing that you're
proposing that's going to take

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.600
a long time for them to learn
and implement successfully

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.330
and may be a failure-- it
may not be the right thing--

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.640
to persuade them that
that's worth trying

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.740
and that it's better,
that specific thing

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.780
is better than the specific
thing they're doing.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.370
Because I can recognize
that what I'm doing

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.690
might not be 100%
the best thing.

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:23.523
But how do I know that
what you're proposing

00:47:23.523 --> 00:47:24.600
is even better?

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.850
So am I going to read
all the literature?

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.150
And so it's partly
sustaining the interest,

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.530
but it's partly just
the initial inertia.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.400
So I assume that what
you're doing already

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.760
is getting people who
have taken the plunge

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.722
and sending them on the
road to say, I loved this,

00:47:42.722 --> 00:47:44.430
and here's how my
classroom works better.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.304
And I think Harvard
Magazine and other places

00:47:46.304 --> 00:47:48.590
have done a great
job of spotlighting--

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.910
shining a spotlight on
specific teaching innovations,

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.410
including flipped classrooms
and having boosters.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.740
And then, you get a little
bored teaching the same thing

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.270
the same way over time.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:04.584
And so having these
opportunities to be led down

00:48:04.584 --> 00:48:06.000
a different path
and not just have

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.670
to walk down it
on your own is, I

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:13.910
think, the great thing
about being here.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.920
I am keenly aware that
we are the only thing

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.040
standing between you and lunch,
and that is a terrible position

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:19.760
in which to be.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.260
I'll enjoy the power
for one second.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.180
All right, now, I think
it's time for lunch.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.130
Let me just thank
my fellow panelists.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:28.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:32.500
And of course, thanks
to the HILT, the most

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.950
magnificent conference.

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:35.450
And thanks to all
of you for coming.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.950
So enjoy the lunch.
