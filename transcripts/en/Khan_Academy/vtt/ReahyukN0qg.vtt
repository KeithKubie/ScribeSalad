00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:03.157
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:05.561
Today I'm learning about
the Sixth Amendment

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.326
to the US Constitution.

00:00:07.326 --> 00:00:09.922
One of four amendments
in the Bill of Rights

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:12.143
that concerns the rights of the accused,

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:14.493
the Sixth Amendment guarantees defendants

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:19.147
in criminal cases the right
to a speedy and public trial.

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:20.678
To learn more about the Sixth Amendment,

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:23.030
I sought out the help of two experts.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.495
Stephanos Bibas is a
United States Circuit Judge

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:29.403
for the US Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit.

00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:32.696
He's also a leading scholar
of criminal procedure.

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:35.463
Jeffrey Fisher is Professor of Law

00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:38.951
and Co-Director of the Supreme
Court Litigation Clinic

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.784
at Stanford Law School.

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:44.249
So Judge Bibas, in the
case of the Bill of Rights,

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.233
the Framers were trying to prevent

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.762
particular abuses of the government,

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:52.822
so what was the historical background

00:00:52.822 --> 00:00:56.949
that led them to want to protect
these rights in particular?

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.883
- [Stephanos] In England in the late

00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:00.773
17th and early 18th century,

00:01:00.773 --> 00:01:02.920
there was a series of treason trials,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.205
other political trials,

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:06.312
and the king had done some things

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:10.854
that bypassed the usual mode
of trial in criminal cases.

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:13.543
The Anglo-American system
is known as the Common Law.

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:16.985
It involves live testimony in open court

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:19.256
before a jury of your peers,

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:21.302
and the jury ultimately decides

00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:23.106
did you do it, were you blameworthy,

00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:25.105
do you deserve the punishment?

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.726
The Crown had railroaded some
of its political opponents.

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:30.410
People like Sir Walter Raleigh,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.181
people accused in the Popish Plots

00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.194
during the strife between
Catholics and Protestants

00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:37.895
and some of these convictions were

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:40.681
later understood to
have been wrongful ones

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:45.146
and so the colonists in
England and then in America

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.441
insisted on protecting against various

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.942
ways of diminishing or abridging the trial

00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:52.783
that would be speedy,
that would be public,

00:01:52.783 --> 00:01:54.518
that would be before a
jury, that would have

00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:56.947
an evenly matched prosecution and defense

00:01:56.947 --> 00:01:58.362
and would have an opportunity to

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:00.837
look the witness in the
eye and confront him

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:02.863
the way it was always done in England

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:04.928
as opposed to on continental Europe.

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:06.385
- [Jeffrey] There's a varied history,

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:10.302
primarily in England of
certain periods of time

00:02:11.418 --> 00:02:14.389
where people were prosecuted in ways that

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.861
the Founders deemed fundamentally unfair.

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:22.059
Probably the most notorious
example was the Star Chamber.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.970
That was a moniker given to a king-run

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.631
tribunal decades before the Founding

00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:29.971
where people were picked up and arrested

00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:32.845
and then sentenced to criminal punishment

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:35.565
and sometimes to death without ever having

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:37.669
an opportunity to challenge
the charges against them

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:38.811
and sometimes not even knowing

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:40.643
what the charges were against them.

00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:43.427
That kind of a travesty of justice

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:45.817
and abuse of power was probably

00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:48.494
the foremost thing in the Framers' minds.

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:49.926
- [Stephanos] This was
partly for the benefit

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:51.426
of the defendant or the accused.

00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:53.507
It also was very importantly about

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:57.542
protecting the citizens' right
to control criminal justice.

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.741
That it wasn't the king who would do this,

00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:03.596
and the king couldn't just
let his royal officers off.

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:05.707
It's very important to look at

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:08.013
the Declaration of Independence.

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:10.353
A bunch of the complaints
in the Declaration

00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:15.036
are complaints that the king
is bypassing these usual modes,

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:18.819
that he's protecting his
soldiers by a mock trial

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.822
from punishment for
murders which they should

00:03:20.822 --> 00:03:23.373
commit on the inhabitants of the States.

00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:24.897
That he's depriving us in many cases

00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:26.964
of the benefits of trial by jury

00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:30.228
and that he has made the judges subject

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:33.074
to his manipulation and pleasure

00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:35.936
because they don't have stable salaries.

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.636
The colonists were very suspicious

00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:42.618
of the king's manipulation
of criminal justice.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.834
- [Kim] So how does the Sixth Amendment

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:48.352
inform how the US legal
system works today?

00:03:48.352 --> 00:03:50.265
- [Jeffrey] The first
important thing to understand

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:53.153
is that when the Sixth
Amendment was drafted,

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:55.581
just like all the other
first ten amendments,

00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:58.616
they applied primarily only
to the federal government

00:03:58.616 --> 00:04:00.514
not to state governments,

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:02.855
but in the sixties and seventies

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:05.528
the Supreme Court applied all of these

00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:08.288
rights one-by-one to the states.

00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:10.114
Now because the rights apply to both

00:04:10.114 --> 00:04:12.784
the federal government
and to state governments

00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:16.957
the Sixth Amendment
applies every single time

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.118
somebody is charged with a crime.

00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:23.785
That starts with knowing what
you're being charged with,

00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:28.680
whether it's by what's known
as a grand jury indictment

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.085
or some other method of accusing

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:33.120
somebody of committing a crime,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.358
and it continues on with the right

00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:39.608
to an attorney to represent the accused

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:42.268
and goes all the way
through the decision-making

00:04:42.268 --> 00:04:46.547
process with how the jury
decides whether to convict or not

00:04:46.547 --> 00:04:47.860
- [Kim] This is fascinating,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.600
but there are a couple things that I see

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.832
in the Sixth Amendment that seem like they

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:54.375
might be a little difficult to define,

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:58.126
particularly the idea of a speedy trial.

00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:01.240
What actually counts as speedy?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.073
- [Stephanos] The speedy trial

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:04.656
component is not well-defined.

00:05:06.123 --> 00:05:09.915
The Supreme Court has ultimately said,

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:12.512
"Well, we're gonna balance
a bunch of factors.

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:14.588
How long is the delay?

00:05:14.588 --> 00:05:16.531
What's the reason for the delay?

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:20.296
Has the defendant shown any
prejudice from the delay?

00:05:20.296 --> 00:05:23.214
How long did it take after the defendant

00:05:23.214 --> 00:05:25.568
requested the speedy trial?"

00:05:25.568 --> 00:05:27.595
Very rarely does the court actually

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:29.223
throw out a case based on that.

00:05:29.223 --> 00:05:31.569
What happens more often
is that the defendant

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.373
makes a request and then judges really try

00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:37.426
to push the case along to be faster.

00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:39.722
The court has turned it into really

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:42.640
focusing on the defendant's
interest in something fast,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.063
and that matters a lot when
a defendant doesn't make bail

00:05:46.063 --> 00:05:48.539
and is being held in jail pending trial.

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.439
Those cases will go to
trial in a matter of months.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.295
A case where someone is out on bail

00:05:55.295 --> 00:05:57.712
can easily take a year or two

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.954
before it ultimately proceeds to trial.

00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:04.400
- [Jeffrey] What's speedy
or what's reasonable in 1791

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.900
might not be speedy or reasonable in 2017.

00:06:12.047 --> 00:06:15.185
What the courts have said
with respect to speedy is

00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:18.056
there's not a bright line rule, say,

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:21.612
one year, five years, whatever it might be

00:06:21.612 --> 00:06:22.782
that somebody has to be brought

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.672
to trial after being charged.

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:28.578
Rather, what the court
does is it considers

00:06:28.578 --> 00:06:31.007
how diligently the prosecution

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:34.403
has tried to pursue the case
in light of other factors

00:06:34.403 --> 00:06:36.401
such as the complexity of the case,

00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:39.059
whether the defendant
himself wants the case

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:40.543
to go to trial soon or whether

00:06:40.543 --> 00:06:43.492
the defendant himself has
agreed to certain delays

00:06:43.492 --> 00:06:45.613
or said that he doesn't mind them,

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.884
and whether there's
prejudice that has occurred

00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:51.216
which is a legal way of saying whether

00:06:51.216 --> 00:06:54.044
somebody's been harmed
or injured by the delay.

00:06:54.044 --> 00:06:55.546
Say for example a key witness

00:06:55.546 --> 00:06:58.866
has now died or fled the jurisdiction.

00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:01.948
Flexible words like speedy in essence

00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:04.725
translate some measure of discretion

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.327
and flexibility to the courts.

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.421
- [Kim] Why is our legal process

00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:13.718
so much slower than it
was in the 18th century?

00:07:13.718 --> 00:07:16.696
- [Stephanos] That connects up to

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:19.097
the second set of rights we've constructed

00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:21.617
around what makes
something a public trial.

00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:25.168
One of the main things
there is the jury right.

00:07:25.168 --> 00:07:27.984
Juries in the 18th century,

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:30.102
we didn't have a jury selection process.

00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:32.626
The first 12 people who didn't know

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:34.539
the plaintiff or the
defendant or the victim

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.374
or whoever it was would be empaneled

00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:38.478
and they would serve
all day and they'd hear

00:07:38.478 --> 00:07:41.891
all the cases that came that day.

00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:44.901
You didn't have lawyers
involved in most of these cases.

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.817
Usually it was the victim against

00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:48.579
the defendant himself or herself,

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:53.079
no lawyer speaking for either
side, that was the norm.

00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:55.564
The defendant had a right to hire a lawyer

00:07:55.564 --> 00:07:59.417
but usually couldn't afford it and didn't.

00:07:59.417 --> 00:08:01.406
There weren't rules of evidence.

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:04.089
There weren't complicated motions.

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:07.120
There weren't technical jury instructions.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.418
The trials themselves took,
as I said an hour, two hours.

00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:13.679
Pre-trial proceedings did not
involve lots of legal motions

00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:15.057
'cause there were no lawyers to run them.

00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:17.512
The judges themselves often
didn't have legal training.

00:08:17.512 --> 00:08:19.493
There were no law schools in America.

00:08:19.493 --> 00:08:22.344
When you have a system like
that, it's not that cumbersome

00:08:22.344 --> 00:08:24.778
there's very little
incentive to bypass it,

00:08:24.778 --> 00:08:26.301
and you don't have professional lawyers

00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:28.854
who are looking to get this case done with

00:08:28.854 --> 00:08:33.063
and get on to the next case
or who have seen enough cases

00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:35.324
that they can bargain back and forth

00:08:35.324 --> 00:08:37.224
and strike a bargain for this case

00:08:37.224 --> 00:08:40.318
that's about where the
previous cases came out.

00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:42.312
You didn't have an incentive
for plea bargaining,

00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:43.183
it wasn't slow enough.

00:08:43.183 --> 00:08:44.829
You didn't have the experts

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:47.096
who it would take to run plea bargaining

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:50.183
and you didn't have the lack of investment

00:08:50.183 --> 00:08:52.466
in your own case that
makes plea bargaining

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:55.089
possible or the technical rules.

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:58.111
These cases actually all did go to juries

00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:00.144
and the expectation was
they all would go to juries

00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:03.374
and the jury right wasn't
just a right of a defendant,

00:09:03.374 --> 00:09:05.546
this happened in every
case 'cause the public

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:08.237
had a right to do justice itself

00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:10.115
as well as seeing justice done.

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:13.014
- [Kim] I have so many
questions about this.

00:09:13.014 --> 00:09:16.730
For one thing, do you
think our current system

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.280
is an improvement on this older system

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.619
of juries and not so much plea bargaining,

00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:27.619
and also why is there so
much plea bargaining today?

00:09:27.723 --> 00:09:29.945
- [Jeffrey] At the time of the Founding,

00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:33.801
there were no deals to be
made short of a full trial.

00:09:33.801 --> 00:09:36.086
That's a huge contrast with today

00:09:36.086 --> 00:09:38.550
where over 90% of criminal cases

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.861
in this country are not resolved by trial

00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:44.019
but rather by what's called a plea bargain

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:45.832
which is a defendant coming in and saying,

00:09:45.832 --> 00:09:49.512
"Look, I will plead guilty
to a lesser offense,

00:09:49.512 --> 00:09:51.399
or to the same offense you're charging

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:53.743
but with a guarantee of lesser punishment

00:09:53.743 --> 00:09:58.183
as long as you don't require
me to go through a full trial."

00:09:58.183 --> 00:10:00.284
The idea is, is that because the system

00:10:00.284 --> 00:10:03.968
has grown so large and
there are so many cases,

00:10:03.968 --> 00:10:06.187
that it's a relief to the prosecution

00:10:06.187 --> 00:10:07.744
and the court system not to have

00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:09.259
to have a trial in every case

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:11.783
and the benefit to the defendant is that

00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:13.465
he gets a slightly better deal

00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:16.768
or is able to plead to a lesser crime.

00:10:16.768 --> 00:10:18.746
- [Stephanos] Over the
course of the 19th century

00:10:18.746 --> 00:10:21.639
prosecutors are really taking
over most of these cases.

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:24.652
It goes from a few percent
to the lion's share of cases,

00:10:24.652 --> 00:10:26.616
and then defense lawyers get hired

00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:28.734
more and more to counteract that.

00:10:28.734 --> 00:10:31.199
Once you got prosecutors and
defense lawyers on both sides,

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:32.749
and the Sixth Amendment guarantees you

00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:34.626
the right to hire a defense lawyer,

00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:37.867
that's how it's understood in
the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:39.049
The prosecutors and defense lawyers

00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:42.150
develop rules of evidence
and they develop procedures

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.583
and jury instructions
and they argue motions.

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:48.361
They get more active and the judge

00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:51.056
gets more passive or reactive.

00:10:51.056 --> 00:10:53.060
The judge isn't pushing
the case along as much

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.128
and the prosecutor and defense
lawyer are slowing it down.

00:10:56.128 --> 00:10:57.572
That seems like it makes it fairer,

00:10:57.572 --> 00:11:01.066
but once it gets to a
certain point of being slow

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:03.396
the prosecutors wanna
get rid of the cases,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.671
they have too many of them.

00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:06.628
The judges, they have a bunch

00:11:06.628 --> 00:11:09.012
of civil cases they need to get rid of

00:11:09.012 --> 00:11:10.596
and so the prosecutors and the judges

00:11:10.596 --> 00:11:12.464
and the defense lawyers all get together

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.834
and find ways to bargain the case away

00:11:14.834 --> 00:11:19.071
rather than spending, now it's
days on each case for trial.

00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:21.434
From their point of view it makes sense.

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:24.619
They have a faster system
and everyone goes home happy

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:26.296
and the prosecutor can pursue more cases

00:11:26.296 --> 00:11:28.655
and the defendant gets a lighter deal

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.047
but the prosecution makes sure

00:11:30.047 --> 00:11:32.000
there's some conviction and sentence,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.684
but from the point of view of the public,

00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:34.995
the public doesn't see justice done

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:37.883
and the public doesn't
trust these plea bargains.

00:11:37.883 --> 00:11:39.645
At the end of the day, what
the defense lawyer's mostly

00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:41.637
doing is not making sure there's a speedy

00:11:41.637 --> 00:11:43.379
and public trial but bargaining

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:47.458
95% of cases away before there's a trial.

00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:50.166
- [Kim] What happens if the defendant

00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:52.583
can't afford a legal counsel?

00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:55.837
- [Jeffrey] The history
of the right to counsel

00:11:55.837 --> 00:11:57.403
is actually one of the more interesting

00:11:57.403 --> 00:11:58.716
components of the Sixth Amendment

00:11:58.716 --> 00:12:01.731
because many of the components

00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:04.446
have deep roots in the history of England

00:12:04.446 --> 00:12:06.548
and so were rights that Englishmen

00:12:06.548 --> 00:12:09.915
enjoyed for many, many years before

00:12:09.915 --> 00:12:11.734
they were brought over to the colonies

00:12:11.734 --> 00:12:14.574
and became part of our
Constitution of the United States.

00:12:14.574 --> 00:12:15.724
The right to counsel is a little

00:12:15.724 --> 00:12:18.068
bit different in that respect.

00:12:18.068 --> 00:12:21.661
Criminal defendants in
England and other countries

00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:23.690
around the time of our founding

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.646
often did not have a right
to counsel of any kind

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.804
whether they could pay for it or not.

00:12:28.804 --> 00:12:32.815
This was a bit of an innovation
on the part of the Framers,

00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:35.445
recognizing that all of the other rights

00:12:35.445 --> 00:12:38.751
they were identifying to
defend yourself in court

00:12:38.751 --> 00:12:40.848
might not amount to
much if you didn't have

00:12:40.848 --> 00:12:42.429
expert assistance or at least the right

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.621
to obtain expert assistance.

00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:46.801
- [Kim] You've described a lot of changes

00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:50.432
to how our legal system
works over the years.

00:12:50.432 --> 00:12:52.750
What do you think would
have surprised the Framers

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.876
most about how our legal
system works today?

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:58.757
- [Stephanos] I think they
would have been shocked

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:02.403
that a system that was meant to slow down

00:13:02.403 --> 00:13:06.592
and check governmental power
and protect overreaching

00:13:06.592 --> 00:13:09.190
and protect the people's role,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.870
has been so subverted that the people are

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.787
involved in a few percent of cases.

00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:17.662
They designed a system that's slower

00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:19.900
and less efficient by design than

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.207
the criminal justice system
of continental Europe

00:13:22.207 --> 00:13:25.810
because they were worried
about the king and the Crown

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.276
pushing around citizens
and abusing their power.

00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:32.684
They wanted grand juries to
authorize every criminal charge.

00:13:32.684 --> 00:13:36.125
We've largely gotten
around that in most cases.

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:38.436
They wanted petty juries to ensure

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:40.592
that every prosecutor's
charge was justified

00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:42.528
and that the legislature's criminal laws

00:13:42.528 --> 00:13:44.216
weren't being applied too broadly.

00:13:44.216 --> 00:13:47.576
Again, prosecutors now
have so many threats

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:49.623
and tools and sentences that they can make

00:13:49.623 --> 00:13:53.131
almost everybody give up
their jury trial rights,

00:13:53.131 --> 00:13:55.138
but the Framers also weren't dealing with

00:13:55.138 --> 00:13:57.256
the volume of cases we're talking about,

00:13:57.256 --> 00:14:00.086
and they weren't focused
primarily on the violent crimes.

00:14:00.086 --> 00:14:03.119
The federal crimes they
were dealing with were

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:06.118
seditious libel,
criticizing the government,

00:14:06.118 --> 00:14:07.712
violations of the revenue laws,

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:10.113
so it's also fair to point out

00:14:10.113 --> 00:14:12.648
that they did not expect that these rights

00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:15.353
were mainly gonna be
limitations that benefited

00:14:15.353 --> 00:14:18.661
people in rape and murder cases.

00:14:18.661 --> 00:14:20.522
A lot of these protections
are mainly designed

00:14:20.522 --> 00:14:23.252
to make sure that the innocent people get

00:14:23.252 --> 00:14:25.709
vindicated against unjust charges.

00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:27.862
They might be a little bit surprised

00:14:27.862 --> 00:14:29.256
that almost all the litigation

00:14:29.256 --> 00:14:33.194
is by people who may be factually guilty.

00:14:33.194 --> 00:14:34.876
- [Jeffrey] The next thing
that would have surprised

00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:36.884
the Framers a great deal, I think,

00:14:36.884 --> 00:14:39.384
is the role of the jury today.

00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:43.306
The jury trial right mentioned
in the Sixth Amendment

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:45.990
is actually one of the only things

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.882
mentioned twice in the Constitution.

00:14:47.882 --> 00:14:50.091
The right to a jury trial
is actually mentioned

00:14:50.091 --> 00:14:54.362
in the body of the Constitution
itself in Article Four,

00:14:54.362 --> 00:14:56.158
then it's mentioned again
in the Sixth Amendment.

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:58.703
The reason why is because
the jury were truly

00:14:58.703 --> 00:15:01.487
the people's check on the court system

00:15:01.487 --> 00:15:05.957
and in particular on
the prosecutorial power.

00:15:05.957 --> 00:15:09.957
Serving on a jury, to the
Framers, was an honor.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:16.244
It was an act of deep political
participation and meaning.

00:15:17.714 --> 00:15:19.836
In a way that we joke
about jury service today

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.601
as being something of a nuisance,

00:15:21.601 --> 00:15:23.916
they viewed it as almost as important

00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:26.516
as voting for the
president on Election Day.

00:15:26.516 --> 00:15:28.047
- [Kim] By guaranteeing speedy

00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:31.874
public trials by jury
and due process by law,

00:15:31.874 --> 00:15:34.616
the Sixth Amendment ensures that citizens,

00:15:34.616 --> 00:15:38.239
not the government,
control criminal justice,

00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:41.742
but today as Professor
Fisher and Judge Bibas note,

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:44.195
the Framers might be
surprised to learn that

00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:46.696
due to the rise of plea bargaining,

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:51.036
only a small percentage of
cases go to trial by jury,

00:15:51.036 --> 00:15:52.950
circumventing this process.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.872
