00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.630
 Hi, Internet, 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.450
 Recently, YouTube invited me to California for a very interesting party with a bunch 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.379
 people. They talked a lot and played with the balloons, but most of all, there was a debate about how it might look 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.119
 the future of education - which is no small thing, because how the company educates its next 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.430
 the future of human civilization determines the generation of scientists, doctors, and programmers. 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.310
 It was amazing for days. And, though disorderly, I would like to share with you a few 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.500
 my thoughts on the subject. And as someone who taught both in schools and beyond. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.330
 This is what schools always looked like: a lord in front who knows everything 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.230
 and students who know nothing, so the gentleman is telling them. 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.600
 But the teacher explains the pace that suits one student. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.380
 All others are bored because they have long since understood or are lost, 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.970
 because they lack the knowledge they should already have. 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.149
 At the end of the lesson, no matter whether the students understood the substance, with others 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.989
 and another substance. 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.890
 And it doesn't matter if the teachers use chalkboard, felt-tip pens or smart board, and whether students 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.829
 use tables, paper or tablets - the system does not change - it just 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.780
 technology does the same in shiny form. 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.909
 But the internet is different and in the background there are interesting things that happen 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.520
 indicate the direction in which education will evolve. 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.619
 In an ideal school, every student has a lecturer like Alexander the Great 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.340
 Aristotle. 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.810
 But if your educational policy is "Aristotle for Everyone" then you have three 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.479
 problems: 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.689
 1) There are not enough people in the world to teach each child individually, and if they are, 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.179
 it would be incredibly expensive. If workforce and money were not a problem, 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.189
 it remains the fact that not everyone is as good a lecturer as Aristotle. 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.229
 But technology solves these problems: let's start with 1: 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.459
 Who needs people when everything can teach you the internet? 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.509
 You want to learn integrals: so start. 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.619
 Do you need a biology course? Try this one - along with hundreds of thousands more 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.119
 students. 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.329
 The Internet is significantly expanding the audience of potential teachers and solving the problem of working 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:54.779
 forces. 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.270
 But it is not the celebration of the internet that I have just complained about: new 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.310
 technician does old stuff, just looks better? After all, if you grew up in front of the Internet 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.329
 and you were a little curious, there was always a place where you could learn everything you wanted. 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.890
 In addition, radio and television were thought to be a revolution in education. By 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.580
 that allows teachers to reach the masses. But the revolution did not come. 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.860
 These are good objections, but the Internet is much better off solving the cost problem 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.040
 than radio and TV. 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.700
 TV shows are expensive, and even the best ones are often pushed out by more stupid and 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.110
 more popular shows that are also - not by chance - more profitable. 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.950
 This is known as the "History Channel" effect. 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.450
 But the cost of internet access is constantly falling, as is the cost of producing content 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.580
 for the Internet. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.020
 Which is why a paper guy and a marker in his room can reach a million views 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.840
 per month at essentially zero cost and does not have to worry about competition from the side 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.530
 this. 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.060
 So the internet solves problems one and two, but educational videos aren't 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.430
 individualized, which makes YouTube just a video library and not an Aristotle-style tutor. 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.050
 But we can build on YouTube, the future I see as follows: Digital Aristotle pro 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.610
 everyone. 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.220
 A program that teaches students individually by selecting videos from YouTube, 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.280
 a program that tests students based on what they already know, and especially the program they do 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.390
 it adapts the teaching according to how effective the videos and tests are 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.990
 and scientifically verifying which work best. 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.040
 It's not a utopia. Already there are people who work on different aspects (even though Digital Aristotle 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.790
 is not their explicit goal). One such place is the Khan Academy, which is more than 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.790
 only Sal's calming voice. "If you're not paf from this, then you have no emotions." For 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.600
 this website hides complex software testing everything about student progress: 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.380
 the effectiveness of different videos and tests, different ways of asking questions. 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.480
 Today it may seem primitive, but technology is constantly improving. Up to Digital Aristotle 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.750
 it will be cheaper, less laborious and better than human teachers can ever 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.220
 be. 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.680
 I often hear the argument that Digital Aristotle (or something like that) frees teachers who 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.880
 they will be able to walk through the classroom and help children work on interesting projects - and even though 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.209
 this may happen in the near future, I don't think it would be true in the longer term. 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.319
 Because what happens when Digital Aristotle knows students better than a teacher? When 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:25.389
 in every field of human activity, the best and brightest can go on 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.749
 on the way of knowledge, and better than a teacher could ever have? 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:33.150
 I doubt that schools will disappear - after all, they're not just here for learning but also 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.249
 They allow parents to engage in the economy while their children are transformed 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:42.599
 to civilized adults. But schools will change radically - there will be fewer teachers in them 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.270
 who will do less and less. 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.479
 This is not good news for teachers, but it is a great news for the company. 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.400
 If you are now a student with poor results, the school goes on without you, and if you excel, 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.389
 school is holding you back. 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.990
 In my opinion, everyone in the future will use Digital Aristotle throughout their lives - a personal tutor, 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.789
 who will teach them exactly what they need to learn and when they are best prepared. AND 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.999
 when it comes, we will have both - a better education system and a better society. 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:19.289
 I want to thank YouTube EDU and the people who have led him to invite him to California 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.529
 to meet these amazing people. I've done more interesting interviews for several 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.069
 than I normally do in a few months. 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.379
 If you want to see what the best educational videos look like, go and see their channels 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.539
 and if you want to hear more, I put together a playlist on the subject 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.160
 you might like.
