1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,883
Number two.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,390
I hear, I hear the sound
of a telephone. Hello. Hi.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,750
Bodies Assembly. A story from
Greg Warner. Yes. Hi Jed.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,090
Greg is a NPRs east African
correspondent. You are in,

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,650
what time is it where you are? It's
um, it's evening is based in Nairobi,

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,610
around seven 30 in the evening,

7
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:23,500
which is embarrassing cause I just
told you good morning in Swahili. Um,

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,180
but I forgot how to say. Good
evening. So, oh, okay. So Greg,

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,370
I mean we were just, uh, anyhow,

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,140
we called Greg up because he had written
this article for this great website

11
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:40,760
called transom.org about being a foreign
reporter and working with translators

12
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:43,400
and all the mishaps, you know, when you
have to go from one language to another.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,500
But there's actually a really good example
that I didn't use in the piece about

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,030
the failures to communicate. I can tell
you that story. Sure, sure. Yeah. So,

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,090
so there's this word and you wouldn't
think of it as untranslatable,

16
00:00:55,091 --> 00:01:00,070
but it's the word
serious. And when serious,

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,970
serious, serious, like S.
E. R. I. O. U. S. Okay. Um,

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,530
in my experience when you hear this word
serious in east Africa does not mean

19
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,020
solemn or thoughtful or stern.

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,730
It actually almost never has
something to do with your mood,

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,610
but serious tends to mean is,

22
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,720
are you just talking to
me or are you serious?

23
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:27,580
Are you doing something? And usually
doing is like some kind of transaction,

24
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:31,660
usually financial. I've been asked
by many east African officials,

25
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,010
are you going to be serious
with me? And it obviously means,

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,540
are you going to pay me a bribe?

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,020
Usually I pretend to misunderstand
that that key moment I said, yes,

28
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm a very serious international
journalists and um,

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,330
but the story that I want to tell you,
uh, took place a couple months ago.

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,410
Good afternoon everybody. Um,

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm really pleased to be back
in Africa. Secretary Kerry,

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Addis Ababa visited Ethiopia and city
have enormous energy and the country.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,340
Few days before Carrie's visit,

34
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:07,780
nine journalists had been arrested under
this relatively recent anti terrorism

35
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:11,650
law that basically says that any
criticism of the government is illegal.

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,700
I had a series of very productive meetings
this morning with my foreign minister

37
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:19,480
counterparts and secretary Kerry
was giving this press conference.

38
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:24,481
I shared my concerns about a young
Ethiopian blogger that I met last year,

39
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,240
uh, [inaudible] who, uh,

40
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,390
with eight of his peers
had been in prison.

41
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,570
And I firmly believed that
the work of journalists,

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,710
whether it's print journalists or in
the internet or media of other kinds,

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,800
it makes societies stronger.

44
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,560
You know, he said all the things you'd,
you'd expect him to say. He said, um,

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,820
we believe that free speech and open
dialogue is important to the economic

46
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,950
development of a country,
blah, blah, blah. But

47
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,510
we remain committed to our partnership
with Ethiopia, with [inaudible].

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,930
This comment was also wrapped up in a
lot of praise of Ethiopia engaged, and

49
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,340
I'd be delighted to
answer a few questions.

50
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,900
I'm not sure how that's even do that.

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,790
Then keep time for questions.

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,530
He could took some vetted questions from
the Ethiopian journalists to more from

53
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,330
the traveling press and
to carry [inaudible]

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,350
credit. Are you all give this
gentleman? I want to give them a shot.

55
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:16,280
I know he was very impatient. I'm going
to sort of wait for, he left the podium,

56
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,530
he was like, you know what, we're
just going to try something different.

57
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,610
We're gonna like call on
an Ethiopian journalist.

58
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,220
I want to make sure we get
a fair distribution here.

59
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,410
Kerry pointed this one guy in the
second row, young guy in his twenties,

60
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:32,220
boyish face wearing a [inaudible]. I
have only two questions for you, sir.

61
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,620
I may have invited the hardest question
of the day now, but one question.

62
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,700
Fair enough. Okay,

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,360
so let me choose. Uh,

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,850
you have raised the issues of uh,

65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,000
Nathanael's [inaudible] who is
a blogger and his friends. Yeah.

66
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,540
In Mark 11, and then this guy's like,
well, every time a journalist is arrested,

67
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,750
the u s gives a statement about
this, but these things are,

68
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,150
this keeps happening, repeated,
repeating. Very much so.

69
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,590
Then he asks his question,

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,160
is it lip service or are you
seriously concerned about Zerorez?

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,070
Is this lip service or are
you seriously concerned?

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,380
[inaudible] at this point, everybody's
just not looking at Carrie.

73
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,090
They're all looking at
this journalist too.

74
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,500
Obviously had to take considerable
personal risks in a place like Ethiopia.

75
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,220
In a crowd of journalists, including
state run TV stations. He's,

76
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:30,540
this guy's on camera asking this extremely
sensitive question about the arrested

77
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:34,990
journalists. We really demand a
genuine answer from you. Thank you.

78
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,440
And Carrie looks at him

79
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,600
like, well, you got to be kidding.

80
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,560
When I stand up in public and I,
and I, and I say something, uh, I,

81
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,420
I try to be serious about it and I
think the fact that I'm doing that is

82
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,254
serious.

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,570
And when I raised him by
name in my comments today,

84
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,290
I can't, it sounds to me like he's sort
of insulted by the question. And so,

85
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,820
so remember serious,

86
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:10,200
the word serious in east Africa can be
translated very much as are you doing

87
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:14,400
something preferably like a
financial transaction, right?

88
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,560
And so what this journalist is saying is,

89
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,230
are you just talking about this or are
you doing something maybe threatening if

90
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,550
you be with a withdrawing aid or
withdrawing support? And Carrie says,

91
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,710
I am very seriously talking about that.

92
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,110
We have previously called for the
release, uh, these individuals.

93
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:37,190
And that is the policy of our
government. And it's a serious policy.

94
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,370
Thank you. Thank you all
very, very much appreciate it.

95
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,320
And it seemed to me maybe,
you know, you can judge,

96
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,660
but it seemed like he
was almost like, look,

97
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,690
I'm like the most serious
politician that's out there. I mean,

98
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,750
I lost the presidential race in 2004 in
part because I was deemed too serious by

99
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:57,560
the American public, you know,
like, what are you accusing me of?

100
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,390
Not being serious.

101
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,410
We put in a number of requests to speak
to John Kerry or someone in the State

102
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,580
Department, but there was no response.

103
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,880
Do you think he was aware of the
misunderstanding who carry this? Uh,

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,300
this felon? Oh yeah, no, no. I followed
him out afterwards. Hey, minute, minute.

105
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,990
Can you pronounce your name
for me? My name is [inaudible].

106
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,710
He's a easy young guy in his twenties
he's an independent journalists. Yeah.

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,580
I used to work in different newspapers
and I was like, you know, when you,

108
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,650
when you listen what happened there?

109
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,070
And I almost felt like I
had some kind of cultural,

110
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:34,460
a guide maybe because that Americans
think serious means I'm standing here.

111
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm not joking, I'm serious.

112
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,880
But when African spacey series and
I'm using a generally they say no.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,340
Are you going to not just speak?
Are you going to do, yeah.

114
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,410
[inaudible] that's exactly my point.
Are you going to take sanctions?

115
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:52,940
Maybe [inaudible] yeah. Do you feel
that that question puts you at risk?

116
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,250
Maybe. Who knows?

117
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,910
Is that is a job description doing
good journalism Muni tape yet.

118
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,820
Thanks so much. Thank you. Yeah.
I'll give you a call. Give me a call.

119
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,050
My number is on there. Yeah,

120
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,100
so that conversation was
about five months ago.

121
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,820
Did do you know what his fate at all?
Let me have you found out why there?

122
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,280
Did he suffer for this
question in any way? No,

123
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,440
but I have his phone number so I
can give him a call and find out.

124
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,570
Hello? Hi [inaudible]. It's Gregory,
Gregory Warner. Oh, good ego.

125
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm good. I'm good. Sorry.
I reached him by Skype.

126
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,680
He told me that actually after that press
conference he did get strange calls to

127
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,310
his home and some Facebook messages from
people who didn't know telling him that

128
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,200
he better rethink what he said.

129
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,480
Yeah, they are lying.

130
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,280
Not Too with the current
government direction and that

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,030
they said you should line up
with the government's priorities.

132
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,510
These messages were from the
government. It's hard to tell.

133
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:59,511
It has been reported that this Ethiopian
Anti Terrorism Task Force will wage

134
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:03,480
social media attacks by getting
people to send messages on its behalf.

135
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,380
[inaudible] John PK reason,

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,320
the task force are the ones that
seem to these kind of [inaudible]

137
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,860
and were they threatening? Yeah,

138
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,860
some of them were, you know,

139
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,210
[inaudible] that I would be punished
accordingly when the train comes and it

140
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,033
might come one day

141
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,950
the newspaper he founded got shut down
after publishing one issue and he was

142
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,140
planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi.

143
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:30,890
[inaudible]

144
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,520
leave his wife and kid behind and
then maybe return grabbed them,

145
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,110
apply for asylum in the United States.

146
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,601
You know,

147
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:41,601
my mother and my older brother
