00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, we just mentioned a bunch of terms that you may not be familiar with.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.644
Visual cortex, occipital lobe, motor cortex, frontal lobe and motor and sensory

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:14.724
neurons. Don't worry. The rest of this lesson we will elaborate and discuss

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:19.406
these important parts of the brain. We will start with the smallest unit of

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:23.053
communication, the neuron. And then, discuss different kinds of neural

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:27.010
chemicals that make different experiences and different actions possible.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.830
Finally, we will learn all of the major brain structures and their function.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.860
The nervous system is comprised of cells. Which is what we will look at next to

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.099
see what the building blocks of the nervous system are.
