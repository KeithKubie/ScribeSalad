[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:33.100
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Thank you very much.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.150
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.490
It's almost evening.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.890
It's a pleasure
to be back at MIT.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.740
It's always a pleasure to
be back in the Boston area

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.570
because this is
where we first lived,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.680
when my family and I came to
the United States in 1957.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.700
In fact, we arrived
here September 17, 1957.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.636
My dad came as a visiting
professor to Harvard

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.260
from the American
University of Beirut.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.629
And then Harvard said,
stay another year stay,

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.170
another year.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.600
He never went back.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.730
So I enrolled at
Boston University.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.260
My dad then moved to NIH.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.210
Both my parents
are deceased now.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.400
But the Boston area
is very special to us

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.200
because it was the
first place that we

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.490
lived in this great and
wonderful country of ours.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.410
And then, I'm very,
very happy to be back

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.260
as a guest of Professor Lippert,
and the students in his class,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.000
and the colleagues.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.363
And I promise you a good
time, if you pay attention.

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:24.229
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:27.810
So what I really
would like you to do

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.210
is sit back and
relax because I'm

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.630
going to share with
you, to begin with,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.390
some important convictions
about what it is that we do

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.350
in science and why we do it.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.540
I wish I had more
time to go in depth.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.400
But I just want to go
quickly through some

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.370
of these convictions
that I hold very deeply.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.999
So let's see if this
is going to work here.

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.040
I want to see your faces.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.540
OK.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.130
I can still see your faces.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.750
So Science is Fun and
the Joy of Learning.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.320
That's the title
of my presentation,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.440
Science is Fun and
the Joy of Learning.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.960
And every word is
carefully selected.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.040
You know, English is
my second language.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.810
So I think about every
word and its meaning.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.760
I also want to say that
it's a pleasure for me

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.900
to see some old friends here,
but also to make new friends.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.190
And to see someone who
watched me in Singapore, when

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.437
I was in Singapore--

00:02:27.437 --> 00:02:28.020
Where are you?

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.910
Right there, yeah, yeah--

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.320
about three years ago.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.670
So welcome.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.040
So what I'd like to
say to you immediately,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.750
that your brain
and my brain will

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.720
be different after
this presentation,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.820
if you pay attention.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.750
If you don't pay attention,
I can't do much about it.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.930
But both my brain and your
brain will be different.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.040
35, 40 years ago, when students
went to medical school,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.880
they were told that
the brain is an organ.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.200
It doesn't change very much.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.890
But now we know more.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.910
Through the neurosciences,
we know a lot more.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.280
We know about plasticity.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.890
In fact, changes in
the brain happen.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.090
That's what education
is all about.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.290
That's what learning is about,
if those changes were not

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.560
happening.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.210
So I just want to share with
you the importance of being

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.430
focused and paying attention.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.150
We live in the most advanced
society in humankind.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.610
And these advances are
due to advances in science

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.580
and in technology.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.360
I want you to think of
this statement I just made.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.610
Everything we enjoy
now is the result

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.430
of advances in science
and in technology.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.890
The advances are so
great, much greater

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.380
than we knew 50 years
ago when I first

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.100
came to this country,
or a hundred years ago,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.150
or 200 years ago, or 500 years
ago, a thousand years ago.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.400
A long time ago,
technology drove society.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.680
The printing press was invented.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.899
Electricity lit the world before
we learned about the electron,

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.700
before the electron
was discovered.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.260
There are all kinds
of connections

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.480
between science and technology.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.950
But nowadays, it's science
that drives technology.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.420
Our ancestors were very good.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.260
They built cities.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.370
They built canals.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.020
They built pyramids.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.520
But now, we can build
pyramids at the atomic level.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.460
You've seen pictures of them.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.310
A great deal of
wonderful transformations

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.430
have happened because
of advances in science

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.230
and in technology.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.660
And it is the brain,
our brain, that is

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.640
responsible for those changes.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.010
We're all capable of doing
good things, each one of us.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.730
And each one of us is
capable of doing evil.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.340
And that's why we have
to be selective about how

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.070
we use the results of
those advances in science

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.450
and in technology.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.090
These are different parts
of the control mechanisms

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.390
that we know about
now for the brain.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.480
So please pay attention
and bear with me.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.120
You came to see some experiments
and some demonstrations.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.450
I promise I will get to them.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:24.510
I promise I will get to them.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.280
But I want you to understand
the perspective and the context

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.400
for doing those experiments
and those demonstrations.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.460
So we all like to
say that chemistry

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.640
is the central science.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.700
And it is the central science.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.592
I like to say it's
the familiar science.

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:43.050
In fact, what I'd
like to say, it's

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.290
the science of the familiar
because everything around us

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.910
is made of chemicals.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.740
The air that we
breathe is a mixture

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.900
of usually good chemicals.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.000
The food that we eat is
a mixture of chemicals.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.610
The clothes that we wear
are made of chemicals.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.710
Our own bodies are
made of chemicals.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.240
What goes on inside
our bodies is

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.450
nothing but a series of
biochemical reactions.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.210
The medicine that we
take when we are sick

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.490
is a mixture of chemicals.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.540
The drugs that some
people very stupidly

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.195
experiment with are chemicals.

00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:16.380
Ah, some of you are smiling.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.810
I'm connecting with the already.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.700
That's why we need to
learn about chemicals,

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.560
their proper handling, safe
handling, proper disposal,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.520
their benefits.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.280
It's so complex,
but it's beautiful.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.660
Beauty is part of science.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.585
It's an essential
part of science.

00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:36.460
Now having told you that
everything around us

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.668
is made of chemicals, I'd
like to ask each one of you

00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:40.910
right now to reach out.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.430
It's OK, Lou.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.088
It's part of the effect.

00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:46.870
It already had the
same effect on you.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.280
So that's good.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.104
I'd like to ask each
one of you right now

00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:51.520
to reach out and
touch a chemical.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.220
Go ahead and do it right now.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.970
Somebody's tapping on
somebody's shoulder.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.140
Somebody's is pulling
somebody's hair.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.220
Don't pull it too long.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.810
Somebody is reaching
out in the air.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.309
Yes.

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:00.770
Chemicals are all around us.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.470
And we want to learn and enjoy
the beautiful chemical world

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.160
that we live in.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.120
That's why I say chemistry is
the science of the familiar.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.120
It's the science
of the familiar.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.960
So I want to share with you
for just a few short seconds

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.920
the theme that I have selected
for the American Chemical

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.620
Society.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.160
As Professor Lippert said,
I will be the president

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.415
beginning January 1.

00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:27.040
But I'm not waiting
till then because I

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.810
want to get a good head
start and get going.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.900
The theme I selected
is advancing chemistry,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.750
communicating chemistry;
advancing chemistry,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.290
communicating chemistry;
advancing chemistry,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.450
communicating chemistry.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.730
And I want to call your
attention to the ACS mission

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.800
statement.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.840
One of the worst things
that a presenter can do

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.879
is show a slide and
then proceed to read it.

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.170
It's an insult to the audience.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.250
You can read it.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.016
But forgive me.

00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:53.140
I don't mean to insult you.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.320
I want to share with you
the emphasis about this.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.130
So it says, "To advance the
broader chemistry enterprise

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.670
and its practitioners
for the benefit of Earth

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.120
and its people."

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.190
Such a profound statement, I
only wish I had written it.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.270
And then there's the ACS vision,
"Improving people's lives

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.440
through the transforming
power of chemistry."

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.900
"Transform" is a
very powerful word.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.350
That's what happens to us
when we become educated.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.620
This is what happens to us when
we become learned individuals.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.050
This is what happens
to societies when they

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.640
become advanced and learned.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.050
They are transformed.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.419
I've selected four initiatives.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.309
Next year is the
sesquicentennial

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.140
of the Land Grant Act.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.850
And the Land Grant
Act, as some of you

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.580
know, and I'm about to tell
you if you didn't know it,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.580
transformed America.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.710
MIT is a land grant institution.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.532
Did you know that?

00:08:47.532 --> 00:08:49.740
Raise your hand if you knew
that MIT was a land grant

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.350
institution.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.270
OK.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.060
Raise your hand now if you
know that MIT is a land grant

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.490
institution?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.460
Everybody-- right?

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.620
I mean, look, I asked
you to pay attention.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.292
I said your brains
will be different.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.750
My brain is being
different already

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.374
because I can tell
from your reactions,

00:09:05.374 --> 00:09:09.420
when it is visual reactions,
and also from your sound

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.160
that you're sharing with me.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.220
So we're going to mark the
sesquicentennial of the Land

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.600
Grant Act at the national
ACS meeting in San Diego

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.480
and Philadelphia by
looking retrospectively

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.750
at what chemistry departments
have done in the past 150

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.440
years.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.880
So we educate ourselves
about our heritage.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.422
What I'm really most
interested in is

00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:31.463
what we're going to do in
the future, what you're

00:09:31.463 --> 00:09:32.550
going to do in the future?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.450
I'm not going to be
around much longer.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.380
I hope a long time.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.290
But not as long as
you're going to be.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.180
So we want to be prospective.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.190
We want a glance in
the real view mirror.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.440
But we want to look
ahead so we can

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.190
be participants and leaders
in transformations that

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.440
are good for our human society.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.540
Our second initiative deals
with appointing a blue ribbon

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.087
commission to examine the
purposes of graduate education

00:09:58.087 --> 00:09:59.670
and research in the
chemical sciences.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.200
Look at the purposes.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.160
Why do we have graduate programs
in the chemical sciences?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.560
Has the German model
served us well?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.399
Is it appropriate
for the 21st century?

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.940
We make promises to
graduate students

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.356
when they come to
graduate school.

00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:15.210
Do we keep those promises?

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.880
Look at the duration of the
postdoctoral appointment now.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.630
It's getting longer and longer.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.420
So we talk about
employment issues.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.060
We also look at the profile
of the graduate students,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.930
diversity, as well
as international part

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.320
of the profile.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.890
And we want to, of
course, remember

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.620
that the graduate students
were undergraduates before.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.767
And before that, they
were in precollege.

00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:38.100
So we're going to segue to that.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.180
But the focus is on
this level right now.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.130
There'll be listening sessions.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.780
There'll be opportunities to
interact via email, webinars,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.190
with this blue ribbon commission
that I have appointed.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.710
The third initiative is to
help the public understand

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.900
the science of climate change.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.990
The science of climate
change, not the politics,

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.050
not the economics, but the
science of climate change.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.520
What is a greenhouse gas?

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.290
What makes it a greenhouse gas?

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.650
Did you know that any molecule
with three atoms or more

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.590
in the gaseous phase
is a greenhouse gas?

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.500
Did you know that?

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.040
Yes or no?

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.240
Did you know that?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.350
You didn't know it, right.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.180
Well, I just told you.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.900
OK.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.540
Every molecule in
the gaseous phase,

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.750
that has three atoms or
more, is a greenhouse gas.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.360
But they're not all effective.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.980
And why aren't
they all effective?

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.990
And what does it
take for a molecule

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.550
to become a greenhouse gas?

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.361
We all know about
dipole moments.

00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:31.860
Yes.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.940
You know about dipole moments?

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.480
OK.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.520
So what I'd like you to do is
make connections between what

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.110
you know and what
you're hearing me

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.660
say now because
that's how we learn.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.540
And that's how we share the
knowledge with each other.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.699
So it takes a dipole
moment to effect, right?

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:46.740
You're shaking your head.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.440
And I'm beginning to
connect with you, right?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.380
But there are molecules with two
atoms in the gaseous phase that

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.180
have a dipole moment too.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.307
Carbon monoxide, right?

00:11:58.307 --> 00:11:59.640
Well, it's not a greenhouse gas.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.450
How come?

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.110
So what does it take
to be a greenhouse gas?

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.640
Think about it.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.410
Here's the big question.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:12.120
How does the vibrational
energy change into heat energy?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.600
I'm not going to ask any
one individual to tell me

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.010
the answer to that one.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.570
But I'm asking you
to think about it.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.650
How does the vibrational
energy change into heat energy?

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.310
You know, most of the air
is nitrogen and oxygen.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.420
But now, we're putting
greenhouse gases in there,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.890
more than we did before.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:28.580
Why?

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.230
Because the
Industrial Revolution

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.980
has been so successful,
extremely successful.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.980
This is why we have the most
advanced society in humankind.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.980
But because of the
Industrial Revolution,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.510
we put more carbon
dioxide in the air.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.730
We put more CO2 gas in the air.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:47.990
Is that a good thing?

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.910
Up to a point,
it's a good thing.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.240
If it weren't for
the greenhouse gases,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.990
the surface of the
planet would be as cold

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.810
as it is on Mars and life as
we know it would not exist.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.270
So there are good
and not so good

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.310
things about the
greenhouse gases.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.560
And that's what this third
initiative deals about.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.050
The fourth one is to
consider the possibility

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.480
of establishing an ACS high
school teacher fellowship

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.290
program.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.820
We will be hearing
about this later

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.920
on from reading
chemical engineering

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.630
news and other sources.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.640
So that's briefly what
I want to focus on.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.640
It's not the only thing.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.180
But that's what I want to
focus on for next year.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.310
So advancing
chemistry, how do how

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.790
do we do it, through research.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.670
Research is so enjoyable.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.140
It's so rewarding.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.360
We ask questions.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.710
We want to know the answers.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:31.790
We're curious.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.880
Why is the sky blue?

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.072
Why is the sky blue?

00:13:34.072 --> 00:13:35.780
Scattering, you're to
tell me scattering.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:36.640
OK, that's good.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.140
OK.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:37.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.080
Why do leaves change
color in the fall?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.640
One of the most beautiful
experiences I had in my life,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.640
when we first came
to Boston in 1957,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.540
a colleague of my dad at Harvard
took us to New Hampshire,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.760
to Vermont, in the fall.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.780
It just-- it was--

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.690
I can't use adequate
words to describe

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.200
the beauty of the
chemical transformations

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.270
that were happening
in the leaves

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.920
and how the chlorophyll
reaction shuts down.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.400
And all these other
colors are there already.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.250
But we don't see them because
they're masked by chlorophyll.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.400
And just understanding
that and asking questions

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.460
is what we're trying to do, both
in research and in education.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.210
Of course advanced chemistry
by being innovative as well.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.880
So I'd like to just take a
couple of moments to tell you

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.970
that in society
today, we have two

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:33.260
sectors, the science-rich sector
and the science-poor sector.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.140
Who is in the
science-rich sector?

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.610
Colleges and universities,
parts of industry,

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.870
the national laboratories.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.420
Who is in the
science-poor sector?

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.950
Everyone else.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.070
And those of us who
are fortunate to be

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.400
in the science-rich
sector have an obligation

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.800
to the people who are in
the science-poor sector.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.130
I want you for a moment to
think about science-rich

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.570
and science-poor.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.960
But I also want you to think
about what you hear on the news

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.760
now daily and cross
out the word "science"

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.860
and cross out the word
"science from the second one.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.030
And look at the
turmoil that we have.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.810
There's a gap that is
widening at an alarming

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.450
rate between those of us
who are rich in knowledge

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.110
and otherwise, and
those who are not.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:26.140
And it's incumbent upon
us to narrow that gap.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.020
We have to do it for a lot
of profound societal reasons.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.550
But I'll give you
one crass reason

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.520
why it's important for those of
us in the science-rich sector

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.860
to communicate with the
science-poor sector.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.040
And you know what
that crass reason is.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.810
The people here, in
this sector here, they

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.640
pay for what it is that we do
in the science-rich sector,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.040
government funds,
private foundation funds.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.450
So we need to be thinking about
our role as science students,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.110
as scientists, as learned
individuals in this regard.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.680
All right.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.441
So there's scientific
competence,

00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:01.190
which is what we acquire
by doing research

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.940
through education.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.650
There's scientific expertise.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.320
But there's also
science literacy.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.260
Our goal should be to increase
the level of science literacy

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.990
among people in the
science-poor sector.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.300
Science literacy is the
appreciation of science

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.690
without a deep knowledge of
chemistry, physics, or biology,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:18.740
or any other science.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.790
It's an appreciation.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.330
Let me give you an analogy to
make this point as clearly as I

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.140
know how.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.480
And this analogy
comes from sports.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.155
I know as a classroom teacher
the danger of using analogies

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.530
because you remember
the analogy,

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.159
and not the real thing
that I'm talking about.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.450
Just as we have professional
football players, baseball

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.170
players, hockey players, and
so on, we have sports fans.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.910
Without those sports
fans, you know

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.450
the interprofessional sports
enterprise would be nothing.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.860
You also know that's
not an exaggeration.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.950
So what we need,
we need scientists

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.050
and we need science fans.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.610
And we want those
science fans not

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.174
to be sitting in the stands
as passive spectators.

00:16:55.174 --> 00:16:56.840
We want them to follow
what we're doing.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.006
Some of them might even
show up on the playing field

00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:01.360
to become scientists like us.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.860
But we have to pay
attention to them

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.210
so we can improve the
level of science literacy.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.250
Communications.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.000
There are many elements
to communications.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.990
I just list five of them here.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.207
One is to inform, to engage--

00:17:14.207 --> 00:17:15.790
that's what I hope
to do very shortly.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.859
I promised you I'll
do experiments.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:18.650
They're engaging.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.733
I'm going to get to that--

00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:23.984
to educate, to advocate,
and to persuade.

00:17:23.984 --> 00:17:25.150
There are other parts of it.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.500
There's entertain, all kinds
of things you can think about.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.080
But those are the
five I want to try

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.260
to focus on as important
elements of communication.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.750
In the scientific community
we communicate with each other

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.420
very well.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.270
But we don't do it as
well yet with people

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.480
in the science-poor sector.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.810
So we have to work on that.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.790
One purpose of
communicating chemistry

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.540
is to showcase
chemistry at its best

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.260
in addressing significant
human and societal issues.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.130
It's very important that we
do that, very, very important

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:51.940
that we do that.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.800
Here's a statement from
a very famous person.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.660
Everyone knows this
person by name.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.260
And he said, "Most of the
fundamental ideas of science

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.960
are essentially m
and may, as a rule,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.800
be expressed in a language
comprehensible to everyone."

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.460
You think about that.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.980
He said most of the
fundamental ideas of science

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.380
are essentially simple,
or maybe simple to him.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.487
But no, that's just a joke.

00:18:16.487 --> 00:18:18.070
Now, you think about
what he's saying.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.430
OK.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.120
So we have to find ways to
improve our communication

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.830
skills to the public at large.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.720
And so I want to mention
to you very briefly

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.680
an activity we do
at the Wisconsin

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.800
Initiative for Science Literacy,
asking graduate students

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.640
to include in their thesis
a chapter, explaining

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.005
the research that they just
finished, to their mother,

00:18:41.005 --> 00:18:44.750
to their grandfather,
to their neighbor,

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.190
to anyone, to their former
high school classmates.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.760
So that they get to appreciate
what it is that someone spent

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.260
five, six years,
working hard, using

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.230
taxpayers' money and
other people's money,

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.100
to improve knowledge and to
give us rewarding experiences.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.510
And the goal, as I say, is
to explain the candidate's

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.820
scholarly research
and its significance

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.530
to a wider audience,
that includes

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.140
family members, friends, civic
groups, newspaper reporters,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.980
state legislator, and so on.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.040
And if you do this,
we give you $500.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.720
We're beyond $10 now.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.280
We're beyond $10
among the graduates.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.020
This is catching on.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.849
And we will assist in the
public dissemination of this.

00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:23.390
So I'm going to tell you how
you can find out more about this

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.890
because you can
read those chapters.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.270
We have them posted
them on my website.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.480
My website is www--

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.570
they all start with www,
you know that, right?

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.190
And then scifun--

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.654
S-C-I-F-U-N-- .org.

00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:37.820
Somebody is writing it down.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.153
You don't have to write it down.

00:19:39.153 --> 00:19:42.230
Just say it quietly a couple
of times, scifun.org--

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.661
S-C-I-F-U-N-- .org,
scifun.org, scifun.org.

00:19:46.661 --> 00:19:48.160
Now, this is how
we memorize things.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.630
But why do we memorize things?

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.850
To store them in
our memory banks?

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.172
They use them.

00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:54.180
To use them.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.175
So I'm going to check
with my web master

00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:59.300
in the next couple of days
to see how many new hits

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.780
we get from the Cambridge area.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.370
See if anybody's
been to my website.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.290
OK.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.430
All right.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.110
The great master
Leonardo said, "There

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.540
is no higher or lower
knowledge, but one only,

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.310
flowing out of experimentation.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.220
We're getting close to
my keeping my promise,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.070
keeping my promise.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.320
That's what you came here for.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.620
So I'm going to do
some experiments.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.880
And my latest book is
volume 5 in this series.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.060
It deals with color, light,
vision, and perception.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.110
It deals with what happens
in front of the eye.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.600
But now because of
advances in neurosciences,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.030
we learn more about what
happens behind the eye.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.130
So that's included
in this book here.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.060
And there's a little flyer
that you may pick up as you

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.820
walked in or when you walk out.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.580
And if you have a favorite
high school teacher,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.370
you might want to give
him a copy as a Christmas

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.760
gift or a holiday
gift, if you wish to.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.680
The book has been out
now since February.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.580
This is the cover of the book.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.110
What are these three
things that you see here?

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.289
What do they look like?

00:20:58.289 --> 00:20:59.330
AUDIENCE: Drops of water.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.340
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Mumble, mumble, mumble.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.350
I like that because
everybody saying things--

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.900
huh?

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.410
Are they paperweights?

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.677
They could be.

00:21:07.677 --> 00:21:09.010
They're actually water droplets.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.940
That's what are.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.380
They're water droplets,
as some of you said.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.680
So here's an experiment
that I want--

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.287
the first experiment I
want to ask to look at.

00:21:17.287 --> 00:21:18.245
This is a checkerboard.

00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:19.870
This is about perception
because you're

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.310
going to be seeing things now.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.650
And the brain, the brain
sometimes plays tricks on us.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.480
So here's the checkerboard.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.130
And you see this
object right here.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.020
And you see it casts a shadow.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.500
So my question to
you is, is the shade

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.710
in square of number 1 the same
as the shade in square number

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.897
2, yes or no?

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:39.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.909
AUDIENCE: No.

00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:42.450
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
How many say yes?

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.070
Raise your hand if you say yes.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.980
And how many say no?

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.180
More people say no.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.880
So we have to train
ourself to do this.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.770
Now, remember now, this
one is labeled number 1.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.090
This is labeled number 2.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:58.190
I'm going to now cover this.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:02.990
And now, you see that they
both have the same shade.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.840
You see that, right?

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.438
So those of you who said yes
before probably have seen this.

00:22:08.438 --> 00:22:10.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.910
And you know what?

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.710
Your brain is
using the knowledge

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.800
that you had from before.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.930
That's great.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.622
So let's look at
this one more time.

00:22:18.622 --> 00:22:19.330
So I take it off.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.930
You see.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.610
So what's going on here?

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.600
The shadow is telling
the brain something.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.520
And we have to develop
the skills with our brains

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.220
to sort out the information, and
be very careful about it, so we

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.620
have the proper interpretation.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.990
So this is when I cover it now.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.190
You see this shadow
cannot be seen.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.560
And that's how we
started with it.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.406
So we have to make connections.

00:22:43.406 --> 00:22:44.780
We have to make
good connections.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.660
We don't want to have
any impedance problems.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.370
That's what we
don't want to have.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.910
And I want to show
you why we want

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.550
to do experiments
and demonstrations,

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.570
why we want to be engaging.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.730
This is why.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.510
That's why.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.300
That's why.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.260
That's why.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.440
That's why.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.990
You just look at those faces.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.620
You just look at those faces.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.510
And each one of them is engaged.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.790
Engagement is important.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.480
But what's really important
is what happens after that.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.440
So we're going to
now get into what

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.260
happens as you become engaged.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.700
Lights out, please.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.670
Because we're going to do
some experiments, in addition

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.031
to the one we did.

00:23:29.031 --> 00:23:29.530
Yes.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:29.800
Yes.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.050
I know you've waited too long.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.710
I know.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:32.770
I know.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.500
When we do experiments, we'll
obey all the safety rules.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.880
You notice I have my goggles on.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.290
Did you notice that?

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.919
I just pointed it
out as a reminder.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.460
For those of you who noticed
and those of you who didn't, you

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.537
just saw that I have them on.

00:23:44.537 --> 00:23:46.120
I have a fire
extinguisher right here.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.760
It's ready to be used, just
in case something goes out

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.587
of control.

00:23:49.587 --> 00:23:51.670
I'm not planning on anything
going out of control.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.790
But we have it as a
safety precaution.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:24:00.370
So what I'm going to do is
take a match and strike it.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.720
You like that, right?

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.370
So this is an example of what
we call a combustion reaction.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.800
I'm going to light a candle.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.790
And--

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.590
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.990
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: --I'm
going to-- whoa is right, see.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.832
Engagement.

00:24:17.832 --> 00:24:19.290
I want to tell you
something that I

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.498
have observed over the years.

00:24:20.498 --> 00:24:23.790
I've been doing these
demonstrations for over 40

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.050
years.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:28.200
Youngsters and people
in retirement homes

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.650
are not inhibited
like the rest of us.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.900
So we have to allow ourselves
to express ourselves.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.170
So this is an example of
a combustion reaction.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:44.770
And it is, of course,
related to Michael Faraday.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.190
You know who Michael
Faraday was, right?

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.800
He used to gather young
people around Christmas time

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.630
at the Royal Institution and
do experiments with them.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.610
And one of his most
famous lectures

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.750
is on the chemical
history of the candle.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.610
So what I'm going to
do now, because you're

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.940
paying good attention,
I'm going to reach back

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.580
into my back pocket
and get my wallet out.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.683
What do people usually
keep in their wallets?

00:25:07.683 --> 00:25:08.410
AUDIENCE: Money.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:08.650
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Money.

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.302
What else?

00:25:09.302 --> 00:25:10.260
AUDIENCE: Credit cards.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:10.900
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Credit cards.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.340
What else?

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.120
AUDIENCE: Driver's license.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.840
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Driver's license,

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.220
if you're old
enough to have one.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:14.670
What else?

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.330
AUDIENCE: Pictures.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.600
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Pictures,
all kinds of things.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.016
So what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to reach in here.

00:25:19.016 --> 00:25:20.730
I'm going to take a
dollar bill and I'm

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.650
going to put it into the
flame, just like that.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.667
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:26.250
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Was that too fast?

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:26.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.493
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Well, I asked you to pay

00:25:28.493 --> 00:25:29.950
close attention, didn't I?

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.810
I'm trying to engage your brain.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.072
So that was not a
real dollar bill.

00:25:37.072 --> 00:25:38.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.970
That was a fake dollar bill.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.290
That was a phony dollar bill.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.250
It's called flash paper.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.060
What we always do in science
is repeat the experiment.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.450
So I take out what looks
like a dollar bill.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.110
But it's not a real dollar bill.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.560
I bring it close to the flame.

00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:05.300
It disappears into thin air.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.060
It looks like magic.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.190
I love magic.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:15.040
Magic is engaging,
but not informative.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.590
Magic is engaging.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.590
So this is paper that has
been treated with chemicals so

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.350
that when it burns, it
doesn't leave any ash behind.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.290
It's called flash paper.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.180
And so what are the chemicals
that are used for this?

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.680
You want to think
about this, right.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.560
So you want to educate yourself
about it if you want to.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.789
And you might want
to go to my website

00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:35.830
to learn more about this.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.325
How do you get to my website?

00:26:37.325 --> 00:26:38.972
AUDIENCE: www.funsci.org.

00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:39.930
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: OK.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.100
You got it.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.350
So now I would
like to ask someone

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.030
in the audience to
volunteer to help me

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.870
with the next experiment.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.620
Who wants to help?

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.095
Well, let me tell you first
what I need help with, OK.

00:26:49.095 --> 00:26:50.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.300
I'd like someone in the audience
to let me borrow from them

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.920
a real $1 bill.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.420
Is there someone
in the audience who

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.795
would let me--
who would trust me

00:26:58.795 --> 00:27:02.340
with a real $1
bill or a $5 bill?

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.290
Steve, how about
a $20 bill, huh?

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.650
You got a $20 bill?

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.150
OK.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.490
Here's a $1 bill.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.660
It's a real $1 bill.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.940
You know what I'm going
to do with it, don't you?

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.640
You know where this is going.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.100
So combustion, combustion is--

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.405
AUDIENCE: You did say borrow.

00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:18.840
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Huh?

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.048
AUDIENCE: You did say borrow.

00:27:20.048 --> 00:27:21.640
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
I did say borrow.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.780
You know what?

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.430
That's a very important
observation that you made

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.260
and you are reporting it.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.480
Because the whole exchange
for the benefit of society

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.240
works on the element of trust.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.720
You trusted me
with this $1 bill.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.710
So I did say borrow, which
means I'm going to give it back.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.439
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:27:43.439 --> 00:27:44.980
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
I didn't say what

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.195
form it's going to be
in when I give it back.

00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:48.185
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.290
So, well, I have
a jar right here.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.992
And I have in this jar--

00:27:55.992 --> 00:27:56.950
what does it look like?

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:57.470
I have a liquid.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.240
What does it look like?

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.900
It looks like?

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.260
AUDIENCE: Water.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.926
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
It looks like water.

00:28:00.926 --> 00:28:02.890
The way we described this
liquid is to say it's

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.490
a clear and colorless liquid,
which is what water is.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:10.320
So I'm going to take
this liquid and--

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.820
so I want everybody to
see the jar right here,

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.730
get this out of the way.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.490
I'm going to take
the dollar bill.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.060
I'm going to soak it in this
clear and colorless liquid,

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.210
which looks like water.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.640
And I'm going to fish it
out using those tongs.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.839
You see, it's dripping
like any wet object would.

00:28:28.839 --> 00:28:30.630
And then I'm going to
take it to the flame.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:31.780
Take a good look at it now.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.510
It may be last time you see it.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:38.692
So here is the dollar
bill on fire, or is it?

00:28:38.692 --> 00:28:39.482
AUDIENCE: No.

00:28:39.482 --> 00:28:41.815
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: But you
did see a flame, didn't you?

00:28:41.815 --> 00:28:42.280
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.920
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: So now I ask
you, can this liquid be water?

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.787
AUDIENCE: No.

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:47.620
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: You
know from experience

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.650
that water does not burn
under these conditions.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.950
So I will tell you
what's in this jar.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.790
This clear and
colorless liquid is

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:59.800
a mixture of rubbing alcohol
and water, isopropyl alcohol

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.030
and water.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.680
You know also from experience
that when you burn alcohol,

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.917
what color flame do you see?

00:29:07.917 --> 00:29:08.750
It's kind of bluish.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.745
Do you remember what
color flame you saw here?

00:29:10.745 --> 00:29:13.040
It was a little yellowish.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.010
That's because we also added a
little bit of sodium chloride

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.970
in there.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.370
The eye is more sensitive
to the yellow color

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.150
than it is to the blue color.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.380
So we added the sodium chloride
to enhance the visibility

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.120
of what's going on.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.480
How can sodium chloride
enhance the visibility?

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.725
So we're exciting the
electrons and the sodium ions.

00:29:32.725 --> 00:29:34.100
They go to a higher
energy state.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.300
Do you remember all the
stuff that you learned

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.040
in atomic structure, and so on?

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.330
Make connections.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.960
Make connections with that.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.600
So I give you back
this dollar bill

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.000
because I said I
would borrow it.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.960
So here it is.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.417
So what does it feel like?

00:29:51.417 --> 00:29:52.250
Of course, it's wet.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.400
It's 50% water, 50% alcohol.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.230
So wait a little
bit until it dries.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.010
And then you can--

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.000
so thank you very much.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.135
Give her a hand for
helping out with this.

00:30:01.135 --> 00:30:02.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.890
So when you burn something
that has carbon in it,

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.940
you get carbon dioxide.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.270
Carbon dioxide is a gas
at room temperature.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.090
We can't see it because
it has no color.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.120
And we can't smell it
because it has no odor.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.730
But everyone knows
about carbon dioxide gas

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.890
because you know about
carbonated beverages.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.470
In fact, they're called
carbonated beverages.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.150
They have carbon
dioxide in them.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:29.910
I'm going to do an
experiment right now

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.030
so that we can learn a bit more
about how much carbon dioxide

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.980
is dissolved in this liquid.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.602
And to do this experiment, I'm
going to use a baby bottle.

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.640
You remember that, huh?

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.210
So this baby bottle has
been modified slightly.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.180
I have replaced the nipple
that has the hole in it where

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.250
the milk flows out, with the
rubber bulb from a medicine

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.510
dropper.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.260
And this is a very
strong piece of rubber.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.010
I'm going to try to
show you how strong it

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.950
is by attempting to blow air in
it to see if I can inflate it.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.450
Here we go.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.580
Can't do it.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.330
It's very, very strong.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.520
So now, please listen carefully
to this very familiar sound

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.990
as I open the can.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.131
You've all done this
or seen someone do it.

00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:15.630
Here we go.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.040
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.660
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Did you hear that?

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.450
Now, the can is open
to the atmosphere.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.580
That's the sound from the metal.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:29.350
I'm going to take the liquid
and put it in this baby bottle.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.460
What do you see?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.470
You see fizz.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.670
You see bubbles.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.959
What kind of bubbles are those?

00:31:35.959 --> 00:31:37.250
They're carbon dioxide bubbles.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.990
Where are they coming from?

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:45.470
They're coming from the
drink, from the liquid.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:49.340
But the pressure now is
open to the atmosphere.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.930
And that's why
they're bubbling out.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.580
So I'm going to fill it to
the top, take the screw cap

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.870
and tighten it.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.243
What should I do next?

00:31:58.243 --> 00:31:59.130
AUDIENCE: Shake it.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.630
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: You've done
this experiment before, huh?

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.423
So I shake it.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.770
And now you see how much
carbon dioxide is dissolved

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.440
in this carbonated beverage.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.520
There's so much carbon
dioxide in there

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.380
it's able to partially inflate
this strong piece of rubber,

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.720
that neither I, nor
any other human being,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.324
can inflate with all
the powers of our lungs.

00:32:24.324 --> 00:32:25.740
But you already
know that there is

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.750
a lot of carbon dioxide
in drinks like this

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:31.006
because what do you do
after you take a sip or two?

00:32:31.006 --> 00:32:31.980
AUDIENCE: Burp.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.021
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Burp.

00:32:33.021 --> 00:32:34.140
Yes, you burp.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.890
When you burp, please do
it gently and politely.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.560
Your burp because the
carbon dioxide gas

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.250
is coming out of the liquid.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.590
So now let's see
if I can release

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.630
the pressure a little bit here.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.590
I do it carefully.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.190
If I don't do it carefully,
what will happen?

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.219
I will make a mess.

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:51.760
You're right.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.770
It'll spread out.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.320
But I don't want to
make a mess because

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.630
this carbonated beverage
has, among other things

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:58.599
in it, sugar.

00:32:58.599 --> 00:32:59.640
And that sugar is sticky.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.605
I don't want to have.

00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:01.230
So there it is.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.930
It's open to the atmosphere now.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.400
And the carbon dioxide
still bubbles out.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.470
You know from experience that
when the drink goes flat,

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:11.980
it doesn't taste as good.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.480
Right?

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.230
Right?

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:14.940
You're shaking your heads.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.230
Why doesn't it
taste good, as good?

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.160
Because all the carbon
dioxide has disappeared.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.190
So why do we like
carbonated beverages?

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.210
Some of them have
alcohol in them.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.540
Some of them have some
sugar or sweetener in them.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.920
We like them because when we
put the liquid in our mouth,

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.110
the tiny gas bubbles
come out of liquid

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.730
and they tingle us
under the tongue

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.310
and give us a
pleasant sensation.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.240
So that's about
carbon dioxide gas.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.350
It is a colorless and
it is a odorless gas.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.650
Now, what I'm going to
do is an experiment using

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.210
another form of carbon dioxide.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.800
It's called dry ice.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.740
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.888
And you'll notice
I'm putting what on?

00:33:57.888 --> 00:33:59.640
AUDIENCE: Gloves.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.380
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Putting gloves.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.600
And I'm going to
open this bucket

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.080
and pick up three chunks
of carbon dioxide, solid.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.989
This is solid carbon dioxide.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:17.620
It's temperature is
minus 78 degrees Celsius.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.300
It's very cold.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.460
That's why I use these
gloves to protect

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.190
my hands from frostbite.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.096
These gloves are not
very good insulators.

00:34:26.096 --> 00:34:28.179
But for this purpose,
they're good because I'm not

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:29.980
squeezing on the dry ice.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.860
Dry ice changes from being a
solid to a gas by a process we

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.912
call sublimation.

00:34:34.912 --> 00:34:36.370
Sublimation is
happening right now.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.203
But we can't see it.

00:34:37.203 --> 00:34:39.000
How come we can't see it?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.977
Because carbon dioxide
is gas, is what?

00:34:41.977 --> 00:34:42.810
AUDIENCE: Invisible.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.500
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
It's invisible.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.489
It has no color.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:49.330
By the way, if you
ever see a colored gas,

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.370
you run away from it.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.330
You heard me.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.940
If you ever see a colored
gas, you run away from it

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.030
because all colored
gases are poisonous.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.640
All colored gases are poisonous.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.210
The converse is not true.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.170
There are some colorless gases
that are deadly poisonous,

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:08.200
including the close
relative to carbon dioxide?

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.320
AUDIENCE: Carbon monoxide.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.150
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Carbon monoxide.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.650
OK.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.440
So, all right.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.870
So sublimation is
happening right now.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.710
We can't see it.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.110
And I'm going to put
those three back in here.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.750
And I ask you to focus
your attention on what you

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.340
see between my two hands here.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.630
What do you see
between my two hands?

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.630
AUDIENCE: Cylinders.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.370
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
What shape are they?

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.000
Cylinders.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.477
How many of them are there?

00:35:29.477 --> 00:35:30.061
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.977
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: And
are they big cylinders

00:35:31.977 --> 00:35:33.020
or small cylinders.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.700
AUDIENCE: Big.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.806
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Well, how big is big?

00:35:35.806 --> 00:35:36.590
This big.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.170
Yeah, I know.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.836
That's this big.

00:35:37.836 --> 00:35:39.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.760
I'm going to ask you to
do the very same thing I

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.110
ask my students in my freshman
chemistry course at Wisconsin

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.220
to do.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.740
In order to sharpen your
powers of observation

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.100
and develop the skills of
reporting these observations,

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.570
I ask you to pretend to be the
play-by-play radio announcer,

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.640
describing to someone
who is not with us what's

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.872
going on, not the TV announcer.

00:36:02.872 --> 00:36:05.080
That person has got it made
because the picture tells

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.230
almost everything.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.402
So there are how many cylinders?

00:36:08.402 --> 00:36:09.429
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:11.970
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: And what do
you see inside the cylinders?

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.320
AUDIENCE: Colored liquids.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.080
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Colored liquids.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.580
OK.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.340
I'm listening to
you on the radio.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.420
And what I hear you say is
that there are six cylinders.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.340
And they have in
them colored liquids.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.150
Come on.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.400
Your brain learned a
lot more information

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.010
than those two statements.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.710
So they're about
this big, you said.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.570
I can see you on the radio
saying, it's about this big.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.310
You've got to do
better than this.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.190
Are they 100
millimeters in size?

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.530
Are they 10 liters in size?

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.100
Are they somewhere in between?

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.600
Yes.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.590
We put a bracket on it.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.680
When we estimate in science,
we put a bracket on it.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.000
And they have, yes,
colored liquids.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.070
How do you know they're liquids?

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:50.940
They could be gels.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.780
How do we find out?

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.700
We shake them up a
little bit because we

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.780
know from experience.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.920
It's a keyword.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.840
We learn things.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.350
Our brain learns things.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.730
So we use them.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.440
So they're liquids.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.530
And they seem to be arranged
in some kind of order.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.705
What is the order?

00:37:10.705 --> 00:37:13.390
It's the order of the
color in the liquids.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.450
And they're arranged in pairs.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.416
This pair has what
colored liquid in it?

00:37:17.416 --> 00:37:18.040
AUDIENCE: Blue.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.015
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: This one?

00:37:19.015 --> 00:37:19.510
AUDIENCE: Pink.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.366
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: This one?

00:37:20.366 --> 00:37:20.742
AUDIENCE: Purple.

00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:21.991
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: All right.

00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:24.460
So I'm going to take
chunks of dry ice

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.850
and put them in the cylinders
in a very special way.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:34.156
And when I get done, you tell
me what the special way is.

00:37:34.156 --> 00:37:36.790
AUDIENCE: It's blowing out.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:39.892
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
What's blowing out?

00:37:39.892 --> 00:37:42.270
Do you see any bubbles?

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.835
What kind of bubbles are those?

00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:54.020
I wish I had a camera
and take a picture

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.710
of the facial
expressions I see here.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:03.870
A lot of interesting
things are happening.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.012
How interesting are they?

00:38:05.012 --> 00:38:06.720
Are they interesting
enough that you want

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.110
to ask questions about them?

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:08.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:09.180
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Yeah.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.770
Well, you want to
know what's in there?

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.686
You already know what's
in there, the dry ice.

00:38:12.686 --> 00:38:14.310
I put the dry ice in there.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.915
What did I put the dry ice into?

00:38:15.915 --> 00:38:18.900
Into the cylinders that have
colored liquids in them.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.920
And I put the dry ice
in every other cylinder.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.560
I didn't put it
in every cylinder

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.720
right, every other
cylinder, leaving one

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.030
for comparison purposes.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.840
So these are dyes.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.630
They'll change color when
the pH of the liquid changes.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:34.230
Because carbon dioxide gas in
water gives us carbonic acid.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.201
Every time we drink a carbonated
beverage, we're drinking acid.

00:38:37.201 --> 00:38:37.950
Did you know that?

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.800
That's a weak acid.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.540
But these cylinders have
in them a little bit

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.410
of sodium hydroxide, before
I did the experiment.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.820
And they changed color because
carbon dioxide, the gas,

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.240
combines with the
base that's in there.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.830
And the dyes are
acid/base indicators.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:03.580
So this pair had an indicator
called bromothymol blue.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.050
This has phenolphthalein.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.940
And this had a
mixture of indicators.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.600
So in this pair, the color
changed from what to what?

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.040
AUDIENCE: Blue to yellow.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.498
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
How about this?

00:39:13.498 --> 00:39:14.570
AUDIENCE: Pink to--

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:15.736
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: To what?

00:39:15.736 --> 00:39:16.417
AUDIENCE: Clear.

00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:17.500
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Clear.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.150
This is a clear
and colored liquid.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.170
This is a clear--

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.450
this is colorless, your right.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.420
Clear and colorless do
not mean the same thing.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.110
From now on, no one
in this audience

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.972
is going to confuse the words
"clear" and "colorless."

00:39:28.972 --> 00:39:30.430
This is a clear
and colored liquid.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:32.260
This is a clear and colorless.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:37.560
So now I ask you to focus your
attention on this cylinder.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.760
Actually, you can
focus your attention

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.070
on anything you want to.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.220
You can even not pay
attention if you want to.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.450
We live in a free country.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.960
But if you want to follow
the experiment with me,

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.040
I want you to focus your
attention on this one.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.740
And tell me, count them out,
how many different color changes

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.754
you see as I drop
the dry ice in there?

00:39:57.754 --> 00:39:59.245
[BUBBLING]

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.826
I'm listening to
you on the radio.

00:40:05.826 --> 00:40:06.580
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.700
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: One.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.570
Wow, I heard wow.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.081
What kind of a count is that?

00:40:11.081 --> 00:40:12.990
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.670
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Three so far?

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.151
Three different color changes.

00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:18.150
But you know, I'm listening
to you on the radio.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.850
And you want me to appreciate
what you're seeing.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.390
So what were the color
changes that you saw?

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:25.980
Why couldn't you say those?

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.100
You see how we have
to help our brain make

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.910
the right observations and
make the right reporting.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.160
So what about this stuff
that's coming off of the top?

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.790
What does it look like?

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:38.730
AUDIENCE: Gas.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.313
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
It looks like gas.

00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:41.450
But actually what it is--

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:42.283
it looks like smoke.

00:40:42.283 --> 00:40:43.340
But it's not smoke.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.097
What's the name of the stuff
that floats up in the sky.

00:40:46.097 --> 00:40:46.930
You can just say it.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:47.710
You don't have to
raise your hand.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.380
Just say it.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:48.730
AUDIENCE: Clouds.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:49.540
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Clouds.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.170
It's a fog.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:50.950
It's fog.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.270
It's a mist.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.980
It's condensed water vapor.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.490
The condensation is taking place
on the cold carbon dioxide gas

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.520
bubbles that are coming from
the sublimation process.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.480
That's why sublimation is
happening right now, right

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.130
here, and also in this bucket.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.240
But we can't see it.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.880
But over here we can
see it because gas

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.582
is mixing with what here?

00:41:10.582 --> 00:41:11.290
AUDIENCE: Liquid.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:11.383
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Liquid.

00:41:11.383 --> 00:41:12.892
And here gas is
mixing with what?

00:41:12.892 --> 00:41:13.475
AUDIENCE: Gas.

00:41:13.475 --> 00:41:13.930
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Gas.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:14.500
OK.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:20.740
So I always think, T-H-I-N-K,
T-H-I-N-K, remember that.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.160
If you remember anything
about my visit with you today,

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.880
remember to T-H-I-N-K.
Remember to think.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.890
So condensed water
vapor is coming out.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.470
The mist is flowing downward.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.090
Why is the mist
flowing downward?

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.654
Because carbon dioxide
gas is denser than air.

00:41:37.654 --> 00:41:38.570
It's heavier than air.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.580
And if we knew this,
this is a beautiful way

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:41.810
to be reminded of it.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.880
And if we didn't know
it, we just learned it.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.770
So what I'm going to do here--

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.340
because she turned it off.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.590
Ah.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.130
No.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.064
I wanted it on.

00:41:52.064 --> 00:41:53.230
Let's see if it still works.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:56.730
So I'm going to take this
bucket, this bucket right here.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:58.200
It's empty except for what?

00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.370
AUDIENCE: Air.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.110
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
You can't see air.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.480
And I'm going to take
the hot boiling--

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.310
ah, well, it's hot.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.170
I don't know if it's boiling.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.020
It was boiling.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:07.820
You could see it.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.090
I'm going to use my gloves now
to protect my hands from heat

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.770
because I don't
want to burn myself.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.810
And I'm going to dump
this water in here.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.945
I don't want to get the
water trapped in the gloves

00:42:24.945 --> 00:42:26.570
because you know what
then will happen,

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.190
what will happen
to my-- here we go.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:29.920
So what do you see
coming off the top?

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.640
AUDIENCE: Steam.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.265
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Steam is invisible.

00:42:32.265 --> 00:42:33.190
You can't see steam.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.060
What are you seeing?

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.050
AUDIENCE: Water vapor.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:35.840
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Water vapor.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.090
This room is full
of water vapor.

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.580
Otherwise, my throat would be
drier than it is right now.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.320
What are you seeing
coming off the top?

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.550
AUDIENCE: Water vapor.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.258
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
You're seeing a mist.

00:42:44.258 --> 00:42:45.670
It's condensed water vapor.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.720
The hot water vapor
hits the cold air.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.400
It condenses.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.530
And then it gets the
same temperature.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:51.880
It disappears.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.020
So what I'm going to do now
is take the bucket of dry ice

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:00.246
and put the dry
ice right in there.

00:43:00.246 --> 00:43:01.725
[YELLS]

00:43:11.092 --> 00:43:12.571
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.670
Just be careful not
to touch the water

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.800
because the water is very hot.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.430
All right.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.210
OK.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:32.380
So what I'd like you to do
now is to go back and sit.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.040
Go back and sit where
you were sitting before.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:36.790
I know that's--

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.300
Condensed water
vapor is what we see.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.920
We see the fog is moving?

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.740
AUDIENCE: Down.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.170
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Downward.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:46.670
Why?

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.550
Because the condensation
is taking place.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:52.960
And the carbon dioxide gas,
which is denser than air.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.660
This is a good way
to demonstrate this.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.450
So I'm going to take this out of
the way and put it right here.

00:44:03.477 --> 00:44:05.560
This is how they make fog
in the movies sometimes.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.020
Take boiling water,
add dry ice to it.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.884
And you put a fan
on it and blow it.

00:44:10.884 --> 00:44:12.550
And I have to tell
you this little story

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.530
because it's a true story.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.540
I do a lot of
these presentations

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.240
all over the world.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.340
In Madison, Wisconsin,
my adopted hometown,

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.580
I was at the airport one time.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:28.750
And a whole bunch of kids,
about 20, maybe 25 kids,

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.000
they saw me from a distance.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.291
They were getting on an
airplane, going on a field trip

00:44:32.291 --> 00:44:33.280
to Washington, DC.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.780
And they ran to me.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.900
And they didn't say,
hi, Dr. Shakhashiri.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.400
You know what they said?

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.350
Condensed water vapor.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:42.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:43.074 --> 00:44:43.990
That's what they said.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.080
They learned it.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.330
They learned it.

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:47.800
They said condensed water vapor.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.591
So they learned it.

00:44:48.591 --> 00:44:49.810
OK, good.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:50.310
All right.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:54.730
So now, we're going
to do an experiment.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:56.260
Let's see.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.530
This is moving along
very rapidly here.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.600
I forgot the directions
for the next experiment.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.470
But you know, I brought
my book with me.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.020
So here's my new book.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.185
So is it OK if I open
the book and read

00:45:07.185 --> 00:45:08.310
from the book a little bit?

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.018
Would that be OK?

00:45:09.018 --> 00:45:09.790
Is that OK?

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.220
Ah.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.350
You see, this is not
an ordinary book.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:16.280
This is a hot book.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.820
Actually, it's just
the book covers.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.560
What's on the inside?

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.960
I'll show you.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.830
There's a couple of
batteries right here.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:32.800
I'll walk around so
everybody can see it.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.140
I have two batteries.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.680
Batteries have stored
in them chemical energy.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.170
And there is a filament up here.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:43.730
And then there is a flint that
I soaked with lighter fluid

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.160
when you were not looking.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.100
And what I have not told you
yet, and you have not seen it,

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.635
but I'm going to show it to
you and tell you right now,

00:45:51.635 --> 00:45:52.760
there's a button down here.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.840
Can you can see the
button down there?

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.680
Huh?

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.364
What color is the button?

00:45:56.364 --> 00:45:57.030
AUDIENCE: Black.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.196
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Come on.

00:45:58.196 --> 00:46:01.160
You're doing the
play-by-play description.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:01.730
Yeah, black.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:02.450
It is black.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:06.710
You have to report
your observations.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.469
So you know about
the fire triangle.

00:46:08.469 --> 00:46:10.010
It takes three things
to have a fire.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.790
What are they?

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.620
Something that burns.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.000
Oxygen, usually from the air.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.850
What's the third one?

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.980
Heat, a source of ignition,
a source of ignition.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.860
So you watch how I do this now.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.390
I stand over here.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.654
I move the book
away from my face.

00:46:26.654 --> 00:46:28.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:32.100
I'm connecting with you because
you're paying attention.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.090
And I open the book.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.850
And when I push the
button, chemical energy

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.710
changes into electrical energy.

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:43.160
And this light bulb filament
is like all other filaments.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.590
It is not 100% efficient.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.684
It gives off light energy and--

00:46:48.684 --> 00:46:51.100
and so let's see what happens
when I push the button here,

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.250
away from my face.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.750
OK.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:54.190
You saw that, right?

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:58.420
So you tell me now,
you tell me what

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.100
happens when I close the book?

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.900
What happened when
I closed the book?

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.237
Just say it out loud.

00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:04.610
AUDIENCE: Cut off the oxygen.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.240
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Cut off the oxygen.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.570
You're like the
students in my class.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.940
You give a correct answer,
but not to the question

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.410
that I asked.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.360
And that's why people
sometimes don't do well

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.870
on tests because they
don't answer the question.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.360
So what was the
question that I asked?

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.670
I asked you what happened
when I closed the book?

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:23.900
What happened when
I closed the book?

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.300
AUDIENCE: The fire went out.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.883
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
The fire went out.

00:47:25.883 --> 00:47:28.040
Why did the fire go out?

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:28.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.030
Because there is no
oxygen. You get it.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.950
We have to train our
brains so we are connected

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.920
with each other properly.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.380
So I open the book now.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.360
Is there oxygen or not?

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.310
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.018
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
But there's no flame.

00:47:42.018 --> 00:47:43.180
How come there's no flame?

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.370
We're missing the heat.

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:46.220
What should I do?

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.900
Stop talking and push
the button, right.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.900
That's what I should do.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.150
So I push the button.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:51.560
There it is.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.880
I'm running out of fuel.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.600
OK.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.290
OK.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:48:02.030
So this book cover
is from volume 5.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.250
And now I have used it once.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.740
I cannot take it back
on the airplane with me.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.900
But even if I
could, I don't want

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.390
to because I want to give
it to Professor Lippard

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.410
as a memento of my visit here.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:15.326
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:21.780
So you can use it safely, Steve.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.220
And you know why?

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.789
You know why we teach
about the fire triangle?

00:48:26.789 --> 00:48:28.580
Not to help people
start fires, but to help

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.810
people put out fires.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.280
You think about that.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.840
So let's see.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.410
We've got a couple of
other things going on here.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:38.460
What am I holding with
my two hands right here?

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.450
AUDIENCE: Bottles.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.200
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
What kind of bottles?

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:40.699
Come on.

00:48:40.699 --> 00:48:44.040
Do I have to ask all the
questions all the time?

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.200
Play-by-play description, right.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.100
Are they what?

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.870
What size bottles are they?

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:50.142
What are they made of?

00:48:50.142 --> 00:48:51.434
AUDIENCE: Plastic.

00:48:51.434 --> 00:48:52.850
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Do you realize

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:55.775
how much technology
is involved in this,

00:48:55.775 --> 00:48:56.900
in just making this bottle?

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.670
Look, there's a shoulder here.

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.260
There's an opening here.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.870
A lot of science and
applications of science

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.510
are involved in making those
two-liter bottles, that

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.590
are made of?

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:08.450
AUDIENCE: Plastic.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:09.616
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Plastic.

00:49:09.616 --> 00:49:11.127
They're made of plastic.

00:49:11.127 --> 00:49:13.460
And there's a little bit of
a clear and colorless liquid

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.800
near the bottom of
each one of them.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.010
And I'm going to tell
you what the liquids are.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.120
The liquid in here
is hydrogen peroxide.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.170
It is 30% hydrogen peroxide, not
what you buy in the drugstore.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:30.740
What you buying the drugstore
is 3% hydrogen peroxide.

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.690
And what do you buy it for?

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.060
Because if you have a cut,
you put the hydrogen peroxide

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.320
on your wound.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.430
And what do you see?

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.180
AUDIENCE: Bubbles.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:38.540
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Bubbles.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.410
What kind of bubbles are those?

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.110
They're oxygen bubbles.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:44.550
Because hydrogen peroxide
breaks down very,

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:48.810
very, very, very, very, very
slowly into water and oxygen.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:51.470
But if there is
something that speeds up

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:55.130
that breakup, a catalyst,
then it goes very fast.

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.680
And the blood and the skin
have in them such substances.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.910
So I'm going to take what
looks like a small tea bag

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:02.720
right here.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.130
I'm going to put it in there.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:09.740
And see if we can catalyze the
decomposition or the breakup

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.290
of the hydrogen peroxide.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:16.120
You can see that already--

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.370
what do you see on the inside?

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.317
What do you see coming
off the top here?

00:50:19.317 --> 00:50:20.400
AUDIENCE: Condensed water.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.610
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Condensed water vapor.

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:22.515
It's a mist.

00:50:22.515 --> 00:50:24.300
It's a mist, right?

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.470
And where is it coming from?

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.960
This reaction of the
breakup of the hydrogen

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.070
peroxide into water and
oxygen is exothermic.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.130
It gives off heat.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.860
So the water is boiling.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.150
And the boiling water,
when it hits the cold air,

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.919
it condenses.

00:50:36.919 --> 00:50:38.460
And we see that
until the temperature

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.340
gets to be the same as
the air temperature.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.730
And we don't see it anymore.

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.240
So we always like to repeat
the experiment in science.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.010
But before I repeat
the experiment,

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.260
I want you to look
very, very closely,

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:52.860
if you haven't been doing
so already, about what else

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.410
is happening to the plastic.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:55.710
But what is this?

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:56.280
What is this?

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.696
I'm listening to
you on the radio.

00:50:57.696 --> 00:50:59.240
I can't see this.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:50:59.820
What is this?

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.580
Tell me.

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:01.750
Tell me out loud.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:02.580
Huh?

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.440
The plastic bottle is shrinking.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.360
Amazing.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.400
When I was a student
at Boston University,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.830
I learned that if you take
a substance and you heat it,

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.840
it stretches.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.130
But this is plastic.

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.570
This is made by people.

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:17.970
So plastics shrink.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.520
You all know that plastics
shrink because you've

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.870
heard of shrink wrapping.

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:23.790
How does shrink wrapping works?

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:26.490
You cover something up
with a plastic sheet.

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:28.380
And then what do you do?

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.310
You heat it.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.470
How come when we
heat plastic, it

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.710
shrinks and when I heat a
piece of copper, it stretches?

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:35.550
How come?

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.510
This is not a
rhetorical question.

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:40.730
I want to do T-H-I-N--

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.750
what?

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.210
"K" about this.

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.860
So be thinking about that.

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.810
So we repeat the experiment.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.380
We're do the
experiment right here.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.370
And there it is again.

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.290
Let's see if the
same thing happens.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.470
As you're watching that, I'm
going to do now an experiment

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:03.380
right here whereby
I have this beaker.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.500
It's volume is about
600 milliliters.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.315
And it's empty, except for?

00:52:08.315 --> 00:52:08.899
AUDIENCE: Air.

00:52:08.899 --> 00:52:10.148
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: All right.

00:52:10.148 --> 00:52:12.635
I'm going to put it on
top of this other beaker.

00:52:12.635 --> 00:52:14.600
They're going to flip
around like this.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.500
So everybody can see it.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:21.770
And I'm going to take two
liquids, a clear and colorless

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:26.770
liquid in my right-hand bottle
and a clear and colorless

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:28.651
liquid in the left hand.

00:52:28.651 --> 00:52:29.150
OK.

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:32.480
You see that, if you're
paying attention over here.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.250
But if you're still
looking over there,

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.610
then you're not watching this.

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:38.360
And that's really
what it's about.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.240
You have the freedom to
choose what you want to do.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.450
And you will be effective
in what you want to do.

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:46.050
Be very careful about it.

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:48.230
So that's kind of
interesting right there.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:50.090
And you know what?

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.220
Don't rush into anything.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.150
I'm rushing right now.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.950
I'm keeping an eye
on the watch here.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.720
You all have other
things you want to do.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.030
You probably want to go
watch the Patriots play.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:01.130
That's up to you.

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.340
But lots of fascinating,
captivating, engaging,

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:08.300
educating, informing,
changes, transformations

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.540
are happening over here.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.270
So watch this.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.960
I take this clear and colorless
liquid and I put some of it

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.900
in the beaker, about
a hundred milliliters.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.890
How do I know it's about
a hundred millimeters?

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.927
I'm reading the markers
here, on the beaker.

00:53:23.927 --> 00:53:25.510
And I take about a
hundred millimeters

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:27.334
of a different clear
and colorless liquid.

00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:28.750
But you don't know
it's different.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:29.932
They look the same.

00:53:29.932 --> 00:53:30.640
And look at this.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.000
Look what's going to happen now.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.464
AUDIENCE: It's yellow.

00:53:34.464 --> 00:53:35.880
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Isn't that one

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.060
of the most fascinating
observations you make?

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.230
You take two clear,
colorless liquids.

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:41.500
You mix them together.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:45.810
And you get a yellow substance,
that is insoluble in water.

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:48.360
And you notice what
happened over here?

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.520
So this is-- this fell over.

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.460
So it's pretty hot.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.190
I don't want to have it--

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.719
there it is.

00:53:53.719 --> 00:53:54.510
I want to have it--

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:58.710
it's going to fall over again.

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:03.290
I'll prop it over here.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:05.270
So the little tea bag
has in it a catalyst

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.420
called manganese dioxide, MnO2.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:09.830
It has large surface area.

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.521
It catalyzed the decomposition
of the hydrogen peroxide.

00:54:12.521 --> 00:54:13.770
Is this one going to fall off?

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:15.850
We'll wait and see.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:17.810
This is lead iodide.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.640
I mixed potassium
iodide solution

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.320
with lead nitrate solution.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.840
So the magician never tells
you how the trick works.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.520
But in science, we like
to know what's going on.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.070
So I close these
back the same way.

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:34.280
And now I'm going to
ask you a question.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.080
I have a magnet
coated with Teflon.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.390
And it's sitting on top of a
motor, which I want to turn on.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:44.374
Can you see the bars spin?

00:54:44.374 --> 00:54:45.032
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:46.490
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
And you tell me

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:48.200
what direction is
the bar spinning

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.370
when we look down at it?

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.607
What direction is it?

00:54:50.607 --> 00:54:51.440
AUDIENCE: Clockwise.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.356
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: When
you look down at it--

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:55.847
I'll slow it down a little
bit so you can see it better.

00:54:55.847 --> 00:54:56.680
AUDIENCE: Clockwise.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.600
AUDIENCE: Clockwise.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.433
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
It's spinning clockwise,

00:54:59.433 --> 00:55:00.560
what we call clockwise.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.680
Now, what I would
like you to do is

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.920
to visualize that
you're not looking down

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.480
at this spinning magnet.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.170
But you're looking up at it.

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:12.190
Imagine there is a
ceiling fan up there.

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:16.760
And it's moving in the
same direction as this bar.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.687
So what is that?

00:55:17.687 --> 00:55:20.020
Here's what some of you are
doing, is you're doing this.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:20.710
And you're looking up.

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:21.580
And what do you see?

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:22.710
What do you see up there?

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.543
AUDIENCE: The light.

00:55:23.543 --> 00:55:25.240
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Counter-clockwise.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:28.000
You're confusing me.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.480
Is this my right
hand or my left hand.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.240
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.435
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
I'm looking up at it.

00:55:32.435 --> 00:55:33.310
It's my right hand.

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:34.120
I put it down here.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:34.994
It is my?

00:55:34.994 --> 00:55:35.660
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.040
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: It's
still in my right hand.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.480
You're really confusing me.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.280
What's going on here?

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.930
Here's what's going on.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.000
I want everyone in the
audience, everyone,

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.290
stick your finger out like this.

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:50.870
And you and I are going
to rotate our fingers

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.920
in a clockwise direction.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.420
Go.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:52.940
Clockwise.

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.620
Hey, I said clockwise.

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.040
What are you doing?

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.850
Clockwise.

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:57.350
Watch me.

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.160
AUDIENCE: Clockwise.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.701
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
I'm doing-- look.

00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:03.380
When I turn around like this,
I'm doing it clockwise too.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.900
But when I turn around
like this, what do you see?

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.740
AUDIENCE: Clockwise.

00:56:08.422 --> 00:56:10.130
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
So you have to think.

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:11.870
You have to think
about the perspective

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:15.200
that you have in
making observations.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.010
By the way, where does this
idea of clockwise movement

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.420
and counter-clockwise come from?

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.320
AUDIENCE: Clocks.

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:21.780
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Clocks.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:22.321
Yeah, I know.

00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:23.337
It comes from clocks.

00:56:23.337 --> 00:56:24.389
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:24.389 --> 00:56:25.680
Where does it really come from?

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.430
Do you know?

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:29.390
AUDIENCE: The Sun.

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:31.280
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
From the sundial.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.050
It's from the sundial.

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:36.200
And as far as we
know, was the sundial

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.320
first observed in the
Northern Hemisphere

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.570
or in the Southern Hemisphere?

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.540
As far as we know, it's in
the Northern Hemisphere.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.670
So I want you to
visualize, like you

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:50.160
did with the ceiling
fan, the sundial

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.086
in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:56:52.086 --> 00:56:52.621
Oh, yeah.

00:56:52.621 --> 00:56:53.120
Right.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.310
I want you to think
about that and see

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:57.650
which direction it's going in.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:58.190
All right.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.970
It's moving.

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:03.810
So now what I want to
do, two more experiments.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:07.850
So here's a beaker.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:09.550
I have a question for you.

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:13.520
Do you suppose there's a way
for me to hold this beaker up

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.173
in the air without touching it.

00:57:15.173 --> 00:57:15.812
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:15.812 --> 00:57:17.770
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: So
let me borrow your book.

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.110
Now, it's your book, Steve.

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.910
I don't mean put it
on a book like this.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:23.530
I'm touching it right now.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:27.009
Do you suppose there's a way
to suspend this beaker up

00:57:27.009 --> 00:57:28.300
in the air without touching it?

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.293
Yes or no.

00:57:29.293 --> 00:57:29.877
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:29.877 --> 00:57:31.793
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Some
of you are saying yes

00:57:31.793 --> 00:57:33.380
because you know how it's done.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.080
And some of you are saying
yes because you trust that I'm

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.300
going to show you how to do it.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.580
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:41.455
We're going to take--

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:46.310
you're doing the
play-by-play description.

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:47.898
What is this?

00:57:47.898 --> 00:57:48.886
AUDIENCE: A balloon.

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:54.650
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: What else
can you tell me about it?

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:55.858
Does it have a color?

00:57:55.858 --> 00:57:58.279
AUDIENCE: It's blue.

00:57:58.279 --> 00:57:59.320
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Look.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:04.330
I am told the brain receives
every second about 11

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:07.450
million bits of information.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:10.070
And a brain can't sort them
all out at the same time.

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:12.160
So we have to
train ourselves how

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.737
to make observations
and report them.

00:58:13.737 --> 00:58:14.320
So here we go.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.280
Ta-da.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.630
Is the beaker up in air?

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:23.369
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:58:23.369 --> 00:58:24.868
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Am I holding it?

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:25.779
AUDIENCE: No.

00:58:25.779 --> 00:58:26.362
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:32.530
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: So can
you explain what this is?

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:33.850
I pulled it out.

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:36.780
Can you explain how this works?

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.450
Can you explain how this works?

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:40.950
So I want you to
think about this.

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.680
You also know what's going to
happen when I let the air out

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.230
of here.

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:45.210
AUDIENCE: Let go.

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:46.334
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Let go.

00:58:46.334 --> 00:58:47.850
OK, I'll let go.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:48.870
You've done that before.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:50.280
Why does that happen?

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.630
Lots of interesting
things happen in science

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:56.240
with familiar items.

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.850
So how do you explain
what happened here?

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:00.450
What?

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:01.740
You're thinking about it?

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:07.032
Some people say that when I
inflated the balloon in here,

00:59:07.032 --> 00:59:08.490
there was a change
in the pressure.

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:09.690
I want to tell you--

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.217
you can think about that too.

00:59:11.217 --> 00:59:12.300
I didn't bring it with me.

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:16.410
But I went to the glass shop
at the University of Wisconsin

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:22.020
chemistry department and I sawed
off the bottom of the beaker

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.760
and it still works.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.550
So it's not the change
in the pressure.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:28.600
But everyone here
everyone, everyone,

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.680
including the little
kids, know the explanation

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.420
as to why this works.

00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.180
But you haven't
thought about it.

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.460
You haven't connected it yet.

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:40.170
So what I'd like you to do
is take both hands right now

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:41.965
and rub them very
fast with each other.

00:59:41.965 --> 00:59:42.960
Rub very fast.

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.010
What do you feel?

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:44.970
AUDIENCE: Friction.

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:47.040
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
You feel friction?

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.860
You feel heat, which is
the result of friction.

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:52.950
As I said, you're like
the students in my class.

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:54.020
So friction.

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.900
So can friction be
related to this?

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:57.319
You think about it.

00:59:57.319 --> 00:59:58.110
You think about it.

00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:02.280
So now what I want to do
is do another experiment

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.230
with the balloon right here.

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:06.866
This time, I'll take
what color balloon?

01:00:06.866 --> 01:00:07.574
AUDIENCE: Yellow.

01:00:09.579 --> 01:00:11.620
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: This
balloon has a hole in it

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.376
so that doesn't work.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:14.125
I'll try this one.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.380
I inflate the balloon,
let some air out.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.600
And then I tie it.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.230
And now I'm going to
ask you a question.

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:31.360
Do you suppose there's a way
for me to hold this balloon up

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.080
in the air without touching it?

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.930
So I don't mean put it
in a beaker like this.

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:39.280
I'm not touching it now.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.560
Do you suppose
there's a way for me

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.083
to suspend this up in the air
without touching it, yes or no?

01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:45.666
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:00:45.666 --> 01:00:48.430
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Those
of you who say yes--

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:51.640
those of you who
say yes know how

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.680
it's done or trust that
I'm going to show you

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.150
how it's going to be done.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:00.010
So suppose I take this
balloon and I blow air in it,

01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:00.530
like this.

01:01:04.691 --> 01:01:06.690
That was held up in the
air without touching it.

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.148
But that's kind of
hard on my neck.

01:01:08.148 --> 01:01:09.580
So suppose I take--

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.530
suppose I take this.

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:12.470
What is this?

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.440
AUDIENCE: Blow dryer.

01:01:18.739 --> 01:01:20.780
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Is
the balloon up in the air?

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.680
Am I touching it?

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.477
AUDIENCE: No.

01:01:23.477 --> 01:01:25.560
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: What
is holding the balloon up

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.408
in the air.

01:01:26.408 --> 01:01:28.120
AUDIENCE: Air.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.510
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Air?

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:31.445
There's air right
now, but it's--

01:01:31.445 --> 01:01:33.070
now, you're going to
help me with that.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.210
Thank you.

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:38.241
Thank you.

01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:38.740
Thank you.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.132
AUDIENCE: Go faster.

01:01:40.132 --> 01:01:41.090
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: No.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.540
I was pushing the cold one.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.340
Look, you know.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.560
Each one of you knows.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.060
What was coming out
the nozzle here?

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.410
What was coming out of nozzle?

01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:54.280
A stream of air, right?

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.890
A stream-- wind,
that's what it was.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.280
So here we go.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.080
So do it again.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.850
Now, watch what I do here.

01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:08.260
Watch how I turn this.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.960
Watch how I turn this
to the side like this.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.510
You can see how big of an
angle you can get away with.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.390
See that.

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:19.240
See that.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.110
All right.

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:21.984
All right, I'll have it
back from you please.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.650
You're all thinking about
what the explanation is.

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:28.062
Thank you.

01:02:28.062 --> 01:02:29.770
You're all thinking
about the explanation

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:32.650
because what I'm going
to do next is take this.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:33.764
What is this?

01:02:33.764 --> 01:02:35.216
AUDIENCE: It's a ball.

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:42.960
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
A Styrofoam ball.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.864
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

01:02:45.864 --> 01:02:47.330
And a balloon.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.918
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: And
a balloon, up there.

01:02:50.918 --> 01:02:52.906
Am I touching any of them?

01:02:52.906 --> 01:02:54.530
AUDIENCE: No.

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:57.710
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: What was
holding them up in the air?

01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:59.060
Thank you.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.890
Moving air, right.

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:01.400
Look.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.990
You all know this effect.

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:05.600
You stand on a street
corner and a big bus

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.351
goes by, what do you feel?

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:07.850
Woo.

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.160
And you're driving on a
highway and the big lorry truck

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.748
passes by, what do you feel?

01:03:11.748 --> 01:03:13.152
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

01:03:13.152 --> 01:03:14.556
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:16.234 --> 01:03:17.650
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
You know what?

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:19.870
I believe you.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:21.220
That's your observation.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:24.130
I respect you for
making an observation.

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:28.920
But watch for it next time, OK?

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.270
Now, this is a
scientific principle.

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.496
You all know what
this principle is.

01:03:34.496 --> 01:03:36.120
It's named after a
Swiss mathematician.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:36.914
It's called--

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:37.580
AUDIENCE: Magic.

01:03:40.702 --> 01:03:42.910
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Bernoulli's
principle, Bernoulli.

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:43.290
Look.

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.380
You all know about this.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.880
I don't want to get too
personal about this one.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.200
You took a shower this morning.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.200
You turned the water on.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.560
Did the shower curtain
move in or out,

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.170
if you have a shower curtain?

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:55.510
Sometimes we don't
have shower curtains.

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:56.830
So there's a change.

01:03:56.830 --> 01:04:00.400
There's a stream of air that
causes things to happen,

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.210
as we just saw here.

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:04.990
So now I'm going to
do an experiment.

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:08.080
This experiment,
with this, with this.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.700
What is this?

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.617
AUDIENCE: Plastic bag.

01:04:10.617 --> 01:04:12.533
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Could
I ask you to help me

01:04:12.533 --> 01:04:13.560
with this experiment?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.220
OK.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.480
So what is it that
Lou and I are holding?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.960
A plastic what?

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.770
A piece of plastic.

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.008
What color is it?

01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:23.920
AUDIENCE: Blue.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.170
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Do I
have to ask all the questions

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:27.340
all the time?

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.210
AUDIENCE: No.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:28.710
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: No.

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:29.560
You are asking them.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.830
You have to make
these observations.

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:31.330
Look.

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:33.930
How long is it?

01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:36.330
It's about what?

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.610
Is it about 1 meter, 10 meters?

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:40.440
It's 2 meters in length.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.150
I have an opening
at this end here.

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:43.520
Do you have an opening
over there, Lou?

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:43.900
LOU: No.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.730
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: It's sealed.

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:45.000
OK.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.724
So I'm going to
change sides with you.

01:04:46.724 --> 01:04:48.640
I'm going to give you
this opening right here.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.556
You hold it like this.

01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:50.640
You got it?

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.010
And I'd like you to blow
air in here so that we

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:55.700
can count how many
breaths it's going

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.186
to take her to inflate this.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:04:59.520
And don't make her laugh now.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:04:59.760
OK.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.310
Come on, go.

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:08.210
One, two, three, four.

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.840
That's enough.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.970
I don't want you
to hyperventilate.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:12.810
You know what
hyperventilation is?

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:15.830
Is it related to
carbon dioxide gas?

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:19.940
So this is what she
did with four breaths.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.600
Now, I'm going to let the
air out that you put in there

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.300
and give you the closed end.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:30.479
And then I'm going to show
you, if you pay attention,

01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:32.270
if you pay attention,
I'm going to show you

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:36.350
how you can inflate this
two-meter long bag with one

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.866
breath.

01:05:38.866 --> 01:05:39.740
You're smiling at me.

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.120
You don't believe me.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.736
Do you remember what she did?

01:05:42.736 --> 01:05:44.360
She blew into it the
same way you and I

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.402
blow into a paper bag.

01:05:49.402 --> 01:05:50.860
So now I'm going
to do it this way.

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.830
I'm going to open
this up like this.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:55.080
I lift it up a little bit
so it's about-- yeah, right.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:55.579
Here we go.

01:05:58.610 --> 01:05:59.928
Let go.

01:05:59.928 --> 01:06:01.410
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.374
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:08.680
Did you see how it was done?

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.382
Would you like to try it?

01:06:10.382 --> 01:06:11.145
LOU: Yes.

01:06:11.145 --> 01:06:12.186
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Yeah.

01:06:12.186 --> 01:06:13.750
That's the spirit.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:17.552
See, Leonardo said, you
know, about experiments.

01:06:17.552 --> 01:06:19.990
So I take all the air out.

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.350
And now you do it
the way I did it,

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.310
not the way you did
it the first time.

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.590
One long breath,
right down the middle.

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:29.100
Whenever you're ready.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.154
Close it off.

01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:32.050
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:32.620
Only one.

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.130
Only one.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.570
A lot better than the
first time, right?

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:41.670
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.720
So here's a question for you.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.115
Do you think she has that
much air in her lungs?

01:06:47.115 --> 01:06:47.656
AUDIENCE: No.

01:06:47.656 --> 01:06:48.239
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:52.130
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Do you
think I have that much air

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:55.310
in my lungs to blow this?

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:59.050
What's the explanation?

01:06:59.050 --> 01:06:59.550
What?

01:07:05.704 --> 01:07:08.120
Well, the thing-a-ma-jigger
doesn't have much in air in it

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.280
right now.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.260
So look.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.460
You all know the
explanation for this

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.100
because we just went through
it in the previous set

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.230
of experiments.

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:24.360
What did I blow out of my
mouth and what did she do?

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.346
A stream of moving air.

01:07:28.346 --> 01:07:30.220
Remember, one of my
slides says connectivity.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.512
You make connections.

01:07:31.512 --> 01:07:33.220
You make connections
between what you see

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.750
and what you already know.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.600
So a stream of
moving air creates

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.300
a partial vacuum and air
comes in from the outside.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.050
That's called "what's
his name" principle.

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:43.002
What's his name?

01:07:43.002 --> 01:07:43.906
AUDIENCE: Bernoulli.

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.660
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: The
whole thing was a setup.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.350
You knew that.

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:50.430
That's why-- OK.

01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:51.870
So here's our grand finale.

01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:58.650
Here's our grand finale.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.860
It's a repeat of
that experiment,

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.340
which we're going to do.

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:05.030
In this, you're doing the
play-by-play description.

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:06.344
What is it?

01:08:06.344 --> 01:08:07.300
AUDIENCE: Black.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.288
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Black what?

01:08:09.288 --> 01:08:11.290
AUDIENCE: Black tub.

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:12.540
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Black tub.

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.617
And what is this?

01:08:14.617 --> 01:08:15.408
AUDIENCE: Cylinder.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:28.319
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: And I take
a clear and colorless liquid

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.682
from this bottle.

01:08:29.682 --> 01:08:32.147
And I put it in there.

01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:37.540
And this clear and
colorless liquid

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:43.880
is 30% hydrogen peroxide,
35% hydrogen peroxide.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.689
And I take what?

01:08:47.489 --> 01:08:48.655
I put some of this in there.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:58.779
But I want to help the hydrogen
peroxide break down into water

01:08:58.779 --> 01:09:00.950
and oxygen. So what do I need?

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:02.529
I need a catalyst.

01:09:02.529 --> 01:09:04.090
I could use manganese dioxide.

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:06.100
But it's not the only catalyst.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.720
I'm going to use this
liquid right here.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.455
This is a clear, but
slightly colored liquid.

01:09:14.455 --> 01:09:15.330
It's slightly yellow.

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:18.295
So I'm going to put some of that
in there and see what happens.

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:25.720
AUDIENCE: It's yellow.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.768
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
What's happening?

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:40.880
You're doing the play-by-play
description, not me.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.720
Ah, it's going out
of control here.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.591
I better put it down here.

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:04.300
So this is that the
decomposition of hydrogen

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.520
peroxide using potassium iodide
solution as the catalyst.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.910
So the different catalyst caused
a lot of different changes

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:14.120
to happen.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.270
And this is why we
need to learn more

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:21.850
about the science of the
familiar, which is chemistry.

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:26.430
And I want to really
thank you for coming

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.830
this afternoon-- this evening.

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:35.080
I want to ask you one more
time, what does my T-shirt say?

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.960
AUDIENCE: Science is fun.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.040
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: That's what
I like, enthusiasm, science.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.260
So whatever you do,
do it-- do it-- do it

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:47.390
with a purpose in mind.

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:52.321
Try to help the
plasticity in your brain.

01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:54.570
But it's not just your brain
that we're talking about.

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:56.460
It's what's in your heart.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.850
Because one of the important
elements of communication

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:03.380
is what you feel in your
heart, which is not something

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:04.620
that was on my slide.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.150
So thank you all very much.

01:11:06.150 --> 01:11:06.900
Thank you, Steve.

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.856
Thank you, Lou.

01:11:07.856 --> 01:11:09.290
Thank you, everybody.

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:10.730
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:16.250
And remember, no matter
what you do, science is fun.

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:17.150
Thank you very much.

01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:17.650
Thanks.

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:19.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
