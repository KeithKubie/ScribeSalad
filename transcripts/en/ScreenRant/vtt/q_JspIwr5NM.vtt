00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.740
With the billions of dollars being spent on
blockbuster films, it's hard to watch an epic

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.750
action, fantasy, or science fiction movie
just once. But even with repeat viewings,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.820
some awesome or unbelievable details always
seem to slip by viewers' eyes. We're determined

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.099
to fill fans in on every cool easter egg or
inside reference, so we hope you enjoy Screen

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.970
Rant's 10 Amazing Hidden Details in Movies.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.970
Pearl Harbor&nbsp;(Buena Vista)

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.610
Plenty of cash was spent on the special effects
of Pearl Harbor, but apparently, either director

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.540
Michael Bay or the special effects team decided
they still had room for some fun. Once the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.329
movie made it to home video, fans started
noticing a standout extra among the wounded

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.710
sailors. As strange as it may seem, it appears
that Bruce Willis' tough-as-nails cop John

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.180
McClane has been spliced out of Die Hard,
and into the WWII-era drama. Since the footage

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.940
of a bruised, battered McClane in an undershirt
isn't an exact match to any Die Hard scene,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.110
some skeptics say it's all coincidence. But
the size and perspective shows it's clearly

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.830
an added digital effect, and one that can
never be missed once it's pointed out.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.830
The Matrix&nbsp;(Warner Bros.)

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.160
Most fans of The Wachowski's game-changing
sci-fi series know that the movie's plot forms

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.930
a perfect circle: the hotel and room 303 where
the movie begins is also the same place where

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.750
Neo becomes "The One". But fans probably missed
an even bigger example. The first movie ended

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.080
with a serious phone call, as Neo told the
Machines that he planned on freeing humanity.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.110
Two sequels followed, but when Neo finally
ended the war in his epic battle with Agent

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.651
Smith, their fight is set at that exact intersection.
When the two slam into the street, you can

00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:40.470
even catch a glimpse of the phonebooth from
the first film. Talk coming full circle.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.470
Iron Man&nbsp;(Marvel/Disney)

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.170
Tony Stark found out the hard way that even
friends can't be trusted, when his business

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.200
partner Obadiah Stane revealed he was funding
terrorists. But Iron Man should have known

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.170
he was up to no good long before. When Tony
finds Stane playing some piano in his Malibu

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.970
mansion, it's not a random bit of music, but
a sample of Antonio Salieri's Piano Concerto

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.860
in C. 
Music buffs, or those who saw the movie Amadeus

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.400
will get the hint, since Salieri was long
rumored to have sabotaged and killed Mozart.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.700
The composers' rivalry wasn't anywhere close
to Stark and Stane's but the hint was there

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.700
all along.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.470
The LEGO Movie&nbsp;(Warner Bros.)

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.640
Directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord beat
the odds when they made a movie about LEGO

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.040
a worldwide hit. The film even included Superman
and Green Lantern, played by Channing Tatum

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.290
and Jonah Hill, the stars of their previous
surprise hit, the rebooted 21 Jump Street.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.750
It wasn't the only nod to the story of undercover
cops, though. When Emmet's apartment is first

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.320
shown, a poster can be seen advertising the
movie "Teen Copz," an obvious reference to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.280
Jump Street. But the poster next to it takes
the cake, since the Tatum/Hill comedy really

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.390
was sold to Russian audiences as "Macho and
the Nerd".

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.950
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&nbsp;(Warner
Bros.)

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.470
For those not versed in Harry Potter mythology,
we'll just say that to bring down Lord Voldemort,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.070
the three Deathly Hallows were sort of an
important combination. It wasn't until the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.510
second last book that audiences learned that
a cloak, stone, and Elder Wand held the key

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.130
to victory, but the idea was teased ahead
of time. As in, two full movies ahead of time.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.920
In one of the franchise's best easter eggs,
Dumbledore tells Harry that he's been searching

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.760
for such a detail. The answer is literally
right in front of him, in the form of a 3d

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.940
version of the Deathly Hallows symbols stored
in his own office.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.900
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol&nbsp;(Paramount
Pictures)

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.650
Every fan of Disney and Pixar knows to keep
an eye out for the code "A113," the room number

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.910
that the studio's top animators all studied
in when attending the California Institute

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.170
of the Arts. But it doesn't stop at animated
movies. When Brad Bird graduated from directing

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.090
movies like The Incredibles and Ratatouille
to Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, he made

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.480
sure to give a nod to his roots. Watch closely,
and you'll spot the code on a trick ring used

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.970
by IMF agents to inject a sleeping agent into
their unsuspecting target.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.500
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&nbsp;(Lionsgate)

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.709
The Hunger Games series took a major step
up in budget and spectacle with its second

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.480
installment, but not every addition was taken
completely seriously. When Katniss and Peeta

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.280
are heading out to make their grand entrance
before the next Games, the doorway they pass

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.569
under is clearly marked with the code PDL-736.
The meaning isn't complicated, it's just an

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.090
address: 736 Ponce de Leon Avenue, a hip hop
nightclub that the cast would frequent when

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.680
filming in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680
Man of Steel&nbsp;(Warner Bros.)

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.880
Zack Snyder and Warner Bros. wanted to make
a clean start with Man of Steel, but that

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.919
didn't mean the director wanted to ignore
the version of the DC hero who came before,

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.400
specifically, the original films from director
Richard Donner. The updated version of the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.530
ship that brought Kal-El to Earth played a
big part in the story, but when Kal-El had

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.930
his escape explained by his father Jor-El,
the version of the ship is obviously modelled

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.530
after Donner's version, not Snyder's.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.970
The Avengers Age of Ultron&nbsp;(Marvel/Disney)

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.090
It wasn't just powerful fighters or alien
invaders that Marvel's Avengers had to tackle

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.410
in their second team-up, but a girl who could
force them to face their worst fears, or tempt

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.530
them with a better life. For Captain America,
that meant sending him back to a USO soiree

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.780
before he was frozen for decades. Pay attention
to the band though: the Roy Thomas Players

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.350
aren't named after a musician, but a Marvel
Comics legend. Roy Thomas spent years writing

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.780
X-Men, Avengers, Doctor Strange, and even
created modern characters like Adam Warlock,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.740
and Vision, who makes his movie debut in the
same film.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.020
Star Trek Into Darkness&nbsp;(Paramount)

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.530
Before Chris Hemsworth was famous as the Marvel
hero Thor, he splashed onto the scene playing

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.530
Captain Kirk's father George. The 2009 reboot
saw George killed in battle aboard the USS

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.530
Kelvin, but his legacy, and that of the ship,
lived on. In the sequel, fans were probably

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.340
too busy trying to make sense of the bomb
plot and blood transfusions to notice that

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.840
the scene of the disaster was the Kelvin Memorial
Archive. Named for Kirk's ship, it means the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.210
destruction of the Kelvin set the plots of
both films in motion - a subtle nod that only

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.760
the diehard fans might have caught.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.680
