[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome to Talks
at Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.460
My grandmother grew up in a
small village outside of Rome.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.800
If there were no tomatoes in the
garden, you had the zucchini.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.800
If you wanted eggs for
breakfast, check with the hen.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.040
Today, we have access to
whatever foods we want,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.270
when we want, but
what is the trade off?

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.536
Is the convenience worth
it if we are putting our

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:33.200
and our children's
health in jeopardy?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.310
Why has there been a spike in
chronic illness in our youth,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.780
and what can we
do to prevent it?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.600
In her book, "The
Dirt Cure," Dr. Maya

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.440
asks these questions
and many more

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.340
regarding allergies,
medications, and the foods

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.460
we eat, and how they will affect
our generation and the next.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.490
It reveals to us why
dirt is the new healthy.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.260
With that, please help
me welcome Dr. Maya

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.820
Shetreat-Klein.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.020
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: Thank you.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.470
Hello.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.990
All right.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.450
So I'm going to be talking
about something pretty

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.690
low tech in one of the
highly technological places

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.510
in the country.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.355
And I want to start
for a minute just

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.100
to ask you to close your
eyes, and I want you

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.330
to picture what a healthy
person looks like.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.670
It could be a
healthy kid, could be

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.260
a healthy adult. Just close
your eyes and kind of picture

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.035
that for a second.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.410
And open your eyes, and can you
tell me what kind of qualities

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.790
you noticed in the person
in your imagination,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.040
the healthy person?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.987
Yell it out.

00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:49.820
AUDIENCE: Skin tone.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.111
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: Skin tone.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:51.890
AUDIENCE: Smiling.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.090
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN:
Smiling, OK.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.727
What?

00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:57.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.930
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN:
Energetic, great.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.600
OK, so the reason that
I ask this question

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.190
is because we spend a lot of
time thinking about disease

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.370
and sickness, and I think
we've forgotten a little bit

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.570
what healthy really
looks like and what

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.809
we're kind of aiming for.

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:16.850
And you know, it's funny.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.130
When I talk to
doctors in particular,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.290
they're often kind of
stumped by this question

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.810
because for them, health is
often the absence of disease.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.510
You're not sick.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.490
You're healthy.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.990
But I don't actually agree
that that's the case,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.470
and there's this
attitude in medicine

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.590
you should be happy
you're not dead.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.470
That's kind of where--
however you want to give birth

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.960
or however you want to--
whatever kind of intervention

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.787
you've had in the hospital,
if you're alive, you're happy.

00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:47.370
So that's not always
true, and I think

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.790
health is more than
the absence of disease,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.651
and it's not just a reflection
of whether we face stressors

00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:55.650
or show symptoms, right?

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.380
People will come to me and
say, oh, I'm so healthy.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.210
I never get sick.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.970
I never have a cold, or my
kid never gets ear infection.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.030
Yes, great.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.300
That can be very good, but
that's not all that health is,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.010
and it's not simply lab
results or other kinds

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.200
of scientific measures.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.700
I get a lot of that when
I talk to doctors too.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.000
So health really
reflects the relationship

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.800
between your internal and
your external terrain, OK?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.570
So health is
really-- it's fluid.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.230
It's a relationship.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.240
And it's something
that is always in flux.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.190
So health really
manifests as resilience,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.240
and resilience is the
ability to bounce back.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.060
So really, it's not so
much the stressors, right?

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.220
Stressors are inevitable.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.420
And actually, they're
necessary to build resilience.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.230
If you don't have
those stressors,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.040
then it's much less
likely that you're going

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.300
to be resilient and healthy.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.010
Now, chronic disease is rising
in children and in adults,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.550
and I like this little
cartoon because when I first

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.000
started practicing
medicine, I had

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.560
a lot of kids who came to me.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.000
So I treat both kids and
adults, but mostly kids.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.940
And I kept finding that kids
were coming in on three, four,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.212
five, six different
prescription medications.

00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:23.670
Over the course of
the year, they'd

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.307
be on their asthma medication.

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:26.640
They'd be on their allergy meds.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.980
They'd have their
steroids for their skin.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.480
They'd be getting maybe
Ritalin, or maybe they'd

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.250
be getting an
antidepressant for anxiety.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.820
There was a long list.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.140
They'd get their Miralax
for constipation, right?

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.400
So there's always
a lot going on even

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.950
with kids, let
alone adults, right?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.260
So chronic disease
actually, I believe, results

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.840
from a lack of resilience, and
there's science to show this.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.280
Sometimes I say
things that people

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.640
have a hard time
believing, so I like

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.181
to have lots of
scientific references

00:04:57.181 --> 00:05:00.100
so you can always see that
I'm not just making it up

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.690
and it's not just
a theory of my own.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.060
This is from a journal
called "Mitochondrion."

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.350
Bob [INAUDIBLE], who is
an amazing mitochondrial

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.710
researcher in California, who
talks about the cell danger

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.470
response-- and the
cell danger response

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.420
is this metabolic response
that protects cells and hosts

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.590
from harm.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.250
And basically, any kind
of stressor-- chemical,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.690
physical, biologic
stressors that

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.380
exceed the cellular
capacity for homeostasis,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.940
to stay in balance, triggers
this cell danger response,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.460
and the cell starts to
function differently,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.940
kind of in defensive mode.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.200
And it's hard when
you're in defensive mode

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.970
to function optimally, right?

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.441
Because you're not going to
be-- you're not creative.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.940
You're not-- I mean,
think about it.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.720
If you're in a
defensive state, you

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.340
don't have all your resources
to dedicate to moving forward

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.610
and to progressing.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.430
So after the danger's been
eliminated or neutralized,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.090
then there's a
choreographed sequence

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.990
of these anti-inflammatory
and regenerative pathways

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.940
that actually reverse
the cell danger response

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.390
and allow healing.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.060
But sometimes the cell danger
response persists abnormally,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.280
and then whole body metabolism,
including the gut microbiome,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.830
are disturbed and it can
lead to multiple organ system

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.160
impairment, and behavior
changes, and chronic illness.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.710
This is straight from the paper.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.290
And this is just an example
of that in a neuron.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.210
So we have these microglia.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.310
And microglia are these
nurse cells in the brain.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.790
We have three microglia for
every one neuron in the brain.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.150
So they're pretty important.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.750
We've ignored them
for a long time.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.460
We do that in medicine, just
kind of say, oh, you're extra.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.460
No, not so much.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.420
They're actually nurse cells and
they take care of our neurons

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.050
when things are going nicely.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.790
Then when there's
this stressor, we

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.610
have that cell danger response,
the microglia become mama bear.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.540
They go from being nurturing,
nursing to being kind of ooh,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.320
aggressive, releasing all
these inflammatory cytokines,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.280
chemokines, and excitotoxins.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.720
And it causes a lot of
disruption for the neuron.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.070
So that is called
microglial activation.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.420
And it's basically implicated
in all different kinds

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.440
of neurologic conditions,
from ADHD and autism,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.820
to Tourette's, to seizures,
to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's--

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.880
basically you name the
chronic neurologic illness,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.220
microglial activation
is implicated.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.490
And there's a
whole, what we call,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.920
immunoexcitotoxicity cascade
that happens in that process.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.280
And then if the cell
danger response dissipates,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.290
then these microglia
go back to releasing

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.780
growth factors and
anti-inflammatory cytokines

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.970
that help regenerate the
neurons that were damaged,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.370
and become the
nurse cells again.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.700
So this is kind of the process.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.670
And it's happening with
different kinds of cells

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.800
throughout the body.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.740
And because I'm a neurologist,
I focus on the brain.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.060
OK.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.490
So what could cause the
cell danger response?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.674
What could trigger that?

00:08:11.674 --> 00:08:13.090
There's a whole
lot of things that

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.900
are different in our bodies
that start from preconception,

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.400
really.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.030
But let's say we're talking
about our microbiome, so

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.760
our flora.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.170
And the microbiome
is in the gut.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.260
It's also on the skin.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.860
It's also in our
nasal passageways.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.000
There's a lot of different
microbiomes in our body.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.090
So that can be
affected by, let's say,

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.740
how we were born-- c-section
versus vaginal delivery.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.320
Formula feeding
versus breastfeeding.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.740
All of these things
influence our microbiome.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.760
And our microbiome is
influencing our immune system.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.270
And our immune system is
influencing this cell danger

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.640
response.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.560
Chronic use of antibiotics.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.770
So recently a study
came out that showed

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.280
that one round of antibiotics
can change your microbiome

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.450
for an entire year.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.600
So that-- if we
think about, let's

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.916
say, those people who
got a lot of bronchitis,

00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:09.290
let's say, or the kids who
are getting ear infections all

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.590
the time, getting three rounds
of antibiotics a year, four.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.980
A lot of people will come to me
and they'll say, oh, you know.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.030
I say, well, so has your child
ever been on antibiotics?

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.000
And they say, oh, no
more than anyone else.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.730
Well, how many times?

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.500
Oh, maybe five times a year.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.760
I'm like, what if I told
you some people never

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.280
are on antibiotics?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.660
Maybe that's not so normal.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.080
That's affecting the microbiome.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.040
Things like acetaminophen,
Tylenol, ibuprofen, steroids,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.860
all of those things
are impacting it.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.580
Vaccines and other
pharmaceuticals

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.970
are always influencing
microbiome,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.530
even ones that we don't think--
like certain pharmaceuticals

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.590
that we wouldn't
imagine necessarily

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.910
are influencing the microbiome,
like certain mood stabilizers,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.889
can actually do that.

00:09:52.889 --> 00:09:54.430
And sometimes that
can be why they're

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.080
associated with weight gain.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.000
Processed food, pesticides,
and then too much time

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.650
indoors, because that actually
does influence our microbiome,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.380
as you'll see.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.490
So this is kind of a little
bit our terrain right now.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.220
And it's a little
different, let's say,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.840
than it was when I was a kid.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.370
Very different than when
my parents were kids.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.160
And our current health
paradigm is really

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.280
this-- avoid, avoid,
avoid, avoid, avoid.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.660
Whatever it is, you
should avoid it.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.310
Don't get dirty.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.300
Don't get out there.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.640
We need to protect
ourselves from everything,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.800
everything dirty.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.680
And so I just like to put
this slide in because I think

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.720
it really tells us something.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.720
We can't fight nature.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.330
We are nature.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.520
So if we're fighting
it, then it's

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.880
going to be-- we're in trouble.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.400
And we need to start
getting into this paradigm

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.400
because the paradigm
we're in right now

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.630
is actually not
making us healthier.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.590
Partly this is because our
bodies crave complexity.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.809
We think there's some
kind of magic bullet.

00:11:03.809 --> 00:11:06.100
We were led to believe it
was pharmaceuticals that were

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.630
going to be the magic bullet.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.840
I'm not saying I'm not thankful
that we have pharmaceuticals.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.580
I think they have a place.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.660
There have been times
I've praised God that we

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.620
had x, y, or z pharmaceuticals.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.770
So it's not that.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.430
But we are very
reliant on that instead

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.390
of looking at what really
the magic bullet is,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.600
which is biodiversity.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.110
And I want to talk about
that a little bit more.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.160
So our nutrition
and our stressors

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.460
really come from our terrain.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:45.070
And so I want to take that
moment to say what is terrain.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.860
And I-- well, terrain
is really many things.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.340
But one of the big things
I think it is, is dirt.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.460
And I kind of use dirt as a
way to talk about terrain.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.820
And dirt is three main things.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.790
It's germs and microbes.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.670
It's fresh food
from healthy soil.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.340
And it's time in nature.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.980
So let's talk about
germs and microbes.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.060
We all know about
germ theory, right?

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:16.140
Our old friend Louis Pasteur,
father of pasteurization,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.940
said diseases are caused
by microorganisms.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.030
These small organisms, too small
to see without magnification,

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.271
invade humans, animals,
and other living hosts.

00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:26.270
Their growth and reproduction
within their hosts

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.760
can cause a disease.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.030
We are sitting ducks.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.530
Something will invade
us, it will make us sick,

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.300
and we could die.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.080
And when the whole
germ theory came out,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.040
it was so-- people
became so frightened

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.630
of germs that actually
even fermented

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.610
foods which were traditionally
eaten-- even yogurt,

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.170
even sourdough bread-- was
considered contaminated.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.390
And it was sort of
pushed aside because they

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.820
thought, well, germs, bad.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.520
Contamination.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.470
Louis Pasteur actually
had a colleague

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.560
at the same time
named Claude Bernard.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.720
And he actually
had a different--

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.650
they were kind of, I would
say, friendly competitors,

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.420
or "frenemies," as
my tween would say.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.860
And he had this idea that
he called cellular theory.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.900
He said, "Most
microbial diseases

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.520
are caused by organisms
present in the body

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.550
of a normal individual.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.440
And they become the
cause of disease

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.880
when a disturbance
arises which upsets

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.080
the equilibrium of the body."

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.360
Well, from everything
we're learning--

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.480
and I'm going to get into
this a little bit more--

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.080
this actually may
have real merit.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.450
And so I call this
the terrain theory.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.360
And the story goes that
at the end of his life,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.860
Louis Pasteur actually said
that his colleague was right.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.810
He said, it's not the microbe.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.080
It's the terrain.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.987
The microbe is nothing.

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:53.820
That's what he said.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.390
So now our paradigm
is starting to change.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.460
Probiotics.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.131
Does anyone here
take probiotics?

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.130
You don't have to disclose
if you don't want to.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.000
But can you imagine, let's
say, 10, 15 years ago,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.060
if you would have
said to your doctor,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.520
I'm going to take bacteria on
purpose in a pill every day.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.370
They would have been
like, you're nuts.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.660
Now they're saying,
hey, take probiotics.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.660
Saccharomyces
boulardi is a yeast.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.480
It's a probiotic
yeast which is used

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.960
to treat clostridium
difficile, C-diff,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.050
which can be a deadly
infection that can

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.430
be resistant to antibiotics.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.050
There's a microvirome
and oncolytic viruses.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.180
I'm going to talk
about that in a minute.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.760
So it's not just the bacteria,
but it's also the viruses.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.920
Soil-based organisms
are now a thing.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.570
We're actually looking now at
soil for the next antibiotics

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.590
that are going to not become
resistant, essentially,

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.090
because they're
organisms themselves.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.930
Fecal microbial transplant,
has anyone heard of that?

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:55.970
It's been in the papers.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.780
This is happening
in academic centers.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.255
We are giving people
other people's stool.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.000
We're stepping out of
the avoid, avoid, avoid.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.830
We're finally starting
to understand maybe

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.871
that's not going to work.

00:15:07.871 --> 00:15:09.840
And actually, maybe
you've also seen recently

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.630
in the paper vaginal
microbial transfer, which

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.550
is being done in
hospitals for babies

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.820
that are born by c-section.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.550
Now, there's so
much more than just

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.710
having a little
swab of fluid going

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.796
into the mouth of the
baby, but it's something.

00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:25.170
Because what we're
doing is we're

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.210
recognizing that
what we've been doing

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:32.220
might not be helping
for optimal health,

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.210
and may be even contributing
to chronic illness.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.670
So I said biodiversity.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.340
And what does that mean, and
why do I say it's important?

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.480
So has everyone heard of
the hygiene hypothesis?

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.860
The hygiene hypothesis basically
said kids who grew up on farms

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.342
are less allergic than
kids who grow up in cities.

00:15:51.342 --> 00:15:53.050
And they said, well,
it's because they're

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.700
exposed to germs.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.300
And so some researchers
went and said,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.060
OK, we're going to measure
the number of microbes

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.250
in an urban apartment and
we're going to compare it

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.300
to microbes on a farm.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.440
And what do you
think they found?

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.330
The number of organisms
were about equal.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.000
So it wasn't that different.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.850
But the variety on the farm
was very, very diverse.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.670
And there were many
fewer kinds of organisms

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.390
in the urban apartment.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.370
So this idea actually
that high diversity

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.950
is what actually helps
reduce the risk of asthma,

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.240
allergic disease,
autoimmune disease.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.450
And so this is actually
now really kind

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.890
of a biodiversity hypothesis.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.885
It's not exactly the
hygiene hypothesis.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.800
Well, what about viruses?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.540
Because, OK, we know
about bacteria being good.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.012
We've got the probiotics,
all of that stuff.

00:16:57.012 --> 00:16:57.970
But what about viruses?

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.580
Those are bad, right?

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.160
Well there was actually this
fantastic paper that came out

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.079
in "Nature" at the end of 2014.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.010
And it was talking
about something

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.650
called murine norovirus,
which was given

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.450
to mice that were germ free.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.109
So they basically sterilize
the mice as best they can.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.440
And we know that when
you get antibiotics,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.720
and you're germ
free, it actually

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.930
disrupts the way your
digestive tract functions.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.369
So you have-- your gut is
a little bit of a mess.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.760
Your immune system is disrupted.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.230
A lot of things change.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.980
Well, in the mice that got this
virus-- were given or exposed

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.470
to this virus-- the
viruses actually took

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.480
over for the bacteria
completely as

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.390
if there was no
disruption at all.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.000
So these viruses
mimicked the effect

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.510
of the commensal
bacteria of the gut.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.130
And so that actually
kind of gives us

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.480
this idea of this
microvirome, like what

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.890
are all the things
we're doing, how does

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.220
that affect the microvirome?

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.010
And then we kind of have this
new literature coming out

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.900
about the relationship
between viruses and cancer.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.560
So what we've
thought as doctors--

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.120
what I learned in
my training-- is

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.780
that certain viruses
actually can put you

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.210
at a higher risk for cancer.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.860
Now what we're learning is
that certain viruses actually

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.540
are protective.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.090
So for instance, there
are a few papers now

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:34.240
out about mumps and the risk of
developing ovarian cancer later

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:34.740
in life.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.250
So if you had mumps
as a child, you

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.000
have half the risk of
developing ovarian cancer.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.250
That's pretty--

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.840
And at first it seemed
like an association.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.180
Maybe it's just kind of random.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.940
Maybe it's-- it could
have been a lot of things.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:55.040
But they actually found that
there are certain proteins that

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.830
are different if you
had the mumps that

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.210
are circulating for life.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.920
So it's not just random.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.740
There are actually some better--
there's better data now.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.660
And we're also learning
about measles virus,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.630
which acts as an oncolytic.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:16.150
So difficult to treat
cancers are now-- they're

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:21.080
now exploring measles, injecting
measles into these cancers,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.260
like glioblastoma
multiforme, which

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.080
is very difficult to
treat, pancreatic cancer,

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.110
another very difficult
to treat cancer.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.550
And in many cases, measles
seems to have an impact.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.760
Now, I mean, again, is
this the be all end all?

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.820
No, of course not.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.360
But what we're learning is
it changes the immune system.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.420
And actually just
yesterday a new paper

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.420
came out about chicken pox.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.870
And having chicken
pox reduced the risk

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.380
of developing gliomas,
another kind of brain tumor,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.540
by more than 20%.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.100
And the authors of the
study said this does not

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.440
seem to be random.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.709
It seems very clear.

00:20:03.709 --> 00:20:05.500
In fact, the people
who had chicken pox who

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.370
did develop gliomas had a
much less aggressive glioma

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.700
and had a better course.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:17.840
So we have to let the juices
flow here and think, what

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.850
does it mean, getting dirty?

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.390
What does it mean,
getting germy?

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.120
What is really
best for our health

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.290
and how do we look
at the whole picture?

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.350
Parasites.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.930
So pretty unequivocally,
nobody is really

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.870
too interested in
getting worms, right?

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.990
No one wants that.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.040
But what if I told you
that in populations

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.570
who have endemic helminths--
parasitic worms--

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.070
they actually have
a much lower risk

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.080
of developing type 2 diabetes.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.250
And that also goes
for type 1 diabetes.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.610
So there's an association.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.890
The top of that slide
is where there's

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.970
a high incidence
of type 1 diabetes

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:07.130
and the bottom map is where
there's a high risk of having

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.710
endemic parasites.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.070
And so diabetes is
much more common

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.710
where there's no
endemic helminths.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.660
So now actually one
of the treatments

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.660
I didn't put on my
list before is actually

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.630
that we're infecting--
experimentally

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.330
infecting people with
autoimmune conditions

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.160
with parasites as a treatment.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.610
And that is looking
to be quite effective

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.720
in certain conditions.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.120
And everything from
inflammatory bowel disease,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.120
to celiac, to type 1
diabetes, even asthma,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.270
there's research going on
right now on this idea.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.580
And here, a paper,
"The emerging role

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.500
of helminths in the treatment of
inflammatory bowel disorders."

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.080
And what they say--
because I just

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.880
thought this was fascinating--
in the end of the paper

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.430
is the relationship between
humans and nematodes

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.040
of the gastrointestinal
tract can

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.370
be considered as
a mutualism rather

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.066
than a typical parasitism.

00:22:04.066 --> 00:22:07.450
So maybe we should be
friends with our microbes

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.810
instead of being at war.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:15.000
And maybe we should be thinking
more about our resilient health

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.730
rather than avoid,
avoid, avoid, avoid.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.380
Attack, attack, attack.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.420
And this is really a
different paradigm.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.070
And here's just a paper looking
at the experimental hookworm

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.210
infection in people
who have celiac.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.310
So what was really
interesting, I

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.440
thought, from this
paper was actually

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.320
that the people who had the
experimental hookworm infection

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.010
had a tremendous increase
in diversity of microbes.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.650
They had a much
richer microbiome when

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.240
they had helminth infection.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.842
So and that seems to really
regulate the immune system.

00:22:52.842 --> 00:22:54.300
And if you think
about it, in a lot

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.440
of these conditions--
autoimmune conditions,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.190
for instance, or allergic
conditions-- a lot of times

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.250
people are getting frequent
rounds of antibiotics

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.910
because their immune
systems are so dysregulated.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.480
And actually what
we may be doing

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.380
is creating more of
a destructive pathway

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.590
rather than a
regenerative pathway.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.490
OK, let's move to a
cheerful topic of food

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.290
coming from healthy soil.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.280
So again, fresh food
from healthy soil.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.190
That is about biodiversity.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.830
And what we've learned is
that our diet-- the diversity

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.990
of our diet influences also the
diversity of our microbiome.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.320
Not so surprising.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.440
Food is the embodiment
of our terrain.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.570
We eat animals and plants.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.920
Animals live on plants.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.810
And plants live on soil,
sun, water, and rocks.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.830
And we basically
ingest all of that.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.410
There are also the microbes.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.710
Plants actually have their
own microbiome, as do animals.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.310
And mycorrhizae, which
live along the roots

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:57.560
and connect-- they're sort
of the plant internet--

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.090
that connects all
the plants so they

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:00.890
can communicate with
each other and act

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.300
as community, essentially,
even though they're non-mobile.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.020
So they can't come
be together so well,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.510
but they can communicate
with each other.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.996
And actually the
mycorrhizae also

00:24:10.996 --> 00:24:12.870
help with nutrition for
the plants and so on.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.600
So when we're eating, we're
really part of this community.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.030
And we're really
internalizing that community

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.040
to become part of
our own bodies.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.840
So nutritional
depletion makes us

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.620
vulnerable to chronic illness.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.610
So we talked about
avoid, avoid, avoid.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.660
Well, depletion is-- when we're
talking about that resilient

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.740
body, and we're talking
about the terrain theory,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.950
remember it's really
not the microbe.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.810
It's the terrain.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.560
We need that
nutritional richness.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.670
So nutrient density
is kind of the theme.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.120
What I do if a patient
comes to my office, whatever

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.490
their problem is, and
however severe it is,

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:50.860
people are often shocked.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.069
Let's say a kid is coming
in with a lot of seizures.

00:24:54.069 --> 00:24:56.110
And it's not to say I'm
not going to do something

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.150
about the symptoms.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.040
But at the same
time, there's no way

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.890
that I'm going to be able to
really heal or reverse illness

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.970
if the person is not
nourished and they don't have

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.030
the tools within their bodies.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.800
So even if you're
giving medication,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.740
people respond much
better when they're

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.150
eating nutrient-dense food.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.720
And of course, they have
to be able to absorb it,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.840
so you need to know a
little bit about gut health.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.050
But the first thing is
what are you eating.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.880
So reserve is key.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.800
And nourishment
really equals reserve.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.760
A nutrient density
creates the resilience.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.620
So we have to think really
about quality of food.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.720
We're thinking about
the macronutrient.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.370
We're thinking about where
it's grown, how it's grown.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.940
What happens when it's grown?

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.250
What kind of chemicals
are being put on it?

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.910
How is that affecting the
microbiome of the soil?

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.760
How is that affecting the
microbiome of the plants?

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.010
What happens after it's grown?

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.430
How is it processed?

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.690
So one thing we know for
instance about wheat.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.150
A lot of people
talk about gluten.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:01.190
Gluten bothers them.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.357
Is it really all gluten?

00:26:02.357 --> 00:26:03.190
Well, we don't know.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:07.600
But what we do know is that
wheat is sprayed pretty heavily

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.150
with Roundup right
before it's harvested

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:15.260
because it's a drying agent and
it essentially creates a better

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.960
harvest because the
seeds are released.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.580
And then that basically
is then taken off

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.030
and becomes our flour and
the wheat that we're eating,

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.980
and it just had this
application of a chemical which

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.320
impacts our microbiome,
impacts our health.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.550
So these are questions.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.870
Because it's not obvious
when you look at bread,

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.030
what happened before
the wheat came.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.650
And that's why it's not
just a hipster thing

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.540
to say where did
this food come from.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.600
It's a very real issue which,
until not that long ago,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.550
we all really cared
about and knew.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.170
Well, we cared, but
it really didn't

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.530
matter because our
food came from nearby.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.590
Now it's very different.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.100
And how quickly is it eaten?

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.660
That's actually
part of it, as well.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.870
And how is it prepared?

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.840
So for instance, some people
have a hard time tolerating

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.300
grains, or beans, or nuts.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.520
So soaking them, sprouting
them, or fermenting them

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.070
can actually-- which
is traditionally

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.340
how people ate those
kinds of things, the seed

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.940
family of food-- actually
makes it much more

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.000
nutrient dense for us.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.720
Because seeds are intended to
survive our intestinal tract.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.330
Because really, things
like grain, or nuts,

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.790
or whatever are plants
wanting to reproduce.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.730
And so they have a
lot of different kinds

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.371
of compounds that protect
them from our digestive tract.

00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:37.870
And we're the animals that are
supposed to eat them and then

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.760
walk somewhere, and
in our scat leave them

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.270
somewhere so they can grow.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.520
That's not happening
so much right now.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.986
But that's really the idea.

00:27:45.986 --> 00:27:48.360
And that's why it's hard for
us to break everything down,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.900
because we're not intended
to be able to do it.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.983
So we have to do it through
the way we prepare it.

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.880
And nutrition is
all of these things.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.010
It's the macronutrients.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.200
It's the micronutrients.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.430
It's phytonutrients, as well.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.980
All the things that make
plants different colors

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.690
are actually the phytonutrients.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.890
Microbes, stem
cells, pheromones,

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.050
and little traces of soil.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.470
If you go to the
farmer's market,

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.350
for instance, maybe
you're not going

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.940
to get that highly
power-washed stuff.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.584
Maybe you're going to see
there's a little dirt still

00:28:20.584 --> 00:28:21.500
attached to your food.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.754
And you might rinse it off,
but there's going to be a film.

00:28:24.754 --> 00:28:25.920
There's going to be a trace.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.570
And that's part of your
daily probiotic, basically.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.350
It's the best
probiotic in a sense.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.170
So eating real food is
critically important.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.480
And I like to always
start with the things

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.240
that we've been told
not to eat, like eggs.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.930
Now they're kind of
coming back into favor.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:50.010
This is how my eggs look
because I keep chickens.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.200
I live in New York City,
but I have a little yard.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.920
And I keep chickens, and we
get fresh multi-colored eggs,

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.600
which is pretty fun.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.850
And these are how
the egg yolks look.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:07.900
And that is because they
have lutein and zeaxanthin

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.970
in them, which actually
protect our eyes, our maculas,

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.060
and also protect us
from colon cancer,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.270
particularly for young people.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:21.410
It also has vitamin D because
if the chickens are outside.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.970
So they're a great
source of vitamin D,

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.410
which most food is not.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.020
Because if you keep
animals indoors,

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.450
then they don't have vitamin
D in their eggs, or milk,

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.710
or what have you.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.040
And choline, which I'll talk
about in a couple minutes.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.370
Cholesterol.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.300
Eggs are a great
source of cholesterol.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.750
This is a good thing,
not a bad thing.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.780
Cholesterol are actually what
make our cell membranes have

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.620
structure because
they create stiffness,

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.150
whereas the omega-3s
and omega-6s actually

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.040
create fluidity.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.697
And you need to have a
balance of those two things

00:29:52.697 --> 00:29:54.405
in order to have a
healthy cell membrane.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.220
You also need cholesterol
for brain development,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.764
particularly in babies,
but actually not only.

00:30:04.764 --> 00:30:06.680
And we're finding that
one of the biggest side

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.230
effects of all these cholesterol
medications that people

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:14.660
are taking is cognitive
dysfunction, actually.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.130
And so what we're learning
is that cholesterol is

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.220
really important for the brain.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.700
It's so rich in mother's
milk and so important

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.170
that there are actually
special enzymes that

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.670
aid the digestive tract
in absorbing cholesterol

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.220
in the baby from
the mother's milk.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.110
And we find that
cholesterol levels

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.145
are lower in people have autism
spectrum disorder, people

00:30:40.145 --> 00:30:43.040
who have depression, in
people have violent behavior,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.250
and even people who
are suicide completers.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:54.670
So low cholesterol, actually,
in a very large meta-analysis

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.350
predicted an increased
risk of dying

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.800
from gastrointestinal
respiratory illness.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.420
So it seems to be that
cholesterol actually

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:09.440
has a very powerful effect
on immune enhancement.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.150
And in fact, it actually--
having high cholesterol

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.040
does not-- unless
you have diabetes,

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.780
that is actually
the one case where

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.160
cholesterol can be problematic.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.610
But if you do not have diabetes,
then having higher cholesterol

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:29.540
is associated with a
lower risk of mortality.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.800
Choline I want to just
mention because it's sort

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.410
of like the forgotten cousin.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.690
But it's very high in egg
yolks, as well as in liver.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.350
And it's very important for
brain development, as well.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:46.250
So in pregnant rats
that were given choline,

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:51.920
they actually had very
improved cognitive function

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.090
when they were born.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.970
And it was so impressive
that even when

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.560
they were elderly rats,
the researchers could still

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:06.590
tell which animals had been
getting choline in utero.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.340
That's pretty impressive.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.120
And it's also just
something we all really need

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.670
in terms of brain function,
in terms of detoxification,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.910
and other things.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.870
And then of course
we all, I think,

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.520
know about the essential
fatty acids like omega-3's.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.850
We hear a lot about it.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.410
Hey, it doesn't have
to just be from fish.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.780
It can also be from
eggs, especially

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.620
from animals, or milk,
or meat, animals that

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.040
have been living on pasture.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.956
So lower risk of ADD, cancer,
learning disabilities,

00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:40.330
mental illness,
seizures, asthma.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.910
There is a long, long list of
how these essential fatty acids

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.300
are important for our
bodies and brains.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.790
And it comes from what we eat.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.020
I mean, that's
really the upshot.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.890
Raw dairy products I
like to always mention,

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.020
because it's pretty taboo.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.660
And yet there have been
a couple of studies

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.450
on unboiled milk--
not in this country,

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.570
because it really
would be hard to do.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.770
It would be hard to get past
our IRBs in the hospitals.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:14.590
But there is both the PASTURE
study and the GABRIELA study,

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.460
which looked at infection.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.560
The first one
looked at infection.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.486
So babies or little kids
that drank unboiled milk,

00:33:22.486 --> 00:33:23.860
how did that impact
their health?

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.650
Well, actually they
had fewer fevers.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.750
They had fewer ear infections
and fewer respiratory

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.280
infections.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.150
So that was actually-- and they
had fewer inflammatory markers,

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.040
as well.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.900
And in the other
study, it actually

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.360
showed less hay fever,
less asthma, less allergy.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.960
It's thought that
this is-- I thought

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.910
it was going to be
about the microbiome,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.600
and that when we
pasteurize milk, maybe

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.110
it impacts bacteria.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.950
And that may be a
part of it, as well.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.780
But what they found is that
pasteurization actually

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:59.480
impacts the whey protein,
and that whey protein

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.130
seems to modulate our
immune systems differently.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.030
So I see lots, and lots, and
lots of people who cannot

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.389
tolerate dairy.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.710
And I don't think
that-- I'm not someone

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.860
who thinks that cow's milk
is only for baby cows,

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.550
because we have
subsisted on dairy

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.909
forever, before we
were even really doing

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.060
formal agriculture.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:27.360
Even as nomads, we subsisted
on different kinds of dairy.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.400
But first of all,
how was it drunk?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.010
And second of all,
it was different,

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.600
straight from the udder,
a little bit different.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.969
Eating organic food--
is organic healthier?

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:37.940
Is it a hipster thing?

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.340
Is it a fad?

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.690
I actually think eating organic
is critically important,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:46.840
because first of all,
calculations of safety

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.750
are for each food, but not
averaged over many foods.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.159
And we don't know
what people are

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.819
eating, particularly children.

00:34:53.819 --> 00:34:55.360
Because children
actually are exposed

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.060
to more pesticides
per body weight

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.000
because they eat more
fruit and vegetables,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.680
generally, per body weight
than we do as adults.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.610
And a lot of it is
concentrated in fat.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.320
There are very
interesting studies

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.430
about Parkinson's and pesticides
and other neurologic illnesses.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.690
But in addition to
that, this is a study

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.280
that was done in
a Mexican farming

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.260
population, where the
people in the valley

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.990
were using pesticides.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.480
And the people who didn't
want to use pesticides

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.900
from this same community
moved to the foothills.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.330
So you see that-- and
then a psychologist

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.250
came and evaluated
their development.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.000
And this is one of the
developmental tests

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.410
that was published.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.330
I really think of this
as a landmark study

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.520
because this is one of
the developmental tests we

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.860
do in children to see
how they're developing,

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.360
how do they draw a person.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.670
And you can see in
an age-matched way

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.460
that the children who were
in the foothills-- that's

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.600
no pesticides-- had these
beautiful people, looked

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.450
much more like people than
the children of the same age

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.390
or older in the valley.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.654
And in that case,
they were actually

00:36:03.654 --> 00:36:05.070
much more scribbled,
didn't really

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.111
look so much like people.

00:36:06.111 --> 00:36:10.520
There was really a pattern
of developmental delay.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.860
And so pesticides
do have an impact.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.770
We know that organic
diets significantly lower

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:18.620
dietary exposure to pesticides.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.180
This has actually been
looked at in several studies.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.690
So we look at the
urine, and we look

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.690
at metabolites of these
pesticides in the urine,

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.490
and the levels are lower.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.280
And we know that ADHD is higher.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.740
The risk of ADHD is
higher, actually double,

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.820
in children-- in this study
it was looking at over 1,100

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:44.290
children-- who had higher
levels of these organophosphate

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.340
pesticide metabolites.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.580
OK, eating plants.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.402
This sounds obvious, right?

00:36:52.402 --> 00:36:53.860
Yes, eat your fruit
and vegetables.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.890
But there's really
great science behind it.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.170
And we again want
that biodiversity

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.425
that I talked about before.

00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:00.800
You want a rainbow
on your plate.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.820
Turns out my mom was right when
she said that when I was a kid.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.170
And part of it is because
of the phytonutrients

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.890
that make all those
different colors.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:13.650
Phytonutrients actually
interact with everything

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:20.150
from our cell membranes
and our organ systems

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.950
to our actual DNA.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.440
And they are in conversation
with our bodies all the time.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.885
One of my favorite
phytonutrients to talk about

00:37:28.885 --> 00:37:31.680
are actually the
bitter compounds.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.390
Anyone here ever use
bitters, bitter tonic?

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.330
They're amazing.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.670
Really if you want something--
speaking of magic bullets,

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:47.410
this is one of those things that
influences increasing stomach

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.870
acid, which helps digest better.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:54.970
Increases motility, so bloating,
burping, constipation, gas,

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.840
all those things improve.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.600
Help with boosting the immune
system of the digestive tract,

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.150
so it helps protect you
from the gastroenteritis

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.140
and those things that you don't
want to get in the wintertime.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.250
Actually interacts with your
liver to boost detoxification.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.100
Interacts with your pancreas
so that your blood sugar

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.160
stays more stable.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.310
And boosts your immune system,
even in your ear, nose, throat,

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.680
and lungs, to help protect you
from whatever cold and flu is

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.574
coming your way.

00:38:25.574 --> 00:38:27.990
Bitters are even being looked
at as a treatment for asthma

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.280
because it helps
bronchodilation.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.360
This happens partly because why?

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.140
What do bitters
remind our body of?

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.260
Poison.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.200
So our bodies get
really like, stand up.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.040
OK, we need to take
care of a lot of things,

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.270
and be really good at
it, and be efficient.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.040
And so a bitter tonic, there's
a favorite bitter tonic

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.320
many people like.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.310
So only a couple of you
raised your hand when I said,

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:53.480
anyone use bitter tonic?

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.460
But does anyone
here like coffee?

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:57.960
No?

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.720
Yeah.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.220
OK.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.254
That's part of, I
think, the craving

00:39:01.254 --> 00:39:02.420
that people have for coffee.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.420
It's not just about
caffeine, but it's

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.320
about the bitter
compounds in there.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.650
And they actually
have a very-- you've

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.680
heard people say, oh, if I don't
have my coffee, I can't poop.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.620
So that's part of what
the bitters are doing.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.770
Beer, anyone here like beer?

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.950
So that's another bitter
tonic because of the hops.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.320
And dark chocolate-- someone
asked me about chocolate

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.790
before I started and said,
my kids love chocolate.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.820
Dark chocolate is a bitter.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.330
It doesn't have too
much sugar, and cacao

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.320
is a bitter, a bitter tonic.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.270
And you can make hot chocolate
very lightly sweetened.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.280
Get yourself or your
kids used to that

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.800
and that can be
their bitter tonic.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.970
Peel of fruits and
vegetables also

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:48.330
have bitter components to
them, and the leafy greens,

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.230
all of that.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.880
You don't have to be eating
broccoli rabe or dandelion

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.610
greens every day.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.490
Chamomile tea is another bitter.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.280
Fermented foods, OK, we
want to be constantly--

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.850
we want the soil, but we also
want the fermented foods, which

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:06.420
just help us mind our microbes.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.040
OK, a word about
sugar because it's

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.720
a topic that we
hear a lot about,

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.960
and it's pretty demonized.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.140
So I do want to say
that sugar, there's

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.320
a lot we could say about it.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.200
And I really talk about it
in great detail in my book.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.510
But one of the things
that sugar does do

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.967
is it stimulates insulin.

00:40:25.967 --> 00:40:27.550
I mean, so that makes
sense because we

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.130
have to manage the sugar.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.260
And insulin is actually
a pro-inflammatory.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.310
So sometimes people
will come and say

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:39.630
oh, my kid, when they eat
sugar, they start to act crazy.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.030
Or people will say when I eat
sugar, I feel really mean,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.520
or I feel really angry.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.940
And they're told, no,
that can't be true.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.560
Actually, yes,
because when you have

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.910
that pro-inflammatory
cascade happening,

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.840
it influences the way
your brain functions.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.290
And basically having
a big spike in insulin

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.540
in some sensitive
people can really

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.050
influence their behavior
and other things, too.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.740
Some people will feel more pain.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.840
They have pain issues.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.920
They might be more in
pain when they have it.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.160
Part of it is the
way insulin actually

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.240
stimulates this enzyme called
phospholipase A2, which

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.410
helps to basically
dissolve your cell

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.770
membrane, fats in
your cell membrane.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.670
And that is obviously
not a great thing.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.310
But what about honey?

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:27.950
What about a natural sugar?

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.730
So honey actually,
interestingly,

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:35.300
is being looked at now as a
treatment for type 1 diabetes.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:35.800
Why?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.080
Because it stabilizes blood
sugar levels and insulin

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.530
levels.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.560
So I actually--
obviously this is

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.050
something to do in moderation.

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.230
I'm not saying let's all go
out and start drinking honey,

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.910
because all sweets
are really not things

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.840
that we-- if you've ever
gone maple sugaring,

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.120
does anyone know how much?

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.200
I mean, it takes
a lot of the sap

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.070
in order to make a little
container of maple syrup.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.150
So we're not intended to
get tons and tons of sugar

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.110
in our diet.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.890
But if you're going
to have sweeteners,

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.110
raw honey is fantastic.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.460
It actually has
wound-healing benefits,

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.450
immune-regulating
benefits, and it actually

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:15.690
stabilizes the blood sugar.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.450
Blackstrap molasses is
one of my favorite things

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:23.880
because it's actually
higher in antioxidants

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.120
than several containers
of blueberries.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.950
Molasses is the leftovers
when we extract sugar

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.160
from sugar cane.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:40.190
Everything that's left becomes
this soupy, sticky, thick

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.020
conglomeration,
which is molasses.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.000
And it's really high in iron.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.760
It's high in antioxidants.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.880
It's high in a lot of minerals.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.350
And it is one of
the best ways I've

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.950
found to treat constipation
in kids, actually,

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:56.960
and in everyone.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.560
You just take a teaspoon a day
of the blackstrap molasses.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.660
And it's a great source
of digestible iron.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.220
All right, last
category, time in nature.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.500
So everything's connected.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.340
We've got our microbial health,
which affects our soil health.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.020
Soil health affects
plant health.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.550
Plant health affects
animal health.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.600
And plant and animal health
affects human health.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.250
And soil health
affects human health.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.410
So soil organisms
actually make us happy.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.310
There are several studies on
this Mycobacterium vaccae,

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.630
which is a soil organism.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.580
And it's been looked at
in cancer patients, where

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.980
it actually improved
emotional health, vitality,

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.900
and cognitive function.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.790
It improved cognition
in another study,

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:46.090
where it lowered
their stress levels

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.940
and made them more relaxed.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.440
And that actually is because
Mycobacterium vaccae actually

00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:00.470
increases serotonin levels as
if the animal or the person

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:05.840
was getting an SSRI,
like a anti-depressant.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.610
That's how much it boosts
our serotonin levels.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.710
And these soil organisms
even can improve cognition.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.380
So in Mycobacterium
vaccae mice were

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.770
navigating a difficult
maze twice as fast

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.540
and with half the
anxiety of the ones that

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.880
did not get the exposure.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.450
And we need the constant
exposure, because in these mice

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.370
this "superhero effect,"
as they called it,

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.800
lasted only for three weeks.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.550
What about sunshine?

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.170
Well, there's this epidemic
of near-sightedness going on.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.720
We all kind of
thought it's genetic.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:42.740
It turns out that it's
actually so severe in Korea

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:47.610
right now that 97% of
young men are near-sighted.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.100
And that's considered
epidemic levels.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.690
Well, turns out, by
accident it was discovered

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:57.400
that being exposed to
sunlight, natural light,

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.790
seems to reverse that effect.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.910
So what is happening to all
of us and all of the kids

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.074
who are sitting inside
looking at screens all day?

00:45:06.074 --> 00:45:07.740
We're not getting so
much natural light,

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.930
and it's actually impacting
vision development.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:14.030
Not only that, but in a
study-- and this study

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.540
is being mined and mined because
just another aspect of it

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.850
was just released
a few weeks ago.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.820
But this study
looked at, in Sweden,

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.630
at 30,000 women over 20 years
and found that women who

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.540
assiduously avoided sun exposure
were twice as likely to die

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.260
as those who didn't.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.720
It just came out recently.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.860
They said this is actually akin
to the risk of being a smoker,

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.100
avoiding the sun.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.590
And in people who did get
skin cancer, by the way,

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.390
of those women, the ones
who were exposed to the sun

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.930
had less aggressive cancer.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.410
Easier to treat

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:53.830
Nature enhances healing.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.330
So when rooms overlook
trees in hospitals,

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.910
patients have shorter
post-operative hospital stays,

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.410
lower scores for complications,
fewer negative comments

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:05.870
in the nurse's notes-- we
all want that-- and less

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.350
need for strong analgesics.

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.020
Nature also reduces
pain and anxiety.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:18.180
So exposure to nature can lower
heart rate and self-reports

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.930
of emotional distress.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:21.530
Patients felt
calmer on days there

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:25.500
was a mural of a natural
scene on the wall than when

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.120
the wall was blank.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.200
And nature in several
studies-- and some of them

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.080
are in children and many of
them also in adults-- actually,

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.770
so children who play
on natural playgrounds

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:39.080
had fewer attention
and cognitive issues.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.760
Their concentration was better.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.120
Their cognitive and physical
functioning was better.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:49.280
And test performance was better.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.340
Has anyone here heard of
shinrin-yoku, forest bathing?

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.740
So this is very much a part
of the culture in Japan.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:03.110
And it's immersing
yourself in the forest.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.340
And a lot of studies
have been done on this

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.200
because it's actually used as
preventive medicine, where they

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.770
actually get a
prescription to go

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.630
spend more time in the forest.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:15.200
And not only does it improve
cognition, improve focus,

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.540
improve sleep, lower
levels of cortisol,

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.080
which are the stress
hormones, and so on.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.560
But actually, it boosted
natural killer cell function,

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.950
so it helped the immune
system to function better,

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:31.240
and improved the number
of anti-cancer proteins

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.680
circulating.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.630
So it helps protect
us from cancer,

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:36.188
just by being in the forest.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.470
So dirt, eat it.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.240
Try to get organic or
biodynamic produce.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.560
Try to avoid
power-washed vegetables.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.060
Cook your food with peels, or
eat it with peels if you can.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.320
Grow food in it.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.270
Eat plants that were
grown in healthy soil.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.750
And only eat animal
products and meat

00:47:55.750 --> 00:48:00.360
from animals that lived
on pasture, lived outside.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.820
Nourish your soil.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.570
So composting, mulching,
no chemical fertilizers

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.490
and pesticides if
you can avoid it.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.080
Bathe in it.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:07.770
Get dirty.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:08.850
Go make some mud pies.

00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:10.340
I don't care how old you are.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.160
If you need a kid, find
a kid to do it with.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.170
But getting dirty
is really important.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.170
And it's pretty obvious, right?

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.400
Try to grow a little food.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.983
I don't care if
you're in an apartment

00:48:19.983 --> 00:48:21.980
and you have a
little pot of herbs

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.750
so you can have
your own fresh food.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:27.480
Or go to your farmer's
markets or join a CSA.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.570
Keep chickens.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:29.940
It's not that hard to do.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.430
Go to community gardens if
you don't have your own space.

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:33.210
Go foraging.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.630
I started doing this last year.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.880
I found like 30 pounds
of maitake mushrooms

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.920
in the New York City
park right near me.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.930
If I want to sell that--
no. [CHUCKLES] But I ate it.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.680
It was amazing.

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.470
Cooking together, eating
together, and getting outside.

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:53.360
So our choice is
between this and this.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.724
Thank you very much.

00:48:54.724 --> 00:48:56.948
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.850
So I'm happy to take
questions if anyone has any.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.860
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
food allergies.

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:14.218
And I saw a study said that a
lot of common food allergies,

00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:21.600
like eggs and peanuts, that
those substances are substrates

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.496
for growing vaccines.

00:49:25.496 --> 00:49:28.922
But I haven't seen any
other confirmation of that.

00:49:28.922 --> 00:49:34.129
I don't know if you've heard
of anything besides the one.

00:49:34.129 --> 00:49:36.170
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: It's
true that some of those

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:41.920
can be used as
substrates in growing

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.640
certain aspects of vaccines.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.370
There is data also that shows
that probably the aluminum

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:52.070
seems to, because it's
given as an adjuvant-- which

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.620
is on purpose to stimulate the
immune system because you want

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.990
it to respond to whatever
the antigen is, whatever

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.310
it may be-- pertussis,
or measles, or whatever.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:07.770
Actually, those adjuvants
seem to increase the risk

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.500
of developing food allergies.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.710
So particularly when people are
getting-- children particularly

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:15.830
are getting their
vaccines-- one of the things

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:20.330
that I outline in the
book is that giving foods,

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.650
we're introducing a lot of
new foods at the same time.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:26.810
And those vaccines
actually are designed

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:29.040
to make the body
much more allergic.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.520
And because children are getting
a lot of them all at one time,

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.250
it may prime the body
to become more allergic.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.651
So that may be an element.

00:50:38.651 --> 00:50:39.150
Yes?

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.691
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:39.691 --> 00:50:41.130
Yeah, I have two questions.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.380
One, maybe building
on that a little bit,

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.950
on allergies or
food sensitivities.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.650
Do you have any
thoughts or advice

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:54.280
on the issue of babies being
born with different food

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.370
sensitivities?

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.440
And then the second
question is, realistically,

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:02.860
how do we get raw milk into
our diets or our kids' diets?

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.840
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: So babies
being born with them really

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.510
has a lot to do with
what's happening in utero

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.440
and what's happening at birth.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:16.910
So definitely everything
from-- because babies

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.270
are born with what we
would call leaky guts.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.210
That used to be an
alternative medicine term,

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.460
but now it's not anymore.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.810
We just call it increased
gut permeability.

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:28.800
That's the science term.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.640
But basically it's
normal to have that.

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.170
And because of a lot of things
that we're doing-- maybe

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.260
because of adjuvants, maybe
because of how babies are born,

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:41.490
and maybe our own, as
the people giving birth,

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:43.700
microbiomes might be
a little disrupted--

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.180
it can put certain babies more
at risk for developing food

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:48.680
allergies.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.490
So part of what I
recommend, if possible, is

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:54.480
to breastfeed, if possible,
is to do probiotics.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.460
And there are infant probiotics
that are designed specifically

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.220
for babies.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:04.770
And as far as the raw milk
goes, there are ways to get it.

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:06.090
It's state by state.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.460
I definitely recommend raw
milk should be state-certified

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.080
because you want to
know-- I personally

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.690
visit any farm that I
would get raw milk from.

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:19.602
I wouldn't just get it from
a random place and drink it.

00:52:19.602 --> 00:52:21.810
I think it's important to
know where it's coming from

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.643
and I want to know that
it's state-certified

00:52:23.643 --> 00:52:25.120
because you can
check for any kind

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.940
of significant contamination.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.970
But there are websites
that can connect you

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:32.410
with raw milk producers.

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:35.650
A lot of Amish farmers will
go all around the east coast,

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:36.870
as well.

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:39.820
So I'm happy to connect you
with some of those resources.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.070
AUDIENCE: One quick follow up.

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.390
Does raw milk cheese give
you the same benefits?

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.150
Because that's more
readily available.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:47.900
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN:
In certain ways, yes.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.810
In certain ways, yes,
because it was never

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.720
pasteurized, so you're
avoiding, hopefully,

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.100
most of the organisms
that could be an issue,

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:02.040
but without changing the way.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:02.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.220
AUDIENCE: What's your take
in general on vaccinations?

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.300
Because you mentioned
measles and mumps

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.230
might have positive benefits.

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:11.860
But I'd rather not
get measles and mumps

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:14.400
when I'm too old, so I need
to be vaccinated at one point.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.493
Are you basically saying
that kids shouldn't

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:17.960
be vaccinated that early?

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.395
But then child mortality
with those diseases

00:53:21.395 --> 00:53:22.830
is a problem, as well.

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.005
So I'm a bit confused.

00:53:24.005 --> 00:53:25.130
What are you trying to say?

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:26.510
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN:
I think what

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:30.400
I'm saying is that we don't
get something for nothing.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.570
And that we really
need to look at-- we

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:36.580
need to study this because
I think previously we

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:40.600
thought of everything infectious
as being contamination

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.900
and totally negative.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:45.140
So the question
is, how can we gain

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.160
those ben-- do we gain
those kinds of benefits

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.540
being vaccinated?

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:49.570
It's not clear.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:54.530
And what can we do
if we're leading--

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:59.340
if we're doing this medical
intervention on 100% of people,

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.627
essentially, that might be
disrupting their immune health

00:54:02.627 --> 00:54:05.210
or their gut health in some way
and putting them more at risk.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:07.110
So this is something,
I think, that we

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.760
need to really study carefully.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.706
And it's not really
being studied.

00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:12.080
AUDIENCE: My
understanding always

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.960
was that being
vaccinated basically

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.830
causes the same immune
response from the body

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:20.654
as if you were actually
having those viruses.

00:54:20.654 --> 00:54:22.612
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: It's
not exactly the same.

00:54:22.612 --> 00:54:24.000
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.460
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN:
It can approximate,

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.780
but it's not exactly the same.

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.600
And like I said, we just haven't
been-- this is new science.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.260
I mean, almost all
of those papers

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.860
are things that came out
over the past few years.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.900
So this is something
that we're really

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.170
going to need to
carefully investigate

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:45.210
to see essentially what the
impact is of vaccination.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.000
Do we get that same
benefit or not, and what

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.440
is the long-term effect?

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.725
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:51.725 --> 00:54:53.100
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.180
I suspect there's a lot
of special interests

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.952
who aren't exactly thrilled with
the message you're discovering.

00:54:58.952 --> 00:55:02.989
Have you gotten any
interesting reactions, you

00:55:02.989 --> 00:55:05.280
or the other researchers who
are working in this field,

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.120
to some of the major
pharmaceutical and agricultural

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.757
practitioners?

00:55:11.757 --> 00:55:13.590
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: I
think their strategy,

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:19.820
as much as possible, is to kind
of black out what's happening.

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:22.410
So the less attention
gotten, the better.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:27.050
And I've definitely heard
from some of the other media

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:27.920
opportunities.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.760
They've said, oh, we're
really interested.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:34.370
And then I've heard back, our
sponsors wouldn't like it.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:39.920
So I think that's
their primary approach.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:43.430
And I do think that there are
a lot of corporate interests

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.300
that are not in favor
of the kind of science

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.970
that is being done now.

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.300
AUDIENCE: And what about
standard medical training?

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.240
Are doctors opening up to this?

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.260
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: I
think to some degree.

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.390
It depends on the doctors.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:00.670
But I think there are definitely
doctors who are open to it

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:04.490
if we're looking at the
science in a critical way.

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.310
I mean, I think raw milk
is very ingrained as being

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.780
a terrible thing in doctors,
so that's a tough one.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.750
And I also talk
quite a bit-- I have

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:13.920
a whole section on fluoride.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.720
And that's another thing
that-- doing fluoridated water

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.260
is another thing that's really,
really difficult for doctors

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.890
to wrap their heads around.

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:24.420
But in other ways, I
think they're open.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.036
I mean, it depends.

00:56:26.036 --> 00:56:26.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:27.159
Thanks.

00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.850
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.740
Do you have any
thoughts on being vegan?

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.260
You mentioned plants
and animals a lot.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.250
And is there a
right way to do it,

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:39.440
or is it just very difficult?

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.350
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN: I think
that children probably should

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:47.170
really not be vegan ever.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:51.260
Or it would be really,
really difficult to do well.

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.270
Vegetarian has to also
be really careful.

00:56:54.270 --> 00:57:00.060
But at least-- the thing is that
animal products are very, very

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.480
nutrient dense and
have certain properties

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.810
that the quality is different.

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:09.200
Protein is not protein,
is not protein.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.830
That said, do I
think being vegan can

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.230
be good for some people?

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.790
Sure.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:15.480
Especially because
I don't necessarily

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.300
think that we have
to adhere to one diet

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.900
our whole entire lives.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.220
I was a vegetarian,
actually, for many years.

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.770
And then at a certain
point in time,

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.580
my body kind of screamed
and didn't like it.

00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:27.980
And then I ate meat and
that was better for me.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.450
But obviously, the way I
eat meat, as I talk about,

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.190
is doing it, I
think, differently

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:34.567
than a lot of people.

00:57:34.567 --> 00:57:36.150
But I think what's
really important is

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:37.170
to listen to your body.

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:39.200
So for instance,
I've had patients

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.330
who have come to me that were
vegan or strict vegetarian

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:44.710
and they were really sick.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.030
And when I told them
to-- one of my patients,

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:50.035
when I told her I thought she
should eat meat, she cried.

00:57:50.035 --> 00:57:51.650
I mean, she was
really angry with me.

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:53.066
She actually stopped
coming to me,

00:57:53.066 --> 00:57:55.050
but I happen to know
her socially, as well.

00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:57.970
So five years later,
she came to me

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.537
and she had a significant
autoimmune disease.

00:58:00.537 --> 00:58:02.620
And she said, I've started
having meat once a week

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.040
and I feel amazing.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.000
It's changed me.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.240
My energy is
completely different.

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.810
This doesn't have
to be for everyone.

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:13.170
But I do think that
it's important to listen

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:13.860
to your body.

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.610
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.210
Thank you.

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.820
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about the sun exposure.

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:23.350
My father died from melanoma
and my mom is Korean,

00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:25.380
so I never go in the sun.

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.600
And is it a vitamin D thing?

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.310
Would you take vitamin D
pills and that would solve it?

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.805
Or is that you really need
to be out in the sunshine?

00:58:33.805 --> 00:58:35.180
MAYA SHETREAT-KLEIN:
Yeah, that's

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.840
a really important question.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.500
Thank you for asking it.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:43.320
So number one, the
major danger is sunburn.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.010
So you don't want to burn.

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.360
So if you're someone
who burns very quickly,

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.350
you have to be very
careful and go out

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:54.000
in the sun at times of day where
it's not very, very strong.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.340
You do want that sun exposure.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:58.690
And it's not clear that
it's just vitamin D. Vitamin

00:58:58.690 --> 00:58:59.940
D is an element.

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:05.400
But sun, again, we like to
really simplify and reduce

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.020
things to, go outside and get
your vitamin D. It's probably

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.950
more than that.

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:16.170
But what the literature actually
shows is that chronic sun

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:20.450
exposure, a little bit of
chronic sun exposure every day

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:23.800
is protective from
developing melanoma.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.547
So a little bit each day.

00:59:25.547 --> 00:59:27.880
I do know some people who
say, when I go out in the sun,

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:28.870
I feel sick.

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:31.020
I feel terrible.

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:34.710
I think, again, listening to
your body is really important.

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:37.020
But I do think getting
some sun is important.

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:40.340
It just depends on how
much and what time of day

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:43.030
so that you're protecting
yourself and covering up

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:46.770
at times of day that are strong,
or just staying out of the sun.

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:48.520
Thank you so much, everyone.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.811
[APPLAUSE]
