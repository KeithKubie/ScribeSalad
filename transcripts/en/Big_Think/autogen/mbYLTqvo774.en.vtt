we've gotten some good distance towards

we've gotten some good distance towards
that at the present time but once you

realized that the only methodology we

choices have made the system to relate
to a lot of structure because one of the

to a lot of structure because one of the
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.889
to a lot of structure because one of the
mysteries is why our universe is so

mysteries is why our universe is so
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.050

such a wide range of scales and that

such a wide range of scales and that
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.680
such a wide range of scales and that
turns out to be tied to the values of

that the only methodology that was

lead to an improbable amount of
structure is natural selection so for

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
structure is natural selection so for
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.479
structure is natural selection so for
natural selection we need reproduction

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489
natural selection we need reproduction
 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.850
natural selection we need reproduction
and there was a hypothesis flying around

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
and there was a hypothesis flying around
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.589
and there was a hypothesis flying around
that the universe is reproduced through

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599
that the universe is reproduced through
 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.780
that the universe is reproduced through
black holes that inside black holes

were time ends there were basically the

which could become newly universes and I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
which could become newly universes and I
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970
which could become newly universes and I
took over that hypothesis and took over

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
took over that hypothesis and took over
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.619
took over that hypothesis and took over
the hypothesis that maybe the laws of

the hypothesis that maybe the laws of

the hypothesis that maybe the laws of
nature change slightly which has been

nature change slightly which has been
 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.759
nature change slightly which has been
made by Johnny wheeler in the 1960s and

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769
made by Johnny wheeler in the 1960s and
 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.380
made by Johnny wheeler in the 1960s and
just added a little bit which is that

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390
just added a little bit which is that
 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.030
just added a little bit which is that
those changes should be very small so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
those changes should be very small so
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.710
those changes should be very small so
that there could be a cumulation of

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
that there could be a cumulation of
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.759
that there could be a cumulation of
fitness leads to a prediction or an

fitness leads to a prediction or an

fitness leads to a prediction or an
observation that after many many

observation that after many many
 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.920
observation that after many many
generations the population of universes

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930
generations the population of universes
 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.589
generations the population of universes
should be fine-tuned to maximize the

should be fine-tuned to maximize the
 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.720
should be fine-tuned to maximize the
production of black holes and that has

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730
production of black holes and that has
 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.819
production of black holes and that has
further implications for things that we

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829
further implications for things that we

experimentally so that's very briefly
