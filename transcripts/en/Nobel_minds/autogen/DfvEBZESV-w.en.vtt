00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
the reactions and synthesis methods

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740
the reactions and synthesis methods
 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.560
the reactions and synthesis methods
developed have made organic synthesis

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570
developed have made organic synthesis
 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.990
developed have made organic synthesis
much easier do you think that catalyzed

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
much easier do you think that catalyzed
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.880
much easier do you think that catalyzed
organic synthesis reactions play an

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890
organic synthesis reactions play an
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.440
organic synthesis reactions play an
important role in solving the energy

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
important role in solving the energy
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.410
important role in solving the energy
crisis faced by the world I think at the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
crisis faced by the world I think at the
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.370
crisis faced by the world I think at the
moment that not so direct relation with

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380
moment that not so direct relation with
 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.490
moment that not so direct relation with
energy crisis but of course organic she

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
energy crisis but of course organic she
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.009
energy crisis but of course organic she
is very important chemistry but in the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
is very important chemistry but in the
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.290
is very important chemistry but in the
near future we can the considers such a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
near future we can the considers such a
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.880
near future we can the considers such a
reaction even in energy crisis for

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
reaction even in energy crisis for
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.110
reaction even in energy crisis for
example you know carbon dioxide is a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
example you know carbon dioxide is a
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.720
example you know carbon dioxide is a
very terrible the chemicals but in the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
very terrible the chemicals but in the
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.160
very terrible the chemicals but in the
near future from the carbon dioxide if

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
near future from the carbon dioxide if
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.819
near future from the carbon dioxide if
we can the the produce that the carbon

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
we can the the produce that the carbon
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.090
we can the the produce that the carbon
compound that should be very important

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
compound that should be very important
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.189
compound that should be very important
for such an energy crisis
