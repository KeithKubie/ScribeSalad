AQEEL PHILLIPS: The Princeton
University Rock Ensemble

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.210
is the first and only rock
cover group on campus.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.490
We are a home for
musicians who haven't

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.770
found a place in jazz
or classical collectives

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.850
on campus,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.550
so really unique in
music that we play.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.987

KATIE FRORER: I've never
been in a rock band before.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.250
It's something that
I had wanted to do.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.810
I've had like different
levels of vocal training,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.610
in like operatic soprano and
like musical theater and pop

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.280
and rock, but I've never
been able to then pursue

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.410
the pop and rock side
as much as I'd like.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.429
So this has been really cool.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.740

AQEEL PHILLIPS:
PURE is currently

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.550
a group comprised
of undergraduates,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.355
spanning most of the
disciplines in the school.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.980
We have a good number
of STEM students,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.740
a good number of
humanities  students,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.030
so we're all over the place.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.680
JOSHUA MURRAY: It's
fantastic meeting

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.000
all these different people,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.580
because while you have this
one common theme, which

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.010
is the music you
like, they bring

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.620
in ideas from all across
different areas of campus

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.790
that you wouldn't be
exposed to otherwise.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.550
FIORA ELBERS-TIBBITTS:
Being part of PURE

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.740
is a lot more of a
social experience

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.110
than I had anticipated.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.010
We'll come together to
rehearse, anticipating an hour,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.680
and then we'll end up
staying and talking

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.620
for another 45 minutes,
wandering over to dinner.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.500
And it becomes a
four-hour excursion.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.982
It feels like a study break as
much as it does a rehearsal.

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:40.690
BRANDON TAN: PURE is
a really good break,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.910
honestly from academics
just because I

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.120
can't be studying all the time.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.000
So it's really good
to have something else

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.130
productive to do besides work.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.420
And it's just a good way
to relieve stress too,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.980
just bang on the drum set and 
just getting together friends.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.030
There's nothing else as fun as
playing music, in my opinion.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.790

DAVID EXUME: I remember visiting
Princeton University when

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.180
I was in high school
and being like,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.120
I want to play on
like that stage

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.340
in like Richardson in
like Frist theater.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.620
But now I'm like
playing in Frist theater

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.470
and it's a lot of fun.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.380
Everybody has a lot of
energy and people are always

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.560
like upstairs like cheering
us on, giving us feedback.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.959
I feel very whole
when I'm on stage.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.000
As somebody who doesn't
like talking a whole lot,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.580
it feels great to step out
of my skin for a little bit.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:36.980
AQEEL PHILLIPS:
My favorite thing

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.570
about like playing an
instrument, especially

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.319
in a group like this,
is just like getting

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.045
to be on stage like
with your friends,

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:43.670
you know, like
collaborating with them,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.890
like you know, being down here,
like rehearsing with them.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.380
I just like love all of it.
