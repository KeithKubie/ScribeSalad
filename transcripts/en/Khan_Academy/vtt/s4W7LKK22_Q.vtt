00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:02.990
- [Instructor] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.470
is even more examples to make
sure we really understand

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.810
how various things would be accounted for

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.720
in the expenditure approach to GDP.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.660
Now we have talked about
this in other videos.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.650
There's many different
ways of calculating GDP,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.330
but in the expenditure approach,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.600
you can break it down as being made up of

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.220
consumption by households
plus investment by firms

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.370
plus government spending
on goods and services,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.250
by the government, and net exports.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.100
And so with that out of the way,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000
pause this video and look
at each of these statements

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.820
and think about what
effect would it have on GDP

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.170
if we have the expenditure approach

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.010
and how would it be accounted for

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.240
in these various categories.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.990
Okay now let's work through this together.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.100
So this first scenario it
says Ford pays $1 million

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.710
for a U.S.-made robot for
its factory in California.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.450
So we have a firm right over here.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.760
It is Ford.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.480
And it's investing in physical capital.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.890
And in most cases,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.210
well especially if you're
looking at some type

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.440
of a standardized test on an AP exam,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.980
investment is firms investing
in physical capital,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.130
although it can also be
on intellectual capital,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.720
things like software.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.620
But this is very clear,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.450
it's Ford buying a U.S.-made
robot, physical capital.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.120
This robot is going to help
Ford make more cars or trucks

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.490
or whatever it's trying to make.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.260
So this is a very clear
that it would increase GDP,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.830
so GDP would go up,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.540
by $1 million because of this, $1 million.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240
And the place that it
would be accounted for

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.590
is in investment.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.130
So I could say investment
would go up $1 million.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.870
Or the reason why GDP goes up $1 million

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.980
or you would add $1 million to GDP

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
is because you would add
$1 million to investment.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.540
This is a clear investment by a U.S. firm.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480
All right now let's look
at the next scenario.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.020
A U.S. car rental
company spends $1 million

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.110
to buy 30 new Fords that
were made in the U.S.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.307
So pause this video again
see if you can think of that.

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:05.910
Well this is a very similar scenario.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.950
A U.S. car rental company,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.600
and it is investing in physical
capital right over here.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.197
By buying those 30 new
Fords, it can rent those out

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:16.860
to create future benefit.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.290
And so once again it
would be the same thing.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.380
In that first case, GDP
would go up by a million

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.880
because investment goes up by a million,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.510
and in this case as well,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.520
GDP would go up by $1
million because investment

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.950
went up by $1 million.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.660
Now let's look at this third scenario.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.460
A U.S. car rental
company spends $1 million

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.500
to buy 30 new Toyotas
that were made in Japan.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.900
So how is this different?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.180
Well in this scenario,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.870
you still would have a U.S. firm investing

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.660
in physical capital,
it's spending $1 million.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.180
So you actually would,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.890
you would actually have
investment go up by $1 million.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.420
But it's not investing
in things that are made

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.253
in the United States.

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:00.900
It's investing in things
that are made in Japan.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.060
So in this particular scenario,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.290
it will be counteracted by net exports.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.400
Here we are importing $1
million worth of things,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.140
and so that would take net exports,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.890
so net exports would
go down by $1 million.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.130
A $1 million import is the same thing

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.763
as a negative $1 million net export.

00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:24.720
And so because of these two,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.140
this will have no impact on GDP.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.900
No impact

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.800
on GDP.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.890
And the reason why this
makes intuitive sense

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.890
is remember GDP is supposed to measure

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.350
how much a, how much was produced,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.270
and in this scenario a car
rental company is investing

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.280
but it was produced someplace else.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.230
It wasn't produced in the United States.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.480
Now this third scenario,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.530
a Japanese car rental
company spends $1 million

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.430
to buy 30 new Fords that were
made in the United States.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.640
So this is almost a
symmetrically opposite scenario.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.530
So we would not add to investment here

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.780
because this was a
Japanese car rental company

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.810
and we're calculating
GDP for the United States

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.360
or at least that's the assumption.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.820
But because the U.S. would
export these 30 new Fords

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.500
for $1 million, that
would add to net exports.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.710
So in this case, net exports,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.310
let me do the net export color,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.220
net exports would go up by $1 million.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.520
And because net exports
went up by $1 million

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.614
and nothing else here is impacted,

00:04:28.614 --> 00:04:33.614
GDP, GDP would go up by $1 million.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.690
And once again the reason
why this makes sense

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.800
is United States produced
$1 million worth of stuff.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.220
It happened to export them out,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.680
and that's where it got accounted for,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.760
but definitely GDP is $1
million higher because of this.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.150
So this next one is interesting.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.820
You buy $100,000 of IBM stock.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.653
What do you think this is?

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:52.790
Pause this video again.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.090
So you in traditional language,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.870
you might say I invested
$100,000 of IBM stock.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.700
But I'm a household,
so how does this work?

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.350
Well it turns out that
this does not move any

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.920
of these dials right over
here because at least

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.720
the assumption here is that you are buying

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.260
that $100,000 of IBM
stock from someone else.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.500
It is not, it is not because
something is being made

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.880
in the United States,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.220
there's some new productivity
that's happening.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.940
And so even though in everyday language

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.200
we sometimes think of
this as in investment,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.370
this has no impact on
any of these categories.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.180
So no,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.520
no impact.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.630
And I really wanna emphasize that.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.660
Investment is sometimes
associated with things

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.120
like buying stocks,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.530
but investment in the
GDP sense is when a firm

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.350
is buying some type of capital

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.730
that'll give it some future benefit,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.390
help it make things better.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.910
Oftentimes it's physical capital.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.370
More and more it's often
things like software

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.500
or some type of intellectual capital.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.030
Microsoft buys $100 million of IBM stock.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.840
This one might be even
more tempting to put

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.650
in the investment category
because Microsoft for sure

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.520
is a firm, and it looks
like it's investing

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.070
in another firm.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.070
But once again,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.130
Microsoft isn't buying some
type of physical machinery

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.970
or it isn't buying an accounting system

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.980
or some type of intellectual capital.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.820
It's just buying shares from someone else.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.350
So once again nothing
new is being produced

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.540
in the country, so this has no impact.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.840
I really wanna emphasize these last two

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.900
because this shows up on some exams

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.960
where it says oh this kinda
feels like an investment,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.160
at least in everyday language,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.720
so people would account for it there.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.330
But remember, no new capital.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.070
Microsoft isn't buying
something that's going

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.760
to help Microsoft produce more of whatever

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.060
Microsoft is trying to produce.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.150
All right this next one,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.300
the Social Security Administration makes

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.780
a $2,000 payment to a retiree.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.690
What do you think's going on there?

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.290
So you might be tempted to
say hey that's a government

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.190
expenditure, the Social
Security Administration,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.560
they're spending $2,000.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.460
But we have to remind ourselves,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.750
this G category is government expenditure

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.660
on goods and services,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.820
not a transfer payment like this.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.080
And so this would have no, no impact.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.650
Another intuitive way to think about it,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.870
and we've been talking
about this for awhile,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.850
nothing new is being
produced in the United States

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.890
because of this payment.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.340
Now we can contrast that
with the next scenario

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.660
right over here.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.080
The Social Security Administration buys

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.290
a new accounting system.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.640
Well in this scenario,

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.260
the government is buying
a good or service.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.840
It might be a combination of both.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.890
They might have to buy some computers,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.770
some software, maybe hire some consultants

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.160
to implement it for them.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.150
So it is the government
paying for goods and services.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.540
So in this situation,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.950
our government category would go up

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.510
by however much they're spending.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.790
Let's say they spend,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.200
let's say this was

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.940
I don't know $1 million again.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.930
So then the government would,

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.450
the government category
would go up by $1 million

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.040
because it's a good or
service it's spending,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.960
and because of that GDP would go up

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.060
by $1 million.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.580
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
