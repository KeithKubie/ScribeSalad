00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:12.240
At moments of low self-esteem, it can be hard to avoid the fear that we may – and this might explain certain relationship hiccups – be really quite ‘bad in bed’.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.500
Three anxieties tend to predominate:

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
that our bodies are not attractive enough

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.060
that we don’t practice or know about certain positions

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.380
and that we tire too easily.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.040
These fears reflect an underlying view that sex is predominantly an athletic or aerobic activity...

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.840
and that therefore ‘good sex’ must hinge on a capacity to flex our bodies optimally.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.440
But this risks misunderstanding what lies at the core of eroticism,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.740
for though sex traditionally makes use of our bodies, sexual pleasure may more accurately be thought of as stemming from certain manoeuvres of the mind.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:58.500
As new technology is showing us, it's quite possible for two people to generate extraordinary eroticism while their bodies are a continent or more apart.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
That’s because eroticism is – in truth – about something else entirely: ideas.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.160
Being a good lover is first and foremost a skill of the mind.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:18.460
Sex grows pleasurable the more it functions as a release from a great many of the ideas of what is normal that dominate in non-sexual life.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.060
Good sex allows us to admit to, and share, a maximal amount of what we must normally keep hidden.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.440
In good sex, we will – for example – be allowed to show that:

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.000
we’re more interested in controlling and dominating someone that we normally let on

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.180
or conversely that we’re very keen to submit and be entirely weak

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.860
we might want to subvert the hierarchies of normal life by exploring scenarios of pilots and cabin attendants, professors and students, patients and doctors

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:57.160
we might confess that, though monogamous by nature, the idea of other people watching us or joining us excites us really rather a lot

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.980
or we may reveal that our erotic interests don’t actually – as they’re meant to – circle exclusively around genitals;

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.520
that we’re really pretty interested in more incidental things like wrists or the back of necks or indeed shoes or tights.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.380
We might be brave enough to challenge the normal chronological rules,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.400
revealing that we’d like to spend a hugely long time with our clothes still on – or indeed rush straight in without decorum.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.820
Sexiness is the excitement of feeling released from the restrictive taboos of the rest of our lives.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:38.000
It’s a safe, mutually caring place where we can take someone else into the not entirely responsible, somewhat cruel and mad sides of us.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.680
That someone gives us permission to do this, that is at the core of what sexiness is.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.220
The person who is good in bed therefore isn’t the one who knows how to articulate themselves rhythmically for extended periods:

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.960
it’s the person who encourages, endorses and legitimates our secret lonely selves

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.220
at the same time as being very aware of, and honest about, their own private wishes and enthusiasms.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.360
It’s about a mutual nakedness of the mind, made possible through trust.
