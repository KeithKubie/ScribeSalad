Speaker 1:          00:01          Gonads. Episode three. I'm Molly Webster. Hello. Hello. Are you still there? I'm still here. And this is my mother Mary Webster. Yeah. Um, but uh, but yeah, no, the bedbugs are such a freaking pain. You have to vacuum all of the baseboards. You have to vacuum the floors, you have to vacuum the door jams cause they crawl up the walls when they're trying to get away.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Oh Molly, that sounds awful.

Speaker 1:          00:25          So I recently called my mom for I guess to catch up but also

Speaker 3:          00:34          bye.

Speaker 1:          00:34          I had a work question

Speaker 3:          00:39          [inaudible] that's been bugging me

Speaker 1:          00:46          cause on my mind, yeah. So I asked her mom been working on this story and it made me wonder what you would have named me if I was a boy.

Speaker 2:          00:54          You would have been named Daniel Dad always liked the name and yeah, if we ever had a boy, dad said he was going to name of Daniel. I if that's you want, go for it. Yeah. Cause he didn't want a junior. You wanted it Daniel. He wanted a little Danny.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Instead he got a Judy, Chrissy, Peggy and Molly. Your poor father, Mike glucky father,

Speaker 2:          01:17          if you had come out, boy you would have been Daniel. Yes. Wait, all of us. Not Well No, we wait Daniel for up forever. You were just ready. We didn't know when I'm breaking him out. He was going to be up. Yeah, I mean [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:40          so this is just going to sound ridiculous, but I called my mom because all these stories that we've been doing in this series, they do make you think about fate. Like even if you think about the first one where they're the primordial germ cells, um, and they are holding on to all sorts of possibilities and futures and then chromosome step in and no more infinity. You're just like shunted onto a path I guess. I guess. I guess asking my mom about Daniel was just like a clumsy way of getting back to what feels like a really pristine moment. Like a moment where no decision had been made where you exist. Totally embalm, ish by life and choice and fate in less.

Speaker 4:          02:37          Maybe life isn't so fateful. Case in point. David, dark hour. Hello. Hi. Actually, I'm just going to make, I don't like correcting people, but I'll just correct you. My name is pronounced Sarah Kovar is our covert covert yet cause it is a w right? I'm not missed. It's a w for the sake of my parents. I pronounce it with the like a v. Um, it's, it's essentially Polish. That's good. And um, you work at the University of Minnesota? Yep. That's right. Uh, what do you do there? Uh, genetics, cell biology and development. That's, that seems scary. It's broad. Anyways, the reason I called Zack Kovar was because I came across a series of experiments that he did that just straight up kicked me into gonads. Okay. So to begin, this was, um, back in the, uh, early 1990s there Kovar was working in a lab doing genetic stuff in worms and flies and mice and things. And one day Presto, we got lucky done, Dah, Dah, Dah. He and his team discovered a brand new gene. Yup, that's right. They saw it in mice and gave it a name. I unfortunately am responsible for this. It's DMR. T One d m r t one DMR t one. Yup. Demert one. I keep trying to say d r m t it's a little bit, it's a nightmare. Very sorry for that. And what was interesting was that this gene was in mice but also in humans

Speaker 5:          03:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          03:58          and in the male mouse it was expressing itself in the testis.

Speaker 4:          04:09          You forgot to say it. Testis testes. Testes, testicles, testers. Is that a single? Yep. Okay. So yes, we found this gene and humans had it and the test is, and the question we had was whether it was doing something or not. Like you've got genes in your eyes that are making chemicals that are making your eyes the color. They are this gene DMR t one. What is it doing? We wanted to know if it's involved in maybe making sperm or maybe it just hangs around. It doesn't matter. It doesn't do anything, you know, we don't know. And so they're like, let's mess around with it and see what happens.

Speaker 6:          04:43          But

Speaker 4:          04:43          you can't do that experiment in humans. No. So instead they get some adult male mice, perfectly normal fertile males that are making sperm. And we use some fancy molecular genetic tricks. And so basically it's kind of a mean trick, but a, it's genetics. They cut the gene out, we did that and then they take a slice of the testis and they look at it under the microscope and it didn't look like what we would have expected. And what they expect to see is that these are the cells that help make the sperm in the testis. And normally they're kind of tall and lean, long and skinny, but suddenly they're different with DMR t one gone. They had gotten smaller rounder and their cover was like, this was not something that was supposed to happen. What is going on here? What are these things? And then he realized that the cells are making estrogen and he was like

Speaker 6:          05:41          [inaudible]. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          05:43          I think what is happening is that the cells in the testis turned into ovary cells. Wait, wait and wait. It's a male mouse. Yes. So you're saying this male mouse now has

Speaker 7:          05:58          over resales in its testicles?

Speaker 8:          06:00          Yes. These are cells that are changing their, their sex.

Speaker 7:          06:04          That's insane. Can I, can we just have like a, a exclamatory moment? Like where you were you like, whoa. Is that pot that's possible. That happened. What is it, you know,

Speaker 8:          06:13          what do you say for, for us anyway, the greatest of all scientific exclamations is, that's weird. Um, so we had that weird moment

Speaker 7:          06:21          and just to take this weirdness like a one step further, a group of scientists did similar experiment in adult female mice where they did like the same

Speaker 8:          06:32          fancy molecular genetic tricks.

Speaker 7:          06:35          Only this time they knocked out a female gene in the ovary and when they went to look at it,

Speaker 8:          06:41          the ovary is trying to kind of reorganize itself into, um, the testis.

Speaker 7:          06:46          Wait, [inaudible] you're saying in both cases there's one gene that's flipping the sex from male to female or back? Yes. One gene. One gene. How many genes do we have in our body? I don't know, like tens of thousands. Wow. And just one is doing this, which is weird concept to think of because we typically connect like sex or gonads to chromosomes at least. I do like an accent of why is a girl and a boy, so how could a gene step in and reverse that? Yeah. Cause I thought chromosomes were a, lots of genes. There are these like massive things. One gene is so tiny, ginger tiny chromosomes are much bigger. And I think the answer to that is that when you get down to sex, like what makes us one sex or the other, it's not, it doesn't work exactly like we thought. Like take for example the x and y idea, this like chromosomal narrative we have of biological sex. It's a specific way of thinking about things from a certain moment in history that we are potentially starting to rethink. Huh. I think it's helpful to see sort of the, the history of how we understand sex and in a, in a longer timeframe. So let me bring in this guy.

Speaker 8:          08:05          I'm David Page biology professor at MIT. Where do we start? Oh my gosh. Well we're going to go. So let's see. We could go off the rails in any number of directions here, all of which would be quite, quite productive. But let's see. So, um, let's go back to um, the 1890s.

Speaker 7:          08:25          Yeah, that definitely is 1890s. So genetics was in its infancy, Mendel peas, all that was [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          08:33          and people had been pondering for millennial. Where do boys and girls come from

Speaker 7:          08:38          now when it came to how you look? People thought mom and dad clearly involved

Speaker 8:          08:42          because people had realized, you know, the children ended up growing up looking something like their mother and their father.

Speaker 7:          08:49          Like maybe you have a Chin like your dad and knows like your mom and the hair. That's a little bit of a [inaudible]. There was a kind of blending of mom and dad to make you you right. But when it came to why you were the sex you were, that was a mystery because there was no blending.

Speaker 8:          09:09          You ended up being like either your mother or your father,

Speaker 7:          09:13          one or the other.

Speaker 8:          09:14          Therefore it must not have anything to do with heredity. It had to be imposed from the outside in some way.

Speaker 7:          09:21          So people came up with all kinds of ideas for what made you a boy or a girl phase of the moon at that moment of conception called dark moon. Definitely a girl. The state of the economy wouldn't be surprised. Down economy girl, everything that was bad was given to women. Uh, there was what the mother ate, mom's body, heat, stress,

Speaker 8:          09:44          all sorts of crazy things. And then, um,

Speaker 7:          09:49          in 1923, we started looking elsewhere, but how do we inherit our characteristics for an answer?

Speaker 8:          09:58          Chromosome chromosomes determine our physical appearance and our sex.

Speaker 7:          10:03          In 1923, a scientists looking down the barrel of a microscope discovers to new

Speaker 8:          10:09          from the silence x and a y all the sex chromosomes.

Speaker 7:          10:13          But I just want to hit pause here. I came to find out actually from David Page that the x and y chromosomes do not look like an x and y. Wait, they don't look like the letters. Oh No, no, no, no. When they first discovered them, they were blobs under the microscope. They just look like these misshapen clumps, kidney being mark. The x look bigger. The y looks smaller, but that's it. That's so interesting because there's something about the shape of the x and the shape of the why, which read as gendered letters that feel so yeah, cause right. Why has a little stem on it, which is sort of peanuts. Like there's like a duality or something in the x, which feels like, you know, ovaries and breasts or something. Like there is like a, there is something about those letters. So I was totally shocked when he was like, there's no real reason they got those letters. It was totally arbitrary. Anyways, when they found these chromosomes,

Speaker 8:          11:05          it was clear that if you had x, x two x chromosomes, you would develop as a female anatomic female. And if you had a y chromosome, your x, y you would develop as an anatomic male. Oh boy. That was the thinking. So you see Roger on suse.

Speaker 7:          11:23          Yeah. But then that idea it got more complicated. Yeah. Yeah. When did you intersect with this story? The summer of 1970 pages at MIT.

Speaker 8:          11:37          First Year of medical school and the DNA revolution. So

Speaker 7:          11:42          far tonight we've been bringing you a news. So the world around us was just beginning. Now we have news of the incredible world inside us. He was involved in what he described, like the precursor

Speaker 8:          11:54          to the human genome project, what would become the human genome project working with a group of senior scientists who were envisioning maps of the human genome [inaudible] we all know within complete set of instructions which made people, and we began to look back at some exceptional human individuals who had not been understood previously. That saliva test women revealed that Maria had a set of x and y chromosomes who had an x and a y chromosome. Like most men, women usually have a pair of xs and they were also looking at men who had been an all together male anatomy, penis, testes, but whose chromosomes appeared to beat those typical of a female xx.

Speaker 1:          12:41          And for Paige and other scientists, they were like, oh, there must be something more happening here than just like the chromosome. There must be something deeper going on here.

Speaker 8:          12:49          So we might actually be on the trail now of the secret.

Speaker 1:          12:53          So scientists across the world started looking at these people's chromosomes,

Speaker 8:          12:57          and what we found was that the few x y females were actually missing a little bit of the y chromosome with these x, y women. A little bit of the y wasn't there, and the bit of the why that the x y females were missing was the same bit that was present in the xx males,

Speaker 1:          13:21          meaning somehow a little bit of the y chromosome had gotten onto one of the exes of these x x males.

Speaker 8:          13:29          And so it was becoming very clear that this must be the bit that matters.

Speaker 1:          13:36          And around 1990 other news this day, scientists say they've made a major discovery. Scientists in Britain announced they'd found this one gene on the y chromosome, the genetic trigger on the y chromosome that determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl. What they found is that of the 200 odd genes on the y chromosome, there was this one single gene that acted as the switch,

Speaker 8:          14:02          the master switch, the grand master switch, which determines the child's sex.

Speaker 1:          14:08          So it's not x and Y as a whole. It's one tiny piece.

Speaker 6:          14:20          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          14:20          So back in the first episode, there were those primordial germ cells and they had to go on that super long journey to get to the Gonad Cathedral. And on the journey when they got to the cathedral, they were full of potential, right? They could be anything can be male, they could be female, they could be whatever your version of anything is. Um, and then when they get [inaudible] get there, there's a moment where like we said, fate stepped in and just crushed, like swept all their possibility away and said, you are one thing and this is the thing you will be, this gene is fate. Uh, this gene, these scientists discovered if it shows up, then you shoot off down the path that his sperm test is male. And if it doesn't show up, you shoot down the path of egg, ovary female, and the scientists, uh, gave this gene and name s r y. [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          15:22          Sorry

Speaker 1:          15:27          man. Sorry.

Speaker 4:          15:29          So it sounds like we've gone from like crazy ideas about what makes a boy or a girl to chromosomes to now like this little gene. Yeah. But the, the sorry gene that you just mentioned is different than the gene that I just heard about from a, I'm forgetting his name. Zara Kovar is our Coover. It's our covert, Yep. It's our covert covert. Yes, it is. I think, is it different that's the same gene or is it DMR? T one is a different gene than s r y but this, this is what's so crazy about DMR. T y. Okay. Primordial germ cells. They're in the embryo. They're waiting to become something and then, sorry, shows up. But it just comes on for about a day and then it goes away. But once it turns [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          16:14          Zan, it then starts this like cascade of Jean after Jean after Jean. That all sort of say, you're male, you're male, you're male. And what all of these genes do is they create chemicals that send out signals that start forming and shaping

Speaker 4:          16:30          being the test is. And as soon as the test is begins to develop [inaudible] turns the fourth gene, DMR t one zero clovers gene. And it clearly is important for finishing the job of making a testis. But the thing is most of these other genes that make the test is turn off the DMR t one. It doesn't go away at that point.

Speaker 1:          16:51          Yes,

Speaker 4:          16:52          stays active forever in the wound when the test is, is just growing. And then when you're born and through, you know, childhood, your teenage years, adulthood, like until you die, DMR t one is on. And if you take it away, likes are covert, did

Speaker 1:          17:11          the cell will actually change sex, which leads you to believe that DMR t one is actually preventing a cell from switching sexes. That's right. So I called blanche capable, who is a geneticists from our first episode. And she explained that what all this means is that that other path, the path that you did not take in the Gonad Cathedral, um, it never went away. It's actually still there. You carry it with you always. It's just that that Jean has been shushing it. Yeah. Wait, I'm repressing the other pathway. My whole like, I

Speaker 7:          17:50          think we think so. Yeah. Really? Yeah. There's like a parallel universe. Male Molly. Yes. I think there is. There's a parallel universe. Male Molly. Wow. That's just cool. Wait, when you say this gene has been shushing the other Molly, what does that even mean? Huh? Okay, so you could think of it like this. The code for that other Molly who I'll call Daniel, that code is still in my cells and dark cover says that what this gene does is it sort of, one of the things this gene does is sort of patrols and it makes sure that Daniel genes don't turn on

Speaker 9:          18:24          basically what this gene's been doing. It turns out as playing whack-a-mole, I'm basically just going around and being like, Daniel, no, off Daniel, no, op and it does this maybe every day. It's like an election that's always being kind of challenged. Yes. Or why cast the deciding vote and male happened. But there's recount every now and then and a 50. Marty one's not there to say, nope, still male. Uh, then you can go the other way.

Speaker 7:          18:50          So now I understand why you're so obsessed with Daniel because it's not just as an idea, he's like trying to get out and it does go both ways. Like, like, um, you know, there's SROI and there's DMR t one, but they have found these key genes in ovaries that you can turn on and off and have similar results. Why would or why would our bodies be set up this way? Like you think once the decision gets made that you just make that decision and be done with it, why would there always be the possibility of unmaking the decision? That is a good question and I will answer that after break. But first I'm going to call my sisters

Speaker 10:         19:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:47          [inaudible] uh, uh, [inaudible] on chase [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          20:21          this is Kayla Cabo calling from Sunny Austin, Texas. Radiolab presents gonads.

Speaker 4:          21:18          All right, back to gonads. I'm Molly Webster. Everyone's say, say their name or hello.

Speaker 12:         21:23          Okay, it's Chrissy [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          21:25          Peggy. Yeah. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm great. And these are my sisters, Judy, Chrissy and Peggy. Okay. So I'll tell you. So I'm going to tell you guys the thing, it's not easy, that big of a deal, but it's just sort of funny. Oh, I know. Okay. You're pregnant. I'm not pregnant. I'm not. No, no. I just want to tell you about some reporting that I've been doing. And then a funny thing that mom and dad told me, that's all it is. Okay, mom had an affair. No, God that doesn't belong. That's Chrissy. Yeah, this is ridiculous. Um, the third episode is basically about how we all carry in us, like the opposite self that we never became. So, um, so I called mom cause I was like, what would mail Molly have been like, like, did you guys have like a name for Mayo, Molly [inaudible]? And they were like, oh, um, we would've called you Daniel.

Speaker 12:         22:24          No, that was what they were supposed to call me. They were so desperate. They used them.

Speaker 4:          22:29          Daniel, it turns out that we were all supposed to be called Daniel reveal. It's not either. Daniel Webster is,

Speaker 12:         22:40          she does Molly.

Speaker 4:          22:44          Oh Man. Um, are you surprised that your name would have been Daniel Webster? That you would have been a Daniel? No.

Speaker 12:         22:49          No. I think we all knew that. Right?

Speaker 4:          22:51          Peggy? Did you know that?

Speaker 12:         22:53          I didn't know that. I don't feel like my inner Daniel Webster would have that much of a different life than I have. So, but I think you guys, honestly, not to railroad this conversation, but I think you guys lucked out because I was the one that was raised with the hopes that there was like some gang no lingering in me. Isn't Daniel Webster like a famous dude in history?

Speaker 4:          23:14          Yes.

Speaker 12:         23:15          Oh, I took a picture of a statue of him once and send it to dad because I was supposed to be Daniel. Who is Daniel Webster? He's a boring white dude.

Speaker 4:          23:23          Well of course he is. We knew that part.

Speaker 12:         23:25          He served as senator from Massachusetts and was the under secretary of state under three presidents. Well, someone googled fast.

Speaker 11:         23:33          Yes.

Speaker 12:         23:33          I think he's just a reg. A regular like old white lawyer dude. Yeah, they're all racist or ages or just douchebag.

Speaker 2:          23:48          All right, well great. That was funny.

Speaker 1:          23:51          Thank you. Got Her giggles in. It's all been worth it. All right. That's all. That's all I got.

Speaker 2:          23:56          We love you mom.

Speaker 1:          23:57          I love you guys. Goodbye.

Speaker 2:          23:59          Love you. Bye Bye. Sorry Molly. You're amazing. Okay, bye. Sorry about your bedbugs. Bye.

Speaker 1:          24:10          Okay. So to catch everybody up, we have learned that we are all carrying around with us another path. We all have our own inner Daniel Webster's, um, and we're constantly shushing it or them, whatever. So my question for is our cover was like, why would I carry this path with me if I'm always trying? Like if, if I'm just turning it off.

Speaker 9:          24:34          Um,

Speaker 1:          24:34          do you have any answer to that?

Speaker 9:          24:36          I wish I had the answer. So the, we don't really have an answer. Um, it could be as boring as, well, it doesn't really matter because normally no molecular geneticists comes in and hacks out DMR t one or turns on Fox l two or whatever. Um, so why solve a problem that you haven't created that that's quite possible but boring? The more interesting answer is that this is an evolutionary holdover from, from a common ancestor with fish.

Speaker 3:          25:05          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          25:06          Okay. So this ancestor would be our great grandparents, 16 million times removed, which means 400 million years ago, a fish swim out of the depths of the ocean crawled onto land and took like squelching steps forward and board and board and board and board through millions of years of luck and chance and fate until finally getting to

Speaker 12:         25:34          you and me and boom. Hello? Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, I sure can. Bob. My name is Bob Warner. I'm a research professor, studies evolution and marine biology at UC Santa Barbara. What's your attraction to the ocean? Uh, well, the whole idea that there is a different world under there.

Speaker 1:          26:00          Well, I'm just going to add in brothers out of this. So down in the waters around the Florida keys there swims a remarkable fish who had rats. It is a very common, a coral reef fish. This is Marshall Phillips Graduate Student at North Carolina State University. She like Bob's studies. Blue heads. Yes. Anyways, down in the keys are some Primo spots, nice patches

Speaker 12:         26:26          that might have a group of say a dozen blue heads. And in that group there will be a single large brightly colored male.

Speaker 1:          26:36          Just one of them. Yeah, about the size of your hand with a blue head and it's shiny blue, green body, it white and black stripes right behind its head that go black, white, black that we've very technically called the Oreo and if he's got a big Oreo, well

Speaker 7:          26:52          that's a sexy male

Speaker 6:          26:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          26:57          and then the rest of the group is essentially a Harem of lady fish and the ladies in the group are little and yellow, very pretty. It kind of swim a little slower watching out for things that the male is flashing, darting all around, much more aggressive. And so this one male and this Herriman

Speaker 1:          27:16          females will basically spend their entire lives on this one patch of ri where they mate every day, each female with that one male, all it entails is the male and the female will dart up in the water column together and then at the same time he'll release his sperm and she'll release her eggs and then they dart right back down and then a different female, same male go up, egg sperm and dark back down. And then again, different female, same male, they go up down and this is what they do every day over and over.

Speaker 7:          27:47          Kind of sounds like a cult of that idea. Sixties but say something happens to this male. I'll say a Predator comes along and he chumps that mail. So the Alpha male is eaten up. Dead. Yup. Gone. Now the question is what happens to the ladies? You'd think it would be chaos because their whole system has been thrown out of whack, but within minutes to hours, life finds a way. Somehow the ladies pick who will be the next male. The ladies have it pretty well worked out. Who's the largest? Do they all start like eyeballing each other? Like they don't line up or anything? My bigger than, you know, but somehow they, um, figure it out until once they establish who the largest female is, she starts to change her behavior. She gets a little more friendly towards the other females. She'll swim up to them, do this little Wigley Dance, Sorta waving her pictorial fin at the ladies, which isn't really something they do as a female ever. And then as time goes on, her body starts to change. She will get a little bit bigger.

Speaker 6:          29:04          Uh,

Speaker 1:          29:04          how do you just suddenly get bigger? Testosterone or brain starts sending signals to produce tons of testosterone. Testosterone is, is taking over and as she starts to grow, a little bit of blue starts to appear right at her nose. Her scales start to change color then sort of spread backwards right at her chin and spread outwards

Speaker 7:          29:24          until her head is entirely Baloo. And then [inaudible] these

Speaker 1:          29:27          dark stripes start to form. Those will eventually become that black, white, black Oreo. And the other thing that starts to happen is her ovaries start to disintegrate. These are

Speaker 12:         29:42          the most valuable cells in the body, and now suddenly they're being

Speaker 1:          29:46          destroyed and then they start to rebuild themselves into testes that start producing sperm really rapidly. Wow. It's, it's not. It's absolutely incredible. And then sex calls is back. There's a new dominant male at the top of the heap, but at first he's not very good at being a male. Like he doesn't quite know when to dart up and when to spawn. It's just like a teenager who doesn't know how to talk to girls, but eventually he gets the hang of it and can produce baby blue heads and the cycle

Speaker 7:          30:24          school of life continues as a good Attenborough. Thank you. It's crazy that they just disintegrate their insights and then rebuild. But the funny thing is if you ask Bob about this stuff, no. It in fact about how these little lady fish completely transformed. He's like, Eh.

Speaker 13:         30:43          Yeah. I hate to admit that, but uh, yeah, it's not that shocking. The shocking thing is how many

Speaker 12:         30:51          fishes change sets? It turns out it's a lot of fishes. Nearly all the rass you blue had your ferries, your flashers, parrot fishes. They actually looked like parents. They changed sex. Most of the big groupers, the tiny gobies damsel fishes. Everyone asks about clam fish finding an email. Yes, they change sex, but they do it a little differently. They go from male to female up with the clown fish matriarchy. Bob Says we're dealing with like hundreds, a whole lot of sex changing fish easily. Wow. Hundreds. Yep.

Speaker 7:          31:25          Here's the really crazy thing.

Speaker 12:         31:28          It's not just fishes. Some shrimps, worms, alligators. If you include all of the animals in which their sex goes a different way than you would think lies. Lobsters, bananas, lizards, birds, mussels, snails, slugs, chickens, chickens. Oh, ELL frogs. It's just amazing. And wait till we get to turtles.

Speaker 7:          31:48          It's the whole zoo in this conversation. I know. So why would fish like, why would it tell her? Why would any animal change sex?

Speaker 13:         31:57          Well, I think a sex change increases your fitness. You have more young, either eggs you produce or eggs that you fertilized than you would as a c as a single sex.

Speaker 7:          32:09          In other words, it just ensures that you can pass on your genetic material. Like if you're the fishes on the reef and the male disappears, you're stuck and there's no, there's your DNA goes nowhere. But if you can become a male socially, you can make sure that your DNA goes somewhere and then like all the other fishes in your little kingdom go somewhere. Okay, so now let me ask you the next obvious question. You've told me that we come from the fish. Yeah. They've got this flexy sexy thing and that we have at, to some degree, Daniel Lurks within you and is being actively suppressed every single day. So can we be like the fish? Yeah, it does make you think of that. Does our covert says that ever since he did those mouse experiments, he gets this question a lot.

Speaker 9:          32:53          Yeah. Yeah. There's some interest from a transgender community and whether this could be something, it'd be helpful, but we can't do it. We technically can't.

Speaker 7:          33:03          Is there a cover says it's unethical and at this point probably even technically impossible to take that gene away. And even if we could, removing a gene just won't physically reorganize us in the way the fish do. He says at most

Speaker 9:          33:19          you might be able to produce your own natural sex hormones of the type that's more aligned with your gender identity.

Speaker 7:          33:25          Oh, pretty crazy. You can even get the body to do that. Um, but the reason we can't actually do the full on switch is because humans, uh, male and female humans have developed internal reproductive plumbing that is so different from each other. It would be impossible at the drop of a hat to switch was the then then this, this makes me confused. Well, is this to use blanche is a word from a few episodes ago as this by potentiality that still is there? Yeah. Latent being suppressed. Is that a legacy thing that is just fading away or is there, is it there for a reason? It's there for a reason and the fish, is it there for a reason in us? Does it serve a purpose and therefore it will be with us always or maybe even get stronger. Yeah, no, I asked blanche that.

Speaker 14:         34:18          I don't know. I don't know. I don't have a good answer for that.

Speaker 7:          34:23          But it, do you think anyone does or is this,

Speaker 14:         34:29          no, I don't think anyone does. I, I think we're all trying to figure out why it would be the case. Um, and most people ask the same question you ask why would this be true? And I don't know why it would be true

Speaker 7:          34:43          even if we don't know why. Just knowing that that other path is there just below the surface, you know, almost like wanting to express itself does make you think a different way about how rigidly we define ourselves.

Speaker 14:         35:02          I think we like to bend people as male or female and we, I, we've always put people in two piles but I think there's a tremendous amount of middle ground even when you're just talking about, you know, things like the level of testosterone you're making or the level of estrogen you're making or um, the shape of your genitalia or, uh, many other features that we can, we, we've been as male or female. I think there is a lot of, um, there's a lot of variation between the two piles.

Speaker 15:         35:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         35:36          and maybe we haven't appreciated the variation that exists naturally in our population.
