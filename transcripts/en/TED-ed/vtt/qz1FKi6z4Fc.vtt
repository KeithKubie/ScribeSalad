00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:16.609
She's only a few feet away.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.792
The closer he gets, the more nervous he becomes,

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:24.093
the budding zit on his nose growing bigger and bigger until it practically eclipses his face.

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:28.176
She looks at him hovering nearby, sees the massive zit, and giggles.

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:30.992
He slumps away, feeling sick.

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:34.976
Stress can sure make a mess, and it happens to both teens and adults.

00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:36.959
But how does it happen?

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:41.076
Let's rewind to before the zit, to before Justin even sees his crush.

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:46.976
Already late for school, Justin got to class just in time to hear the teacher say "pop quiz."

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:50.027
He hadn't done his homework the night before, and felt more unprepared

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:54.277
than the ambushed World War II soldiers he was supposed to write about.

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:58.443
A sudden rush of panic swept over his body, leaving him with sweaty palms,

00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:01.209
a foggy mind and a racing heart.

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:07.892
He stumbled out of class in a daze, and ran straight into his all-time crush, spiking up his stress.

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:12.309
Stress is a general biological response to a potential danger.

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:15.909
In primitive caveman terms, stress can make you fight for your life,

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.308
or run for your life, if, for example, you're confronted by a hungry saber-tooth tiger.

00:01:21.308 --> 00:01:24.226
Special chemicals called stress hormones run through your body,

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:27.260
giving you more oxygen and power to run away from danger

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.193
or to face it and fight for your life,

00:01:30.193 --> 00:01:33.293
hence the term "fight or flight."

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:37.313
But when you don't fight, or take flight, you face the plight.

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:42.027
When we're taking final exams, sitting in traffic or pondering pollution,

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:44.027
we internalize stress.

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:46.310
It all begins in the brain.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.609
The hypothalamus, the master controller of your hormones,

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.376
releases something called corticotropin-releasing hormone.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:54.842
This triggers the pituitary gland,

00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:57.360
a pea-sized gland found at the base of the brain,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.193
to release adrenocorticotropic hormone

00:02:00.193 --> 00:02:03.492
which then stimulates the adrenal gland sitting on top of the kidneys

00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:07.392
to release cortisol, the major stress hormone.

00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:10.876
These natural chemicals are a great help when you need to run away quickly,

00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:13.542
or do superhuman feats of courage,

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:19.926
but when you're simply sitting, these stress hormones collect in the body and affect your overall health.

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:23.476
Stress hormones increase inflammation in the body,

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.180
suppress the immune system,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.892
which makes you more susceptible to infection by acne-causing bacteria,

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:32.860
and can even increase oil production in the skin.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.143
And this is the perfect storm for forming a pimple.

00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:42.092
Cortisol is a major stress hormone involved in making skin cells

00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:46.127
churn out oily lipids from special glands called sebaceous glands.

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:48.110
But when there's too much of these oily lipids,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.059
called sebum, they can plug up the swollen, inflamed pores

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.697
and trap the pesky, acne-causing bacteria inside,

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.908
where they set up house and thrive.

00:02:57.908 --> 00:03:02.126
Add a dash of inflammatory neuropeptides released by the nervous system when you're --

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:05.792
well, nervous -- and angry zits follow.

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:10.508
To make matters worse, Justin is a boy, meaning he's got more testosterone than girls.

00:03:10.508 --> 00:03:14.277
Testosterone is another hormone that increases oil production in the skin.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:19.831
So, his already oily skin, together with a boost in oil and inflammation from stress,

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:22.426
is the perfect environment for bacteria

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:26.342
to swell, swell, swell up into a major zit.

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:29.892
So what could've Justin done to avoid the big pimple?

00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:32.142
Stressful situations are unavoidable.

00:03:32.142 --> 00:03:35.842
But we can try to change our responses so that we're not so stressed in the end.

00:03:35.842 --> 00:03:38.376
And had he been confident in approaching her,

00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:43.027
she might not have noticed the pimple, or he might not have had one.
