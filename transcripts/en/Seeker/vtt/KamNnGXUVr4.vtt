00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.740
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.870
It’s not just a sedan - it’s a Subaru.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.490
Mars can breath a HUGE sigh of relief -- it
WON’T get hit by a comet in October… but

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:21.850
I’m kinda sad that the Red Planet won’t
take one for the Planetary Team.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.180
Hi there, I’m Ian O’Neill, the space producer
for Discovery News, and I’m going to talk

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.910
a little about a huge event that’s about
to occur in interplanetary space not that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.080
far from Earth.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.530
Some of you may remember back in 1994 when
Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was ripped to shreds

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.530
by Jupiter.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.890
The huge comet drifted a little too close
to the Solar System’s largest planet and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.570
paid the ultimate price for messing with the
its powerful tides -- it broke apart and then

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.920
rained down, each chunk exploding on impact
in Jupiter’s thick upper atmosphere.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.239
This was the first time in modern history
that we were treated to a violent planetary

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.390
event that we could view up-close -- the Hubble
Space Telescope was there to forensically

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.960
study each and every impact.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.320
Then, last year, astronomers noticed another
comet lining up for a planetary impact.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.740
This time it wasn’t Jupiter in the crosshairs
(and fortunately for us, it wasn’t Earth

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.269
either!), it was Mars.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.109
There was a VERY REAL possibility that we’d
witness the mother of all planetary impacts

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:10.799
on a neighboring rocky planet.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.109
Comet C/2013 A1 (also known as Siding Spring)
is a new comet that is making its inner solar

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.139
system pass after dropping from the outermost
regions of the Solar System.

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:23.070
At first, astronomers thought it was going
to hit, but after further observations of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.499
the comet’s path, it became clear that the
half-mile-wide lump of ice and rock would

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.119
miss…. but only just.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.079
Siding Spring will make close approach with
Mars at a distance of only 80,000 miles on

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.249
the 19th of October.

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:37.139
If you compare that with Earth, that’s only
a THIRD OF THE WAY to the Moon!

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.569
As far as near misses go, this is danger-close.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.229
The Mars encounter has even prompted NASA
and the European Space Agency to re-route

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.880
their orbiting Mars missions so they will
be hidden behind the planet when the comet

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.639
flies by, to avoid potential damage to the
satellites by high-speed comet debris.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:54.860
But that’s not to say a grand observation
campaign isn’t planned -- as the comet approaches

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.069
and flies away, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter, for example, will turn its camera’s

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.969
gaze away from the planet and at the comet
for a VERY intimate view of Siding Spring.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.700
Even NASA’s Curiosity and Opportunity rovers
will observe from the ground, possibly witnessing

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.689
a Martian meteor shower as the comet’s dust
hits the atmosphere.

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.510
But, for me, I’m kinda sad that Comet Siding
Spring WON’T hit Mars (sorry, rovers).

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.159
A comet that size hitting a planet with a
thin atmosphere would create a BIG crater,

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.790
around 6 miles wide, unleashing an energy
equivalent of 20 billion megatons of TNT.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.950
That’s roughly A BILLION TIMES more powerful
than the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated!

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.470
Not only would such an impact be valuable
for understanding how large space impacts

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.720
affect rocky planets (like Earth), a fresh
impact in Mars’ crust would be a smorgasbord

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.720
of science.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.550
We could send a manned expedition to study
freshly excavated Mars rock; we could study

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.709
the prebiotic chemicals that comets are known
to contain; we could even look for past and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.430
present microbial life in the layers of Mars
rock!

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.430
Hell, if there was any chunks of comet ice
left after impact, or fresh ice uncovered

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.200
BY the impact, our hypothetical Mars explorers
could have a source of water!

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.180
In my view, it would catalyze a new era in
Solar System exploration.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.280
Well, maybe next time.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.689
Now that you know what MIGHT have happened,
are you a little disappointed Mars isn’t

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.769
getting slammed after all?

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.269
Let me know in the comments below and keep
coming back for more DNews every day of the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:15.959
week.
