Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible] joining me today is the founder and president of live action, a pro life organization, which advocates for the dignity of all human beings. Lila rose, welcome to the Rubin report.

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       Thanks for having me, Dave. I'm glad to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:00:15       Well, I'm glad to be here too. You had reached out to me like a year ago about having a civil conversation about abortion. Is that even remotely possible to do it? We're going to do it. Are going to do it. All right. We're going to see, because we, we do, I think most people watching this from the beginning, just from the way I intro, do you know that we have a, a different position on this? And that's okay. I've had this debate and this conversation, I don't even want to call it a debate. I've had this conversation with Ben Shapiro and a series of other people. Um, but this is the one, I mean, to me, abortion is the one that is the most polarizing and sort of just makes everyone absolutely crazy. So let's put it that there. And here we go. So just tell me a little bit about yourself. First before we get into this.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       Sure. So I'm, I head up this non profit, not for profit, but that's most of my time in life. But I'm also big into my family. That's really important to me. I've got married last fall and regulation actually have seven siblings. Wow. So really prolife yeah, my parents were anyway. Yeah. And then I live in Berkeley right now. Berkeley, California, born and raised in San Jose.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       Wait a minute, wait a minute. What are you doing up in Berkeley? A good time. Are they okay with your alternative lifestyle up in Berkeley?

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       It's, yeah, it is very alternative. But you know what? More people are open minded on this then I think we give each other credit for, because people just assume they, they have like an opinion on it. But once you start to engage and have a conversation, people are, people can be very open minded. So there definitely are people that are just kind of your stereotypical set in their ways. This is my ideology, right? I've had some really good conversations in Berkeley.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       So I think people find it really interesting to see how people have either evolved or not evolved or changed or not changed when it comes to abortion. Did you come from a family that was where, I guess you just said your family was, was prolife yeah. Conservatives. Republicans.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       Yeah, they would, I would, I definitely think they identify as conservative. They weren't necessarily activists. So what, when I started live action, I actually started as a teenager. It was kind of an oddball thing because they were not out there doing prolife activate active activism are, you know, doing activism in any really political kinds. Um, but they were very people that really cared. My family really cared about peep other people. They cared about education. We were homeschooled, so we had this alternative lifestyle. They're kind of like hippies in a different way because they're all, you know, big family homeschool. Um, we, we had like chickens,

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       we've got some chickens back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can play with the chickens later. I look forward to that. Yeah. So, okay, so you've got into this topic. I mean you started doing activism related to abortion when you were in high school? Yes. Yeah. How did that possibly come to be?

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       Yeah, so we, we, again, it was kind of alternatives. I was actually taking like college classes when I was 12. Like we had a really kind of mismatch or a patchwork education. We did all kinds of, you know, where I was going to some high school classes, some college classes. So there's a lot of free time and flexibility in my schedule and I had a lot of passion and ability to pursue things I loved. And when I found out about abortion, I was just very, very concerned. Um, I was really interested in all kinds of human rights issues. I was really, you know, I was involved in like volunteering with children with disabilities, volunteering with homeless ministry, you know, house building and in Mexico, in Tijuana, um, famine relief in this year. So I was really into just wanting my life to be, you know, stirrup give back.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       And when I found out about abortion and I started to really consider what was happening. So there's 3000 abortions every day in America. So that's a million a year. And I started to look at the fetal development and see just how amazing this little life is even in the first trimester that this is alive and just the violence abortion does to that life. And I was learning all this as like, you know, my early teens. I was just deeply struck because I thought if this is really life or be, if these are really humans like you and I are humans and you and I started, you know, embryo Dave, you know, back in the day and realize we all are in the same year, very fashionable. I'm sure. Yeah, I'm in Utero. But we all started that way and I was just thinking, I thought, I realized this is the greatest human rights issue.

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       I can get involved in a lot of other causes. There's a lot of things to care about, but this is life and death for 3000 people a day. And they're people that are not protected by the law. They're seen as society as less than not human and women girls. I mean as a woman and as a, as a young woman, very young women at the time, I just thought I'm being told that taking this life is a good thing, can be a really good thing for me. And I just thought, how can this be? This is a violence violent act. So that really inspired me just to begin live action. And the idea was I just need to get a group of friends together to do community education. Basically community organizing to educate other young people in high school and junior high about what abortion actually is about. Embryonic and fetal development about the risks to women. No one talks about the risks to women about the way it's harmed society and how this is not peace and justice. This is actually violence and injustice. And if we want to be better together and be more loving and be more, more compassionate, we need to eradicate this all together from our society.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       Okay. So I want to touch on a lot of those issues that you just brought up. So you start live action as a, as a young teenager, um, how did it go? Were you, were you immediately a attack? Did your friends all want to join on board? I mean, what, what was that like? Yeah. To just put yourself as a young person out there. Because I get so much email now from, from kids that are in high school that whatever their is, they're starting a young libertarian club, there's nothing and just the amount of hate that they deal with and all that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       Yeah. I mean we definitely got a lot of rejection, um, because very few people, like when we were pursuing schools to give presentations at schools or even churches meeting, got rejection from churches because we want it to go and develop this very professional presentation on like the facts. Right. And we got training and we really did our research and we developed this whole program and literally it took a whole year to convince the first church to let us come in and give a presentation to the, to the youth group there. And it took, you know, several months and the two years to really start getting schools to allow us to come and give presentations. But we did. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       Why would you be getting pushback from churches that I assumed were completely ideologically aligned?

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       Well, just because you're ideologically aligned in theory doesn't always mean you're aligned in practice. So unfortunately, even in the church and a lot of Christian communities, abortion isn't talked about. Um, women are having abortions. You know, even some people are encouraging women to have abortions, like even pastors and some situations like privately behind the scenes, you know, if their daughter gets pregnant. So there's some really awful things that happen like that. And there's this fear of the offense. It's a fear of offending their congregation. Um, or it's just this wanting to be mister nice guy all the time or Mrs Mrs, nice guy or a nice girl, whatever. Um, and so people are afraid to talk about the tough things, even when, according to the research that has been done, the people who are having abortions, as many people identify as Protestant or Catholic as secular and not no religion who have abortion. So you have people who are maybe not going to church every Sunday, but who have some sort of fake background who are not really educated. And not really empowered so that they're also having an abortion. So that's part of the battle is getting this message, forget what your religious label is, getting it to people so it really touches their hearts. And then you make any inroads in the church community to provide the support for women who faced unexpected pregnancy.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       Were you shocked at just how hard it was just getting the conversation going? Because the way I always frame this is if you listen to, you know, broadly speaking, if you listened to, uh, how the media deals with this is if you're on the right, that means you hate women, you want to somehow control women. And if you're on the left and you're pro choice, that means that you hate babies. I mean, that's basically how it's framed and not just through the media. That's basically how our politicians are framing it. How did you find you could sort of get past just the box that people look at it? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       Talk to people. I mean listen than most of our, most of our impression of what the left really says on the right really says, or what abortion act, you know, advocates supposedly really are saying, meaning just a normal person who identifies as pro choice like their representatives and media. Um, versus what we see or what we think are the representatives for prolife often displayed in media are not the actual fullness of the position and they're not actually dialoguing. So the benefit of being a teenager at the time and talking to like sitting down with the youth pastor or going to the school administrators and trying to get inroads was that I was able to just talk to them as a human to a human and discuss what we could bring to the table, discuss, you know, our program. And it wasn't, you know, two people debating in five minutes segments on a TV show. You know. So I think when people actually talk to each other and your communities, things change, you know, when they actually have a respectful dialogue. It doesn't seem that way though. If you were to watch TV or look at news headlines because it looks like the world is so crazy polarized.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       Yeah. So, okay. So if we were just sort of starting from the beginning here, if you were sitting across from somebody and let's say they were neither here nor there on the issue, they didn't feel strongly either way or they just wanted more information, what are some of the things that you would be telling them?

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       Sure. So I would start by first of all, finding the common ground with them. I would say, you know, do you think, and I'd ask you Dave, you know, do you think that it's always wrong to intentionally take a human life and innocent human life? Like is it always wrong to intentionally take an innocent human life and pretty much like 99.9% of people, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       I'm going to wait on answers so that when we get to ours, our differences, I think it'll

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       no, they all say yes. Yeah. Intentionally wrong, too indirect to directly take an innocent human life. And I was like, okay, great. We all agree. So number two, abortion is the intentional and direct taking of an innocent human life. And that's usually where we like really. Tell me more about that. And then obviously the last conclusion would be therefore a abortion is always wrong. But then we have to unpack all, why is abortion always the intentional and direct taking of an innocent human life? Well, first of all, we know because science shows us that a unique individual human life begins as a single cell embryo at the moment of fertilization. Like you and I both began our life that way. And from that moment our sex was determined. Our eye color or hair color within three weeks, our heart started to beat within six weeks are nervous. Our brainwaves are starting to, you know, that we can be detected within seven weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       So you believe that life begins at conception?

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       It's not, I wouldn't call it a belief, I'd call it an acknowledgement and acknowledgement that life begins at conception. And then we know like you actually look at abortion procedures, there's no debate. I mean they intentionally directly dismember disembowel destroy that child, that life, that human life. In the first, second and third trimester. So because of those two facts, you know, abortion, the intentional taking of an innocent human life is wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       So, okay. So there's a lot of, a lot of ways we could go here. So, alright, let, let's do, we'll do some of the more sciencey stuff first. Um, in cases where there is a threat to the mother. Leslie, we'll just rifle off a few of these. What, what position do you think is right or just or fair?

Speaker 2:          00:11:41       Yeah, that's a very good and important question. And there are certainly cases where pregnancy can be, have complications or severe complications if those were to be the case. The intentional direct taking of that innocent human life and abortion is not a medical treatment. This is a big confusion that often happens in kind of pro life pro choice soundbite debating. Like we're not actually talking to each other because they're like, well, women need abortion for health. And when you actually unpack it, early delivery. So in some severe cases, for example, if there are, um, ruptured membranes are infected membranes inside the uterus so that you know that those are attached to the baby. In some cases you might have to sit for severe infections that starting to form, you might have to deliver the baby early. That's not an abortion, that's not targeting the baby's body for destruction using forceps or using drugs that's delivering the child because she's she or he is attached to a part of a woman's body that's causing infection.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       So that would not be an abortion. I'm pro life and pro choice agree that in some cases that may be necessary. And, but for any other case, like for example, if I get chemo or if I get cancer and I need chemo, you don't have an abortion, you might choose to undergo chemo and that's in targeting the cancer cells might harm the baby and the baby there might be miscarriage, but that's not an abortion. So you can do any number of treatments as a woman who's pregnant who might have complications or may have other conditions. But the direct taking of that life going in there and targeting that baby for destruction is not a medical treatment.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       Right. So are there no cases where it's a direct threat to the woman's life that then

Speaker 2:          00:13:21       there, there are cases where the things related to pregnancy might be a threat like for example, ruptured or I'm infected membranes, but that in that situation, delivering the child early, that's not going in there to tear the child apart with, I mean, the way abortions are done, abortions aren't done yet.

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       You're just putting in effect if the child wasn't ready to be given birth to

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       right. And that would be a really tragic case. But in that situation, there should be careful management of the pregnancy to try to allow that baby to live for as long as possible in the womb so that there would be a chance for the baby to be delivered alive. But the point is not using just the, uh, you know, four Stan, I'd Jay lethal injection to kill that child before delivery, but trying to give that child a chance. And if that child were to die after delivery because he or she is too premium, too much of a premium premium keeps getting pushed back and back as you know, like 21, it's 21 weeks now that some babies and a half that can survive after birth. It's amazing. They're so teeny, but we should at least give him a chance. And that's, that's it's a total mentality shift. The mentality shift is are we going to attempt to save this life, this life of the child as well as we treat the mother or are we going to just say this life is not a life. Right. And we can target his or her body for destruction before birth.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       Okay. So that's dealing with health of the mother. So what about cases of where its health of the fetus or of the Child? So I know somebody within the last year or so that had an abortion a little bit after 20 weeks. I think because the child had severely, severely, um, uh, under developed brain and the, and the doctor said this was not going to be anything remotely close to a, to a functional life if, if it survived in the first place. So where do you stand in a case like that?

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       I mean, I would first say if there was a toddler with a severely underdeveloped brain, is it okay to take the life of that toddler because you have a severely underdeveloped brain or you have even a life threatening condition that you, you have a terminal illness. Does that mean you should be killed? You know what, like why don't we treat you with love and try to eliminate the suffering and not the sufferer or try to serve the patient and not see them as somebody that we can just kill. So I think we just need a total mentality shift. And if we acknowledge that these are humans, like a toddler or an infant as a human, if an infant is a human, then before birth, that same child, you know, whether it's weeks or months earlier in their development is a human. Humans begat Hume as you can't, it's not like a different species. This is a human individual, unique life. They deserve the same, they deserve the same care and protection that an infant does. So we shouldn't, we don't leave infants to die. We shouldn't leave infants to today because they have a life threatening condition or because they have a severe disability.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       So does the state then, oh the mother where the parents, let's say anything. If if the state, let's say there's someone like this case I just laid out to you where this person, they just disagree with your premise there. They just feel that they should be allowed to do what they want, but then the state says, no, you cannot have that abortion. You have to bring this child into the world. They fight and now let's assume that the child survives. It has all sorts of problems that they don't want to deal with in the state. Forced them to, to bring it to term. Yeah. Do you think there's any responsibility of the state there? Yeah, cause this is where I find a little bit of the conservative argument. Yeah. To be tough because it's like, well, okay, I get it. You, you're trying to protect life. I can go with you on that. But then at the same time, if are, if you're using the state to force that, well you also don't want the state to be supporting people and now you have a little bit of a chasm there in, in the logic.

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       Yeah, it's a good question. I say, first of all, you have to be consistent. If it is he or she is a life before birth then and it didn't, she is a life after birth. If she's a life after birth, she's the life he or she has a life before birth. So you know, if you're looking at it from the pro choice perspective of it's not a life, then you can do whatever you want. Like I don't, you know, if you can prove to me this is not a human life, I'm fine. You do whatever you want.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       Right. So I think that would be my view. That would be a pretty extreme position for I, I don't find that many people saying it's not a life after,

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       but I think that in a of weeks consistent, if you're a human life, do you have human rights? You know, I think it's just about consistency and it's about, so this is the logic side and then I'll address like what you described as the compassionate, but I think we have to be logically consistent cause we kind of like our, it's like our brains start turning off. I think sometimes on this if he or she is a human life before and science kids conclusive about that. You know, the, the United, the United Nations Declaration, Universal Declaration on human rights that has, that all members of the human family have these rights. And then an article six that says that these are, you know, anybody who's a member of the human family has a right to be seen as a person under the law. These are members of the human family.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       They smaller, they're more dependent. They're, they're, they're, they're very fragile. You know, they need time in nourishment to grow, but they're members of the human family, so they deserve to be treated that way. Um, but in your city, in the case you mentioned, you know, I think it's, uh, it's obviously very complex because if you're, if you're like, you know, has, have socioeconomic struggles, you're not able to care for it seriously, a child, a serious disabilities or a life threatening condition, you're a terminal illness, then yes. I think that there needs to be a appreciation for that and in our society or communities should be supporting those families. And you know, if the family is really not able to care that parents really not able to care, there should be a way that they can place their child for adoption or find other caretakers for that child. And Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       Don't you think that's on the state though? Or do you think that can just be done with churches and synagogues? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       I think it's best people closest and most intimate in the community. So I'm a big believer in subsidiarity. So this idea that the best resource are the best solutions for our community will be as meant as localized as possible. Um, that being said, there will be situations where the community isn't available or if somebody fails somebody. And so I do think that there should be backups. I think that, you know, I, I think a lot of the systems we have in place, they're very imperfect, like, you know, for born children. Um, for infants, for children who suffer serious disability for infants or children from families that are not taking care of them, you know, with addictions or abuse. You know, I think the foster care system needs a ton of work. I think that, um, but I'm grateful that it exists. You know, I'm grateful that we have some programs, some state programs. I think the more localized in, the more we can empower local communities, the better. So I'm not against those things. I think they need to be improved. But I think those same things should apply to the child before birth. It's not, again, we have to be consistent. If this is a human life, they, they deserve protection. Just like a boring life, whether you're before birth or after.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       Yeah. So when we talk about the science part of this, if, if something in science, I mean a lot of this has to do with the way people just view, I think the nature of reality and and really, you know what science verse belief, I mean it's all here, which is why this topic is so difficult to talk about. If science could somehow prove to you that say that life in essence doesn't begin until three weeks in, could that shift your position on this?

Speaker 2:          00:20:32       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       That you know that the egg meets the sperm, okay. Conception, but then for three weeks the whatever that is at that point, it actually doesn't qualify as as life by a sort of technical scientific.

Speaker 2:          00:20:45       Hmm. I feel like even in the questions, a little bit of a contradiction, just because you said three weeks from something is when life begins. Well, three weeks from what?

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Well, dude, that's why I brought up the question because this is where everybody's definition of everything I think is a, you know, you can look at a three week fetus is obviously very different than what it's gonna look like at six months and everything. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:21:08       it's really different as a baby. Like baby Dave had a massive head as it did. I write like, nope, humans are supposed to look different at different stages of development. Um, but, but I think, look, what does the IVF specialists trying to get in a lab? What are they obsessed with getting in there, trying to create life in a test tube. They're obsessed with getting the meeting of us for a minute egg, the fusion, that moment of fertilization. Then they have a single cell embryo and they know that and they'll tell their client the family we have, you know, 10 embryos, you can implant three or whatever, right? I mean, they're obsessed with getting that moment, that special moment in a test you, because that moment means something and the, the science on this is conclusive. But that moment means is you have a unique individual life that needs nourishment to grow. So you, it cannot survive outside the womb. It can survive outside of the test you, but it needs, it needs a ton of support to grow. But if you give it that support and if you don't interrupt his or her life, kill it, then he or she will become one day, you know, an adult, you know, one day will grow into, you know, the, the person and then eventually pass away. As we all know, we die so that it's human lifespan. And that's conclusive.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       There is that meme that I always find, it's hard to get my way out of which it's like they'll show like, you know, a month old fetus and they'll say that, you know, everyone agrees that this is life. And then they'll show or you know, or the people on the, you know, everyone on the right, basically, we'll agree that this is like people on the left, we'll say this isn't life. And then they show, you know, like a speck of something on Mars and they'll say, well, you know, all these scientists say this is life. And it's like, ah, that's good

Speaker 2:          00:22:42       human life. I mean there's a lot of life out there but we're talking about something very special, which is human life. And that's why like even the United Nations, and I don't know if they're United Nation fans here, but even they have,

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the United Nations generally speaking. A lot of reasons.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       They actually are contradictory in their policies, but their, but their principals say, you know, all members of the human family, all members of the human family. So you know, and I think, look, it's not just right versus left. I think on this, you know, I'm from California, I live in Berkeley right now. I went to school at Ucla, like I've met people on left and right who are pro life. And in the pro life movement there are atheists, there are secularists. There are people who are more left wing who are also pro life. So this is unfortunately it seen in the media. And it's art. It's because the Democratic Party has like abandoned prolife ideas, which is really sad because I think you, there are pro life Democrats out there. Um, I think a lot of Democrats are prolife actually the majority of them want abortion restrictions, but they're not getting their day. They're not getting representation. You know, they're getting these senators like all the democratic senators who are running for office like Kamala, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, uh, Warren, um, Stanton, Bernie Sanders. I mean he goes, he's not democratic, but he basically hit all of them are the most pro abortion people ever. They're there for abortion through all nine months.

Speaker 1:          00:24:03       Right? So, okay, so let's, let's bring that to sort of where on that, because they are making my life difficult for this because I, I often describe myself as begrudgingly pro choice. I view this as, I think I do this probably as horrifically a choice as you do. You don't, you don't think it's a choice per se, but I view the, the idea here is as probably as horrific as you do. I don't think that something at 18 weeks is not alive. So when I discussed this with ban my Ben Shapiro, my position, this was I think a little over a year ago, um, and the clip really took off. Uh, my position at the time was that at 20 weeks they've, there is more than ample evidence that the fetus can start feeling pain and I would view that up until that point that I would leave the choice with the mother.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       That, that I, that it's not a good choice. I'm not defending the choice. I'm not moralizing about the choice, but that that's just the position that I would want the power to be with the person that is here now. Now Ben said to me something that you already alluded to, which is which if, well, if you're saying it's a life at 20 weeks, you're obviously acknowledging it's a life at 18 weeks and to be logically consistent, I had to concede that point because yes, I am acknowledging that I'm just allowing the life that's here and now to sort of supersede in the, in the decision making. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       Why did, why did we have this mindset like let's imagine, I mean there are women that killed killer infants that are born, they're born alive infant. I mean there's just a horrible case in Texas. This poor girl who you know had gave birth and stabbed the baby to death and now she's being tried for murder. You know that very severe penalties, which is a whole other debate, right? But it's like, why do we, why aren't we consistent on it? Is it because the infant or the 20 week old can feel pain is pain that the kind of ticket to legal protection, like my ability to feel pain because what if I was paralyzed? I couldn't feel pain.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       Right? So again, I don't think it's, I don't think it's a perfectly air tight, logical argument. My, my deference though is to the mother. Now, I would say this, and this is why I prefaced it by what you just did with the, with the Democrats right now, is that they have now gone seemingly so far extreme on abortion, where it's now we're talking late trimester and then there was that really awful video of the governor of Virginia, right? Yeah, yeah. Uh, talking about decisions that could be made after Bert. Yeah. Yeah. They've gotten so extreme that I'm finding, I'm finding, I'm finding holding what I think is somewhat moderate position here. I'm finding to be just very different.

Speaker 2:          00:26:29       Yeah. I mean, I hear you and I think it's because they're actually being consistent. That's the thing on, on abortion. I don't think that you can have a, when it comes to looking at when life begins, when life should be protected, I don't think you can have a moderate, moderate. It's either it is a life and it should be protected here. She should be protected or he or she is not a life. And we as adults, the strong people in the room, the mom or the the doctor, we get to decide when that life deserves protection or when that life can be killed. So I think that actually in a way, as as repulsive as the Democrats, like you know, crazy abortion through all nine months and lead the infant to die after birth as, as crazy it sounds to most people, they're actually being consistent because they're saying, well, it's a helpless dependent infant. Slash fetus. Slash. Embryo. I decide as the adult when I can confer on, you know, the value on this, I get to make the final medical decision right as they see at a medical decision. So leave me alone. Like leave me alone state, let me do what I want to do. And it, yeah, I think that they're actually being consistent if they really think that we have the right to take some lives.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       So how much of this discussion is just that you think people don't really think through their positions? Because like I, I've thought about this a lot and I get you, I really, I hear you and I find this, you know, who knows what I'll, what I'll think in, in 20 years and we Ryan, who knows what you'll think in 20 years or whatever. But that, but that's what, that's what really thinking through an issue is about. And, and, and you know, there's also an irony here because you know, for someone like myself, if you take a classical liberal or libertarian position on this, you believe in the individual above anything. So my position has been, well in the individual, I'm looking at it through the woman's choice. Now I get the counter argument. I've heard this from a lot of libertarians. Well, if you really believe in the individual, there's an individual right there, the fetus is the individual. Um, but how much of this is just that people don't, people don't want to do this.

Speaker 2:          00:28:25       Yeah, I think it is a lot of that. I think that most people would actually come to the pro life position. And when I say probably position that, so I think weighted down with these like political, you know, edge to it. Like, well that means you're like a Republican and you love Trump. If you're pro life, it's like, no, that's actually not true. You know? Prolife it says all humans are, all human lives are precious and have the same human rights. I mean, I think that's the, the prolife platform you could say. Um, and that starts in the womb obviously, and it ends at natural death. But I, yeah, I think a lot more people would be more open minded and more willing to like acknowledge human life in the womb and see the violence of abortion if they had the conversation. But we just assume that the other side is wrong, you know, we assume and, and people, I think when it comes to prolife, if they're pro choice, they assume that's just what the crazy Republicans believe, you know? Or that's what Trump thinks or that's what Trump is doing. Or you know, they, they don't really, and then they're afraid. I think that's the other thing is fear. People are afraid. And even what you were saying Dave, about being moderate on this, I think there's a sphere of like women are going to be set back, like mothers are going to be set back if abortion is illegal, if abortion is rejected. Societaly yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       right. Well it's always framed as a woman's right issue or a woman's health issue. Right, right.

Speaker 2:          00:29:38       Which is extremely misleading because I mean the first I, the a key part of the hippocratic oath on healthcare is do no harm. And actually the original hippocratic oath, which is that all doctors and medical personnel had to take this oath saying that they would actually not administer abortion because abortion is doing harm to the second patient, to the, to the child. It's killing that child. So we have to have a paradigm shift on this and we also have to see that there are risks, there is responsibility that is involved. I mean, I'm not saying that any woman who gets pregnant, she has to parent that child and be involved in that child's life for life because that's, you know, that may be something that's really difficult for her, something that she's not able to do, but I think we need to take more responsibility for each other. I think that's part of the message.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       So then going back to the question that I asked earlier, do you think that a sensible thing for the pro life movement to do that today, and this is a strange hint that I might be giving you, would be, would be you focusing more on what's done after. So we framed that before within, whether it's done through the church or some other private organization, but if the focus was there so that you can take the pressure off all of the men and women who, you know, they're sort of somewhere in the middle, but they are really concerned that if you're going to force people to do this, you're going to bring all these unwanted pregnancies and all of these things out there and then you're going to have, or you're going to have more women, you know, going to back alleys and all that. So that, so that if your focus may be, was there a little bit more maybe, maybe that would do something. I'm really just speaking.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       Yeah, I mean that is the product movements focus. I mean, again, this is totally the misrepresentation. I think of our, of our work and, and at the movements work to people who disagree. I mean, again, people who disagree are likely not going to be getting their news from people who are pro life. People who disagree are going to be getting their news from organizations like the New York Times is pro abortion. I mean the, The Washington Post editorial boards or pro abortion, they explicitly aren't supportive abortion.

Speaker 1:          00:31:36       Do you know you're not going to get me to defend mainstream media here right now. You're just giving me red man.

Speaker 2:          00:31:40       Mine is that you don't know what's going on in the product movement because people haven't taken the time to look. The pro life movement has thousands more than, uh, more than abortion clinics, thousands of pro bono, confidential pregnancy and early childhood care support facilities. You know, places where they provide prenatal support, they provide ultrasound, they provide parenting classes, baby clothes, diapers, and then when the child is still an infant that we'll try to help place for jobs. They'll try to do resume work, they'll do all kinds of amazing things and there's thousands of pregnancy centers across the country that are designed for this. Then the social safety nets that we do have in this country are designed for, for, for young mothers and for young families as well. Those, those exist churches that are doing support, you know, connected to pregnancy care centers. So there's a ton of stuff out there like here in la, there's several of them. And I volunteered at them, you know, when I was a student. So they're out there, they're just not getting any press. Yeah. People just don't know about them. So about the, so we do care. We care about where you have to be consistent. I agree. You're pro life, you can't just be like, I just love the baby before he or she is born. We love the baby period. We love the life period. And there's work being done for children both before and after birth.

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       Yeah. So what about the sort of like nitty gritty legal parts of this? Cause the, the discussion about abortion often is just framed through Roe v Wade, right? So we're, well, I don't have to ask you where you fall off, where you fall on Roe v Wade, but it is one of those positions where, again, and I say this is begrudgingly pro choice and I hear you and I, and I hear it. I, I really, I do hear you on these arguments. I really do. Um, but as a state's rights guy, because everyone's, everyone, a lot of people think that Roe v Wade was about making abortion legal [inaudible], which isn't the case. This was it, that it was federally, right? Uh, mandated so that, okay,

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       stripped away states protections the roadway way basically said you can't ban abortion in your state. You're not allowed to abortion as a right. You can, you need to allow abortions. And that's actually part of the, the, the uh, women's right in your state. And look, I mean, you could do this, you could kind of walk back to another human rights abuse, our country, a profit at both profited from and perpetuated, which is slavery. And you know, you had this, this, this situation where you had some states who saw the, the, the uh, the person, the slave as three fifths of a human, literally three fifths of a person. And then you saw some states who said, no, these are persons. I don't think states should get to decide that some humans are persons and other humans aren't persons. I'm with everybody's a person. If you're a human life, you're a person. Now how we care for you and protect you. It's going to be complex. That's, that's a whole other question, but I don't, I'm about, I'm also for states' rights. You know, I think we're very big diverse country. I think localization is important for laws and for, you know, both was safety nets, you know, community, how communities are governed. But I don't think that we should get to decide whether some people live or die.

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       I mean, that's what it, it's interesting because this is where, because we don't have these conversations and if you don't hear people explain that properly because you hear a lot of people on the right, we'll say that they think it's an overstep, uh, by the court of what the constitution should be laying out in terms of state's rights and the individual and all that. You're saying that even though your first state's rights, that you don't even think this is a states rights issue?

Speaker 2:          00:34:57       Yeah. I mean, again, it all comes back to is he, is he or she or human life and do all human lives deserve protection? I mean, again, I know it's hard to be, it's hard to be consistent in that way because we have these competing concerns, especially ones that have been heavily branded and promoted, like this idea of women's rights, this idea of choice. I'm for women's rights, by the way. I am for choice. I'm for bodily autonomy to the degree that I'm not interfering with somebody else's right to live. But again, I can't interfere with somebody else's right to live. And if I have a child with me, that is a responsibility. I do have to a degree at least, and other people should be helping me with it, but that doesn't mean I have the right to end the of that child.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       Okay, so let's go to just some other series. The unpleasant parts of this, when, when we see videos of what an abortion is like and all of these things, and undercover planned parenthood things where they talk about, yeah, you know, throwing body parts into a guard. I mean, horrible, horrible stuff. Yeah. I just, I, I guess I want to give you an opportunity to just address some of that. Obviously not that shocking to you, what's going on?

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       Yeah, well, I've been inside abortion clinics. I mean, I've done investigative reporting and I know people, you know, obviously David has done the investigative reporting, exposing the body parts, trafficking, that happens at abortion facilities. Um, he and I work together, so I'm very familiar with that really ugly side of it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       So what does that actually mean? That they're actually aborting fetuses and then selling the body parts? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       yeah, exactly. I mean, now they would say we don't make that much money off of him, so it's not really selling, but they're making like 70, 80, $90 a body part. And if you've got five body parts, if you've got a heart, a Le Livre, a brain, you know, you could be making 400 $500 off of each fetus, off of each baby and on top of the 500 or 400 or $600 abortion, they're talking about a thousand bucks plus an abortion, then, you know, all in profit or all in net, you know, money coming in. So it is an industry. Um, the government's funding it, people don't realize this, but the National Institute for Health has a budget. $100 million in the last reported year goes to research on aborted baby body parts. So think about that. Like the government is literally have this, he has this hundred, you know, 100 million bucks, millions of dollars, which is for these researchers. And so they're going to go by, they need their stuff, they need their body parts. So where do they go? Abortion facilities. And they're going to be like, you know, it's profitable for the abortion facility to do business with the middleman who then hands it off to the, to the experiment. You know, the, the person experimenting on these, on these children's bodies

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       where, where does planned parenthood fit into the equation?

Speaker 2:          00:37:42       So they sell, um, they've sold body parts and there's continue to sell body parts. In fact, the district attorney here in Orange County shut down the middle man that was doing business with planned parenthood to by body parts from them to then sell them off to medical experimenters, you know, who are doing experimentation on, on them. So planned parenthood is one of, I mean they're the biggest abortion. China, I mean a lot of people don't know this about planned parenting cause they were like planned parenthood, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       Yeah. Awesome. They're a hoe. You always hear people say play. It's, it's less than 1% of their activities or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       Even the Washington Post has given that three Pinocchios, you know, like slate has called it very misleading that they do one, you know, one or 3%. Um, the fact is planned parenthood is the biggest abortion providers. So there they commit over 300,000 abortions annually. That's almost a third of the national abortion rate. Um, they're the biggest kind of single chain that is doing abortions. That's 900 a day. 900 lives taken a day up to 24 weeks. So even past the point you say, are your, you know, okay with these are children that are viable. Um, but all of the abortions are, are wrong or are taking innocent human lives. And that's a lot of dead bodies that they could do business with middlemen to get them off to labs where they're experimented on. Is there any country in the west that are, that's doing the laws in a better way, a better way of within your estimation.

Speaker 2:          00:39:04       So Malta, Malta has, you know, really better much talk a little bit ever been referenced on the show before. Well, go Malta. You know, I'm also really prolife and they're very, you know, no abortion is permitted in the country. Um, Ireland was very prolife until abortion activists, a lot of them imported from the UK and from other countries when there and said, no, this is gonna be, we gotta legalize it. But let's see, let's just back up this. So a country like Malta, are there numbers on how many women are now actually going to back alleys and, and what is actually the state doing after? And that's a great question Dave, because I think that is a, a fear that motivates like abortion pro choice people sometimes like, well women are going to go to back alleys. That's actually a myth. That's actually a myth that all these women are going to do back alley abortions.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       If abortion's illegal before abortion was illegal, let's legal in this country, the abortion that suppose, um, deaths from back alley abortions were in the hundreds, not the tens of thousands that were claimed. And the, the reason we know this is first of all, the CDC was reporting in the hundreds but tens of thousands that were claimed that they said we'll tens of thousands of women are dying right now. Um, were fabricated numbers and the people that made up those numbers later on admitted it. So Dr. Bernard Nathan said it was important abortionist he helped found the national abortion rights association. So Ne Rao and he later became a pro life activists, this guy. And he said, we made up the numbers. We were just trying to like get our agenda through. So we literally made statistics up out of thin air. What was it that changed him? I'm sure there's an interesting story.

Speaker 2:          00:40:41       I mean, there are a lot of things that changed him, but eventually, cause he's doing all these abortions and eventually he just saw and you know, as he was looking at the ultrasound of what he was doing and the child basically running for his or her life, I mean, from the section, he just was like, I can't, this is all of a sudden it clicked for him. I mean, it's kind of a mysterious thing. Why didn't it click before? But it clicked for him and he just thought, I can't do this anymore. And at the same time he was having his own faith journey and like believing that human life is made by a god, a creator who loves us. And that also was beginning to move his heart on it. Um, but so it took them years to kind of have a full, like, you know, one 80 on it. But eventually he became, you know, a pro life activists and said, I was a mass murderer. You know, he wrote books about his experience and said, I, you know, I, I took 70,000 lives and shared that fountain.

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       So we discussed a little bit about the belief part and you mentioned that there are nonbelievers that are prolife you really never hear about that. Do you find that they have different issues that they're thinking about or struggling with or meaning if you're not have a religious background? Yeah, cause yeah, the general picture of someone that's prolife is usually just like a Christian conservative. I mean that's just, yeah, that's generally what it is. You don't find that many or you just don't see publicly that many atheist or just more secular prolife people.

Speaker 2:          00:42:05       Yeah. Well first of all, I wasn't always identify as, I didn't always identify as a Christian, you know, when I was like in high school and as a teenager I actually ended up becoming a Catholic in college. But it was after my own journey of discovering what I believed and whether I knew for sure what religion identified with, if at all. I knew that it was wrong to intentionally taken innocent human life. So I think, again, if it goes back to the, the, the, the, the facts of this and it goes back to the, you know, being consistent. It doesn't matter your worldview, it doesn't matter your religious background. It doesn't even matter your political affiliation. Nothing matters except do you believe human life is, it should not be intentionally killed, innocent human life and is the child in the womb is this innocent human life.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Um, but that being said, I think there is a growing amount of people even in the pro life movement who don't identify with a religion, who are, you know, atheists, I know these, some of them, firstly atheists or, um, part of, uh, you know, very left leaning causes other causes who are pro life and see it from a scientific and logical perspective and from a human rights perspective. Um, but there are a lot of, obviously people of faith who are pro life. I wish there were more just because you know, there are people of faith who are out there being Christian and they're not doing anything about pro, you know, abortion there, you know, this is the greatest human rights issue. The, there are thousands of children being killed every day and, and women facing an unexpected pregnancy at churches. And it's not talked about enough in churches. So just because you're a Christian or conservative doesn't mean you've got it all figured out. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:43:36       have you found, um, counterparts on the pro choice side of this that are willing to have this discussion? Because originally when, when I think you reached out to us, or maybe it was on Twitter at first about coming on the show, I thought, all right, well I should do this one as a debate. And then I thought about it a little bit longer and I thought, you know what? No, let's, let's do one just with you so we can hear your ideas without it, you know, without the entering the fray. And then I'll find somebody who it will be a lot easier to find someone on on that side. Right. Um, and do that. And then maybe we'll do this as a debate then or a conversation or something. Yeah. And I'd be happy to do it but I wanted to do it separately first just so that all the ideas can be out there. Do you find that you can find people on the pro choice side of this that will debate you in this? In an honest and even way, because I don't have to tell you, I'm finding it harder and harder to find people broadly on the left that will do these types of debates without attacking you personally and your motives. And that's really hard things about it. It's really hard,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Dave, to find people willing to debate about this. I have been on shows like radio shows, TV shows, and planned parenthood has been invited and every time they've declined like planned parenthood spokespeople or representatives. And I was actually on a live radio show. It was somewhere in the Midwest and the planned parenthood director of that Midwest affiliate was on the other line like she had been, she had been invited and when she heard my voice and she heard that who I was like as a pro life activists and she heard me talking, she literally hang, hung up like she, she ditched out of this, you know, ditch the show. So I have seen in the pro abortion world, um, I call it pro abortion because I don't think, again there's, there is middle ground on this, but in that pro choice world I've, it's very hard to find people willing to have the debate, especially on live TV or in a longer you a format where it's filmed or people can watch it later.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       Yeah. It's so interesting because that I just find so consistent with everything that's happening on the left these days on every issue. If you want to talk about climate change, they won't talk about it cause you have to accept their position first or whatever. And again, I say that I say that as someone that's not fully where you are obviously, but like I'm finding it more difficult and more difficult than their stake. They're in an odd way, they're staking out religious position.

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       Yeah. It's a, it's interesting. It's like, it's the new pharisees, you know, it's like, I'm so holy, I'm so right. I'm not even gonna deal with your dirty, you know, people that don't just don't agree with me and like, you know, I'm, I'm the one who's pure. I'm the one who's compassionate. I'm the one who's correct. And yeah, it's really vicious and it's really bad for everybody, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:46:08       What do you think the pro life community generally thinks of Trump at this point? I mean, he's probably in a weird way, been the biggest supporter for you guys in modern times at some level, right?

Speaker 2:          00:46:19       Yeah. I mean, he has been very supportive and in many ways, um, I was very skeptical when he ran for office. Um, I did not vote for him in the primary. Um, and I was really concerned. I thought he was potentially just kind of tricking. All of us are trying to trick people. You know, even when he had my pants come on as the VP because of Penn's a super pro life and he has been consistently politically for years. Um, I was encouraged by that, but I was also like, is this like your token prolife pence, you know, on a ticket. But he has eve ministration has done some very prolife things, which I'm really grateful for. I find it really sad though that, you know, the, the one that's most prolife as far as the policy is concerned, you know, he, he did it, he reversed the Mexico City policy, which is international funding for abortion. He um, defunded planned. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       Let's talk about that one for a second. Cause that was actually, I think one of the first things that he did and it sort of went under the radar and, and then I saw these people arguing about it and it's like, so we were actually funding abortions overseas, not overseas, but in Mexico over, over, not beyond our borders. For some reason we were using American tax dollars to do that. Do we even know why? Why was that policy even in place in the first place, that that has nothing to do with whether you're pro choice or pro life. That's just like, why are we funding abortions anywhere? Why are we funding these types of things outside of work?

Speaker 2:          00:47:36       Yeah, I mean a population control is a lot of it and that is rooted in Eugenics. So early you, Dennis s in this country, we're also Margaret Sanger and her friends, she founded planned parenthood and they wanted to use, they used for sterilization, like she promoted for sterilization. Margaret Sanger, who is the founder of planned parenthood. She actually designed the one child policy. She wrote out a proposal for a one child policy. If you were, apparently you're not allowed to have more than one child, the state would force you to only have one offspring. And that's what China's doing right now. I mean, they've kind of expanded it to maybe the two child policy, but it's, it's really horrific. I mean it's this idea that the government gets to decide what happens in reproduction. So it's the whole thing about pro choice. It's actually the opposite of it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       It's like, so not choice that you are not, you're forced abortion, forced sterilization and if somebody's developing nations. I know the stories and these are anecdotal so we don't, it's hard to even know the full body of research on this or no what is actually going on, but I have anecdotal stories of women who went to family planning clinics in Mexico or family planning clinics in some African nations that are UN operated, funded by us, have been in the past month by us tax dollars and they were without their consent or knowledge we're given IUD is placed in them that they then didn't know how to deal with. I mean they would, you know, years later this one woman had migraines yet had all these health conditions. You didn't know what was wrong with her. Finally they discovered this old IUD in here that have been there in her for like 15 years and with potentially it could be life threatening. So there's all kinds of weird stuff happening where the rich,

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       right. I suppose that depends how far you want to go down the rabbit hole of what these, the ritual eat may be in you and are doing about, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       They're like looking at impoverished countries and they're thinking, hmm, what are we going to do with impoverished countries or countries that are struggling? Let's have them make sure they have less children. Like why not better education, access to clean water, better infrastructure, less, you know, better democracies. Why don't we just going to try to kill off or limit their ability to have children? I mean it's, it's a really a terrible approached at a very, very, I think in many ways it's racist and it's, and it's, it's, it's of discriminatory just because people are poor against them, right? Because you're poor, you shouldn't have children.

Speaker 1:          00:49:50       Right. It's one of those things, I mean to, to be funding these things beyond our borders, the United State for remove the unit, you end for a second, but to, you know, for the United States to be doing it, it's such a strange thing.

Speaker 2:          00:49:59       Then our, our borders. I mean, well,

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       whether you, whether you're for it or not, doing something within your borders is one thing. Doing something outside of your borders.

Speaker 2:          00:50:07       Yeah. I mean it's our, it's our, I think, you know, where they were going to go save the world. America is going to save the world. Yeah. America can do good in the world for sure. But you're not saving the world by going off and helping other people kill their offspring. I mean, that's just not good.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       So what is the funding situation? So, yeah, so I, I you hear a lot about this, about how much we either give a tax dollars for abortions and planned parenthood or they'll say no, it's 99% private are extremely confusing information that, that again, it's one of these things, it depends who you follow on Twitter to, to basically decide what you think on this. So what is, what do we need to know about fun?

Speaker 2:          00:50:42       Yeah. So here are the basic numbers. And again, I, I'll, I'll explain what the opposing side may say. So for, for, you know, maybe show where the disconnect is, but there's over half of $1 billion being going to planned parenthood from taxpayer us tax payer sources. So that's federal money and it's shifting, you know, going down through the states being distributed through title, title 10, historically that's what president Trump just cut actually, um, his administration and through Medicaid largely there's all these other teeny little pockets dreams, you know, the streams of money as well. So planned parenthood says, well, we're not, they're not funding our abortion because we're using this to reimburse for ultrasound or reimburse for condoms are reimbursed for, you know, um, a pregnancy test or whatever. The problem with that is those reimbursements are helping fund the infrastructure at planned parenthood where they're committing abortions and some of those other services like ultrasound or pregnancy tests are done around the abortion service.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       No, it was like the precursor base.

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       Yeah. And it's just the money's fungible. Like, you know, it's kind of like saying like, we're not going to fund the funds steak, you know, people eating steak because it's wrong. It's eating cows is wrong or you know, or turning the environment whenever. Right, right. Um, and so we're not, we're, but we're still gonna fund steakhouses half of a billion dollars a year. It's like, well, it's only paying for the ketchup and the French fries and like, you know, it's just like, come on guys like that. It is funding a corporation that has increased abortion numbers over the last 10 years and a lot of their other services have actually declined. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       Is there any other funding that the u s provides that outside of planned parenthood?

Speaker 2:          00:52:19       You mean to abortion provider? Yeah, not typically, unless they find ways to reimburse for similar things at planned parenthood is doing. So there's, there is a Hyde amendment where in some, I actually take that back because in some states like California, you can reimburse directly from abortion. So that's the state money. So we're just talking federal money this half of a billion dollars. Um, so planned parenthood, if you went to a planned parenthood in California, if you qualify, you could reimburse for an abortion, even a late term abortion in our state and other states. Um, so that's, uh, that's, uh, a big chunk of money and it's hard to even track that money because every state tracks it differently. But, but yeah, I think the fact that they're funding the infrastructure for planned parenthood, they're funding the ability for it to market itself, build relationships in communities. Um, you know, put the, turn the lights on, hire the staff. It all helps them increase their abortion business.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       Do you know that numbers are the specifics on like states that, right. So I get your position on Roe v Wade. I would assume a state like Mississippi still probably has the tightest laws around when you can have an abortion versus a state that I suppose like California, that probably the most lenient and I'm just picking those two, but I'm guessing I'm not that far off. Yeah, there are gravity is right.

Speaker 2:          00:53:30       Like for example, Ohio recently passed the heartbeat bill, which would try to ban abortions once the heartbeat can be detected. The problem is, yes,

Speaker 1:          00:53:38       usually. When is that?

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       That's it. Just three, you know, three weeks basically 21 days. Amazing. I'll quickly like it. Most women don't know they're pregnant at that point. They, they, they like don't even have even necessarily missed her period yet or they might just start to be missing it. Um, so anyways, yeah, I think there are states that are trying to ban abortions like past the first trimester in the first trimester, but they're being hit with challenges because that's where row kicks in, you know, row says and row and dough dough, which are two different cases. And then Casey v Planned parenthood, these different illegal precedents after Roe that basically say if you're a state, it's really hard for you to ban or nearly impossible for you to ban abortion after, you know, before viability. Um, or if you prefer,

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       do you mind for them that then the discrepancy is when is viability? Right,

Speaker 2:          00:54:26       right. And that meant, you know, medical advancements have pushed it further and further back. You know, a child can survive at 21 and a half weeks. It's incredible of who was born completely. Primi and that may continue to push back. But again, it's so arbitrary. It's like, why does that define whether or not you should live or die? You know, how advanced medical technology is, whether or not you can be killed or not.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       So you would argue that then this law in Ohio, the heartbeat lies basically you would say that's a good first step or something. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:53       Yeah. We, we celebrate any of any laws like that. And there are some states which are also trying to limit abortion by making it, making abortion facilities have to have standards like hospitals. So that's another thing that is made some progress. And what standards does that, for example, ambulatory hallway, so you're able to fit your, uh, you know, I, I, um, a stretcher through the hallway so that if there's a woman who starts hemorrhaging, which has happened, you know, happens sometimes with abortion, she can be carried on a structure, um, or the doctor has to have visiting privileges, uh, in nearby hospitals. So if she goes to the emergency room afterwards, I mean I just knew a friend who recently had to go to the emergency room, um, who had an had an abortion and you need to have the doctor be able to accompany you or know who your doctor is, have admitting privileges. But again, abortion advocates are against all of these things. They think abortion facilities basically should have as few regulations. That's like a dental clinic or even less actually like a tanning. So on, you know, because again, it's this idea, this ideology, this is a women's rights don't interfere whatsoever. And you know that

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       probably what state, what state is the most lenient if Ohio is sort of doing it right. In your estimation, what stay would you say is sort of the most out there? Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:56:09       Well, New Mexico's really out there. It's abortion through all nine months for any reason.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       So that really is real. So you, that means that you can have a perfectly healthy, yeah, eight months.

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       Yeah. Fetus. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       And you don't have to have a medical excuse. You don't have to have a, yeah, I mean I, yeah, I mean this is where I just, I can't, and I got nothing left there, right. Like,

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       yeah. I mean it's happening. People don't even know when New York. Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       Are there numbers on how often that happened? Say after it's really hard after that, 20 weeks or something like that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       It's really hard to track. We know it's in the tens of thousands, but it's hard to know exactly. You know, cause it's some of the state reporting that California doesn't report to the CDC how many abortions it does or how late term they are. So the national numbers, I mean we know tens of thousands, but we don't know. Beyond that, we don't know what else is happening in some of these dates. What New York did is already being done in seven other states, abortion through nine months. But we just, again, people just don't know. Media is not reporting on it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       Wait, so the New York thing, which just happened and there's a very, I thought it was a very chilling video. I mean, I tweeted it even though I wasn't thrilled to do it, of all of the state legislator legislature of cheering this bill so that that bill allowed it under any circumstances to nine months

Speaker 2:          00:57:27       in New York. They said, well, if there's a health or what could be emotional health or mental health reason, economic reason that the mother and the doctor decides. So that's really saying if for any reason, because if I go in and say, we know I'm not feeling like doing this because I just think it's not convenient for my life right now. Um, it's not good for my life right now. And you got the abortion as a sign off on it, which, you know, they're making up to $20,000 for a late term abortion, then you're good to go. Okay

Speaker 1:          00:57:54       man. It's unbelievable. And then they had the, the uh, statute and that statue of Liberty, the empire state building is in pink or something because we're all trade the new world trade building built it. It was lit up and pink. Yeah. To celebrate the late term abortion passage. I mean, this is where I say it's like they're making my, what I would again say is a pretty moderate yeah, decision and you know, you're saying they're 21 weeks now because science has advanced that a, that a fetus could be, uh, you know, uh, livable, right? Then it's like, all right, well I'm talking about the 20 week pain thing and if I that had, I could probably, if we did this long enough, you could get me to move forward on that and that they will know, well, let's say it's 16 weeks. And again, I'm conceding that because that was the exact conversation I had with Ben when he said, well, if it's at 18 weeks and I can't, I can't deny that. But then when they take such an extreme position, and I think this is what's happening all over the political landscape right now, we have sides taking stress, extreme positions all over the place. So we get pulled in ways that maybe aren't the default. I places for us that's true about

Speaker 2:          00:58:53       policy decisions, like how do we deal with environmental concerns? How do we deal with health care? How do we deal with tax palsy? What do we do about the poor? What do we do about homeless? It's like there's so many, what do we do about education? You can have extreme policy positions, but with prolife it's not about policy. It's about fundamentals. It's about do human beings have the right to live and does the state, is it the state's duty to do their best to protect them, even if it's a complex situation. Because in a situation where you know there's, for example, a child abuse, right? If a family is abusing their children, the state isn't inspecting every home to see if your child abuse is happening. Right? So similarly, if we made abortion illegal, it's not like the state's going to be inspecting every pregnancy. They're there. We'll have to, we'll have to deal with it. We'll have to deal with that complex situation. But it comes back to are we about protecting human rights, the right to life or not? And that's why with prolife, I don't really see it as one extreme versus another. I actually see the Democrats position right now of abortion through all nine months as the logical, consistent argument coming from this idea that human life in the womb does not have value, does not have legal rights.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       Right? So you're really giving the devil his due there. You're saying, all right, this is what you guys want and this actually all makes sense.

Speaker 2:          01:00:09       Doesn't have legal protection at 19 weeks. Why should it have legal protection at 20?

Speaker 1:          01:00:14       All right, so one more for you and then I promise you we will do this. If I, if I can get someone that will have this conversation in good faith, we will, we will absolutely do it. And I welcome people to, you know, give us some recommendations in the comments below. Um, what kind of costs is this ad for you to just do this? This is not the type of thing that you're going to get invited to the parties at Berkeley and the cool parties in la and everything else. Just putting yourself out there on something. The, I, you know, I, I know about getting hate online. What does this cost you?

Speaker 2:          01:00:41       Yeah, I mean, I've gotten my share of hate online over the years and you know, death threats and weird attacks and stockers and just very, you know, fake porn websites set up about me and just very weird things over the last 10 years doing this activism and doing reporting on this. Um, but you know, it all kind of, I put it all in perspective because I think, look, we live in one of the freest and most prosperous nations despite these horrible blights that we're struggling with. Like with, in the past it was slavery. In the past it was, you know, women not even having equal rights under the wise men. And now we have abortion. So we are dealing with are crap. We have, we have this stuff to deal with, but I feel very privileged. And so when I do experience attacks, I put it, it helps me to put it in perspective, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       Um, and then also just the incredible reward of seeing lives being saved. I mean, I've been privileged to see lives being saved because of the work that we do. Like women who learned the facts and they'll say, I could never do this. I've just not going to have an abortion. I'm canceling my appointment and we get pictures of like the newborn and you don't understood, or were you just like third graders start crying? Like thank you know, thankful, thank goodness that this happened. Like thank God this happened. So it's incredibly rewarding because we're dealing with life and death, but so it's extremely painful because we're dealing with really horrific violence, but we're also seeing lives be born and live and thrive. And that's what it's all about.

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       So this is what it's all about for me. I mean, this is exactly why I do this show and I'm thrilled that you came in here and we'll continue this conversation. And, uh, for more, I Laila, you can follow her on Twitter at Lila Grace Rose

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:02:23       okay.
