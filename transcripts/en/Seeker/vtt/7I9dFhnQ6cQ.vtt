00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.059
How fast can a virus spread through a classroom
or office?

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.900
The answer might surprise you.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.900
Around two to four hours.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.349
But stick around after the intro to find out
how to avoid it.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.349
Washing your hands often.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:25.770
I’m really bad at this whole stay tuned
thing.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.029
Hi there, welcome to DNews, I’m Ross Everett.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.920
So, without thinking, when it comes to transmitting
viruses what’s worse, a sneeze or a hand?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.170
If you said “a sneeze” not only are you
talking to a video, but you’re also wrong.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.699
It turns out that when it comes to spreading
disease, hands are actually the quickest way

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.059
to disperse bacteria.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.540
A study done at the University of Arizona
showed that a virus could spread from just

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.700
one doorknob to an entire building within
a couple of hours.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.510
And I went to the University of Arizona and
I can confirm that those are some big buildings.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.449
Some rooms can become infected quicker than
others, because duh.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.840
Communal rooms like break rooms and bathrooms
and game rooms are most susceptible to virus

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.519
spreading because they get the most traffic.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.049
When a hand touches a surface it picks up
between thirty and fifty percent of the organisms

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.049
on it.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.150
But don’t go all germaphobe on me, because
most bacteria is actually beneficial and strengthens

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.150
your immune system.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.030
But other bacteria like, say, the norovirus,
you might want to avoid.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.780
So, how does the virus get from your hand
to your immune system?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.090
Take your hand off your face.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.870
Some of you right now are like “how did
he know”?

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.480
Well, people touch their face about once every
three minutes and THAT’S how it gets you.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.400
Good news is, it’s easy to avoid getting
the viruses into your system by just doing

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.870
what every doctor or teacher or parent has
always told you.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.390
Wash your hands, use hand sanitizer, or never
leave your room.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.200
Okay, maybe not that last one.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.030
Unlike viruses, the quickest way to spread
a video is by sharing it with your friends,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.750
so go ahead and do that with this.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.180
