00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.370
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD I NEED TO GET TOGETHER,
TO REGISTER A SMALL EARTHQUAKE OF MY OWN?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.379
HI.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.130
I’M TIM AND THIS IS SCIENCE?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.680
THE SHOW WHERE WE MAKE SCIENCE SO EASY TO
UNDERSTAND, IT COULDN’T POSSIBLY BE ACCURATE.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.480
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY HAS WORLD CUP FEVER.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.260
AND WE CAN’T BLAME THIS PANDEMIC ON CELEBRITY
ANTI-VAXXERS LIKE ROB SCHNEIDER AND JENNY

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.260
MCCARTHY.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.260
THIS TIME.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.710
IT’S BECAUSE SOCCER —OR “FOOTBALL”—
IS SO DAMN EXCITING.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.800
DURING A MATCH BETWEEN MEXICO AND GERMANY,
ONE GOAL, IN PARTICULAR, LEFT SO MANY MEXICANS

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.850
JUMPING FOR JOY THAT SEISMIC SENSORS PICKED
UP A SMALL EARTHQUAKE.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.630
UN POQUITO EARTHQUAKE-O.
THAT GOT ME TO WONDERING, HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.900
WOULD I NEED TO GET TOGETHER TO REGISTER A
SMALL EARTHQUAKE OF MY OWN. AND I DECIDED

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.670
TO FIGURE IT OUT IN AN EXPERIMENT I LIKE TO
CALL…

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.640
BEFORE I COULD GET ALL MY FRIENDS TOGETHER
I HAD TO FIND OUT “WHAT THE HELL IS AN EARTHQUAKE?”

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460
SO I GOOGLED THAT SHIT.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.820
THAT SEARCH LEAD ME DOWN A YOUTUBE RABBIT
HOLE OF VINTAGE STANDUP CLIPS FROM A COMEDIAN

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.820
CALLED EARTHQUAKE.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.950
HE’S REALLY FUNNY.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.640
HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.970
AFTER THAT I FOUND OUT THAT EARTHQUAKES ARE
USUALLY CAUSED BY A SUDDEN RELEASE OF ENERGY

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.700
IN THE EARTH’S LITHOSPHERE.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.950
WHATEVER THAT IS.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.390
READING THAT GOT ME SLEEPY, BUT THEN I THOUGHT
ABOUT A HILARIOUS JOKE EARTHQUAKE TOLD ON

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.729
DEF COMEDY JAM IN 1995.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.119
THAT WOKE ME RIGHT UP.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.119
HEY, PALS.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.040
I’M LOOKING FOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE
TO MEET UP SO WE CAN MAKE AN EARTHQUAKE.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.970
I’LL GET A CASE OF BEER, SOME CHIPS, AND
DIP AND MORE.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300
HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.229
AND WE’RE OFF.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.930
ALREADY GOT ONE MAYBE.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.939
LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE ARE PRETTY BUSY THIS WEEK.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.939
MAYBE SOME PERSONAL OUTREACH.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.760
MAYBE CRAIG’S LIST WILL HELP.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.489
NOTHING?!

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:17.180
HOUSTON, WE HAVE SOME INTEREST.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.090
MOST OF THESE EMAILS ARE JUST PENISES.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.510
NOT VERY HELPFUL.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.700
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TOLD ME TO EAT SHIT.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.010
THAT’S NOT WHAT THIS EPISODE IS ABOUT, BUT
THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.010
OH, HEY.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.130
ARE YOU BUSY THIS WEEKEND?

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.900
YOU WANNA GET TOGETHER FOR AN EXPERIMENT?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.170
ELLIE: I ACTUALLY HAD PLANS THIS WEEKEND BUT
THANKS.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:49.120
WELL, I HAVE FOURTEEN MAYBES ON FACEBOOK,
SO FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE SHOULD SHOW UP.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.450
LET’S GIVE THIS A SHOT.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.450
ANYBODY WANNA HANG OUT IN THE PARK?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.740
I GOT SOME BEERS.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.400
JUST NEED TO JUMP AROUND A LITTLE BIT.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.390
IT’LL BE FUN.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.050
OH, OK.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.650
SO WHAT DID WE LEARN TODAY?

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.060
WE LEARNED THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUR “FRIENDS”
ON FACEBOOK AREN’T ACTUALLY YOUR FRIENDS

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.190
AT ALL. AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE GIVE YOU THEIR
PHONE NUMBERS BUT THEY DON’T REALLY WANNA

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.230
TALK TO YOU.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.230
OFF CAM: I THOUGHT WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT
EARTHQUAKES?

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.230
YEAH.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.870
WELL MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU’LL ANSWER MY TEXT
MESSAGES AND WE CAN, GREG!

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:42.060
UNTIL THEN, I’M TIM AND THIS HAS BEEN SCIENCE!
