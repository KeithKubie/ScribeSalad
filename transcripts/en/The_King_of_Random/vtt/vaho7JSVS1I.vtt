00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.819
When you're using vacuum power, moving water,
or compressing air, chances are it's being

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.550
done with some type of a pump. We'll need
one for future projects, so in this video

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.010
we're building a PVC hand pump, from scratch,
that will do all three.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.329
To start this project, you'll need these PVC
parts from your local hardware store. The

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.079
1" pipe will become the plunger piston, and
we can start working on that first. You can

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.649
see this 1" pipe is a very close fit when
pushed inside the larger tube. There's just

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.069
a slight gap between the two, but in just
a minute they'll be perfectly air tight. I

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.370
chose to use a few pieces of two by four to
hold this piece in place over the blade of

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.010
a table saw. Let's measure out 2 marks from
the end of the pipe, at 1", and another at

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.760
2". You can see here that I've adjusted the
blade so that when it's cutting into the pipe,

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.120
it shouldn't cut any deeper than halfway through
the plastic. At this point we can get the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.970
blade spinning, and hold the pipe in place
with one hand, while using the other hand

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.290
to carefully rotate the tubing. This should
result in a little groove all the way around

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.050
the pipe.Now let's repeat that at the 2" mark
as well, and now we should have 2 clean, and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.050
uniform grooves like these. The grooves are
cut so that we can seat 2 rubber o-rings in

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.910
place, and when they're fitted snug, they
should be just slightly higher than the surface

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.850
of the tube. While we're here, let's seal
this tube with a little PVC glue and a 1"

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.680
plug. Now the plug might be tight, so just give
it a few taps with a rubber mallet to encourage

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.560
it all the way in. Now let's clean up the
piston by wiping away the excess glue, and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.840
use a bit of sand paper to smooth down the
sides of the pipe. I'm using 220 grit sandpaper,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.770
and you can see it cleans everything up nicely
and gives the piston a smooth finish. Now

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.670
this piece of pipe only needs to be 26" long,
so we can cut two 4-1/2" pieces from the top

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.240
to create some handles that we'll use later
on. I painted all the fittings and adaptors

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.789
black, while the tubing got painted blue,
except for the piston of course. Now let's

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.549
go ahead and cement it together. First we'll
need to glue the coupling to the bottom reducer

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.480
bushing, then glue the bigger tube into that,
making sure it pushes all the way to the bottom.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.200
We can go ahead and cement the handle together,
but don't attach it yet, just set it to the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.069
side. We need to insert the piston first,
so use plenty of lubricating jelly around

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.170
the o-rings and the pieces should connect
together with just a push and a twist. Finally,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.739
we can cement the cap on the top, and the
hydraulic piston is complete. Now, if you're

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.489
wondering how the top cap was made, I just
took a regular slip cap and drilled a hole

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.969
in the center with a 1-3/8" Forstner bit.
The #320 O-Ring fit nicely inside that, and

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.219
I used a little more lubricating jelly around
the ring

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.420
Now you can see the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.840
piston sticks out just a couple of inches,
and this is the place where we're gonna

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.480
attach our handle. When it's glued on tight,
it should have just the smallest gap of clearance

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.269
when the piston bottoms out. Well now we have
a piston. Let's turn it into a pump. To do

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.669
that, we'll be using two of these one-way
check valves that were made in a previous

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:13.769
project. The threaded bushing at the bottom
of the piston is designed to accept a 3/4"

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.419
nipple, and the threaded Tee fitting screws
onto that. If you try this yourself, make

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.870
sure to use something like thread tape to
ensure the connections end up water tight.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.930
Our two check valves can connect in-line with
the bottom of the Tee, and because they're

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.590
threaded, we'll have the convenient option
of switching, or replacing them any time we

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.340
want. At this point, you should have a completely
operational water pump, ready to test out.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.760
It's very important that the valves point
the right direction so that when the piston

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.139
is pulled up, water flows in, and when it's
pushed down, it flows out the opposite

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.109
side. Alright, let's see what this thing can
do. If we place something like a balloon over

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.419
the outflow valve and begin to pump, you can
see the balloon blows up on every downward

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.370
stroke. If you try adding additional pipes
to the valves, you'll be able to leverage

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.540
the pump with your feet. I tried putting balloons
on each valve so you can see how every cycle

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.159
sucks air from the red balloon, and pumps
it into the yellow. When all the air gets used

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.889
up, the balloon gets sucked inside. Now this
opens up the option to using the system as

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.519
a vacuum pump, and we can get a rough idea
on how strong it is by blocking the valves

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.340
from both directions. This time when the piston
is pulled back, it creates a strong vacuum

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.050
in the chamber, which you can clearly see
when we let go. For more variety, I tried

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.110
converting this into a vertical pump, and
was able to pump 3 gallons of water in about

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.100
a minute. Each cycle seems to pump just a
little over 2 cups of water, and I found that

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.620
by leveraging the pump with my feet, I could
double the flow rate, and move over 5 gallons

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.580
a minute. Some additional features are that
the handle can rotate a full 360ยบ, and perhaps

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.380
my favorite is how easily it comes apart for
servicing. If you need to get inside the pump,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.990
just give the handle a sharp tug and the whole
plunger comes right out. This gives you easy

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.590
access to clean it, or add more lubrication
if you need it. Well now you know how to make

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.480
a simple PVC hand pump that can be used for
compressing air, pumping water, or creating

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.000
a vacuum. If you liked this project, perhaps
you'll like some of my others. Check them
