00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.020
So, we were talking about expected values,
right, averages, linearity.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.838
So, just continuing
right where we left off.

00:00:07.838 --> 00:00:09.910
I owe you a proof of linearity.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.221
I don't like be in debt, so
let's start by proving linearity, and

00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:16.047
then do some more examples.

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:20.686
We started on some examples last time, but
continue just seeing why is linearity so

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.820
useful, linearity of expectation.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.194
So start with the proof.

00:00:27.263 --> 00:00:30.515
This is kind of my own proof of linearity.

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.200
I call it, I don't know what I call it.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.838
But I like this proof better than
the ones that usually one sees.

00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:44.554
Basically, remember last time we
wrote down a list of numbers, and

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.780
we averaged them in two different ways?

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.740
One is the naive way, just add them up and
divide by how many numbers there are, and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.620
then the other way was we grouped the same
numbers together, grouped them together,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.700
and take the weighted
average at the same thing.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.830
That's basically the proof of linearity,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.708
it just doesn't seem that way until
you think hard enough about it.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:07.500
So I wanna explain that point
of view to you rather than doing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.050
tedious calculations.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.030
So here's what we're trying to do.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.900
We're looking at the sum of two random
variables, let's call it T for total,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.000
T = X+Y, and our goal is to show

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.826
that expected value of T is the expected
value of X plus the expected value of Y.

00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:34.640
Show E(T) = E(X)+E(Y),

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.530
which as I said last time, is pretty
obvious if X and Y are independent, but

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.410
not at all obvious, at least to most
people, if X and Y are dependent, and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.900
this is always true as long
as these expectations exist.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.260
You could have random variables where
the expectation doesn't exist, cuz the sum

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.420
diverges, or something like that, but
as long as these numbers actually exist,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.600
this is always true,
even if they're dependent.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.926
So here's kind of the first attempt.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:06.217
What if we just tried
to directly prove this?

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:09.959
It looks kind of straightforward,
and you can say,

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.220
well sums are linear, and so
on, it should be kind of easy.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.926
Let's just try to do this brute
force from the definition.

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:20.148
What would we have to do?

00:02:20.148 --> 00:02:23.480
Well, we'd have to write
down the definition of E(T),

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.310
the definition of E(X), the definition
of E(Y), and see is it the same.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.641
So here's E(T).

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:35.540
E(T) is the sum over t, right now,
I'm assuming they're discrete.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.690
I'm gonna prove it in the discrete case.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.200
We haven't dealt much yet
with continuous random variables, but

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960
we'll be coming to that soon.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.076
But the proof is analogous in
the continuous case anyway.

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:47.590
So right now we're working with
discrete random variables.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.020
That means we have a PMF, and the expected
value is the sum of of T times the PMF so

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.195
remember this form also time.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:03:01.100
We're just taking a weighted average of,
little t is a possible value of capital T,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.899
and that's the PMF, so
it's just the weighted average.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.670
So, but equals with a question mark,
because this is what we wanna see,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.127
whether this is true, E(X)+E(Y).

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:17.162
So for E(X) we would take the sum of x,

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:20.520
sum over xP(X=x), and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.260
then similarly for y, yP(Y=y).

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.700
I'm assuming they're all discrete random
variables, so we can work with the PMFs.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.725
So there's a question mark here.

00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:36.610
So now we need some kind of a strategy.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.100
How do we deal with this?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.872
Well, I guess there's two strategies I
can think of just off the top of my head.

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:46.175
One would be try to mess around
with the right hand side, and

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:47.507
show that equals this.

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:49.676
The other be we try to
mess around with this, and

00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:51.419
show that it can split it up like that.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.024
Let's consider both strategies.

00:03:54.024 --> 00:03:57.660
Strategy one,
try to combine these into this.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.320
This is a sum over x,
this is a sum over a y.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.932
How do we combine a sum over x and
a sum over y?

00:04:05.932 --> 00:04:09.150
Just like two sums right, I don't
really see how to put them together.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.690
So let's consider
the alternative approach.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.780
Take this thing,
now how can we break this apart?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.450
Well this is a little bit more promising.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.090
I mean, it's not obvious like how
is t gonna split up into an x and

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.100
a y, but we can try to play
around with this P(T=t).

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.555
In particular, we could take P(T=t), and

00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:35.938
our most important strategy
is conditioning, right?

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:36.810
What do we wish we knew?

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.680
Well, it would be useful to know X, or
to know Y, so it's conditioned on X.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.410
So I can write this as
the sum over little x, P(T=t

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.382
| X=x)P(X=x).

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.180
Now T,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.600
capital T = X+Y, and if we know X is
little X we can plug in little X there.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.959
If X and Y are independent then
we could simplify this, and

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:14.787
it'd be kind of similar to when we
proved algebraically that the sum

00:05:14.787 --> 00:05:18.700
of independent binomials
with the same P is binomial.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.490
We did the algebraic proof of that.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.110
It reduced to the Vandermonde thing.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.540
So it will look kind of like that if X and
Y are independent, and

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.665
we could eventually probably
work it out to this.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:33.430
Now that's if X and Y are independent,
but I didn't say X and Y are independent.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.104
So if they're dependent then you're
just kind of stuck with this given

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:38.155
(X=x) forever.

00:05:38.155 --> 00:05:43.362
You can plug in (X=x), but
there's still gonna be a y here,

00:05:43.362 --> 00:05:46.812
and then it's y given x, and your stuck.

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:51.020
So, that doesn't work.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.090
Let's do this from another point of view.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.257
But just by looking at
pebble world over here.

00:05:56.257 --> 00:05:58.414
So, I'm just gonna draw a simple picture.

00:05:58.414 --> 00:06:03.456
Let's just suppose X has four
possible values, and I just assume

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:09.884
that I've arranged my sample space such
that they're kind of arranged by column.

00:06:09.884 --> 00:06:14.067
Remember a random variable is
a mapping from the sample space.

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:18.738
The sample space is the set of
all pebbles to the real line.

00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:23.145
So suppose I've arranged my pebbles,
just for simplicity in that picture I'm

00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:26.433
assuming X can only take on
these four possible values, but

00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:29.740
the same idea would work for
any discrete random variable.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.630
Let's just have a picture
I can draw easily.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.004
So suppose that there are four pebbles,
each of these pebbles get mapped X=0, so

00:06:37.004 --> 00:06:40.315
that means you have this random
experiment if the outcome is one

00:06:40.315 --> 00:06:42.583
of these four pebbles, then we say X=0.

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:47.209
If the outcome is one of these
two pebbles, we say X=1, and

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:52.855
maybe these three pebbles go to X=2,
and this one pebble goes to X=3.

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:54.460
So that's what a random variable is.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.800
Any discrete random variable,
conceptually, looks something like this.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:07.386
Now let's just make an observation
about how we can do our summation,

00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:14.710
E(X), we defined it to be the sum
over all values x of x times the PMF.

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:22.363
That was the definition, but notice that
we could do this a different way instead.

00:07:22.363 --> 00:07:29.155
That is to sum, not over values of the
random variable, but sum over all pebbles.

00:07:29.155 --> 00:07:31.235
So this is the space capital S, and

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:34.515
I'm thinking of each individual
pebble as a lower case s.

00:07:35.725 --> 00:07:41.216
X(s) remember x is a function,

00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:44.358
so X(s)P(s).

00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:49.115
Remember we have these different
pebbles whose total mass equals 1.

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:51.254
P(s) is the mass of pebble s.

00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:57.240
So, notice this is the same thing, and

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.110
that's obvious once you've stared at it
enough to like understand what we're doing

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.170
here, because it's the same thing as
doing the average in two different ways,

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.010
like we did last time.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.450
This one is the grouped one.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.625
This one is the ungrouped.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.510
So what we're doing with this some
of our pebbles is we're just taking

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.570
each pebble as a sign of certain value and
we're just averaging them all together.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.750
It's a very obvious thing to do.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.180
Just take the average, of course it's
a weighted average cuz some of the pebbles

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.530
have higher probability possibly.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.409
On the other hand as in this picture
we could first group together all

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.662
the pebbles that got
assigned X equals to 0,

00:08:38.662 --> 00:08:42.620
group together that's assign
X equals to 1 and so on.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.890
Group all these together.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.055
You can imagine these four
pebbles with X equals 0,

00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:51.980
kind of like clump them together, glue
them together, until like a super pebble.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.320
A super pebble has a mass equal
to the sum of these masses.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.840
Glue these two together, glue these three
together, this one's already one pebble.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.450
So we could group them together, that's
exactly what this is saying to do, right,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.140
because we grouped them all together, and

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.420
then give it a larger mass,
if it's a super pebble.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.480
So that's just immediate, just by
thinking of how we could do averages by

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.710
grouping together terms
that have the same value.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.460
So that's true for any random variable X.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.062
Now, let's probe linearity
in the discrete case.

00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:34.910
And the continuous case
is basically the same.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.670
We'll talk more about continuous later.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.370
So what do we have to do?

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.640
Well, let's just use this same
identity for T instead of for X.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.670
So we could say well what's
the probability, not the probability.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.810
What's the expected value of T?

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.374
This definition got us
stuck let's use this way

00:09:56.374 --> 00:09:59.919
to write as a sum of overall pebbles.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:07.555
So it's the sum overall

00:10:07.555 --> 00:10:12.059
s X plus Y of s P of s.

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:15.540
By definition what does it
mean to add two functions?

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.020
Well, it just means you compute
both functions and add them.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.410
That's just the definition
of adding functions.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:27.410
So, that's really just the same thing
as X of s, plus Y of s, times P of s.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.500
And now, just distribute, you know,
this times this, plus this times this.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.180
And break the sum.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.380
Now everything is summed over the same s,
whereas here it was annoying,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.720
cuz we had to sum over x, sum over y.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.710
Here, everything is a sum over pebbles.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:51.629
So now we just write it as two sums,

00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:56.757
that's just the sum of X of s P of

00:10:56.757 --> 00:11:01.730
s plus the sum of Y of s, P of s.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:07.364
But according to this identity again
that's just E of X plus E of Y.

00:11:07.364 --> 00:11:10.390
And so that's the end of the proof.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.500
So it's almost immediate once you see
that you can write the expected value as

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.940
the sum of pebbles rather
than in this original form.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.670
Okay, well now I have a clear
conscience about linearity.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.480
There was one other fact about linearity,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.701
which was that you can
multiply by constants.

00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:38.253
So I'll just say similarly,
do the exact same thing except

00:11:38.253 --> 00:11:42.988
it's even easier in this case
if we multiply it by a constant,

00:11:42.988 --> 00:11:46.832
E of C times X equals C times
E of X if C is a constant.

00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:52.150
That's the other part of linearity.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.220
And to see that,
just use the same thing again.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.480
Just multiply both sides by C,
take out the C.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.210
This one is more intuitive, I think,
because it just says, you know,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.965
the expected value of 2 times X is
twice the expected value of X so

00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:08.285
we use that a lot.

00:12:08.285 --> 00:12:13.445
But by the way actually, this one I think
this seems pretty simple if you multiply

00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:17.327
all the numbers by three then multiply
the average by three, it's pretty natural.

00:12:17.327 --> 00:12:20.827
But this also helps explain
some of the intuition for

00:12:20.827 --> 00:12:25.887
why is this true even if X and
Y are dependent.

00:12:25.887 --> 00:12:30.866
Because remember it's very useful
to look at extreme cases, so

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:33.917
here is an extreme case of dependence,

00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:40.649
What if X equals Y?

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.110
That's as dependent as they can get.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.950
They're the same thing.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:53.134
Now if that's true,
then E of X plus Y since

00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:59.182
it's the same thing it's
E of 2X equals 2 E of X,

00:12:59.182 --> 00:13:05.110
which is in fact the same
thing as E of X plus E of Y.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.060
Okay, so that's not a proof of linearity,
but that's checking.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.670
That in that extreme form of dependence,
it's true.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:17.080
And in the case of independence then it's
pretty intuitive that this should be true

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.280
and so we've covered both extremes and
the proof covers everything in between.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.240
So that linearity.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.270
So let's do some more examples
of how we would use that.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:36.310
Here's another one of our
famous distributions, and we're

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.350
gonna have a whole, by the end of this
semester we're gonna have a list of 13 or

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.270
14 extremely important
distributions in statistics.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.490
So you might ask,
what makes a distribution important,

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.180
because there are infinitely
made distributions so

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.930
we could write down just
choose whatever PMF we want.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:59.530
Or create any CDF we want and
then at some distribution and

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:04.060
why are we being so undemocratic about it
and we keep talking about binomials and

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.390
geometrics or we could be talking,
everyone can make up their own.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.040
Well, the reason is that
the most important ones all have

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.220
nice useful stories behind them.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.130
So we saw the story of the binomial
the story of the geometric the story of

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:26.600
the hyper geometric and there's just a few
more of those that we're gonna need soon.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.300
There are only a couple more discrete
ones we need for the entire semester.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.110
And then there's gonna be a bunch of
continuous ones that we'll get to later.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.790
But as far s discrete ones, I think
there's only two more that we need.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.740
So, I'll do one today,
and one on Wednesday.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.520
And then we're done with
all the famous discrete

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.400
distributions that we need in this course.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.872
So one of them is called
the negative binomial.

00:14:51.813 --> 00:14:56.581
Don't be fooled by the name,
the name negative binomial usually might

00:14:56.581 --> 00:15:00.985
make you think that you take
a binomial and then make it negative.

00:15:00.985 --> 00:15:03.198
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Like multiply it by negative 1 or

00:15:03.198 --> 00:15:04.180
something.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:09.440
But negative binomial is actually non
negative and it's not a binomial.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.382
So it's kind of a mis-normal but
that's standard terminology.

00:15:14.382 --> 00:15:16.580
Actually what the negative binomial is,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.420
is a generalization of
the geometric distribution.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:27.682
So a negative binomial,
it has two parameters Of r and p.

00:15:31.907 --> 00:15:36.131
And the story is that,
remember what the geometric.

00:15:36.131 --> 00:15:40.935
We were doing Bernoulli trials over and
over and over again

00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:44.775
until getting success for the first time
then we counted the number of failures.

00:15:44.775 --> 00:15:48.809
This is the extension to the case
where you want r successes.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.727
So again we have independent
Bernoulli P trials,

00:15:55.727 --> 00:15:58.776
like with the geometric.

00:16:01.557 --> 00:16:06.109
And we want to know number of Of failures,

00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:13.210
Before the rth success.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.445
So keep trying and trying and
trying until you have r successes, and

00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:18.166
then count the number of failures.

00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:19.932
That value would be called
a negative binomial.

00:16:25.098 --> 00:16:29.160
And, Let's find the PMF.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.470
Let's find the expected value, okay?

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.801
So what's the PMF?

00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:45.234
Well, to find the PMF basically we
just need to draw a little picture for

00:16:45.234 --> 00:16:49.470
ourselves, and
then think about the picture.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.520
So the picture is just a sequence.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.594
Well, let's write 1 for
success and 0 for failure.

00:16:56.594 --> 00:17:00.683
So maybe it looks like this, 1000100,

00:17:00.683 --> 00:17:04.271
I'm just making something up right now.

00:17:04.271 --> 00:17:08.230
And let's choose a value of r,

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:14.050
let's say r equals 5, 00001001.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.860
Okay, I just made up a sequence
that has five 1s in it and

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.024
however many 0s,
I just felt like writing, okay.

00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:25.480
Now [COUGH], I claim that if we
stare at this binary sequence

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.890
long enough we can just write down the PMF
without having to do any further work.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:35.496
So that's good, I don't wanna do a lot of
work, I just wanna write down the PMF.

00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:36.647
So what's the PMF?

00:17:38.636 --> 00:17:43.314
Well, I say you just stare at this,
I mean we all need to stare at this a bit.

00:17:43.314 --> 00:17:49.204
I'm saying that r = 5,
just for our sake of example,

00:17:49.204 --> 00:17:53.300
because I drew five 1s, r = 5.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.470
And well, I guess I have to
do some work counting the 0s.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.500
How many 0s were there?

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.440
One, two, three four five six
seven eight nine, eleven 0s.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.280
So we want the probability that x = n,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.120
let's say if x is negative binomial.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:15.584
x equals n would me that
there are 11 failures, right.

00:18:15.584 --> 00:18:21.547
So since there are 11 ones,
n = 11 in this example, okay?

00:18:21.547 --> 00:18:25.259
And p is whatever it is,
we don't have to worry about p right now.

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:31.268
All right now, Notice one simple but

00:18:31.268 --> 00:18:38.257
important fact about this
sequence that ends in a 1, right?

00:18:42.926 --> 00:18:45.018
That's the rth success right there.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:49.113
Okay?

00:18:50.689 --> 00:18:53.162
That could not have been a 0, right?

00:18:53.162 --> 00:18:57.483
Because if that was a 0 that would either
mean we had not yet achieved our rth

00:18:57.483 --> 00:19:02.090
success, or we'd achieved it earlier and
then why were we continuing, okay?

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.520
So one thing I know for

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.300
sure, is that when you stop this,
it's gonna be with a success, right?

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.279
Now, let's consider
the rest of this stuff.

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:22.430
If I permute these 0s and 1s,
would that still be valid?

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.680
Yeah, it didn't matter, right?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.350
And I can change these however I want, so
amongst here, there are four successes,

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.280
meaning we have not yet
got in our fifth success.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.730
So permute these however you want,
it's not gonna change things.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.167
It's not gonna change the probability,

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:41.164
it's not gonna change
whether it's valid or not.

00:19:41.164 --> 00:19:44.040
So amongst these earlier terms,

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:49.495
we know that there are 4 successes and
11 failures, right?

00:19:49.495 --> 00:19:51.488
But those can be in any order.

00:19:51.488 --> 00:19:53.280
And those are the only possibilities,
right?

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.230
We need to have the rth success,
and then the earlier stuff.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.958
We already know how many 0s,
how many 1s it could be but

00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:00.654
they could be in any order, okay.

00:20:00.654 --> 00:20:02.599
Now we can immediately write down the PMF.

00:20:04.242 --> 00:20:11.076
The PMF is gonna be, first of all the
probability of this particular sequence,

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:18.012
this particular sequence had r successes,
and each success has probability p.

00:20:18.012 --> 00:20:24.430
And there are n failures,
so it's (1- p) to the n.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.390
That's the probability of this
particular sequence that I wrote down.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.400
Then we have to multiply
it by how many possible

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.110
ways are there are to rearrange it.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.480
This one has to stay here,
but the ones before it,

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.760
the terms before it could be in any order.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.340
So all we have to do is select
the locations of the 0s, or

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.320
equivalently select
the locations of the 1s.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.210
So we can do,
how many terms are there before?

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.922
Well it's n + r- 1,
just everything except the last one.

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:59.140
And then we just have to choose where
the successes are, there's r- 1 successes.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.250
So we could do r- 1.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.220
We could also chose n,
remember it's the same thing.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:11.683
So this is for n = 0,1,2, and so on.

00:21:11.683 --> 00:21:13.484
So that's the PMF.

00:21:17.156 --> 00:21:21.621
The reason it has the name negative
binomial is just that in combinatorics

00:21:21.621 --> 00:21:26.445
this kind of series is closely related to
what you would get if we did the binomial

00:21:26.445 --> 00:21:27.104
theorem.

00:21:27.104 --> 00:21:32.360
The binomial theorem is
a plus b to a positive power,

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.830
if you expand a plus b to a negative power
you get something closely related to this.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.821
So it's like a negative power
in the binomial theorem.

00:21:40.821 --> 00:21:45.189
But that's just the etymology of the term
and we don't need to worry about that.

00:21:45.189 --> 00:21:48.580
For our purposes what we care about is
the story and we care about the PMF.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.226
And then we care about
what can we do with this?

00:21:54.226 --> 00:21:59.387
Well, The next

00:21:59.387 --> 00:22:03.210
obvious thing to do is compute the mean,
right?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.018
So let's find E (X),

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:17.088
Okay, so we have the PMF, so
in principle we can compute

00:22:17.088 --> 00:22:23.250
the mean just by taking the sum of
n times this, summed over all n.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.286
And that looks pretty nasty.

00:22:27.142 --> 00:22:29.315
So let's try to think of
a better way to do it.

00:22:31.354 --> 00:22:35.033
Better way to do this is to say well,
first of all if r is 1,

00:22:35.033 --> 00:22:38.240
remember think of simple in extreme cases.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.250
If r equals 1 then it's just a geometric
and we computed last time in two different

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.770
ways that a geometric p has
expected value q over p, okay?

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.899
So we know the case r equals 1 already.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.840
Now let's think, okay, well it's
a slightly harder case, r equals 2.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.650
So we are waiting and waiting and
waiting, until we have two successes.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.066
But a natural way to view that would be,
first you wait for

00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:11.168
your first success, and then you wait for
the second success, right?

00:23:11.168 --> 00:23:14.668
And in general if you wanna wait for
r successes, you can think of that as,

00:23:14.668 --> 00:23:18.636
first wait for the first success, then
wait for the second, third and the fourth.

00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:22.399
So therefore we can interpret this as,

00:23:25.408 --> 00:23:30.024
I'm gonna rewrite X as X1 + blah, blah,

00:23:30.024 --> 00:23:35.167
blah + Xr,
where Xj is the number of failures.

00:23:40.226 --> 00:23:43.450
X1 is the number of failures
before the first success.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.200
X2 is the number of failures between the
first success and the second success and

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.040
so on.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:56.684
So Xj is number of failures between
(j- 1)st and jth successes.

00:23:56.684 --> 00:24:00.840
For X1, I'm just interpreting
it as the number of failures

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.760
to start with before the first success.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.230
So number of Failures between
the j minus first and jth success.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:17.630
Then we already know the distribution
of Xj, Xj is just geometric p.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:23.200
Now in this case the extras
are even independent, but

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.160
we don't even need that for
this calculation.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.320
So, they're independent because if you
just imaging we have independent trials.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.560
So you wait an amount of time for
the first success.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.190
And then I'm talking about the additional.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.540
From that point on we're starting
at that point, how many more?

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.480
And keep going like that.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.630
So they are independent,
but we don't actually care.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.760
By linearity this is
just E of X1 plus blah,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.351
blah, blah, plus E of Xr,

00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:56.371
therefore that's equal to rq over p.

00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:59.252
So that's another calculation you could
do in your head because in your head

00:24:59.252 --> 00:25:02.313
you just think, well I'll wait for the
first success and then the additional for

00:25:02.313 --> 00:25:04.370
the second and
the additional for the third.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.670
Each one of those is geometric P.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.153
Each one of those q over p and
there's r of them, so it's rq over p.

00:25:09.153 --> 00:25:12.550
We just took q over p and
multiplied it by r.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.260
So it's very, very easy if you
think of it that way and very,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.370
very nasty if you don't
think of it that way.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.530
Okay, so, that's the negative binomial.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.970
And I want to just mention that you do
have to be careful about conventions,

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.740
both for the geometric and
the negative binomial.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:35.190
Some books start the geometric at 1, which
would mean you're counting the success.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.350
And we are starting it at,
both conventions are common,

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.390
starting it at 0 or starting at 1.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.740
They're both very common
in the literature.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.010
For example Ross starts
his geometrics at one.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.920
And starts his geometrics at zero.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.550
And we're starting our geometrics at zero.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.890
So we're following more
like the convention

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.780
which again is very common as well but
both conventions are common.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.200
For the geometric, I'm kind of ambivalent
about which convention I like more.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.778
But I decided to go with the zero.

00:26:04.778 --> 00:26:10.261
The negative binomial.I definitely
like the convention more.

00:26:10.261 --> 00:26:14.764
If you look in Ross he'll start
the negative binomial at r,

00:26:14.764 --> 00:26:18.547
because he's counting
the successes as well, so

00:26:18.547 --> 00:26:24.220
if if you're successful the first r times,
then those would count.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.890
And we're starting at zero.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.060
So it's very easy to convert back and
forth between those, it's just you have to

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.520
be careful, if you just blindly
copy a formula from somewhere, and

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.340
they're using a different convention,
then it's gonna be completely wrong.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.880
As long as you're careful,
then it's not really a big deal.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.580
Just to say a little bit more
about that geometric thing.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:51.320
Let's define what is sometimes called
the first success distribution.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.450
Let's let X.

00:26:57.898 --> 00:27:02.491
X be FS of p, that's first success of p,

00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:06.824
that is the time until first success.

00:27:06.824 --> 00:27:08.978
So we are going to have
these Bernoulli trials.

00:27:11.785 --> 00:27:14.570
And this one is counting the success.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.760
Just because I have noticed that sometimes
student get confused about how to convert

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.540
back and forth and it should be very easy.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.920
So once you've thought it a little bit
hopefully it will be easy to do that.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.890
So this is, so if we just write geometric
we're not counting the success.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.660
If we write FS of p then
we're counting the success.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.660
S for success.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.040
Okay?

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.150
Well, if we wanted to
deal with this problem

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.230
we don't need to go through
a new theory and everything.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.540
All we have to do is say, well let's just
let, if we want to deal with such an X,

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:54.270
all we would do is just
let Y equal X minus 1.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.330
Then, by our definition, Y is geometric p

00:27:59.785 --> 00:28:02.520
I subtracted 1,
just cuz I don't wanna count the success.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.020
That's all.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.290
And so then it's easy to relate
the two PMFs because if we wanna know

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.460
the probability that X equals something,
just rewrite that in terms of Y.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.220
That's very easy.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:21.280
And if we want the expected value of X,
the expected value of X.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.668
Well, X is Y plus 1.

00:28:22.668 --> 00:28:24.498
So it's just E of Y plus 1.

00:28:24.498 --> 00:28:28.450
And by the way,
it's fairly common to omit,

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:32.400
I'll write the parentheses for now, but
it's fairly common in the literature to

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.090
omit the parentheses with expected
value when there's not ambiguity.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.130
Expected value of Y is q over p.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.110
So this is q over p plus 1.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:49.335
Which we can simplify by getting
a common denominator, p plus q is 1.

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:54.738
So that's just 1 over P.

00:28:54.738 --> 00:28:56.435
So that's a pretty nice result too.

00:28:56.435 --> 00:29:01.885
A very simple looking formula for the
expected value of the first success time

00:29:01.885 --> 00:29:05.815
and 1 over P, this is pretty
intuitive when you think about it.

00:29:05.815 --> 00:29:07.465
Let's see what that says.

00:29:07.465 --> 00:29:10.820
Suppose that our probability
of success is 1 in 10.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:15.770
Then it says, on average, it would take
ten trials to get the first success,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.670
if you include that success.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.170
So that kinda makes sense,
if you succeed one in ten times,

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.060
it means it's gonna take about ten trials.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.000
So that's all it's saying.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.650
Okay so that's just how you
convert between those things.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.220
Okay so that's the negative
binomial distribution, and

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.450
then that only leaves you one more famous
discrete distribution that we'll need and

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.890
we'll save that for next time.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.151
First I wanted to do a couple
more examples with expectation.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.240
So here's another problem I really like.

00:29:50.961 --> 00:29:55.610
That is, this is a problem that came
from Putnam exam a few years ago.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.810
So for
those of you who don't know the Putnam is

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:04.150
one of the hardest math
competitions in the country.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:13.790
It's extremely difficult math exam,
and it's offered every year.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:18.630
Most year, the medium score on the Putnam
is a zero because most people who

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:22.500
take it can't solve any of the questions,
so they get zeros.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.450
So it's a very hard, hard exam, and

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.550
here is a problem that came
straight off the Putnam.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.830
I like this problem because it
illustrates what we're doing,

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:36.690
and we can solve this problem very
easily with what we're doing.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.280
Okay, so here's the problem.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.180
The problem says you
have a random permutation

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.290
of the numbers integers from 1 to n.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:56.290
So, in general they don't have
a lot of probability on the Putnam,

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.570
but they do occasionally have probability.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.990
Especially when it's actually counting.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.240
That is, you could use the naive
definition of probability.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.910
Although, that would actually
not be a good idea here.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.030
So by random they mean that all
permutations are equally likely.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.940
So we take the numbers 1 through n and
permute them in any order.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.720
All n factorial equally likely.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.948
And let's assume n is at least two,

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:28.941
to avoid some stupid cases.

00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:31.070
Now, I have to tell you
what the question is.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:36.500
The question is find the average, or
expected number, of local maxima.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.349
So I have to tell you
what a local maximum is.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.090
Expected number, so
this is all defined on the problem.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.670
And this is exactly what the problem was,
I'm just phrasing it in my own words, but

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.380
this is exactly the problem.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.490
Find the expected number of local maxima.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:56.860
And it's easiest to explain what local
maxima is just by making up an example.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.320
So I'll just permute some numbers,
let's say we had.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:10.320
3214756.

00:32:12.504 --> 00:32:17.670
So, that's a permutation of 1 through 7.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:23.313
Local maxima is any number that's
bigger than its neighbors.

00:32:23.313 --> 00:32:26.510
So 7,
I'm going to circle the local maxima.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.340
7 is bigger than 4 and 5.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:37.195
Now, the 3 only has one neighbor,
the 2, cuz that's at the endpoint.

00:32:37.195 --> 00:32:39.905
But 3 is bigger than 2,
so that still counts.

00:32:39.905 --> 00:32:41.645
So there's two different types.

00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:45.241
Either you can have one that's in
the middle somewhere and then it has to be

00:32:45.241 --> 00:32:49.360
bigger than both its neighbors, or you can
have one at the end, 6 is bigger than 5.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.138
So in this example,
you can make up whatever example you want.

00:32:52.138 --> 00:32:56.730
In this example, it happened that
both endpoints are local maxima.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:00.250
And one point in the middle
was a local maxima.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.580
And none of these are local maxima.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.760
Does everyone understand the problem now?

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.230
So you want to know on average this is
one of 7 profactorial things I could have

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.490
written down and on along average
how many local maxima are there.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.560
So, actually,
not only was that a Putnam problem, but

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.190
I was kind of like looking
around on some Putnam

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.940
forums a couple years ago when people
were discussing that year's Putnam.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.460
A lot of people who took the exams
thought these were the hardest questions

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.498
on that year's exam.

00:33:28.498 --> 00:33:35.220
So, now, let's solve the problem.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:42.003
So first of all we need some
indicator random variables,

00:33:42.003 --> 00:33:48.221
so let's let Ij be the indicator
random variable for

00:33:48.221 --> 00:33:52.340
a position j being a local maxima.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.260
So, of position j,
this is position one, two, three and so

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.447
on position j either it does,
right that's an event, either it does or

00:34:02.447 --> 00:34:05.530
it does not have a local
maxima at that position.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.160
So that's what we are looking at.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.689
Position j having a local max,

00:34:09.689 --> 00:34:14.562
so that's a natural indicator
random variable to look at.

00:34:14.562 --> 00:34:17.210
And of course Ij goes from 1 to n.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.290
Now the sum of these

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.940
Ij is the number of local maxima.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.740
That's what we're trying to count.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:36.420
So what we're interested in
is the expected value of I1

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.452
plus blah blah blah plus In and

00:34:40.452 --> 00:34:44.930
by linearity,

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:50.222
that's just E of I1 plus
E of I2 plus E of In.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.270
Now the only thing or

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:58.230
the main thing we have to be careful about
here is to split into two different cases.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:03.180
One is that because we have these
endpoints and we have these non-endpoints.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:09.920
So we do have symmetry,
in the sense that what was the probability

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.500
that this number here, which happens to be
a 7, is bigger than both its neighbors?

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.020
Well, if you look at these
three positions here, the 4,

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.430
the 7 and the 5 by symmetry,

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:27.030
they're equally, likely to be in
any of the six possible orders.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:34.380
And at those six orders there's two ways
that the biggest could be in the middle.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.100
So it could have been 475 or 574.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.020
Two over six is one-third.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.430
Or an even better way
to think of it is that

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:44.850
we're looking at these
three positions here.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.770
The largest number among those three is

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.280
equally likely to be in any
of those three positions.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.050
The 7 was equally likely to have
been there, there, or there.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.900
So there's a one third chance that
the biggest number is in the middle.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.310
A common mistake with this would
be to say it's one-fourth.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.120
Because there's a 50-50 chance that
this number is bigger than this number.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.180
And there's a 50% chance that this
number is bigger than this number.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.850
And so
a lot of people would say one-fourth here.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.200
That's the same mistake as,
you remember the problem about,

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.450
what's the probability that A is older
than B, given that A is older than C?

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:28.060
Similar type of problem,
this being bigger than this is

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.600
not independent of this
being bigger than this.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.300
And well we just show that they're not,
if they were independent,

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.100
it would be one-fourth.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.730
But I just argued in two different
ways that it's one-third.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:43.090
So with two correct arguments, I got
one-third and with one incorrect argument,

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:43.892
I got one-fourth.

00:36:43.892 --> 00:36:47.037
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go with the one-third.

00:36:47.037 --> 00:36:50.257
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Now we can use symmetry, as long as

00:36:50.257 --> 00:36:54.670
we're careful to distinguish between the
intermediate points, and the endpoints.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:37:02.101
There are n-2 intermediate points,
each of them is one-third probability.

00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:05.060
That is the expected value of,
remember the fundamental bridge?

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.210
The expected value of an indicator
is the probability of the event.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.480
The probability of
the event is one third for

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.930
each of these intermediate coordinates.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.760
Lastly we just have to look at these two
end points, so there's two of them and

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.110
for those it's just one-half because it
was equally likely that this number is

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:26.620
bigger than this number, versus this
number being bigger than this number.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.660
So for the end point, it's one-half
because there's only one neighbor.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.745
So those are both one-half.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:39.090
So it's just n minus 2 over 3 plus 1,
which we could simplify a little bit.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.082
n plus 1 over 3

00:37:48.812 --> 00:37:51.910
So it's basically again a one line thing.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.030
Once you set up the indicators and
you understand your linearity and

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.590
your symmetry.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:02.580
Let's just check does this make sense
in extreme cases, well if n equals

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.110
1 that's a really stupid problem you just
have one number and it's a local maximum.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.920
So that's why I assume n is at least 2.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.300
Now let's just quickly check
what happens if n is 2,

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.960
then we either have 1 2, or 2 1.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:20.690
And either way that's one maximum and
this says it's equal to 1.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:26.051
So that worked and let's see.

00:38:26.051 --> 00:38:30.700
This grows linearly and
it goes to infinity as n goes to infinity.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.640
I guess that would be a little bit
weird if they expect a number of max.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.400
So I did not go to infinity
as goes to infinity.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.980
So we do a couple of quick
little checks like that.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.300
But anyway, that's the argument.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.040
So it's those same tools we
were talking about last time.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.130
Just use those in combinations,
indicators, linearities,

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.180
symmetry, and
you can solve some really hard problems.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.740
All right, so

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.420
let's do one more famous example that
does not involve indicator random

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.360
variables cuz I don't want you to think
that's everything there is to expectation.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:08.980
So this one is called, sorry.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.964
This is called the St. Petersburg Paradox.

00:39:15.347 --> 00:39:17.935
And we can debate whether
it's really a paradox or not.

00:39:17.935 --> 00:39:21.915
Well, it's not a paradox,
as I've said before.

00:39:21.915 --> 00:39:26.585
There's not any true paradoxes, but
that's what it's traditionally called.

00:39:26.585 --> 00:39:31.835
And it is something that makes you think,
which is why we're doing it.

00:39:31.835 --> 00:39:33.175
This is about thinking.

00:39:33.175 --> 00:39:34.135
So here's the problem.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.400
So someone offers you the following game.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.440
They're going to flip a fair coin over and

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.480
over again until the coin lands heads for
the first time.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.700
Now if the coin lands heads on
the first trial, you'll get $2,

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:59.790
if it's the second trial for the first
outcome of heads If it's the second

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:03.180
trial you got four dollars, if it's
the third trial you got eight dollars, and

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.910
the fourth trial you got 16 dollars and
it doubles every time, okay?

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:12.022
So you get, let's say

00:40:12.022 --> 00:40:17.134
a two to the x dollars,

00:40:17.134 --> 00:40:21.708
where x is the number

00:40:21.708 --> 00:40:26.560
of flips of the coin.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:38.080
Until it land heads
first H including the H.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:43.290
So that's what we call
the first success distribution.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:47.690
So it's a geometric distribution plus
one cuz we're counting that success,

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.180
including the success.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.050
And the question, so
obviously if you're playing this game,

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:58.390
you're hoping that the coin will
land tails for a long time.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.010
Cuz this keeps doubling every time,
and the longer it goes on,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.300
the better it double.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:07.010
It grows exponentially fast,
like If x is 10 then you'll get $1,024 and

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.710
so on, it keeps doubling.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:16.060
So the question is how much should you
be willing to pay to play this game?

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:23.050
Now some people have moral or
other objections to gambling or

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:28.700
are very risk averse or whatever and some
people are gambling addicts and so on.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.650
But let's define fair,

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.630
a standard definition of a fair game would
be well what value, you know you should

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:40.360
obviously pay something to play this game
because your going to get some money out.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.210
What value would make peace?

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.640
What price would make
the expected value zero,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.950
okay, that would often be
called the fair price.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:48.620
Although whether you
actually want to pay that or

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.290
not depends on your own
gambling preferences.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:53.690
Okay, so that's the problem.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.205
So it's a It's a very simple
sounding problem, right?

00:41:57.205 --> 00:42:03.785
It's just here's the payoff, two to the X,
and then how much should you pay to play.

00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:06.685
So, I'm curious what your
intuitions are on this problem,

00:42:06.685 --> 00:42:09.705
especially if you haven't
seen this problem before.

00:42:09.705 --> 00:42:11.580
But, even if you have, so

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:17.330
let's suppose now I don't want any of you
to gamble away everything a go bankrupt,

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:21.550
right, so let's assume that everyone
in this room is a billionaire, so

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:27.560
you can afford to pay a lot
if you want to play, okay.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.589
So let's assume that everyone
has a billion dollars.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:37.800
And we could do a little bit auction and
see who'd pay the most here.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.950
So is anyone willing to pay more than
$1 million to play this game once?

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.545
Okay, two of you, okay.

00:42:43.545 --> 00:42:46.473
$10 million?

00:42:48.595 --> 00:42:49.522
$100 million?

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.690
You guys really wanna play this game?

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:55.570
You have a lot of faith in me, right?

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.540
Yeah because I might just walk
away with your 100 million right?

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.380
So that's one assumption we need
is that the person offering this

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:10.490
game is 100% reliable and it's not like
if by chance X was some large number,

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:16.080
then that guy is gonna flee the country
rather than pay you, But okay,

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.010
let's assume we can completely rely- okay
so you'll pay a hundred million dollars.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:21.970
Now probably most people
in this room would not pay,

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.750
assuming you have a billion,
most of you would not pay,

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:28.430
I only saw a few hands,
would not pay a hundred million.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.050
How many of you would pay more than
a thousand dollars to play this game once?

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.310
Assuming you had a billion so it's not
like a thousand is not that big deal.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.614
But on the other hand, you know,

00:43:39.614 --> 00:43:42.030
even if you have a billion you
wanna make more money right so.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:48.580
All right not too many of you
have above more than $100.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.010
Okay, all right, more than $20?

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.120
Okay, so that's interesting.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.420
So there is no right or
wrong answer, necessarily.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.970
Now let's do the calculation.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.000
What is this?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:01.990
The expected value.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:06.730
So let's let y equal two to the x.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:08.480
That's your payoff.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.917
And we want to find
the expected value of y.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.450
Well, that's just pretty
easy by the definition.

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:21.170
Expected value of y all we have
to do is sum up the value times

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:23.220
the probability of that value.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.520
Now in this case y is
always a power of two.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.150
All right so
we're gonna sum overall powers of two.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:32.363
So, we're gonna sum K equals to infinity.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.740
The value it could take is
two to the k for sum k.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.610
Now the probability of that happening,
this event,

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:52.570
is when the coin lands tails
k- 1 times and then heads.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.310
That has probability,
we're assuming it's a fair coin.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:56.680
So that's probably one over two to the k.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.950
Because that's one specific event.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:03.390
So what we're really doing is
summing up one from one to infinity.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.243
What does it mean to sum up one?

00:45:09.243 --> 00:45:14.367
That means that we're adding
up 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 forever.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:18.170
So that's infinity.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.550
So according to that calculation
you should be willing to pay

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:27.120
an infinite amount of
money to play this game.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.760
And yet most of you did not
want to pay more than $100.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.270
So there's something there
that needs to be sorted out.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.840
So okay, so what can we say about that?

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:47.830
Well, It's kind of hard to argue
with this calculation, right?

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:53.630
I mean, this is not some tricky sum where
I'm likely to get messed up somehow.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:57.870
This 1 + 1 + 1 forever = infinity.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.520
It's pretty indisputable.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.040
So what's going on?

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.000
Well if you look this up online I mean
you can find hundreds of pages of

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.280
debate about this but
I think the simplest explanation is just

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:17.360
in the real world no one has
an infinite amount of money.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.560
That there is some bound, okay?

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.650
Now let's consider the same problem
where we impose some upper bound.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:28.380
So suppose that you're never gonna get
more than a trillion dollars from this.

00:46:29.475 --> 00:46:31.565
Okay, and then let's see what happens.

00:46:32.645 --> 00:46:35.696
So if we bounded at one trillion.

00:46:39.745 --> 00:46:44.145
And just to make the math easier,
two to the tenth is 1,024,

00:46:44.145 --> 00:46:48.330
so that's a little bigger than 1,000.

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:54.000
A trillion is ten to the 12
which is 10 cubed to the fourth.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.980
So if we take two two the 40th
that will be over a trillion.

00:47:01.825 --> 00:47:04.115
We may as well just use a power of two.

00:47:04.115 --> 00:47:09.245
So then let's assume, what happens
if the game lasts longer than this?

00:47:10.455 --> 00:47:14.445
Either there's two possibilities
that we can consider.

00:47:14.445 --> 00:47:18.115
One would be that the guy
offering this game just say,

00:47:18.115 --> 00:47:20.515
sorry I only have two
to the 40 of dollars.

00:47:20.515 --> 00:47:21.845
I mean, that is more than a trillion.

00:47:21.845 --> 00:47:22.560
So.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.590
You know, you should be happy
with your trillion dollars.

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.520
You shouldn't complain too much, right?

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.810
You've got the trillion.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.070
The other possibility you might consider
is if it goes beyond this point,

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:35.330
then he flees the country and
you've got nothing.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:35.830
Okay?

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.619
So let's just consider
either of those two options.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:48.690
Suppose that we balance at two to
the 40th then what we would get, the same

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:54.350
looking sum but let's suppose first
that he flees the country in that case.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.810
Same sum except now I'm
just gonna go up to 40.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:00.270
Two to the k, one over two to the k.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.170
Well I'm adding 1+1+1 40 1s that's 40.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:12.090
So that's the big difference there
$40 instead od infinity dollars.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:18.130
Just by even imposing a band of a trillion
dollars it sounds like that's a It's

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:23.180
unbelievably unlikely that the game
would last to that point anyway right.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:28.360
And a trillion dollar is this astronomical
in saying the amount of money and

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.245
yet it still reduces it only $40.

00:48:31.245 --> 00:48:34.780
Which doesn't seem paradoxical at all.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:39.740
And if we consider the other, so here
basically I've just cut it off at 40 and

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.440
set all the other terms to zero.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.910
If instead we just stuck in a two to
the 40th for all the rest of the terms

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.170
those terms are just gonna add up to.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.770
Because the first term beyond this,

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:56.000
if we replaced it by two to
the 40th it would be one half.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.150
And the next one would be one quarter.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.760
And it would go like that.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.160
Those would add up to one.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.290
So that would add $1, so this is
the case where he flees the country.

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:06.170
If he doesn't flee the country and
pays off your trillion dollars,

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:10.060
then it's worth $41 instead of $40,
so you got an extra dollar there.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.560
Okay.
So, a very important cautionary example of

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.000
this is that the expected value of
two to the x, this is just going back

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.530
to the general case again, the expected
value of two to the x is infinity.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.920
A common mistake would be to just
kind of move the e around and

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.020
just stick the e up in the exponent.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.230
So if we look at two to the e of x,
remember I said that for

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:41.460
the first success,
the expected value is one over p which

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.560
in this case is two,
so this would be four.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.850
So if you just carelessly
put the e up there,

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:50.620
thought just move the e around,
the average of the power,

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.300
the power of the average or something
you will get $4 instead of infinity.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.850
So this is actually not equal.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.750
You can't just move the E
around blindly like that.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:05.580
What you can do is use linearity, okay?

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.110
I mean in general linearity is true.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.970
This is false so
you got to be careful of that.

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:09.700
All right.
