and air shipping is unsustainable then
 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.689
and air shipping is unsustainable then
it means that we've got a huge amount of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699
it means that we've got a huge amount of
 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.060
it means that we've got a huge amount of
work to do to make it sustainable and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
work to do to make it sustainable and
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.350

design has to play an extremely

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360
design has to play an extremely
 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.200
design has to play an extremely
important role in that and so that's why

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210
important role in that and so that's why
 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.690
important role in that and so that's why
I'm very optimistic that if designers

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700
I'm very optimistic that if designers
 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.279
I'm very optimistic that if designers
wanted there's more work than they will

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289
wanted there's more work than they will
 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.709
wanted there's more work than they will

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.590
 
probably the most important one is for

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600
probably the most important one is for
 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.620
probably the most important one is for
designers to be listened to as

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810
and the challenges involved with that
 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.640
and the challenges involved with that
means that designers need to understand

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650
means that designers need to understand
 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.650
means that designers need to understand
a lot more about the larger context of

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660
a lot more about the larger context of
 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.750
a lot more about the larger context of
the world that they're designing in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.150
 
I think there are a variety of

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160
I think there are a variety of
 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.540
I think there are a variety of
bottlenecks and of course one has to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550
bottlenecks and of course one has to
 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.370
bottlenecks and of course one has to
consider that pretty well all of our

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
consider that pretty well all of our
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.800

there are all very mature industry some

there are all very mature industry some

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.420
of them with well over a hundred years
of continuing continuity so there are

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430
of continuing continuity so there are
 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.130
of continuing continuity so there are
huge vested interests in the way we do

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140
huge vested interests in the way we do
 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.870
huge vested interests in the way we do
things now so it's very very difficult

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
things now so it's very very difficult
 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.930
things now so it's very very difficult
to get people to change a habit that

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940
to get people to change a habit that
 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.820
to get people to change a habit that
they're used to and they've got business

up so that's one bottle neck and of

up so that's one bottle neck and of

course in the political spectrum there

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
course in the political spectrum there
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.390
course in the political spectrum there
are lots of interests lots of special

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400
are lots of interests lots of special
 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.130

too quickly so i don't think that i

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090
too quickly so i don't think that i
 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.760
too quickly so i don't think that i
don't think the bottlenecks are actually

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770
don't think the bottlenecks are actually
 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.949
don't think the bottlenecks are actually
in technology there we know that there's

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
in technology there we know that there's
 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.800
in technology there we know that there's
quite a lot of interesting technology

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810
quite a lot of interesting technology
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.990

well designers do have a huge

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020
well designers do have a huge
 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.130
well designers do have a huge
opportunity to Stewart these changes

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
opportunity to Stewart these changes
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.250
opportunity to Stewart these changes
through the processes and to do that as

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
through the processes and to do that as
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.160
through the processes and to do that as
I said earlier the designers need to see

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170
I said earlier the designers need to see
 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.290
I said earlier the designers need to see
their role as being much larger than

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300
their role as being much larger than
 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.480
their role as being much larger than
just concentrating on products and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490
just concentrating on products and
 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.550
just concentrating on products and
services to design they really need to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560
services to design they really need to
 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.960
services to design they really need to
look at the complete system of

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970
look at the complete system of
 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.120
look at the complete system of
transportation and they need to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130
transportation and they need to
 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.220
transportation and they need to
understand the contexts in which these

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
understand the contexts in which these
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.260
understand the contexts in which these
transportation systems are going to be

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270
transportation systems are going to be
