My name is George Gachara. I am a Global Change
maker from Kenya. I actually believe that

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.570
the World Cup will really mean a lot to Kenya,
I mean to Africa and specifically South Africa

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.779
in two ways, two fundamental ways. One is
the economy, the other one is cultural exchange.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.830
The economy of Africa should be more or less
improved by consumption because we have a

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.809
lot of people coming into Africa, into South
Africa and into the neighboring countries

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.719
around South Africa for accommodation, for
food, for travel, for tour, around the time

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:48.949
of World Cup. And also cultural exchange that
Africa should not be seen as jungle with lions

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.260
all over but with people and cultures that
are progressive with their infrastructure

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.570
and the opportunities that exist in Africa.
So I think the World Cup is pretty a good

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.270
thing and also it should elevate our soccer
and our standards also of infrastructure of

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.700
communication and security must also increase
the same. So that's my opinion. Thank you.
