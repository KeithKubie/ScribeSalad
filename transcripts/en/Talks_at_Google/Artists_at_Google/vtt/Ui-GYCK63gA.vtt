[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.970
MIKE ABRAMS: Please
welcome to the stage

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.880
the stars of the show, Nick
Frost, Lena Headey, Florence

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.355
Pugh, Jack Lowden, and
WWE Superstar Paige.

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:13.117
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:14.460
FLORENCE PUGH: We came
in out of order, sorry.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.990
MIKE ABRAMS: That's fine.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.840
That's fine.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.780
Come on down.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.290
NICK FROST: Hello.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.015
Hello, everyone.

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:23.806
JACK LOWDEN: Hello.

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:26.354
MIKE ABRAMS: Well, thank
you all for being here.

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:28.770
Let's start with, can you mind
doing a brief introduction,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.892
who you are, who you play, where
everyone recognizes you from?

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:33.600
NICK FROST: Hello, my
name is Nick Frost,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.472
and I play Ricky Knight.

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:36.570
LENA HEADEY: Are you done?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.750
NICK FROST: Yeah.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.583
If you don't know where
I'm from, Google me.

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:40.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.170
Because, yeah.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.140
PAIGE: My name is Paige, and
this movie is about my life,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.130
and don't Google me.

00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:51.730
It's so funny.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.230
Your turn.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.890
FLORENCE PUGH: I'm Florence
Pugh, and I play her in life

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.819
all the time.

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:58.860
LENA HEADEY: Lena Headey.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.780
I play Paige's mom.

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:05.850
JACK LOWDEN: And I'm Jack, and
I play Zak, the brother who's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.848
also over there ominously lit.

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:13.150
LENA HEADEY: Oh,
that's terrifying.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.604
JACK LOWDEN: Genuinely is.

00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:16.770
MIKE ABRAMS: So Paige, let's
kick this off with you.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.742
For many of you that--

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:21.140
PAIGE: Come on, granddad.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.200
Your turn.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.220
MIKE ABRAMS: For many
of you that don't know,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.930
there was actually
a TV documentary

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.180
that was made about your
family that, kind of, started

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.470
a little bit of this picture.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.540
What's it like at this
stage in your career,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.900
very early on, young, to have
a TV documentary and a biopic

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.434
about with The Rock?

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:37.350
PAIGE: Well, when it
comes to the documentary,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.430
I was very used to being
in front of the camera,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.140
because, you know,
my mom and dad

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.230
loved to do a documentary
or two growing up.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.857
So me and Zak were kind of
used to that kind of stuff.

00:01:44.857 --> 00:01:46.440
We didn't realize
that the documentary

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.700
was going to be so successful.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.420
So it won awards, and we
were really happy about it.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.280
But again, you don't
think anything of it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.120
after that until Dwayne
approached me one day

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.230
and said, hey, we're going
to make a movie on you.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.170
And that's, like,
so bizarre to me.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.920
It's very surreal.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.080
So, yeah, and it's very strange
to see a girl playing you too.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.240
And she just did
such a fantastic job.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.850
She made me look so much
better than I actually am.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.302
And I'm just really
thankful for the cast too.

00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:16.260
They're absolutely
incredible, apart from Nick.

00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:22.380
NICK FROST: She's kidding.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.554
She's kidding.

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:27.510
MIKE ABRAMS: You didn't
get to meet Paige

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.650
until after the shooting.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.540
So what was it like being
able to pick someone who's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.030
real, who's alive, who's
still very much in, kind

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.324
of, the early stage
of the career,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.990
to build your own
character that was you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.642
and not necessarily just
an impersonation of Paige?

00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:44.350
FLORENCE PUGH: So many
questions in that.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.040
Yeah, I didn't meet her.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.960
Sorry, I have a slight cough.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.370
I didn't meet her until about
three weeks ago, which I think,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.209
now looking back
on it, I'm quite

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.750
glad I didn't, because I think
I would have been studying you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.820
probably a bit creepily.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.880
But at the time,
Paige was injured,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.582
and she had her neck injury
and couldn't fly over,

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:06.540
and we started filming.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380
So we were just in
contact all the time.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.350
Very odd playing
someone that's not

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.496
only alive but only a couple
of years older than you.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.370
And this only happened
a couple of years ago.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.780
So she doesn't need
her memory refreshing.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.790
She knows about it all.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.940
So I suppose you just have
to take the opportunity

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.950
and hope that you're not going
to offend or, most of the time,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.840
you hope that you're going
to do the story justice.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.530
And also, I suppose,
make sure that I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.920
find some peace
in that storyline

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.880
that I need to tell as well.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.730
So you have to make some
sort of amalgamation and then

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.250
just fingers crossed,
because she can wrestle,

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.952
so you hope she doesn't
find it offensive.

00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:52.180
PAIGE: That's a true story.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.460
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.150
MIKE ABRAMS: And along
those same lines,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.940
you were able to
watch a lot of YouTube

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.820
and film because of so much of
her being on stage and on TV.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.414
How much did you prep
and watch for that?

00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:04.830
FLORENCE PUGH: I mean, that's
the best thing about playing

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.329
a famous wrestler is that every
single fight she's ever done

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.100
is on there.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.510
And even the documentary
was just so helpful to use,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.940
because you can see what she
was like when she was younger

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.510
and around her family
and how they spoke.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.519
And actually, getting
the accent down,

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.904
that was really handy to
watch the documentary.

00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:24.570
MIKE ABRAMS: Jack,
you play the brother.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.300
Kind of a very, very
big part of this,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.800
take a lot of the emotional
toll through this.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.360
I'm curious about with you doing
a big core of the wrestling,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.000
how much training went
into, how much of the stunts

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.019
did you do to prepare
for such a physical role?

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:41.060
JACK LOWDEN: Quite a lot.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.360
I was-- Zak is a big lad,
as we call them back home.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.080
He's a unit.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.290
Like, he's-- there's
just a lot of Zak.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.670
And I really wasn't.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.880
I was sort of wafer thin,
and kind of pathetic looking,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.195
and told that very quickly by
our director that I needed to,

00:05:01.195 --> 00:05:03.570
sort of-- there was a lot of
work to do to kind of do him

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.480
justice.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.100
And so then they also gave
me six weeks to do that.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.960
And so I had to eat like
four or five meals a day.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.730
I was given a trainer, CrossFit
training, which is mental,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.940
and I did that twice a day.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.130
So did Flow.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.590
So I'd get--

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.430
I remember the first
day I did it, actually.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.930
I mean, I barely did anything
in the grand scheme of things,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.480
but went home, and I fell
asleep at 3:00 in the afternoon.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.090
And I was only 26 at the time,
so that's quite embarrassing.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.820
But I did.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.660
I ended up putting on
two, roughly two stone.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.050
So I went from 79
kg to about 90 kg.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.230
But that still wasn't even
anywhere near the size

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.040
that Zak was.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.290
He's just huge.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.200
But and then we
were lucky enough

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.280
to go over to the NXT in Florida
for a week, a week and a half,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.690
and do some training with
some guys that were like--

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.877
they were all like 60, 75
years old, and sort of all

00:06:03.877 --> 00:06:05.960
walked around with their
hands behind their backs.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.751
And it was all disapproving
looks, and sort

00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:09.850
of very little information.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.150
And it was wonderful though.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.750
And it was just
hilarious that you

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.500
had all these professional
wrestlers going

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.480
through all their
moves so beautifully,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.100
and then me and
Florence Pugh just,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.100
sort of, huffing and puffing.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.700
But in a good way, I think.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.190
But it was very, very
difficult, but very enjoyable

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.500
to try and get near
the size of Zak.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.800
And it does-- even just
athletically, obviously,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.940
it helps.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.560
But I loved the way it felt
to, sort of, carry yourself

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.880
being bigger than that.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.280
I've always dreamed of being
anywhere near that size.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.707
And it was, yeah,
my favorite thing,

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:47.540
one of my favorite
things about playing him.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.970
But the emotional
storyline of it.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.130
This is-- I'm realizing,
as I'm speaking this,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.005
this is the first time
I've spoken about this

00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:55.160
in front of the real Zak.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.460
So it's a little bit weird.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.780
But his story is
actually remarkable.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.530
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.160
Let's get into that.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.743
I mean, that's a big
part of the movie

00:07:05.743 --> 00:07:08.270
is the emotional storyline
of not being selected,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.580
and then a new baby,
a lot going on there.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.260
And you kind of carry the
emotional roller coaster

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.010
of the character
throughout the movie.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.790
How did you, I guess,
prepare for that

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.950
and cover that while also
doing all the physicality

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.585
of the wrestling aspect?

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:26.460
JACK LOWDEN: I think
it's a really cool thing

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.770
that it's been explored.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.510
And I think he's an
incredibly honest human being.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.560
And I think everybody's
probably dealt with,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.540
to some extent in their
life, a dream that they had

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.790
and it maybe not coming true.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.110
And I think in
the script, I hope

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.050
it's sort of true enough
to what actually happened.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.500
But you know, it hits that
quite hard in the film.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.990
And as an actor, you
know, I've obviously--

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.510
all of us have
experienced that, where

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.440
there's a brilliant scene
in it where he brings up

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.900
the guy who auditioned
him for the WWE,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.400
basically to say
give us another go.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.110
And I mean, I've
definitely thought

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.460
of doing that after auditions
that have gone horrendously.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.820
And so it was quite cool to do.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.060
It really was.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.310
It made it really interesting.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.470
PAIGE: I love that scene.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.310
LENA HEADEY: Me too.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.410
JACK LOWDEN: It's--

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.330
MIKE ABRAMS: A powerful scene.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.204
JACK LOWDEN: Well, I'm
glad it was, because--

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.140
I did it with a
guy who was lying

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.060
in the footwell of the car.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.720
He's-- in that scene, there's
this little Canadian bloke

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.140
lying there, like, squeezed
up like that with sides,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.270
with giving me utterly nothing.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.400
So I had to stick my finger
in my eye and do all the fake

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.222
crying I could.

00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:46.180
MIKE ABRAMS: And Zak was
on set with you a lot.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.510
So you got to kind
of work with him

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.830
and meet him throughout the--

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.775
JACK LOWDEN: Zak's in the film.

00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:50.608
MIKE ABRAMS: Mm hmm.

00:08:50.608 --> 00:08:53.700
JACK LOWDEN: So there is an even
weirder moment where Zak plays

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.050
the drug dealer in the film.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.560
And I pull up in a
van and look at him,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.930
and he says something to me.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.500
So that was utterly bizarre.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.460
Really, really weird.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.930
But he's a remarkable
human being.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.100
And I went up to Norwich.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.020
I was given a chance to
go up there and watch

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.560
him run the WEW, which
is their company.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.140
And for me, it's
better than the WWE.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.990
I'm a massive fan of
amateur and semi pro sport.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.510
I'm a big semi pro
football fan back--

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.360
soccer ball back in the UK.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.050
And people who have that
much passion and who do it

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.900
for a tenth of the money,
even no money, I think

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.050
is, in my opinion,
way more impressive.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.550
And I think what
he's done, and he's

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.060
such an enormous part
of his community,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.439
I really take my hat off to him.

00:09:42.439 --> 00:09:42.980
He's amazing.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.950
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah, and teaching
a blind wrestler is a big part

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.140
of that too in the movie.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.550
JACK LOWDEN: Yeah, and
that's a verbatim true story.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.290
He taught a blind
kid how to wrestle.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.020
You think you've done
something well in life,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.280
and then someone tells
you that a human being

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.530
taught a blind kid to wrestle.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.238
Like, you're really
not trying that hard.

00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:04.320
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.880
Nick, I want to touch on
the father figure, Ricky,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.650
who talks multiple times about
being a violent crime offender,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.240
of going to prison
for violent crimes.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.740
You've done a lot of comedy.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.009
How did you take
that character that

00:10:18.009 --> 00:10:19.550
has kind of a rough
around the edges,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.720
but also is the
cornerstone of family,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.969
and really doing what's best for
them, and bring your version?

00:10:24.969 --> 00:10:26.010
NICK FROST: I don't know.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.843
I mean, I think I'm
always keen to point out

00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:31.161
that comedy and drama are
not mutually exclusive.

00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:32.160
Do you know what I mean?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.191
There's comedy in
everything, even funerals.

00:10:36.191 --> 00:10:36.690
You know?

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.720
That's-- I don't think you
can just be funny and not feel

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.550
the other emotions
that a human may feel.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.240
I think Ricky was a dream for me
to play, really, because it's--

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.750
as an actor, it's everything
you really want to be.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.640
You want someone who's a
bit funny and is emotional

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.830
and is a lunatic.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.480
He was a treat.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.160
And I kind of--

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.586
I mean, me and Zak
and stuff today,

00:11:01.586 --> 00:11:03.210
and getting to know
Paige a little bit,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.880
and seeing the
documentary, I mean,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.040
they're a lot like
my own family.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.010
You know, my own brother
was a lot like Zak.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:16.530
He was a bit of a loony, but
with a good heart, good egg.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.200
And I think with
Ricky, I like the fact

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.442
that so often you see
a character who is bad

00:11:23.442 --> 00:11:25.900
or who has made a mistake, and
there's not much redemption,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.610
and I like the fact
that, yes, he did that,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.980
and he was those
things, but he's also

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.100
a passionate father
and husband, and I

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.740
guess dynamite in the sack.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.270
LENA HEADEY: Your mom's nodding.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.492
PAIGE: Mom, stop nodding.

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:42.700
FLORENCE PUGH: Mom's nodding.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:42.870
JACK LOWDEN: Who is that?

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.070
You're nodding as well.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.903
Why are you nodding?

00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:47.270
Why are you nodding?

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.980
NICK FROST: But he's a dream
to play for me personally,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.920
because especially with
Stephen, the director, you know,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.260
he was he was keen.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.270
I added a little something
in, and I didn't want

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.478
to do an impression of Ricky.

00:11:58.478 --> 00:12:02.160
I wanted to do a kind
of an impression of who

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.970
he was as a man.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:03.190
You know?

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.940
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.840
And so you bring up Stephen,
and a of the dialogue, I mean,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.760
it's very quick, very witty.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.810
How did you kind of embrace that
and bring that into the piece?

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.370
There was so much
back and forth.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.203
We saw a couple of the
jokes, the Vin Diesel

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:19.140
joke, and all these other pieces
in there that you throw in.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.390
NICK FROST: Yeah, I mean,
it's quite limp on the page,

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.819
and the actors really
bring it to life, I think.

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:25.360
I don't know.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.650
You know, Stephen wrote a
great script, and we had fun,

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.780
and we had the
time to muck about.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.230
And once you've honored
what has been written,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.050
there was always time
for something looser

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.580
or an improvisation, or if
one of us had a better idea,

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.020
we were allowed a voice.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.010
And that's always-- plus, I
think we all like each other,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.450
and the crew was great.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:48.570
LENA HEADEY: Sort of.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:48.630
Yeah.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.963
NICK FROST: And I think it--
some of us like each other,

00:12:50.963 --> 00:12:52.142
and the crew was great.

00:12:52.142 --> 00:12:53.850
And I think that, for
me personally, that

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.280
gives you an ease, and
the fact you trust people

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.860
enough to put a bit of yourself,
leave a bit of yourself

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:01.380
out there.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.100
You know?

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.240
I mean what bit is?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.210
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.860
NICK FROST: Sometimes
it was just liquid.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.520
But other times
spirit and heart, you

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.020
know, but a lot of liquid.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:19.650
PAIGE: Yeah, just to say that
Stephen really transport--

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.040
he took away from
the documentary

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.522
and put it onto
page really well.

00:13:23.522 --> 00:13:25.230
I think that was
something that stood out

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.230
to me was watching
the documentary

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.349
and falling in love with
that family was exactly

00:13:30.349 --> 00:13:32.390
the same as the way that
Stephen had put it down.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.830
And I think that's a
testament to say how good he

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.150
did with the script.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.140
MIKE ABRAMS: So Lena,
I wanted to ask you.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.890
You know, you talked
about bad characters.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.580
You're pretty famous for
playing a bad character on TV.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.240
What was it like, kind
of, taking the TV big hit

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.890
and playing into a
movie, and a mom,

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.060
and someone who's here and as a
character and kind of embracing

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.280
her role?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.884
LENA HEADEY: I, well, I'm
such a big fan of Julia.

00:13:58.884 --> 00:14:00.300
I think she's an
incredible woman.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.740
And I watched a lot.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.500
I watched the documentary,
and I watched interviews

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.080
that she did.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:12.000
And she's had a really
interesting, sometimes tricky

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.380
history.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.720
And so she's such a sort of
powerful, resilient person.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.430
And like Nick said,
it's like, you don't

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.300
want to do an impersonation.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.570
You want to do--

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.960
you want to portray
someone with respect

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.880
and bring in who
they are at the core.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.160
And all these characters are
such big, joyous honest people

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.012
that fuck up, and do really
well, and nothing's hidden.

00:14:39.012 --> 00:14:40.720
Like, everything's
just out on the table,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.460
which is why you can't not
fall in love with them.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.225
And I didn't want
Julia to beat me up.

00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:48.714
So that's a problem, right?

00:14:48.714 --> 00:14:50.130
MIKE ABRAMS: And
how much training

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.090
did you two go through?

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.298
I mean, you definitely have
scenes in the movie where

00:14:53.298 --> 00:14:56.670
you're in the ring, and did
you do a lot of training

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.290
for the wrestling part?

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.310
NICK FROST: We wrestled,
yeah, didn't we.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.980
LENA HEADEY: We wrestled.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.900
NICK FROST: [INAUDIBLE]
together, and--

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.880
LENA HEADEY: We tongue wrestled.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880
NICK FROST: It was good.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.760
I was always--

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.582
I like wrestling.

00:15:04.582 --> 00:15:06.540
I was a keen wrestler,
a keen amateur wrestler.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.550
I've wrestled men in pubs
and privately in my own home.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.745
And I'd always loved
wrestlers boots.

00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:16.620
I was always fascinated,
always was like, oh,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.070
my god, their boots are amazing.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.080
And then when we
started to do the film,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.750
they said, so we're going to
make you all handmade wrestling

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.000
boots.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.791
I was like, oh, my god,
this is incredible.

00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:27.150
But it's to kind of get
boots on and have a wrestle.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.300
And the ring was very hard,
and noisy, and squeaky,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.251
and it was great.

00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:31.750
Right?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.200
We had fun.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.108
FLORENCE PUGH: It was a lot of.

00:15:33.108 --> 00:15:33.931
NICK FROST: Anyone?

00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:34.680
LENA HEADEY: Yeah.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.380
No, I loved it.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:36.880
I loved it.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.420
I was saying earlier, I can
recognize everyone by smell.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.685
Truth.

00:15:43.685 --> 00:15:45.560
MIKE ABRAMS: So Paige,
when you saw the film,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.101
you know, you have
this amazing cast,

00:15:47.101 --> 00:15:50.280
how did you feel that
they depicted your family?

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.000
PAIGE: Oh, they killed it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.666
And I'm not just
saying that because I'm

00:15:53.666 --> 00:15:56.460
sitting on stage with them,
or it's about my story,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.270
but they really did kill
it, because 95% of the movie

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.260
was very true to story.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.900
And they didn't get to
spend any time with us,

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.211
like, at all, apart from Jack
a little bit with Zaky boy

00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:07.710
over there.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.337
But I just thought it was--

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:12.170
I cried my eyes out.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.520
Like, the first time I
watched it, like, I couldn't--

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.060
blobbering everywhere.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.260
I couldn't get through
the whole movie,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.218
because I was just crying,
because I was like--

00:16:18.218 --> 00:16:20.854
these guys are just, like--
it's so perfectly done,

00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:22.770
and Stephen did such a
good job on the script.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.280
Enough where-- so I don't know
if you guys have seen it or not

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.140
yet or you're about
to see it, but they

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.310
say some pretty crude stuff.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:29.810
Right?

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.800
Some crazy stuff that's
just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.900
But Stephen said,
like, all he had to do

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.200
is pretty much follow my
parents around with a notepad,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.759
and the script pretty
much wrote itself.

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.550
And people always think
that it's not real,

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.000
but that's literally
who they are.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.550
And these guys just
absolutely killed it.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.070
And the thing that broke my
heart the most was seeing--

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.580
Jack did such a good
job playing my brother.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.850
And the wonderful
part of Zak's story

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.440
is the fact that it
kind of shows you

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.660
that you don't have to be
successful in the way-- it

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.070
shouldn't be measured.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:00.570
Sorry.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.660
Your level of success shouldn't
be measured by how famous

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.024
you are, or how many people
you have on Instagram,

00:17:07.024 --> 00:17:08.940
or how many cameras are
in front or your face,

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.273
or how many people you are
doing interviews in front of.

00:17:11.273 --> 00:17:14.160
Success is reaching a goal
that you set for yourself.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.319
For example, Zak
wanted a family,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.430
and now he has two kids.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.980
And Zak wanted to train disabled
children how to wrestle,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.990
and now he has someone
with Down syndrome

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.980
who wants to learn
how to wrestle,

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.020
someone who is blind who
wants to learn how to wrestle.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.349
You know?

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.480
And also, you want to be
part of my dad's company,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.787
which you know, if
you guys want shares,

00:17:29.787 --> 00:17:31.120
my dad said they were available.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.650
NICK FROST: I've got
the paperwork in my bag.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.460
PAIGE: I feel like
Jack just portrayed

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.609
that in such a wonderful
way, and it just

00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:40.650
completely broke my heart,
especially that scene.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.900
It was absolutely incredible.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.494
I was like--

00:17:43.494 --> 00:17:45.410
I wanted to call Jack
like, I'm so sorry dude.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.560
But yeah, they just did
such an incredible job.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.089
And I'm sorry the answer was
really long, but I loved it.

00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:53.880
MIKE ABRAMS: Another
big theme of the movie

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.190
is, I think The
Rock says the line,

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.800
but don't try to be the
next me, be the first you.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.150
How did you embrace that?

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.970
I mean, when you came on
stage, being from Norwich,

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.662
and with all the models,
and the different pieces

00:18:06.662 --> 00:18:07.620
in the movie that you--

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:07.740
PAIGE: Yeah.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.880
It was a little bit different.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.380
Yeah.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.610
Well, when I first
came over here,

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.170
I didn't know
anything about makeup.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.252
I was wearing my
brothers hand-me-downs,

00:18:15.252 --> 00:18:16.710
and I didn't have
to brush my hair.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:17.490
Still don't.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.600
And it was just--
it was very strange.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.820
I was very insecure.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.860
Like, I was confident
enough to know,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.630
OK, I'm going to be
in the WWE, and I'm

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.880
going to fight until I make
it, but it's another story

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.838
once you come over here
to a different country.

00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:31.380
It was a big culture shock,
and it was just so different,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.244
because the women
were so beautiful.

00:18:33.244 --> 00:18:35.910
The kind of ones that you see in
slow motion with smoke machines

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.637
and doves flying behind them.

00:18:37.637 --> 00:18:39.720
And they're just like, ha,
and I'm just like damn.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.280
And then there's me
and my frumpy jackets

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.654
and baggy clothes, and like,
smelled probably really bad.

00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:46.020
You know, like, they're
just so beautiful.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.687
And so I was real insecure.

00:18:48.687 --> 00:18:50.770
But the one thing, even
though I was super lonely,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.020
I didn't have any friends
when I first came over here.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.530
Still don't.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.002
But-- fuck.

00:18:57.002 --> 00:19:00.660
But no, the one thing that
I did have was my family,

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.550
and they just made me feel
like I was very unique.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.110
In that case, I was there.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.360
And someone told me
before that being yourself

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.540
is your superpower.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.590
So I kind of took
that and was, like,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.490
I tried to be something
I wasn't, which

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.040
is when I lightened my hair,
and took my piercings out,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.840
and got tan, which
is so strange for me.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.645
But I kind of took that
after a couple of months

00:19:24.645 --> 00:19:26.770
of being there and crying
my eyes out and embracing

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.372
it and being like, you know
what, fuck you, this is me.

00:19:30.372 --> 00:19:31.330
That's just how it was.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:35.615
And then I kind of ran with
that, and now we're here.

00:19:35.615 --> 00:19:37.870
MIKE ABRAMS: So there's
a lot about perseverance,

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.570
wanting to quit.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.459
I think that's very relevant
too for the acting world, where

00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:43.750
it takes a lot to kind of
get to that level of success.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.300
How did that
storyline kind of play

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.530
to you as actors in your career?

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.770
Open ended for any of you.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.950
JACK LOWDEN: It obviously
plays a massive part.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.930
You know, you're not
saving lives doing this.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.570
You know, you have to enjoy it.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.030
In my opinion, you're
obliged to enjoy it.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.070
It's your responsibility
to enjoy it.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.896
And it's remarkable how often--

00:20:13.896 --> 00:20:15.770
I'm probably not speaking
for just me either.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.400
So it's remarkable how often
it's not enjoyable when--

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.980
because it's so about
you, this profession.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.270
It's so you.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.470
It's not, like, what you do.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.395
You can't do your work,
and then stand back

00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:26.770
and people can
look at your work.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.610
It's you.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.630
And I totally took that for
granted before I got into this.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.390
And sort of, it's gotten easier
and harder at the same time.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.160
And so it's exactly
what these guys do.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.240
You know, what they do is the
perfect combination of sport

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:43.870
and drama.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:44.760
It really is.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.140
It honestly is the
best night I've ever

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.790
had when I went up there.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.350
It's tremendous.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.020
And it's full blooded as well.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.660
You know a lot of
people in our profession

00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.370
get, like, a lot of credit for
being method, or going deep,

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.080
and all this, kind
of, stuff that they

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.510
like to say that makes them
sound a lot sexier than they

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.140
actually are.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.860
But like, if you want
to see going deep,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.030
go and watch the WEW.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.570
Like, their commitment
in front of an audience

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.950
is extraordinary.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.310
And also, to do what
they do, and not

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.021
in front of an audience
that's that much bigger

00:21:21.021 --> 00:21:22.270
than the audience we have now.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.594
Like, you know, the WWE,
with all due respect,

00:21:24.594 --> 00:21:26.010
they're in front
of 20,000 people.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.020
It's probably quite easy to
get jacked up and get into it.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.190
But to do it in front of not
a great deal amount of people

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.710
is even more impressive.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:39.550
And it's kind of like doing a
fringe show at the Edinburgh

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.070
Festival when you do
a play in like a cafe.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.180
Like, it's a lot, lot harder.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.670
So the respect level's
huge for what they do.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.020
MIKE ABRAMS: Anybody else have
any thoughts on that topic?

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.260
No.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.145
JACK LOWDEN: Yahoo.

00:21:54.145 --> 00:21:55.100
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.600
No.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.700
LENA HEADEY: I think
Jack covered it.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.580
MIKE ABRAMS: Jack covered it.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.080
Perfect.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.759
So what was it like
having "The Rock"

00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:05.300
Dwayne Johnson's
involvement in this.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.590
There's a lot of parallels to
his family and to your family.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.770
How much of that, having him
being a producer on this,

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.940
played into a little bit more
of the overall wrestling family

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.710
piece of this picture?

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.060
PAIGE: Is that an open question.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:20.600
MIKE ABRAMS:
Open-ended question.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.140
PAIGE: Oh.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.890
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.800
NICK FROST: Me?

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.680
Oh, I never met "The
Rock" until last week,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.910
so I was really nervous.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.326
I'd never-- I was a big fan,
and I was a fan of "The Rock"

00:22:31.326 --> 00:22:33.904
for years, and then I kept
talking to the producer,

00:22:33.904 --> 00:22:36.320
kind of saying, hey is "The
Rock" ever going to come down,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.160
or--

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.269
yeah, "The Rock"
didn't ask about--

00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:40.810
he's not ever seen
"Hot Fuzz" has he?

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.790
You know, just keep
dropping hints and stuff,

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.610
and he never got in touch.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.500
So then I saw him
last week at Sundance,

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.480
and I was fairly nervous.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.990
And I practiced three or
four different versions

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.580
of how I would meet him.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:00.050
And then in the end, when you're
faced with such a Colossus,

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:04.250
all that falls to the side, and
you're just left saying, hey.

00:23:06.824 --> 00:23:07.490
And that was it.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.820
That was kind of all I got out.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.240
But I don't know.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.010
I mean, he looks
good in the poster

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.100
that he wasn't there for.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.845
LENA HEADEY: Did you send him
your "Jumanji" audition tape?

00:23:23.845 --> 00:23:24.470
NICK FROST: No.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.860
I keep mentioning
"Jumanji 2" a lot,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.750
hoping there'll be some kind
of trickle-down casting.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.280
But I haven't heard.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.080
I haven't checked today, but I
haven't heard whether or not--

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.210
I mean, I think they're
starting to fill up

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.500
their roster of actors.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.499
I know Danny Glover
recently got cast, but--

00:23:42.499 --> 00:23:44.290
LENA HEADEY: I met him
at Sundance briefly,

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.147
and he didn't know who I
was when I was leaving the--

00:23:47.147 --> 00:23:47.730
and we did it.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.460
I went, hey, and he
went, hi, and I went--

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.532
that was my exchange.

00:23:54.532 --> 00:23:56.240
FLORENCE PUGH: In all
seriousness though,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.970
he did work.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.465
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
give them some good things now.

00:24:02.465 --> 00:24:03.880
JACK LOWDEN: Like he needs help.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.620
FLORENCE PUGH: He
needs a bit of help.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.060
Jack and I worked with him.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.950
Obviously, on our
first day of shoot,

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.655
he did scene where he
shouted at us for 40 minutes.

00:24:13.655 --> 00:24:15.477
LENA HEADEY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:15.477 --> 00:24:16.310
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.910
It was fun.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.200
He's really big.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.250
He eats a lot.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.160
And I keep on saying that he
looks really smooth, because he

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.130
does look really smooth.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.370
But no, we had a great time,
and we were both just so amazed

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.700
by how--

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.210
he basically went
away and wrote that,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.142
and then we exchanged
lines to figure out

00:24:34.142 --> 00:24:35.600
what we were going
to say, and then

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.516
he walked away and came
back 20 minutes later,

00:24:37.516 --> 00:24:39.410
and he knew this
huge monologue promo,

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.480
and he just basically
barked at us.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.830
It was amazing.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.650
And then also,
towards the end, I

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.880
did at Paige's fight
in the Staples Center

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.304
after Monday Night Raw,
and he was very much

00:24:53.304 --> 00:24:54.470
involved with the wrestling.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.830
So that was really
lovely of him.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.422
And yeah, those were the
times that we worked together.

00:25:00.422 --> 00:25:02.880
MIKE ABRAMS: So I do want to
open up to audience questions.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.900
So if people want to line up,
we have two mics on both sides.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.930
While people are lining up, I
have a fun question for you,

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.530
and I'm--

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.950
if you were-- this
is more for the cast,

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.410
since Paige's has
already been picked.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.980
If you were a WWE wrestler,
what would your stage name be,

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.460
and what would your
finishing move be?

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.036
FLORENCE PUGH: Lena
has a really good one.

00:25:26.036 --> 00:25:27.900
It's called choo-choo.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.692
LENA HEADEY: Yeah.

00:25:28.692 --> 00:25:30.400
FLORENCE PUGH: She
comes on choo-chooing.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.293
LENA HEADEY: It's
like a locomotive.

00:25:31.293 --> 00:25:32.668
FLORENCE PUGH: As
she choo-choos.

00:25:32.668 --> 00:25:34.940
LENA HEADEY: And
my fuel is farts.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.479
And I just release
one long deadly one.

00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:40.520
FLORENCE PUGH: Choo-choo.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.962
LENA HEADEY: Choo-choo, and
just everyone [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:42.962 --> 00:25:44.170
I don't have to touch anyone.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:44.990
FLORENCE PUGH: No,
she's going to eat--

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.886
NICK FROST: Has that ever
been done in the WWE?

00:25:45.886 --> 00:25:46.600
LENA HEADEY: No.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.690
PAIGE: Oh, actually
Natty, which is--

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.230
she's a Hart, one part
of The Hart Foundation.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.570
She had to fart on screen a
lot and not notice the fact

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.270
that she was farting.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.540
But Vince thought
it was hilarious,

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.990
so she had to do it for months.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.750
So she's standing in
front of people just like,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.969
[FARTING NOISE],, and that
was all she had to do.

00:26:03.969 --> 00:26:04.760
FLORENCE PUGH: Wow.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.802
PAIGE: For, like, months,
she got paid to fart.

00:26:06.802 --> 00:26:09.010
NICK FROST: But did they
have a thing in her trousers

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.840
where smoke would come out?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.720
Because that's how
choo-choo would end.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.850
PAIGE: No, WWE's
not that dramatic.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:13.750
LENA HEADEY: She's
got green gas.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.030
Yeah.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.560
FLORENCE PUGH: Imagine calling
your dad and being like,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.370
dad, dad, I did it.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.906
Yeah, I'm playing the farter.

00:26:17.906 --> 00:26:19.780
PAIGE: Thank god they're
not making me queef.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.676
I knew mom would like that one.

00:26:27.676 --> 00:26:29.675
MIKE ABRAMS: Anybody else
have a wrestling name?

00:26:29.675 --> 00:26:30.610
No?

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.450
JACK LOWDEN: I would
be called rump steak.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.910
And he wouldn't be so
much of a wrestler.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.090
I thought he would
just be around the ring

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.900
dressed in like dressing gown.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.380
It comes from my prison name.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.360
If I went to prison, I was told
that I would be kind of known

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.400
as, sort of, rump steak,
and sort of passed around

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.740
in a sort of chewy kind of way.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.709
And I kind of think rump steak
could fill that kind of spot

00:26:56.709 --> 00:26:57.250
in wrestling.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.540
So he's not featured.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.300
He's just always there at
every single wrestling match.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.060
And he just walks about
in a dressing gown.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.700
And it's just, sort of,
when he's given the signal,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.707
he just comes on, and it's there
just to be used in any way.

00:27:09.707 --> 00:27:11.290
FLORENCE PUGH: Does
he cook you steak?

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:11.995
JACK LOWDEN: No.

00:27:11.995 --> 00:27:13.640
FLORENCE PUGH: Does he
have, like, a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.680
LENA HEADEY: Can I just say,
hearing that, never ever

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.480
do anything wrong.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.230
JACK LOWDEN: What?

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.340
LENA HEADEY: Never do anything
that sends you to prison,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.420
just having heard that.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.170
JACK LOWDEN: Yeah.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.753
NICK FROST: It sounds like you
had something awfully traumatic

00:27:22.753 --> 00:27:24.910
happen to you, and this is
something your brain has

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:25.840
invented to cover it.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.716
JACK LOWDEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:27.716 --> 00:27:32.380
PAIGE: His wrestling alter ego
reminds me of the alter ego

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.690
that I came up with in
case I wasn't Paige.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.287
And it was me and
Renee Young, and we

00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:37.870
said we would dress
in dressing gowns.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.970
So I don't know if I'm stealing
your gimmick a little bit.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.620
But we would be
called the sleepers,

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.510
and we'll put you
in sleep, and then

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.580
we'll give them buns
on their wrists,

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.320
and be like, you just
got a case of melatonin.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.741
And then you'd be like, are
you ready for your wet dream.

00:27:51.741 --> 00:27:52.240
And then--

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.150
LENA HEADEY: Oh, my god.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.050
NICK FROST: Oh, wow.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.750
PAIGE: Well, I'm not going
to tell the rest of it.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.208
FLORENCE PUGH: So
it didn't happen.

00:27:57.208 --> 00:28:00.690
PAIGE: No, unfortunately, it
didn't sell, but it's an idea.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.780
But you can join.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.230
JACK LOWDEN: I definitely
think there's a gap in WWE.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.640
PAIGE: Yeah.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.765
JACK LOWDEN: I think there's
a market for something

00:28:05.765 --> 00:28:08.431
a little bit more
highbrow like that.

00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:09.440
PAIGE: Do you have one?

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.023
NICK FROST: I think we've filled
enough to allow the question.

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.020
PAIGE: There's one
person lined up.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.490
FLORENCE PUGH: He's on a stage.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.560
JACK LOWDEN: Got a light.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.700
AUDIENCE: First off,
thanks for coming out guys.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.150
We really appreciate it.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.250
I'm someone who grew up
kind of watching, like,

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.110
the attitude era
of WWE, so there

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:26.440
was a lot of cool crossover.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.930
It's cool that "The
Rock" is in this.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:31.780
Were there any other stars
from WWE that were on set

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.994
helping out that didn't
make it on camera?

00:28:33.994 --> 00:28:35.410
PAIGE: Oh, I don't
know that part.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.820
I just know the ones
that were on camera.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.278
And The Miz, he
gets in everything,

00:28:38.278 --> 00:28:40.137
so of course, he was on there.

00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:40.720
Freaking Mike.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.740
NICK FROST: Big Show
should appear as well.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:41.950
Right?

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.060
PAIGE: Sheamus Big Show.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.710
And--

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.050
FLORENCE PUGH: But we had
that-- that was the one day.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.830
So when we shot at Monday
Night Raw, we were there,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.570
and we were kind of
milling about waiting

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.565
for our opportunity to go
on after the show was over.

00:28:54.565 --> 00:28:56.190
So Stephen was actually
just going down

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.620
the whole thing like, hi,
anybody want to be in the film?

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.970
Please be in the film.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:00.720
And so all these--

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.175
JACK LOWDEN: And Vince
Vaughn walked past.

00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:03.008
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:29:03.008 --> 00:29:03.900
Exactly.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.640
These massive
wrestlers were just

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.910
walking about in
their little Speedos,

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.720
and like, we were just
hoping that they'd

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.587
be doing a gag with me and the
food, and then [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:12.587 --> 00:29:14.170
PAIGE: Oh, that was
a good one though.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:14.400
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.240
PAIGE: That was like me
when I first got there.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.010
I was just like--

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.494
everyone was like, you shouldn't
eat that much, and I'm like,

00:29:18.494 --> 00:29:19.780
I'll eat whatever I want to.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.113
And I'm just grabbing hot
dogs, burgers, and everything.

00:29:22.113 --> 00:29:24.120
All the girls were eating
like salads, like--

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.400
and I'm just like,
no, I like food.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.120
That was perfect.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.940
I loved it.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.690
Oh, that was--

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.571
LENA HEADEY: Sorry.

00:29:31.571 --> 00:29:33.570
PAIGE: There was that one
question for you guys.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.361
MIKE ABRAMS: Anyway,
I'll keep asking then.

00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:36.390
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.192
MIKE ABRAMS: So how--

00:29:38.192 --> 00:29:39.900
NICK FROST: Thank you
everyone for your--

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.120
MIKE ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.849
NICK FROST: Really.

00:29:42.849 --> 00:29:43.890
MIKE ABRAMS: There we go.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:44.240
NICK FROST: Oh, hang on.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.870
You're not using the bathroom.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:46.650
JACK LOWDEN: Yeah.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.340
NICK FROST: Oh, he's
off to do a shit.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.210
Well, hello.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.310
I had to think of a
question really quick,

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.268
because I didn't want to
miss this opportunity.

00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:58.455
But I'm Irish, so
I'm not from the US.

00:29:58.455 --> 00:30:01.200
And I noticed there's like
a different sense of humor

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.390
in the US than there is
in the UK and Ireland.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.860
I think we kind of
get each other more.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.010
So how do think
American audiences will

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.315
take to the movie?

00:30:09.315 --> 00:30:11.190
LENA HEADEY: I think
they'll fucking love it.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.201
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:30:13.201 --> 00:30:14.700
PAIGE: All the
screeners we went to,

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.310
everyone's literally dying
laughing, and I love that.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.150
[INAUDIBLE] crying.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.090
FLORENCE PUGH: You know,
we did have to-- so there

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.173
are a couple of the lines.

00:30:21.173 --> 00:30:23.530
So there's a really
good line in it,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.530
"dick me dead,
bury me pregnant."

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.510
And when we'd be
filming, Stephen

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.030
would have to basically measure
how many "dick me deads"

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.650
each person could get.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.230
So like, if someone
said the F word,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.630
or if someone said dick, or--

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.700
it would be like a
tally so there'd only

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.276
be a certain amount of
fucks and dicks and willies.

00:30:41.276 --> 00:30:41.775
PAIGE: Yeah.

00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:42.960
I heard they had to change that.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.170
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.410
PAIGE: Just for
American audiences.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:44.640
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.050
PAIGE: Because it was
"fuck me dead, marry me--"

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.220
FLORENCE PUGH: Yeah.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.395
You're only allowed, like, two--

00:30:48.395 --> 00:30:48.910
PAIGE: Yeah.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.993
FLORENCE PUGH: "Fuck me
deads, bury me pregnants."

00:30:50.993 --> 00:30:51.672
PAIGE: America.

00:30:51.672 --> 00:30:55.170
FLORENCE PUGH: And "The Rock"
wasn't even allowed to say it.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:55.839
All that power.

00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:57.630
LENA HEADEY: Did that
answer your question?

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.680
NICK FROST: I'm
sorry you asked now.

00:31:03.982 --> 00:31:05.595
FLORENCE PUGH: What
was the question?

00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:09.660
NICK FROST:
Sensibilities in comedy--

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.380
FLORENCE PUGH: Oh.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.400
NICK FROST: Internationally.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.340
FLORENCE PUGH: You
can answer that one.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.173
PAIGE: Was that the
answer to that question?

00:31:14.173 --> 00:31:16.550
NICK FROST: Oh-- look, OK.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:20.790
So I mean, I think if
you try and dilute or try

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.930
and second guess what an
international audience will

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.092
like, I think you
dilute what the thing is

00:31:29.092 --> 00:31:30.050
that made people laugh.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:30.900
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.260
So I think of things I've
made in the past, comedically,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.220
that have worked
all over the place.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.650
You just do what makes
your mates laugh, really.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.590
And I think I've found
all over the world there

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.520
is that gang of people that
them feel like what you've made

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.330
is speaking to them
and you directly.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:46.830
You know?

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.322
NICK FROST: End of answer.

00:31:50.322 --> 00:31:51.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:52.441
NICK FROST: Thanks.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.090
MIKE ABRAMS: So I would
love to hear what your--

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.300
NICK FROST: Let us go home.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.630
We're a bit bored.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.600
No, I'm joking.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.690
Oh, whoa!

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.150
LENA HEADEY: That's Zak.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.800
NICK FROST: This is Zak Zodiac.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.986
PAIGE: This is my brother.

00:32:09.986 --> 00:32:12.820
ZAK ZODIAC: I don't
have a question.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.810
In fact, I just wanted
to talk to you, Jack.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.150
That's the first time I've
heard you say anything.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.390
My sister's told me about all
the interviews you've done.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.820
But you know, I
just stood there,

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.060
and you just made a six
foot 318 stone guy cry.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:27.800
JACK LOWDEN: Oh.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.175
ZAK ZODIAC: I
wanted to make sure

00:32:29.175 --> 00:32:31.710
that everyone knew here
how much I appreciate

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.801
you playing my character.

00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:34.800
And there would have been
no one else I'd rather

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.030
have play my character.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.960
Thank you so much.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.369
And thank you for those kind
words you've just given me.

00:32:39.369 --> 00:32:40.410
JACK LOWDEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.368
PAIGE: That's so sweet.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.402
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:49.402 --> 00:32:50.360
Let them have a moment.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.600
Yeah.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.944
NICK FROST: Nice.

00:32:53.944 --> 00:32:56.630
PAIGE: My dad's going to do the
same thing to you, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.630
NICK FROST: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:57.860
Come on.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.530
JACK LOWDEN: Yeah.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.530
NICK FROST: Well, that's
a nice place to end it.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.350
I'd like to thank--

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.641
I'd like to thank you all for--

00:33:02.641 --> 00:33:03.720
MIKE ABRAMS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.220
I agree.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.690
NICK FROST: Let's
have a look at clip.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:07.250
MIKE ABRAMS: If there's
no other question,

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.749
that's a beautiful
moment to end on.

00:33:08.749 --> 00:33:09.315
So--

00:33:09.315 --> 00:33:10.207
NICK FROST: One more.

00:33:10.207 --> 00:33:11.790
Jesus, we've flown
thousands of miles.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.130
There's two people at Google
who wants to ask a question.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.465
Ah, three, there we go.

00:33:17.465 --> 00:33:18.840
AUDIENCE: How are
you guys doing?

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.470
Thanks for coming.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.080
NICK FROST: Thank you.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.413
Thank you for asking a question.

00:33:21.413 --> 00:33:24.150
AUDIENCE: So growing up
here, wrestling was very much

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.876
a part of the popular culture.

00:33:25.876 --> 00:33:27.750
When I was a kid, there
was breakfast cereals

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.670
and the Saturday
morning cartoons.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.625
And you know, I
was just curious,

00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:33.750
in the UK, what is it like?

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.820
Is wrestling similar?

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.320
Is it part of the
popular culture

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.486
in the same way it was here?

00:33:38.486 --> 00:33:41.370
Do you-- is our wrestling,
the American wrestling,

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.104
popular there?

00:33:42.104 --> 00:33:44.520
PAIGE: Yeah, American wrestling
is very popular over there

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.020
actually.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.310
That's why we do two
tours a year over there.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.590
It's pretty successful
when we do go.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.420
And yeah, British
wrestling was a huge thing.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.670
We had World of Sport growing
up, and stuff like that.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.170
And [INAUDIBLE] Big Daddy.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.570
NICK FROST: Yeah.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.460
PAIGE: So but it's really grown
in the last couple of years

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:00.960
now.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.960
Like, there's just indie
federations everywhere,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.420
and obviously WWE have opened
up a performance center.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.050
I think CUK over there now.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:10.800
So yeah, it's just as alive
over there as it is here.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.000
We're just a very small country.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.696
So obviously
there's not as many.

00:34:15.696 --> 00:34:17.820
NICK FROST: I used to watch
wrestling on a Saturday

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.150
morning.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.670
It was on for like an hour in
the mornings, and that was it.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.169
You know?

00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:24.330
And there was, as Paige said,
a character called "Big Daddy"

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.100
and another guy called
"Giant Haystacks."

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.859
And they were always-- they
started off in their own--

00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:30.900
they were a tag team, and
then, essentially, they

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.340
became enemies.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.989
So to watch those
two guys going at it,

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.697
that was my kind of
beginning of wrestling.

00:34:36.697 --> 00:34:38.280
And it was always,
I think, maybe, you

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.520
know, the birth of
where WAW started in,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.540
small little halls
around the country.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.830
And it would travel, and the
guy who presented it was a guy

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.210
called Dicky Davis.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.710
And he was very Dapper.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.969
And he had dense,
big black hair,

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.150
but he had like a
white streak in it,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.510
like the mom at the
end of "Poltergeist."

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.280
So that-- yeah,
that's where wrestling

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.510
started for me as well.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.291
You know?

00:35:01.291 --> 00:35:03.537
AUDIENCE: It feels like a love
child of "Big Daddy" and "Giant

00:35:03.537 --> 00:35:03.700
Haystacks."

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.408
NICK FROST: Yeah.

00:35:04.408 --> 00:35:05.280
In many ways.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.940
I keep trying to think
a biopic of their battle

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.871
would be a great
film, but I keep--

00:35:10.871 --> 00:35:12.120
it keeps getting knocked back.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.245
People keep saying, well,
it's too British perhaps,

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:18.880
and it wouldn't travel,
but I think that's shit.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.661
Look, we've opened up a gate.

00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:24.310
AUDIENCE: Everyone,
thanks for coming.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.490
So to go on that
question, if you

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.050
were a fan of
wrestling growing up,

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.700
who was your favorite
wrestler and why?

00:35:31.974 --> 00:35:33.390
PAIGE: Can I answer
this question?

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.515
Because I know I've always
been a fan of wrestling.

00:35:35.515 --> 00:35:36.840
Obviously, it's obvious.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.487
But I really loved--

00:35:39.487 --> 00:35:41.070
I don't know how big
of wrestling fans

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.970
you guys are in
here, but there's

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.560
a woman called [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.119
And I was a really
big fan of hers,

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:46.410
because she was very different.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.787
She was this really big
Asian, just beautiful woman,

00:35:50.787 --> 00:35:53.370
and she was just so different
to the rest of the women in WWE.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.495
And that's where I stole
one of my wrestling moves,

00:35:55.495 --> 00:35:57.630
apart from Zaks, but--
and then, also I love Lea,

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.921
because she was very different.

00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:01.560
And obviously, Dwayne, I'll put
you up there if he's watching.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.190
And "Stone Cold," because he
just was just a bad ass dude.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.300
He was so amazing.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.907
No one else liked
wrestling, so--

00:36:10.907 --> 00:36:13.490
NICK FROST: I think that "Stone
Cold" was one of my favorites.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.840
And of the old English bunch,
I like "Big Daddy" and "Giant

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.660
Haystacks," but
when Kendo Nagasaki,

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.460
when he ran into
the ring, he was he

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:26.540
was shrouded in
like a Kendo mask.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.166
He was kind of frightening
and and mysterious.

00:36:31.166 --> 00:36:32.185
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:32.185 --> 00:36:33.480
NICK FROST: Thank you.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.710
AUDIENCE: Hey guys.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.760
Thanks for coming.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.850
This question is for Paige.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:39.710
One quick thing I
did want to say,

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.540
that what you've done
for women's wrestling

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.277
has been amazing.

00:36:42.277 --> 00:36:42.985
PAIGE: Thank you.

00:36:42.985 --> 00:36:44.520
AUDIENCE: And I
really appreciate.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.290
That being said, where do
you see it going from here?

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.581
PAIGE: It's just going to
keep getting bigger, I think.

00:36:54.581 --> 00:36:55.800
Now we have a WWE Evolution.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.740
I mean, I'm sad that I can't
be a part of that because

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.240
of the injury that I had, but--

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.110
FLORENCE PUGH: But
you started it.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.010
PAIGE: Though I did
start the damn thing.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:07.170
So no, I'm just really
happy with where it's going.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.587
We have so many amazing females
now that's in the company,

00:37:09.587 --> 00:37:11.753
and they're just main event
in all these big things,

00:37:11.753 --> 00:37:12.670
like Wrestlemania.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.710
I never thought that
was going to happen,

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.697
but hopefully it's
happening this year.

00:37:15.697 --> 00:37:18.030
And I just think it's just
going to keep getting bigger.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.310
Women in the WWE
are now unstoppable.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.100
We're not looked at as
a piss break or like

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.090
tits and ass anymore.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.740
We're looked at as truly
serious in the ring competitors,

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:33.780
and no longer divas, but we're
superstars, and I love that.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:34.320
Thanks.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.226
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:38.226 --> 00:37:39.900
AUDIENCE: Hey, thank you.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.030
Thank you guys for coming.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.230
Didn't know if that was working.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.680
This is probably
mostly for Paige,

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.369
but it could be for everyone.

00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:48.410
You have a moment in the
film, or in the trailer,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.993
where you're talking
about, hey, don't

00:37:49.993 --> 00:37:52.280
be the first-- or, don't
be me, be the first you.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:52.940
Right?

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.112
So I'm wondering how people
develop their personas.

00:37:55.112 --> 00:37:57.320
You know, how does somebody
become a hero or villain?

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.653
And that might make more
sense, obviously, in wrestling.

00:37:59.653 --> 00:38:02.240
It could also apply to
actors, who gets cast as what.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.270
How does that work?

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.811
PAIGE: Right.

00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:08.149
So when it comes to
the WWE, you have

00:38:08.149 --> 00:38:09.440
to try and develop a character.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.648
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:38:10.648 --> 00:38:15.240
Like, we had Hornswoggle, who
would dress like a leprechaun.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.925
He was a midget.

00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:19.800
I don't know if that's
the right term to say.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.701
But it's that WWE can give you
a character, like they gave it

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:24.200
to him.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.690
Or you know-- but with me,
I create my own character,

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.464
because I was just like the
elevated version of myself.

00:38:29.464 --> 00:38:31.130
You know, I just
started screaming a lot

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.781
and being extra pale.

00:38:32.781 --> 00:38:33.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.390
And apparently it worked.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:39.680
But like, with the process,
you have so much time in NXT

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.060
that you can
develop a character.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.540
Like, they have such a great
center down there where

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.760
you have promo
classes, and you have

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.770
teachers that can
work with you to try

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.460
and help you create something.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.380
And but I think the best
character you can have

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.240
is definitely just you with
the bass turned up essentially.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.790
So that's personally for me.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:02.175
What do you guys think for
your wrestling characters?

00:39:02.175 --> 00:39:04.569
Are you OK?

00:39:04.569 --> 00:39:05.860
Wait, what are you laughing at?

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.539
NICK FROST: Lena's
laughing at Hornswoggling.

00:39:09.539 --> 00:39:10.580
PAIGE: That was his name.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.890
Is there-- do people
know who Hornswoggle was?

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:13.610
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.290
PAIGE: One person, I think.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.540
Oh, and the one in the back.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.091
He was Hornswoggle.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.240
There was also another
one called El Torito,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.136
and he dressed
like a little bull.

00:39:25.136 --> 00:39:26.880
FLORENCE PUGH: What?

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.150
PAIGE: We've had
some characters.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.945
LENA HEADEY: I feel like
we've entered another realm.

00:39:31.945 --> 00:39:34.070
PAIGE: Not the kind of
realm you're thinking about.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.450
FLORENCE PUGH: You're crying.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:36.158
PAIGE: You look--

00:39:36.158 --> 00:39:37.614
LENA HEADEY: It's
been three days.

00:39:40.505 --> 00:39:43.640
MIKE ABRAMS: On
that note, the film

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.220
was going to be in theaters
everywhere on February 22nd,

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.360
so please go see it.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.490
And you can find
out more information

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.637
at FightingWithMyFamily.movie.

00:39:51.637 --> 00:39:52.970
So thank you all for being here.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:53.660
NICK FROST: Thank you.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.230
Thanks for having us.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.650
Cheers.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:55.358
PAIGE: Thank you.

00:39:55.358 --> 00:39:56.800
[APPLAUSE]
