[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.450
JOSH LANZET: All right.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.575
Now let's bring up the
people that are behind that.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.170
Let's start with co-creator
and executive producer Matthew

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.670
Federman.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.470
Come on up.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.240
Keep it going, guys.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.760
Awesome.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.000
We've got Sofia Pernas,
one of the stars.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.230
Come on up here.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.753
Matt Barr, another
wonderful star.

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:23.670
And another co-creator
and executive producer,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.550
Steven Scaia.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.400
Come on up, guys.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.727
All right.

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:30.810
MATT BARR: Yes, I'm green.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.570
Yes.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.610
JOSH LANZET: Yeah
that's what we did.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.090
We did it exclusively for you.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.910
MATT BARR: That's
the OG Google color.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.185
JOSH LANZET: Perfect.

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:37.260
Do we all like our colors?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.640
Are we cool with
our colors here?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.090
SOFIA PERNAS: With our colors.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.750
JOSH LANZET: Perfect.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.420
Wonderful.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.995
STEVEN SCAIA: I'm-- I'm fine.

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.120
JOSH LANZET: You've got
your M&amp;M's and you're good.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.962
Good.

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.170
I do want you guys to know
that he goes to all of his

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600
interviews with green M&amp;M's.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.563
That's how that works.

00:00:51.563 --> 00:00:52.980
STEVEN SCAIA: Firm
contract rider.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.630
JOSH LANZET: I believe that.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.627
So let's get to-- let's
jump right in to that.

00:00:56.627 --> 00:00:57.210
What was that?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
A really boring drama, I think
that's what that was, right?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.032
No action at all.

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:03.240
Let's start at the beginning.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.615
Can you guys talk
me through kind

00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:06.990
of the origins of this show?

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.030
How you guys came up with
it, how it came to be.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.010
STEVEN SCAIA: Well it all
started because Matt and I,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.020
we've been writing together
for quite some time.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.080
And nearly every
development season, we

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.240
write a treasure hunter script.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.223
And I think-- is this our
fourth or fifth crack at that?

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:22.890
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
This is the fifth one,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.030
and it's actually getting made.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.863
STEVEN SCAIA: Right.

00:01:24.863 --> 00:01:28.950
And so the difference
this time for us was we

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.210
discovered that ISIS's
second best form of revenue

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.317
was looting antiquities
and selling them

00:01:35.317 --> 00:01:36.150
on the black market.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.110
JOSH LANZET: Wow.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.485
STEVEN SCAIA: And
so that gave us

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:42.822
a really good modern way in
to giving stakes to treasure.

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:45.030
When you don't have Nazis
and an Ark of the Covenant,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.450
you've got to find a new way.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.290
And that was a nice fresh take
and a way in that still had

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.290
very modern resonance, I think.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.290
JOSH LANZET: Oh my gosh.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.450
So you said, Nazis,
Ark of the Covenant.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.600
So I have to ask,
having watched this.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.070
Very Indiana Jones.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.293
Very "Romancing the Stone."

00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:01.710
Were those influences
for you guys

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.730
when you were writing this?

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.490
STEVEN SCAIA: Absolutely.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.410
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Yeah
I mean, and it also

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.130
takes place in a world where
people have seen those things.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.247
So they are
referenced because we

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:10.830
feel like it would
be weird for people

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.220
to be on a treasure
hunt in 2019 and not

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.798
be talking about Indiana
Jones all the time.

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:18.840
JOSH LANZET: I can just
imagine them being there,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.937
being like, yeah,
this is like a movie.

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:23.270
I don't know what it was called.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.970
Anyway.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.260
Yeah, that would be--

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.348
that would be very, very odd.

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:28.140
But I think those--

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.550
I mean, we're talking
about movies right now.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.170
We're not talking
about television.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.670
This felt-- I know you guys
haven't watched the full show.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.170
But you saw in the trailer, I
mean, it feels very cinematic.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.000
Did you guys set out
to make something

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.515
that was a little more
movie-ish than TV?

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:43.140
STEVEN SCAIA: I think
for us, you know,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.190
we've always been big
idea, very visual writers.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.670
And when CBS wanted to do
a summer blockbuster on TV,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.590
we were more than happy
to take them up on it.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.507
And do something maybe
even a little different

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.340
for them that they were
excited about where

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.810
we didn't shoot in Atlanta.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.892
We shot all over
the world instead.

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:02.350
And I think one of the things
we really like about the show

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.892
and what was really
fun with you guys

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.100
was, we went to those places.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.633
We basically did our own stunts.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:09.300
And we basically
didn't use green screen

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.717
unless we were maybe putting
a mountain in the background.

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:13.980
But anytime someone comes
through a skylight or rides

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.450
a motorcycle, that's a real
person doing the real thing.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.680
It's not digital anything.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.460
And it just--

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.110
I think you can
tell in the show,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.590
it feels like a real adventure.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.270
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah
and how we were

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.130
able to shoot in
some of these places.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.577
Like, you saw the
Trevi Fountain.

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:29.160
And we were right
outside the Vatican.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.180
And I think it
was you, Matt, who

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.280
was like, I didn't even think
we would be able to do that.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.630
I thought we'd have
to green screen that.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.223
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: It's really
funny because when we--

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:35.870
is this on, or not?

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.150
I can't tell.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.100
JOSH LANZET: I think it is.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.220
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: OK.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.000
SOFIA PERNAS: Just have to--

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.292
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: I've got to--

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:40.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.188
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: When
we'd written that, which

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.890
was in 2016 at this point.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.477
And we just wrote like, oh, we
should say something specific

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:47.310
that they walk past.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.700
And then like, in some universe,
at least people will imagine

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.827
where they are in Italy.

00:03:51.827 --> 00:03:53.910
But we're just clearly
never going to shoot there.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.550
And then, everything about
this project just kept being us

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.860
saying, well they're
never going to do this.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.760
But we might as well have
fun and just push it anyway.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.260
And then like,
see if someone is,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.160
you know, somehow dumb enough
to take us up on this thing.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.810
STEVEN SCAIA: It's
the first project

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.473
we've worked on where it got
bigger and bigger and bigger

00:04:09.473 --> 00:04:10.140
as you go along.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.410
Because part of the
magic of television is,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.820
do it faster and
spend less every time.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.550
And everything we
came up with, it just

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.550
would keep getting larger
and larger and larger.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.785
We weren't-- we weren't
originally going to Morocco.

00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:24.160
Then all of a
sudden it was like,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.370
hey how about Morocco
as well as Italy?

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.852
And then when we
got to Morocco, we

00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:30.060
decided, hey, how about we
go to an whole other place

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.593
in Morocco?

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:32.760
Because it's got a completely
different visual feel.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.340
And then it went from
foot chase to car chase.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.170
And like, all
these little things

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.420
we would do along the way
when these guys were totally

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.470
game where they wanted
to crank it up too.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.970
MATT BARR: Yeah,
and you know, there

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.762
was-- you would read
the scripts and think,

00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:48.090
there is no way we can do this.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.640
So you know-- and when
we'd arrive on set

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.715
and there was live cobras or
there was a zip line that's

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:56.090
going to catch on fire and
the whole half of the building

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.960
is going to fall
over, or, you know,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.860
I'm going to be tied
to the top of a BMW.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.990
And we would do it.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.837
It was like, somehow these
guys and our whole team--

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:05.420
STEVEN SCAIA: I want
to feel like it's

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.350
because we were far enough
away from CBS headquarters

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.970
that they didn't quite
know what we were up to.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.330
MATT BARR: No that's exact--

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.530
cause, yeah, when you're in the,
you know, the heart of Morocco,

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.230
you can get away with shit.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.105
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah, Barr
broke both his legs.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.658
We have no idea how it happened.

00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:16.825
We're going to make it work.

00:05:16.825 --> 00:05:17.616
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah.

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.440
MATT BARR: It was a
real cobra, you guys.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.850
JOSH LANZET: I feel like
for the two of you, I mean,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.350
you guys are probably
having scripts

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.760
sent to you all the time.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.160
What was your initial
reaction when you read this?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.475
I mean, this had to
have been crazy, right?

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:29.850
MATT BARR: I'll
take a step back.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.490
I remember the press release
for this in like, 2017.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.240
And there was like, CBS buys
series, "Blood and Treasure."

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.160
And I was like, oh my god.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.810
That's going to be the
greatest show ever.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.690
We were both doing other
shows at that time.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.970
But, yeah.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.220
I remember reading the script.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.260
And as a boy that grew
up like every boy that

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.540
wants to be Indiana Jones,
and I thought, I'll be damned.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.040
They did it.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.710
Like, however they've
kind of captured

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.070
that magic, which I don't
know why no one seems to--

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.008
no one has done this.

00:05:59.008 --> 00:05:59.550
I don't know.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.830
It's like--

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.288
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah well we both
have crazy casting stories.

00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:03.950
Because specifically
because we both

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.300
fell in love with the script.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.490
And so yes, I was on another
show at the same time.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.490
But I was like, now I'm
getting on this show.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.280
It's happening.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.020
JOSH LANZET: Is
that how that works?

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.562
Is that you just
say, I'm getting on?

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:16.025
SOFIA PERNAS: I don't
care what I got to do.

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:17.400
MATT BARR: Who do
I have to kill?

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.820
SOFIA PERNAS: Who
do I have to kill?

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.495
Yeah, but it was nuts.

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:22.370
I mean, I think what?

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.060
You had 24 hours, then
you got on a plane.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.380
And you were in--

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.360
you were in Montreal.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.830
MATT BARR: Yeah.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.705
STEVEN SCAIA: My two
favorite casting stories

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:32.790
are when she came in
to read for the part,

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.880
well she has an English
accent on the show.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.220
And she came in, did the
whole thing, and left.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.870
And we were like, was that?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.730
Is she English?

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.967
This doesn't-- like, we had
no idea whether it was a put

00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:45.050
on or whether it was real.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.758
Because you stayed in
it the entire time.

00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:47.510
It was brilliant.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.240
SOFIA PERNAS: First of all,
I don't remember doing that.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.390
I don't remember.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.808
STEVEN SCAIA: You don't
remember not doing it either.

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:53.804
SOFIA PERNAS: I don't
remember not doing it either.

00:06:53.804 --> 00:06:54.387
So, who knows?

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:55.846
MATT BARR: She
actually is English.

00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:56.815
This is all an act.

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:58.190
STEVEN SCAIA: But
then, then when

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.240
we called this guy to tell
him he got the job, you could,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.460
like, the scream was so
loud that the phone actually

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.360
shorted out.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.190
And then it stopped.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.420
And he's like, OK guys.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.960
What do I need to do?

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.350
And we're like,
don't worry about it.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.360
We just need you to get
on a plane tomorrow.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.512
And he's like, ha ha ha.

00:07:12.512 --> 00:07:13.970
No seriously, when
do I need to go?

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.410
We're like, no Matt.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.880
We start shooting on Wednesday.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.180
Then it got really quiet.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.670
MATT BARR: Pack
for seven months.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.500
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.460
JOSH LANZET: So you
packed for seven months

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.110
in less than 12 hours?

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.250
MATT BARR: I really did.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.760
JOSH LANZET: Oh my--

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.540
SOFIA PERNAS: Like, I'll
just buy my closet--

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.165
MATT BARR: The good
thing is, you know,

00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:30.290
I probably own three jeans
and a few t-shirts and--

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.082
JOSH LANZET: A lot of
linen and flip flops.

00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:34.340
MATT BARR: Yeah, a couple
flip-flops and, you know,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.220
I'm good to go.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.440
JOSH LANZET: So you can
take the boy out of Texas.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.550
That's pretty much
what you're saying.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.060
MATT BARR: That's right.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.893
JOSH LANZET: Got it.

00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:39.685
So, so OK.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:41.060
So you guys, you
got the scripts.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.070
I mean, was it a very
long process for you

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.930
two, kind of starting
from reading it

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.460
to being cast in this?

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.975
SOFIA PERNAS: Well, what
made mine a little bit crazy

00:07:51.975 --> 00:07:54.007
was because I was on
another show at the time.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:54.840
JOSH LANZET: Oh wow.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.410
SOFIA PERNAS: And so it was
a very interesting needle

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.643
to thread, that one.

00:08:00.643 --> 00:08:03.060
JOSH LANZET: I'm sensing some
withholding, which is great.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.940
I'm fine with it.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.580
STEVEN SCAIA: I think it's
that we all knew she was cast

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.663
and she knew she was cast.

00:08:06.663 --> 00:08:08.803
But the world could not
know she was cast yet.

00:08:08.803 --> 00:08:10.470
Until the fate of
that show was decided.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.270
SOFIA PERNAS: Yes, the fate
of the show had to be decided.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.200
STEVEN SCAIA: And we
had contingency plans.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.010
But still.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.310
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:14.690
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.273
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
Our contingency plan

00:08:16.273 --> 00:08:17.805
was to end that other show.

00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:19.680
We were like, she's
literally the only person

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.138
in the world that
can do this part.

00:08:21.138 --> 00:08:23.490
So whatever we have to do,
whoever we have to kill,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.445
just let us know.

00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:26.070
MATT BARR: What I'll
say is pretty cool

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.930
is like, it's rare when you
read a script that you just love

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.680
and you think, I'm
born to play this part.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.350
And very rarely does that
align with your reality.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.293
And when it does, it's like
a freaking miracle, you know?

00:08:38.293 --> 00:08:39.960
So it was fun that
when this worked out,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.870
and I joined this team,
that thought I'm like,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.162
walking in my dreams right now.

00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:46.703
STEVEN SCAIA: And I think that
that's what's great about them

00:08:46.703 --> 00:08:49.260
in the show is, we cast them
as actors to play parts.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.860
But you guys are so very
much those people on screen

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.840
that we wrote before
we even met you.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.110
You guys are the perfect
people for those roles.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.743
Because there are so many
times we'd be somewhere,

00:09:00.743 --> 00:09:02.160
and you would say
or do something,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.020
or you would say
or do something.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.920
And we're like, that's
such a Lexi thing.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.180
So Lexi.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.928
It's so Danny.

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:10.970
JOSH LANZET: Well so when
did you two first meet?

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.803
Did you meet on set?

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:14.530
Or did you have a
chemistry read beforehand?

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.180
SOFIA PERNAS: Well, technically,
we had met January of 2018.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.390
Because we were both on
military shows at the time.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.340
MATT BARR: At a veteran's event.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.140
SOFIA PERNAS: We met
at a veteran awards

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.360
ceremony promoting each
other's military shows.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.810
Then six months
later, we were doing--

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.240
he calls me and he
goes, hey, we met.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.130
And I'm chemistry reading
with you tomorrow.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.675
And I was like, oh no sh--

00:09:33.675 --> 00:09:35.272
no shit.

00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:37.230
JOSH LANZET: My favorite
thing is, you said it.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.400
Then you looked around.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.990
And then you said it again.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.790
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: That was peak
Sofia you just saw right there.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.150
That's why she's so Lexi.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.873
MATT BARR: It's cool cause
at that veteran's event--

00:09:45.873 --> 00:09:47.290
at that event when
I met Sofia, we

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.628
were both doing
this veterans thing.

00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:52.170
I remember thinking like, this
is the kind of actress I like.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.640
One, what a cool human being.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.430
But two, we talked
about work and sort

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.880
of how we approached
being actors.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.640
And I was like, this
is the perfect balance.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.620
Like, I would love
to get in a foxhole

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.400
with an actor like this.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.710
And so we, you know, just
thought, good luck to you,

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.210
you know?

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.960
And I hope I get to
work with you one day.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.810
And then three months
later, we were--

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.890
SOFIA PERNAS: We were
literally in a foxhole.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.680
Yeah.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.410
MATT BARR: Literally
in a burning--

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.248
burning foxhole.

00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:16.290
JOSH LANZET: I mean, I
haven't seen that episode.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.550
But I can't wait.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.260
It sounds great.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.040
So this show jumps everywhere,
all over geographically,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.832
all over the world.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.207
When you two were
writing it, was

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:26.940
part of the allure
to essentially take

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.587
the audience on a free trip
with you all around the world?

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.920
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Yeah because
I-- lots of times the way

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.805
we split it up is Steve is
running the set, basically,

00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:36.180
and I'm running
the writers room.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.307
And then we kind of cross--

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:37.890
we cross over.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.845
And sometimes I would
be in the writers room

00:10:39.845 --> 00:10:41.220
and we'd be working
on the story.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.840
And then Steve would come in
and we would pitch him a thing.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.310
And he'd be like, wait, where?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.630
We're just in like, one city?

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.130
And I'm like, well we're
figuring out the story.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:47.370
No no.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.950
We got to-- we got
to-- we got to go here.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.975
We'll go to-- we'll
go to Montreal here,

00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:50.450
and we'll go to here.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.920
You know, he just like,
starts throwing cities up

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.462
on the board.

00:10:52.462 --> 00:10:53.130
I'm like, OK.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.213
Get out of the room until
we figure out the story.

00:10:55.213 --> 00:10:58.230
But it was definitely
the point was that it

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.490
should feel like a travelogue.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.567
We would joke, it's
Anthony Bourdain with guns.

00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:03.900
But it's like, it should feel
like these beautiful parts

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.800
of the world.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.905
And the audience
is on an adventure,

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:10.560
you know, as much with
us as the characters.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.190
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah,
I think for us,

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.440
we've always loved traveling.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.390
And so to be able
to-- for us to be

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.030
able to go and see these places,
but also present them in a way

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.140
that you would want
to go to them too.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.680
And so, when we go
to a refugee camp,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.300
it's a sexy refugee
camp by the beach.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.800
You know?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.320
Like, you really get
the sense of this

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.780
is a world that you want to
get out there and explore.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.000
And I think for us,
one of the fun things

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.790
was finding those places
in Morocco and Italy.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.800
I mean, Italy's easy because,
I mean, look at that.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.050
Who wouldn't want to go there?

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.675
But there's so many
places in the world

00:11:41.675 --> 00:11:43.398
that you wouldn't
necessarily think of,

00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:44.940
this would be a
great place to visit.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.790
But you go and we show that.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.540
And I think hopefully
it'll get people out

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.180
of their houses a
little bit more.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:50.520
JOSH LANZET: Ah.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.145
So you were trying
to encourage travel?

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:52.660
I get it.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.220
That makes sense.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.550
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: We're
actually a travel agency

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.920
that's, you know, working
the long way around

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.540
on our business.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:56.970
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.970
JOSH LANZET: Oh perfect.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:58.680
Well I'm sold.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.403
I'm ready to go wherever
that picture was taken.

00:12:02.403 --> 00:12:03.570
This was filmed across what?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.350
Three continents?

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.830
Is that right?

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.860
STEVEN SCAIA: That's true.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.650
JOSH LANZET: So what was it like
for-- have you guys ever been

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.180
on shows where you were
traveling as much as you

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.260
traveled for this?

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.060
MATT BARR: No.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.110
It was awesome.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.333
SOFIA PERNAS: It was nuts.

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:15.000
MATT BARR: Yeah.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.960
It was fun to, like, go to
sleep in the Italian Alps,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.350
and then wake up in Morocco.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.547
And you're in some
Medina with camels.

00:12:23.547 --> 00:12:25.380
JOSH LANZET: I hope you
know that no one can

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.200
say that sentence.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.200
Like there are like, maybe
five people that have

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.220
said that sentence before.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.140
STEVEN SCAIA: I've never had
a job where the call to prayer

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.820
was my alarm in the morning.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.140
And that was pretty special.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.500
SOFIA PERNAS: Yup.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.250
MATT BARR: Yeah.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.042
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah.

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:37.110
It was-- I'm from--

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.290
I was born in Morocco.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.270
So I've now had the honor of
twice in a row shooting there.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.050
But this one was like,
very, we shot all over.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.980
So it was great.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.610
I was like the secret
Moroccan on set.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.100
Because apparently I don't look
Moroccan, is what I was told.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.360
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
That's a weird--

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.620
SOFIA PERNAS: Cause
I speak the language.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.240
JOSH LANZET: I was going to
say, that's a new script,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.032
is Secret Moroccan.

00:12:56.032 --> 00:12:57.282
SOFIA PERNAS: Secret Moroccan.

00:12:57.282 --> 00:12:59.140
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Can
you find the Moroccan?

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.932
JOSH LANZET: It's like
a new Where's Waldo?

00:13:00.932 --> 00:13:01.793
I'm excited.

00:13:01.793 --> 00:13:04.210
Was the travel-- I imagine
travel might be a little easier

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.918
for you because you
speak, I want to say,

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:06.980
is it four languages?

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.480
Yeah.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.022
So it might have
been easier for you.

00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:11.970
And Matt, I think
you're cracking one?

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.270
MATT BARR: That's right.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.920
JOSH LANZET: It's like--

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.700
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: He's
got a couple more classes.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.367
And then he's totally
going to be there.

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:19.720
MATT BARR: Sofia's dad
won the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.170
Matt's dad mows the
yard on Sundays.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.920
JOSH LANZET: You know,
and mowing the yard

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.702
is a peaceful thing
that deserves a prize.

00:13:25.702 --> 00:13:27.160
STEVEN SCAIA: And
he's great at it.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.993
MATT BARR: Yeah, but
he's great at it, guys.

00:13:28.993 --> 00:13:32.080
STEVEN SCAIA: He like, puts
the pattern on it, you know?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.400
JOSH LANZET: I've always been
impressed with your father.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400
I want you to know that.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.395
MATT BARR: Thank you.

00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:37.270
JOSH LANZET: But in
terms of all this travel,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.370
I imagine some things
didn't go as planned, right?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.510
There had to have been--

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.400
nothing ever goes
perfectly, especially when

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.320
you're running three
continents in the mix.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.478
Any stories of things that
kind of didn't go so hot?

00:13:47.478 --> 00:13:49.770
STEVEN SCAIA: I mean, the
two stories that come to mind

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.960
are Colosseum Night.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.810
And then the day in
the Medina in Tangier.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.170
Where we were
shooting a chase scene

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.605
through the streets of
Tangier, doubling for Havana--

00:14:01.605 --> 00:14:03.480
which, by the way, I
just said that sentence,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.690
and it sounds awesome.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.150
And that day, it poured
rain all morning long.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.032
And we were in
two inches of rain

00:14:11.032 --> 00:14:12.240
in the middle of this Medina.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.190
We had like, 200 extras.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.540
It was a big day.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.060
And it didn't stop
raining for the first four

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.960
hours of the day.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.315
So we just lost a
whole bunch of time.

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:23.940
The sun finally came out, but we
had lost the ability to shoot.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.732
Because we were at the
end of the schedule,

00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:28.650
and we were out of
things to shoot that

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.460
weren't basically action
scenes set in a Medina.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.830
And we were out
of space to do it.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:35.913
So we were sitting there.

00:14:35.913 --> 00:14:37.580
It was me and the
director, Steve Boyum.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.122
And we were trying
to figure out, OK,

00:14:39.122 --> 00:14:41.772
what can we do here
when the sun goes down?

00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:43.230
Because we've got
to keep shooting.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.563
Because we've got-- we've got
basically three days left.

00:14:45.563 --> 00:14:47.730
But we've got eight pages
still left to shoot.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.600
And the only thing
left on the schedule

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600
that we hadn't shot yet
that we meant to pick up

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.660
in other places, but it kept
dropping off of our schedule,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.060
was this little
moment in Episode 2

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.550
where they parachute
into a place

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.680
and they roll over
in a parachute.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.610
And we had this Medina set.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.840
And we had, like, was it two
eighths of a page of you guys

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.360
landing in a parachute
and rolling over.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.070
And so we decided, OK.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.780
All we need to do
is we need someone

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.720
to go out and find us like,
four feet square of AstroTurf.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.420
And we can shoot this scene
in the middle of the Medina.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.480
We did that.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.660
But then we also
didn't realize by doing

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.070
that in the middle of the
Medina in Tangier, which is--

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.250
it's a safe place.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.200
But you know, you try not
to get people riled up.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.200
But they were-- some
people were very displeased

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.790
that we had a man and
a woman rolling around

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.500
in a parachute in the
middle of a Medina.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.510
So it got to be a very--

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.890
it was a very interesting night.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:41.807
But I'll never forget.

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:44.540
You look at the cut of the
episode, and you don't realize,

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.150
oh we shot that like, this far
away from a lamb on a spit.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.173
When a romantic
scene of you guys

00:15:50.173 --> 00:15:51.340
rolling around on AstroTurf.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:51.720
Yeah.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.512
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah.

00:15:52.512 --> 00:15:53.250
That was nuts.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.708
JOSH LANZET: From
a lamb on a spit?

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:56.083
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah
because that's

00:15:56.083 --> 00:15:57.190
part of the other episode.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.030
JOSH LANZET: Oh.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.530
Of course.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.010
Obviously.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.060
I don't know why I
didn't think that.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.850
STEVEN SCAIA: We had to take
the stand that we were shooting,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.860
this sort of like-- it
was like a market set.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.010
We stripped it down, stapled
the four feet of AstroTurf

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.660
that our prop guy
had found somewhere

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.565
in the streets of Morocco,
brought it back, set it up--

00:16:12.565 --> 00:16:14.940
SOFIA PERNAS: And every time
I would rest my head on what

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.220
I thought was just
beautiful, lush grass,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.285
there would be a needle
in the back of my head.

00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:21.508
Where he stapled the AstroTurf.

00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:23.550
And I'd be like, Matt,
just let me down easy, OK?

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.822
Just let me down easy.

00:16:24.822 --> 00:16:27.075
I don't want a lobotomy today.

00:16:27.075 --> 00:16:29.700
JOSH LANZET: Now you said there
was something at the Colosseum?

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.492
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah.

00:16:30.492 --> 00:16:32.910
So we got to shoot
outside the Colosseum.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.590
And it was this
amazing location.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.930
There's this park overlooking
the Colosseum that's--

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.450
I've never seen it in a
movie or a TV show before.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.000
But it's this amazing-- it's
like a dog park in Rome.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.090
Because they don't care.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.770
It's just like, this is
where we walk our dog.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.270
MATT BARR: It's incredible.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.228
STEVEN SCAIA: Whatever.

00:16:46.228 --> 00:16:48.790
And so we had
locked the location.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.550
And we were going to
shoot it the next day

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.740
where Danny and
Father Chuck were

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.220
going to have a nice scene.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.680
MATT BARR: I just remember
we had lost that location.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.510
And the next day,
we had had it back.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.360
And I was like, our
producer, Irene, I said--

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:03.980
yeah.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.400
I said, how did you swing it?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.369
She goes, she goes,
don't ask me that.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.270
Just continue with your day.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.940
Shit.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.290
STEVEN SCAIA: And that
was the kind of thing

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.790
we were up against
the entire time

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.089
where, I guess the mayor
of Rome had declared

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.915
that all public
parks in the district

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.040
were closed because it was
the worst weather they'd

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.599
had in six years.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.920
And all of the old
trees were falling down.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.435
But we were happy to go in and,
you know, take the trees out,

00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:32.310
clean it up for them.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:36.330
Like guys, we'll leave that park
nicer than when we got there.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.480
And they're like, no.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.240
Za parks, they're all closed.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.743
And--

00:17:39.743 --> 00:17:41.243
MATT BARR: He's
Italian, by the way.

00:17:41.243 --> 00:17:42.510
So it's offensive--

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.530
JOSH LANZET: Spot
on It was spot on.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.072
STEVEN SCAIA: But
I will say, I don't

00:17:45.072 --> 00:17:46.320
know what happened overnight.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.977
I just know that maybe--

00:17:48.977 --> 00:17:49.560
you know what?

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.955
I'm not going to say.

00:17:50.955 --> 00:17:52.353
I'm not going to guess.

00:17:52.353 --> 00:17:53.520
Because I still want to be--

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.280
I want to be welcomed back
to Italy for Season 2.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.083
I just know that--

00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:59.250
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Persuasive
people made their case.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.402
STEVEN SCAIA: It
got taken care of.

00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:02.610
JOSH LANZET: I mean, I just--

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.110
I hope you're hearing
these sentences.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.277
The mayor of Rome said no,
and then all of a sudden,

00:18:06.277 --> 00:18:06.880
he said yes.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.230
I don't think people
say that ever.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.783
STEVEN SCAIA: It's
definitely-- it's

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:13.950
a different experience than
shooting in Simi Valley,

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.608
I will say.

00:18:14.608 --> 00:18:15.900
JOSH LANZET: And you know what?

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.040
I think the show
could've worked there.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.990
Can I say that?

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.930
I don't--

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.060
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Season 3.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.270
JOSH LANZET: Yeah, as I
was watching, I was like,

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.210
let's get this to
Toronto or Atlanta.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.770
That's where this could be.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.770
Were there any challenges for
the two of you in all of this

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.400
travel?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.400
Any kind of things
you didn't see coming?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.750
SOFIA PERNAS: Not dying.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.946
MATT BARR: Not dying.

00:18:34.946 --> 00:18:37.330
SOFIA PERNAS: That's
my nice answer.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.930
MATT BARR: We snuck off
to Pasitano for like,

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.690
a couple days when we
had our probably two days

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.050
off the whole shoot we had.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.610
And, you know, the trains,
like, finding your way

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.750
around is kind of tough.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.478
So we wound up in,
like, another city.

00:18:50.478 --> 00:18:51.020
As you would.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.520
And then had to find the train
to get there and then take a,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.460
you know, a van to another
city to get a little taxi

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.710
to the place we were going to.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.840
So that was fun getting lost.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.893
SOFIA PERNAS: But during
shooting, do you remember?

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:05.810
I don't even remember.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.842
It's like, I was wiped.

00:19:06.842 --> 00:19:08.550
STEVEN SCAIA: My
favorite part about that

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.800
was you guys pretending like
you weren't getting hurt.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.030
Like, it was-- look,
it was grueling.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.030
The days were long.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.180
And there was a lot of running
around, no matter where

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.717
we were in the world.

00:19:19.717 --> 00:19:21.550
And each of them would
pull that move where,

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.540
it was your knee and your leg.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.200
They would show up on
set a little bit limpy.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.147
And they'd be like,
nah, it's fine.

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:29.730
Let's do this.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.080
Let's do it.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.570
It's fine.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.440
SOFIA PERNAS: I like this
just hanging off of my hip.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.150
STEVEN SCAIA: I just need a
little ice and about 15 Advil.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:33.840
We'll do it.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.190
It's like they were
like old stunt men

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.900
by the time we were
done with this thing.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.150
MATT BARR: I remember thinking
I was hiding that well.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.340
STEVEN SCAIA: No, you
were terrible at it.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.050
SOFIA PERNAS: There was
one-- there was one day where

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:43.967
we were in the Medina.

00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:45.660
I had no idea how Stephen Boyum.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.500
Did it.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.920
Well not-- well he was
a director of ours.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.780
But anyway, so it was packed.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.680
It was crazy.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.350
And then I'm
pouring tea with one

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.850
of our castmates, Katja Winter.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.580
And it's like, you
know, a long pour tea.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.663
And then all of a sudden,
you just hear screaming.

00:20:00.663 --> 00:20:01.388
From nowhere.

00:20:01.388 --> 00:20:03.180
And I was like, wait,
that's not us, is it?

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.490
That's not-- that's
not-- there's no way.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.720
And then we look over.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.820
And there's just a
riot breaking out.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.050
And Matt-- I think you're
in the middle of it.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.590
Well, you were
shooting your scene.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.257
MATT BARR: Yeah.

00:20:13.257 --> 00:20:15.590
JOSH LANZET: I was
taking a break.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.810
And I was like, this is
what happens when I leave.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:18.796
A riot.

00:20:18.796 --> 00:20:19.870
A riot breaks out.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.760
But it was nuts.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.570
MATT BARR: I just
thought the people who

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.000
were directing the extras
was like, doing a great job.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.792
Like, look at these
guys-- these kids are--

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:26.667
STEVEN SCAIA: Use it!

00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:27.740
SOFIA PERNAS: Clamoring.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.310
MATT BARR: Everyone's
so into this.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.760
JOSH LANZET: And
all of a sudden,

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.140
a riot appeared in the script.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.057
And it all made sense.

00:20:32.057 --> 00:20:33.140
STEVEN SCAIA: Looks great.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.320
JOSH LANZET: No, I'm sure.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.420
STEVEN SCAIA: You can't--
you can't pay for that.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.950
JOSH LANZET: Certainly not.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.117
So, you were saying
that they got injured.

00:20:40.117 --> 00:20:41.700
So there were a lot
of stunts in this.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.123
Were you doing most
of your own stunts?

00:20:45.123 --> 00:20:45.790
MATT BARR: Yeah.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.210
Yeah.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.127
SOFIA PERNAS: We were.

00:20:47.127 --> 00:20:50.800
But the really cool stuff, my
stunt double, Zandara Kennedy.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.170
I mean, that girl is just--

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.070
she's an Avenger.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.310
Ii mean, she was going
150 miles on a Ducati.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.390
And there's no way.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.580
CBS was like, you won't even
go two miles on a motorcycle.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.400
But Zandara-- of course
her name's Zandara.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:03.850
So.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:04.150
JOSH LANZET: Sure.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.120
That makes sense.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.078
MATT BARR: Sofia's being
pretty modest, really.

00:21:07.078 --> 00:21:09.100
This girl really-- she
is like half ninja.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.350
I mean, she knows martial arts.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.240
She handled-- she
did a military show,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.368
so she knows weaponry well.

00:21:14.368 --> 00:21:15.910
And it's like, I
mean, I'll be damned

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.918
if she can't do everything that,
you know, they want her to do.

00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:21.460
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
There was one night

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.340
where we had a big fight
scene, in 103, that big fight

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.510
scene in the tea thing.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.173
And we were like--

00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:29.590
they said, like, we had like,
five hours of shooting left,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.960
but like, an hour
to shoot it in.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.900
And every one of them had a
fight scene within that fight

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.253
scene that-- because
it was basically

00:21:37.253 --> 00:21:39.420
four of them going to battle
against the entire room

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.570
full of people.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.480
And every one of them,
you watch Matt go in.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.300
And he just like, nails this
really complicated fight

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.250
with five guys at the same time.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.540
And a hookah pipe that
breaks in the middle of it.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.865
And it was like, wow.

00:21:51.865 --> 00:21:52.490
He nailed that.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.150
And then, OK.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:53.590
Let's do it again.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.250
He nails it again.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:54.625
It was like, oh.

00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:55.583
And then he comes back.

00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:56.868
He's like, did my part.

00:21:56.868 --> 00:21:58.160
And then she's like, all right.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.183
I'm going in.

00:21:59.183 --> 00:22:00.850
One after another,
they just all went in

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.750
and they just nailed it.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.667
And it's like, wow, this
show would really not

00:22:03.667 --> 00:22:05.443
be makeable without
this group of people,

00:22:05.443 --> 00:22:07.360
if you had, you know,
any other set of actors.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.980
STEVEN SCAIA: I think
our directors were always

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.857
surprised because they
would read the scripts

00:22:10.857 --> 00:22:12.190
and see how ambitious they were.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.630
And then they would show up like
a good guest director trying

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.890
to make it easier.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.137
And we'd be like, no, no, no.

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:20.470
That's not "Blood and Treasure."

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.270
We have to make this harder.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.740
And they would get into it.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.710
And then they would see these
guys on set thinking, OK so,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.943
we'll use the stunt doubles
for all of the big action.

00:22:29.943 --> 00:22:31.360
We'll punch in for
some close ups.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.330
And we would just laugh and
be like, sure, sure, sure.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.953
Why don't we just do one run
through with our actors first?

00:22:36.953 --> 00:22:38.620
Just sort of like,
just to warm them up.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.740
And they'd see you guys do it at
full speed, completely capable.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.520
And then they would just look
at the two stunt, you know,

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.472
the two stunt people, and
be like, Robert and Zandara,

00:22:48.472 --> 00:22:50.180
you guys can just hang
here for a minute.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.690
And then they would just
sit in costume and chairs

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.728
while you guys did the
entire thing yourselves.

00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:55.770
SOFIA PERNAS: It was fun.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.730
It was fun.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.650
It was also like, there was
one fight scene where it

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.240
was, you know, girl and girl.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.020
We were just going at it.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.550
It was-- well--

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.675
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Language.

00:23:06.675 --> 00:23:07.633
JOSH LANZET: All right.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.890
I love just watching
Matt's face during that.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.380
He went on a journey.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.900
STEVEN SCAIA: This
show has everything.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.820
SOFIA PERNAS: You guys,
please watch 21st.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.022
But yeah, it was a really
intense fight scene.

00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:23.980
And I remember the stunt
double I was fighting.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.022
Her name was [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:25.022 --> 00:23:26.170
She was a ninja.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.660
But there was-- it starts off
with her doing this flying

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.200
kick at me.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.330
And she's like, I don't
know how to sell this.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:35.020
Because it's a kick in mid
air and I'm hitting you.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.340
I was like, just kick me.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.910
Just do it.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:38.410
Just do it.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.702
And she was like, are you sure?

00:23:39.702 --> 00:23:41.380
I was like, just do it.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.340
We have no time.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.298
And then she kicked me.

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:45.053
And I was like, oh my god.

00:23:45.053 --> 00:23:46.510
You like, drove the--

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.750
the lungs-- just the
air out of my body.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.830
But and then it was a
five minute fight scene.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.663
STEVEN SCAIA: By the
way, that's in the cut,

00:23:52.663 --> 00:23:54.773
because it looks awesome.

00:23:54.773 --> 00:23:56.440
SOFIA PERNAS: She's
a tae kwon do champ.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.350
I can tell you.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.075
Yeah.

00:23:58.075 --> 00:23:59.950
MATT BARR: There's a
scene where I'm giving--

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.162
I'm stabbing Sofia in
the arm with a little--

00:24:02.162 --> 00:24:03.370
I don't want to say too much.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.010
A little thing to save her life.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:06.900
And so, you know, I--

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.450
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
Well if you say less,

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.230
it's going to
actually be weirder--

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.380
MATT BARR: Yeah.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.020
That's right.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:09.380
Yeah.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.672
That's what we're trying to do.

00:24:10.672 --> 00:24:12.588
STEVEN SCAIA: Guys this
show has everything.

00:24:12.588 --> 00:24:13.880
JOSH LANZET: It's in the pilot.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.592
MATT BARR: So like,
after 10 takes,

00:24:15.592 --> 00:24:17.050
you know, it's a
fake thing, right?

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.130
So I'm just-- I'm doing the arm.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.700
And then I, you know, I look,
and her arm is just like,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.580
it was like, 10 puncture
wounds and blood on her arm.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.510
And I thought, oh my god.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.760
Have I been doing that to you?

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.593
And she's like, yes.

00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:29.983
Every time.

00:24:29.983 --> 00:24:31.900
I was, you know, I thought
you were committed.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.942
So I didn't want to mess
with your process there.

00:24:33.942 --> 00:24:35.020
But.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.810
SOFIA PERNAS: It was like, the
first thing of our partnership.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:37.860
He was like, why
didn't you tell me?

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.850
I was like, I don't want
to break your focus.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.630
MATT BARR: I think you
still have scars on your arm

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.240
from that.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.573
SOFIA PERNAS: Where this was
just a thin trail of blood.

00:24:44.573 --> 00:24:47.115
JOSH LANZET: I don't think I'd
be speaking to him after that.

00:24:47.115 --> 00:24:48.150
I don't know.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.205
MATT BARR: We all
bleed for our art.

00:24:50.205 --> 00:24:51.580
JOSH LANZET: He's
a charming guy.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.836
SOFIA PERNAS: Just committing
right in the shoulder

00:24:53.836 --> 00:24:54.336
every time.

00:24:54.336 --> 00:24:55.148
Like, damn.

00:24:55.148 --> 00:24:55.960
Damn.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.100
OK.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.097
JOSH LANZET: So I know that
you, Sofia, you did "The Brave."

00:25:00.097 --> 00:25:01.180
You did "Operation Rogue."

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.473
So you already had some
kind of gun training

00:25:03.473 --> 00:25:04.390
and military training.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.030
Did you go through
extra training for this?

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.950
SOFIA PERNAS: I
mean, very briefly.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:09.573
Gun Guy Brent.

00:25:09.573 --> 00:25:10.990
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah,
mostly we just

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.160
wanted to fool around with guns.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.150
And so they took us out.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:13.910
SOFIA PERNAS: --fool
around with guns.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.850
But I think they saw
really quickly that we

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.650
weren't just like, oh guns!

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.870
You know, we're obviously,
we know gun safety

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.810
and we were not being lax with
any kind of firearms on set.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.123
So we just got to
be able to play.

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:26.290
And so that was what it was.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.100
I mean, we went--

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.960
I think both-- did
you do the gun thing

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.720
too out in the Montreal farm?

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.158
MATT BARR: No I
don't think I did.

00:25:33.158 --> 00:25:34.450
JOSH LANZET: Matt's from Texas.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.840
He doesn't-- Matt
wasn't invited,

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.580
MATT BARR: I don't
think I was hired yet.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.825
STEVEN SCAIA: That is true.

00:25:40.825 --> 00:25:42.480
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah, that's true.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:42.980
But yeah.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.500
He just-- it was crazy.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.880
Like, there was
this random farm out

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.610
in the boons,
boonies in Montreal.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.120
And this guy had an
arsenal, like an actual--

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.980
I was like, are you
preparing for war?

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.830
What is happening?

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.580
But it was a vault
just lined with guns.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.080
And he was like,
pick whichever one.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.780
He had like, World War II--
he had every kind of weapon

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.070
there was in there.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.630
And then, I shot some, and
he's like, you're good.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:07.130
All right.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.630
You're off.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:08.412
And that was it.

00:26:08.412 --> 00:26:10.370
STEVEN SCAIA: There was
nothing more satisfying

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.537
than getting the report
back from all the department

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:15.380
heads about how competent and
unactor-like you guys were.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.530
Where I'd be like, the stunt guy
would come back after training.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.678
He's like, they're good.

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:20.720
They're going to be fine.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.800
The gun guy would come back,
[INAUDIBLE] like, they're good.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.842
They're going to be fine.

00:26:23.842 --> 00:26:25.920
Like, every step of the
way, costume is like, oh,

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.170
everything looks good on them.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.550
It's like, we might
just pull this off.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.550
MATT BARR: Sofia can shoot
a gun, drop the clip,

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.320
grab the other clip, put
it back in, shoot it again,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.250
like kill shot.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.870
And then put it
back in her holster.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.318
And you're like,
don't mess with here.

00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:41.360
STEVEN SCAIA: Oh, and
also, super hyper real girl

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:41.760
over here.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.460
We're always cutting
around-- what do you call it?

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.182
The press check?

00:26:44.182 --> 00:26:45.890
That you do every time
you pick up a gun.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.348
Because she can't help it
because of her training.

00:26:48.348 --> 00:26:50.890
SOFIA PERNAS: Well when you make
it sound like that, Stephen,

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.186
I am not obnoxious.

00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:55.160
JOSH LANZET: Wait, so
what is the press check?

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.750
SOFIA PERNAS: Well
on "The Brave--"

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:57.970
"The Brave" was
this military show.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.690
But the guy who was
our technical advisor

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:00.680
was an ex Navy SEAL.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.750
So if we--a press
check is sort of like--

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.240
you guys have all seen
"John Wick," right?

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.520
Well Keanu Reeves does
a press check every time

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.390
before he shoots.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.090
And everybody, like, Navy
SEALs and operator guys

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.680
go absolutely nuts
over Keanu Reeves

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.700
because he's so
authentic and he's real.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.430
So if we didn't
do a press check,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.740
our advisor would
make us beat a wheel--

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.020
a tire with a sledgehammer.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.520
You're supposed to make sure
there's a round in the chamber.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.690
STEVEN SCAIA: When you
pick up a bad guy's gun.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.670
MATT BARR: You had to say Keanu.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:24.830
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.590
MATT BARR: You had to say Keanu.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.498
It's fucking awesome.

00:27:26.498 --> 00:27:28.040
SOFIA PERNAS: You
check the mag, make

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.248
sure there's a round in the
chamber before you shoot.

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:33.140
Otherwise, maybe there's a,
you know, the gun doesn't work.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.267
And then you're screwed.

00:27:34.267 --> 00:27:36.850
JOSH LANZET: Sorry I just want
to back up just a smidge there.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.230
Did you say something about
a sledgehammer and a wheel?

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.725
SOFIA PERNAS: A tire.

00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:40.010
A tire.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.700
JOSH LANZET: A tire.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.200
A tire.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.752
What?

00:27:41.752 --> 00:27:43.460
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah,
it was his way, like,

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.670
if we didn't have our mags
out and the gun on safety,

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.000
we weren't practicing regular,
you know, safety regulations.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.730
So he would pick up the
weighted sledgehammer

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.830
and beat the tire
until he said--

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.660
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Is
that a SAG approved--

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.368
SOFIA PERNAS: No.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.070
It was good.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.850
That's what we needed.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.267
That's how we
didn't die that day.

00:28:03.267 --> 00:28:04.910
Because there were
some un actor like--

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:05.630
STEVEN SCAIA: That's very true.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.860
SOFIA PERNAS: --actors
on the range that day.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.210
JOSH LANZET: Yeah I love
how these three are like,

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:09.630
oh yeah, yeah.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.200
Sledgehammer.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:10.700
Tire.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.340
Makes sense.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.043
I'm like, what?

00:28:12.043 --> 00:28:13.460
STEVEN SCAIA: It's
how they learn.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:13.730
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:14.300
Oh obviously.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.022
That's how I learn, most times.

00:28:16.022 --> 00:28:18.230
Any time I'm dating someone,
if I do something wrong,

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.380
she always have me go out
back just with a sledgehammer

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:20.928
and the tire.

00:28:20.928 --> 00:28:22.970
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah chop
some wood, yeah, exactly.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.370
JOSH LANZET: Now I know,
Matt, for you, you've

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.690
had gun training as well.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.970
I also believe you've
been on horses.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.160
Are we going to see
any horseback riding

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.340
in the first season of
"Blood and Treasure?"

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.840
MATT BARR: You bet
your ass you are.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.782
JOSH LANZET: Yes.

00:28:35.782 --> 00:28:38.240
STEVEN SCAIA: You've got to
tell that story about how like,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.460
day one, he gets here, and he's
like, so we're doing horses,

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:40.543
right?

00:28:40.543 --> 00:28:42.515
And we're like, we don't have
any horses in the episode.

00:28:42.515 --> 00:28:44.480
MATT BARR: But Stephen,
every adventure show or movie

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.080
has horses.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.275
You've got to have
the horses there.

00:28:46.275 --> 00:28:47.040
Need to see it.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.710
SOFIA PERNAS: 100%.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.308
STEVEN SCAIA: He slowly wore
us down to the point where--

00:28:51.308 --> 00:28:52.100
that day-- it was--

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.440
that was maybe my
finest moment, with you,

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.440
of being able to be like,
Matt, I got greatness.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.480
MATT BARR: I was like, we need
horses and we need quicksand.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.480
And they're like, well I
can get you the horses.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.855
STEVEN SCAIA:
Quicksand Season 2.

00:29:01.855 --> 00:29:02.860
MATT BARR: Season 2.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.818
JOSH LANZET: Wait, so
the horses weren't in it.

00:29:04.818 --> 00:29:06.720
Matt just comes in
with his Texas style

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.970
and you go, all right, horses.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:08.690
We'll do horses.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.580
SOFIA PERNAS: Well that's what's
so awesome about these two guys

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.080
here.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.663
Because I mean,
Stephen at one point

00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:14.330
was going around set
like taking a poll,

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.010
being like, hey, coolest
thing you ever want to do,

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.920
tell me, bucket list.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.420
Do it.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:17.920
Right now.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.187
And I'm like, laser dance.

00:29:19.187 --> 00:29:20.020
He's like, Season 2.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.040
It's happening.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.190
STEVEN SCAIA: But
you were double guns.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.910
SOFIA PERNAS: I was double guns.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.650
And you made it happen.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.500
STEVEN SCAIA: We made it happen.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.231
SOFIA PERNAS: You
made it happen.

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.895
JOSH LANZET: Did
you say laser dance?

00:29:27.895 --> 00:29:28.687
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah.

00:29:28.687 --> 00:29:30.020
You know, in every show, like--

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.830
MATT BARR: Trying
to entrapment here.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.220
SOFIA PERNAS: Entrapment.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.345
JOSH LANZET: Oh entrapment.

00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:34.670
SOFIA PERNAS: "Oceans 11,"
there's a laser dance.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.260
JOSH LANZET: I didn't know
it was called a laser dance.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:36.890
SOFIA PERNAS: Laser-- yeah.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.753
Well it is a dance.

00:29:37.753 --> 00:29:38.420
JOSH LANZET: OK.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.530
SOFIA PERNAS: But
I mean, you know?

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.400
JOSH LANZET: I'm going
to take your word for it.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.020
No sure.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.730
We all know.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.230
So--

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.147
SOFIA PERNAS: Stephen
was taking bucket lists.

00:29:45.147 --> 00:29:46.460
And then he would report back.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.510
And then Matt's like, OK.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.050
He would approve.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.520
And then somehow, it
would be on the script.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.780
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Yeah I
just get very strange calls

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.655
from Steve where we're
in the middle of like,

00:29:52.655 --> 00:29:53.810
trying to break 110.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:54.560
And it's like, OK.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.570
So we need-- we
need horses for 106.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.730
So do you see any place
where we can have horses?

00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:59.627
And it's like, what?

00:29:59.627 --> 00:30:01.460
After a while, I would
just stop asking why.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.860
I would just be like, OK,
let me get back to you

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:03.520
and we'll see if this--

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.770
MATT BARR: Stephen's like,
Matt wants an electric eel.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.050
I was like-- sorry,
we can't do that.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:08.840
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Every
now and then, it actually

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.670
solves a story problem.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:09.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.440
MATT BARR: But they're
cool, you guys.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.390
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.670
MATT BARR: The treasure
is behind the eel.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.965
JOSH LANZET: I would
never want that.

00:30:15.965 --> 00:30:17.960
Your list is much
stranger than yours.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.630
Yours is like lasers
and double guns.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.900
SOFIA PERNAS: I had
a very reasonable--

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.678
I was like, Stephen, I just want
to shoot two guns in this show.

00:30:22.678 --> 00:30:24.470
At one point, I want
a pistol in each hand.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.540
And then in like
Episode 10, it happens,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.200
where I'm reading the script--

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:28.780
he could--

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.110
JOSH LANZET: We won't say
why she's using the guns.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.610
SOFIA PERNAS: He
would never tell me

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.740
it was happening for sure.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.407
So when I read the
script and it's like,

00:30:38.407 --> 00:30:41.350
Lexi looks at the second gun,
I was like, no, you didn't!

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.800
And then I was
like, yes you did!

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.650
It was crazy.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.640
It was like, you
guys are magicians.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.150
It's like, you think
it, and so it is so.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:51.920
STEVEN SCAIA: But like,
I feel like that's

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.045
the fun of the show, right?

00:30:53.045 --> 00:30:55.460
It's like, the shit that
you can think of that

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.300
would be really cool
to do, it's like, yeah.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.040
Let's just put that on TV.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:58.780
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Are
we allowed to curse?

00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.850
Or is we just doing that?

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:00.100
STEVEN SCAIA: It's Google.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.960
They'll take it out.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.740
JOSH LANZET: I mean, if it was--

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.665
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:04.665 --> 00:31:06.570
JOSH LANZET: If it wasn't
allowed, it is now.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.270
You know, that's
kind of where-- we've

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.710
passed-- we passed
that, I think,

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.930
with Sofia, like 30 minutes ago.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.828
So we're good.

00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:15.370
Was there anything
else on your list?

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.420
It was just-- it was
just horses for you?

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.600
MATT BARR: Oh, I had a
list of like 375 things.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.270
We got through about
20 of them I'd say.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:22.550
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah yeah.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:22.840
JOSH LANZET: Oh good.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.390
Good, good, good.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.070
STEVEN SCAIA: Matt's list
is the most comprehensive

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.000
of everyone's.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.472
But also it's good,
because like I

00:31:27.472 --> 00:31:29.180
said, like the quick
sand is like, that's

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.710
a great target for Season 2.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.620
JOSH LANZET: Sure.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.380
MATT BARR: I'll
keep them coming.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.695
JOSH LANZET: I don't doubt it.

00:31:34.695 --> 00:31:36.570
MATT BARR: We need sharks
too, at some point.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.900
We need sharks.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.390
JOSH LANZET: I don't
want to be your friend.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.770
Very scared of you.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:46.010
I mean, for you, just, I want to
know your mindset for a second.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.270
You've played a gunslinger.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.740
You've played a
helicopter pilot.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.370
You've now played an Indiana
Jones like character.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.800
You are living the dream of
every young boy everywhere.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.783
Are you just one superhero
movie away from just retiring?

00:31:57.783 --> 00:31:58.700
MATT BARR: I think so.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.070
I mean, you know, growing up on
"Top Gun" and "Indiana Jones,"

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.010
I've done both of those.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:02.270
So.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.060
JOSH LANZET: Yeah.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.410
MATT BARR: I don't know.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:03.940
Maybe.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.330
JOSH LANZET: Yeah I like,
looked at your roles,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.080
and I was like, OK.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.205
Well he's living my dreams.

00:32:07.205 --> 00:32:08.960
That's fine, OK.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.270
Reasonable.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.340
Yeah, I'm not jealous.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.420
Sofia, for you-- because I don't
want to talk to him anymore.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.230
You play, I guess, I don't know
how-- a lovable con artist?

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.590
I don't know what the right
term would be for that.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.110
STEVEN SCAIA: Master thief.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.160
JOSH LANZET: A master thief.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.060
SOFIA PERNAS:
Yeah, master thief.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.890
I steal everything,
not just art.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.000
Emphasis on art, I guess.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.250
But I steal, you know, jewels.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.150
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: But
also in real life too.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.200
JOSH LANZET: You
steal people's hearts.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.320
SOFIA PERNAS: Don't
leave your things out.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.017
I steal hearts.

00:32:35.017 --> 00:32:36.100
JOSH LANZET: There you go.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:36.770
SOFIA PERNAS: That's what I do.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:37.270
Aw.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.690
JOSH LANZET: Did you--

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.240
did you do any specific
training or preparation

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.940
to play, like a thief?

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.580
SOFIA PERNAS: I stole Matt's
sunglasses at the audition.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.200
That was how I got the role.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:48.890
No, I'm kidding.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:49.770
I'm totally joking.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:50.450
No.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.520
I have not practiced
any of those things.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.862
Just guns.

00:32:53.862 --> 00:32:54.820
JOSH LANZET: Just guns.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.935
Exclusively guns.

00:32:55.935 --> 00:32:56.960
MATT BARR: Hey, Sofia.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.860
This is actually an
intervention for you.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.460
This is all just a--

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.340
it's OK.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.295
Let it out.

00:33:02.295 --> 00:33:03.670
SOFIA PERNAS:
Speaking of things,

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.440
there is no bowler
hat scene in Season 1.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.160
There should be.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.710
I mean, come on.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.467
Season 2.

00:33:09.467 --> 00:33:12.050
JOSH LANZET: I mean, one of my
favorite scenes from any movie.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.400
The bowler hat scene.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.190
Incredible.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.200
Absolutely incredible.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.280
I have more
questions, but I also

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.200
want to make sure that
we get to the audience.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.290
Does anyone in the audience
have any questions?

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.570
We do have one over here.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.208
We're bringing a mic to you.

00:33:25.208 --> 00:33:26.250
SPEAKER 6: This is a mic?

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.042
SOFIA PERNAS: Yeah.

00:33:27.042 --> 00:33:29.960
STEVEN SCAIA: It is a
cartoonishly large mic, yes.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.030
SPEAKER 6: OK, here we go.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.170
So you know, it
looks really cool.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:39.650
It seems like it's very like a
comedy, action, drama, romance,

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.860
Chinese restaurant
resort and everything.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.310
I wonder, will you folks be
doing some sort of like, more

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.620
comedy on putting the action
adventure troops on its head,

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.120
you know?

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.970
Like the whole storm
troopers always failing

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.740
to actually hit their targets?

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:59.300
Or having some comedy part of
that of the usual adventure

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.400
troupes of Indiana Jones and
all these movies that you are--

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:02.930
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah
I mean, I think

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.972
because like we were
saying, the show takes place

00:34:04.972 --> 00:34:08.989
in a world where we
literally reference Indiana

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:10.850
Jones, "Predator,"
"Die Hard," like,

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.630
all those movies that you'd
love if you loved the show.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.190
And so it gives
you a chance to be

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.023
able to not just
take those moments

00:34:19.023 --> 00:34:20.190
and turn them on their head.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.860
But actually
acknowledge the moment

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.960
when you're doing something
from one of those movies.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.929
Two characters can look
at be like, oh my god.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.570
We're totally doing this
thing from that thing.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.280
It's like, oh my god.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.960
This is awesome.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.380
And I think it is really fun
because it feels like people

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.969
I'd want to hang out with.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.552
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
Yeah I think for us,

00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:39.290
the trick is like, if it ever
becomes so meta that it's goofy

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.112
and that it's like you're not
watching the show anymore.

00:34:42.112 --> 00:34:44.570
You're watching us all making
a show, you know what I mean?

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.310
Like, then we don't
want to go that far.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.820
But we want to go far
enough where if literally

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.230
you were in this
situation, wouldn't you

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.480
bring up "Die Hard" right now?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.320
Like, wouldn't-- you
know what I mean?

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.159
It's like we all--

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.280
because it's partially a
show about culture and things

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.818
like that as art
and antiquities are.

00:35:00.818 --> 00:35:02.360
And pop culture is
a part of culture.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.568
So it's like, it's the way
we all talk to each other.

00:35:04.568 --> 00:35:06.080
And their characters--

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.068
Lexi like, doesn't know
any of his references.

00:35:10.068 --> 00:35:11.610
Because she grew up
around the world.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.117
She wasn't, you know, so
it's like, the pop culture

00:35:14.117 --> 00:35:16.700
references in the show actually
serve another purpose of like,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.800
being able to talk about
culture in a different way

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.925
and all that kind of stuff.

00:35:19.925 --> 00:35:22.700
So I think when we're
deconstructing the genre,

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.230
we're deconstructing
it like modernize it,

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.197
but we're not deconstructing
it so far that it

00:35:27.197 --> 00:35:28.280
feels like it falls apart.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.300
SPEAKER 6: I do follow before.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.450
So now concerning talking
that you folks are--

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.250
you mentioned about, oh we
want to use, like, you know,

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.510
right now, sort of ISIS
as a model of they're

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.640
dealing with art, and you
know, before the Nazis.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.480
There's no Nazis anymore.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.750
Do we plan to then
maybe for other seasons

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.290
use other sort of like, the
narcos in Latin America?

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.690
Or warlords in Africa?

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:55.040
And like, making it a
little more diverse,

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.727
and less just, you
know, Islam, bad.

00:35:57.727 --> 00:35:58.560
And stuff like that.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.185
STEVEN SCAIA: That's exactly how
we think about the show, which

00:36:01.185 --> 00:36:02.995
is in success, were we
did do more seasons,

00:36:02.995 --> 00:36:05.120
we would pick a different
part of the world with it

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.250
maybe a different treasure,
different bad guys.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.120
And they would want
a different thing.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.830
But I think that like any good
summer novel or blockbuster

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:14.690
in the franchise
of it, we want you

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:19.610
to be able to look at the visual
and know, oh this is a Season 2

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.660
episode.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.070
This is a Season 3 episode.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.100
Because of where they
are in the world.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.886
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
And we also the--

00:36:25.886 --> 00:36:28.280
when we pitched the show, we
were talking about how like,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.480
in real life, there's guys with
AK-47s in parts of the world

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.400
like, you know, the
ancient city of Palmyra

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.932
was blown up by ISIS.

00:36:35.932 --> 00:36:38.140
So those guys that went in
there, they killed people.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.530
They cut stuff out.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.785
They put it on a truck.

00:36:40.785 --> 00:36:42.410
Then they blow up
the rest of the stuff

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.408
that they can't
move for PR value.

00:36:44.408 --> 00:36:45.200
They're like, look.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.880
We're the guys who
did this thing.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.008
Then all that stuff goes into
like a free port somewhere.

00:36:50.008 --> 00:36:51.800
So we have a free port
in our first episode

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.100
because we're like, we are
kind of paralleling real world

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.600
stuff.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.628
We're just making it awesome.

00:36:57.628 --> 00:36:59.670
But and trying to not be
completely [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.480
But it is actually the
path that this stuff takes,

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.700
which is, it will go to a
free port, which is a, like a,

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.600
you know, somewhere in
Geneva or something.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.962
It's a place where the stuff
comes in, it's not taxed.

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:12.420
No one actually
knows what's there.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.000
There's literally like,
billions and billions

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.460
of dollars of art--

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.980
STEVEN SCAIA: It's a
Swiss bank for stuff.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.897
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Yes.

00:37:16.897 --> 00:37:19.370
And then that stuff
will come out like,

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.370
10 years from now
when the heat is off.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.980
And it will end up on the walls
of a very wealthy person's

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.510
house or in a museum.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.060
And you know, so it's
like, there's not just

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.437
like one bad guy in that story.

00:37:30.437 --> 00:37:31.520
There's a lot of bad guys.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.280
Because if someone wasn't
paying for that stuff, then ISIS

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.190
wouldn't be using it
to fund killing people.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.830
And so, wherever we
are in the world,

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.450
or whatever the
season is, it's always

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:45.092
this like intersection of people
doing really bad things-- they

00:37:45.092 --> 00:37:47.300
could be criminal networks,
they could be terrorists.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.840
And then how that ends up in
places of wealth and privilege.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.940
And how like, they
completely ignore the fact

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.750
that the other end of this,
there's a lot of bodies there.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.660
And then our people are
following that trail.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.080
So we're in dangerous places.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.163
But we're also in tuxedos.

00:37:59.163 --> 00:38:00.955
STEVEN SCAIA: And also
we embrace that too,

00:38:00.955 --> 00:38:02.840
where not every rich
person is a good person.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.258
Not every mobster
is a bad person.

00:38:04.258 --> 00:38:06.050
And that's part of the
fun of the show too,

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.670
of like, as we build
out the treasure

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.980
squad as the season
goes on, it's

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.980
unlikely friends and foes
you wouldn't necessarily

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.447
see coming.

00:38:14.447 --> 00:38:16.780
JOSH LANZET: I think there's
another question over here.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.630
SPEAKER 7: Yeah, I have
a question for Matt.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.320
Is there ever tension between
how you want to write the show,

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.360
or what you want to write
about, and like what

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.573
isn't necessary to promote
a good blockbuster TV show?

00:38:30.573 --> 00:38:31.990
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
I wouldn't say--

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.610
because I think we both have
pretty, pretty broadcast

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.140
sensibilities.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.630
I think the biggest
tension between us

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.290
is generally a, like once
we figure out, OK, this

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.360
is the story we're
telling, it becomes just

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.580
about knowing what is possible.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.540
Because I'm not where he is.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.980
And so, I might think,
like, OK, well we

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.980
can do this whole thing.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.900
And then he's
like, yeah we don't

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.098
have that location anymore.

00:38:57.098 --> 00:38:57.890
We lost this thing.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:58.807
We have to-- you know?

00:38:58.807 --> 00:39:00.860
And then, so sometimes,
he wants to cut a scene.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.620
And I'm like, that
scene is important

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.060
for the entire season.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.570
We can't cut that scene.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:08.230
But where will you be near,
and we can rewrite the scene

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.300
to fit the place
you're going to be at?

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.310
So our issue is
more generally like

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.210
where the writing
meets the production.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.240
But in terms of
vision of the show,

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.720
we're pretty much like--
you know, if he is on set

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.555
and somebody is doing something,

00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:23.680
I'm sure there's moments
where he has a thought of,

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.725
Matt would not like if
you said that that way.

00:39:25.725 --> 00:39:28.100
And I will be in the room and
someone will pitch a thing.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.960
And I'm like, I'm
fine with this story.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.130
But right now, I am
having like, some

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.770
referred rage from another
place that's entering my body.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.780
And I think it's like,
Steve is perceiving

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.405
that this story is boring.

00:39:39.405 --> 00:39:41.670
And so we now need
to do something to,

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.270
like, you know,
juice this thing.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.412
Because you know--

00:39:44.412 --> 00:39:46.120
STEVEN SCAIA: It's a
good-- it's a good--

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.440
because we've known
each other for so long

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.790
and have worked
together for so long,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.127
we are a good check and balance
against us too, of like,

00:39:51.127 --> 00:39:52.460
we like a lot of the same stuff.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.830
But there's also stuff that
I like that he doesn't like

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:55.580
and vice versa.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.247
So it helps us be
like, as long as we're

00:39:57.247 --> 00:39:59.810
in the Venn diagram of
shit we think is awesome,

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.900
we know we're generally
in the right zone.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.900
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Right,
and like, for instance,

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.670
for pop culture references,
I am less interested in them

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.010
except insofar as
they reveal character

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.470
or they reveal like, how
these two people would

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.040
connect to each other.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.480
But if when shows do references
just so the audience is like,

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.000
oh, they're doing
that thing I know.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.292
And it's like, well, you
don't really earn that moment.

00:40:20.292 --> 00:40:21.940
But so there's times
where we have--

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.990
we have some big moments
in the show where

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.870
there is a pop culture reference
happening right at that moment.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.000
But what that moment
is about is like,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.167
these two people have now
connected with each other.

00:40:30.167 --> 00:40:32.000
And now they're speaking
the same language.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.792
And so that's where
like, sometimes they'll

00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:37.108
be a reference that I'm like,
this feels very like, in 10

00:40:37.108 --> 00:40:39.650
years, no one's going to know
what this moment means anymore.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.370
Because it's totally
dependent on a reference

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.300
to understand why
we're seeing it.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.200
And so I'm like, it needs to
work on its own inherently.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.790
And then, on top
of that, it can now

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:51.040
be awesome because someone's
like, oh, from that movie

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.452
I love.

00:40:52.452 --> 00:40:53.910
JOSH LANZET: Were
there-- oh, we've

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.993
got another one over here.

00:40:54.993 --> 00:40:56.202
SPEAKER 8: Hi.

00:40:56.202 --> 00:40:58.160
So you were talking about
how people don't make

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.130
treasure hunter shows anymore.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:00.825
Other than this.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:02.450
And I think part of
the reason for that

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.220
is that they're very
steeped in this kind

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.803
of like, pre
colonialist, like we just

00:41:05.803 --> 00:41:08.300
go and take stuff and
put it in our museums.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.340
And similarly--
and on top of that

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.650
now, we have the
whole ISIS aspect.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.207
And shows which have--

00:41:14.207 --> 00:41:16.040
shows which mention
ISIS tend to make people

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.360
look like who look like me
into terrorists or victims.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.840
So the question is, do you
spend a lot of time thinking

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.520
about how to subvert
those expectations?

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.515
Cause, I mean, literally
everything does this.

00:41:28.515 --> 00:41:29.390
So I'm wondering if--

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.350
STEVEN SCAIA: Yeah
I mean, that's

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.200
absolutely a big part of how we
thought about the show, which

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.510
is, when we go to places
around the world--

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.820
like there's an episode that
takes place in Casablanca.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.380
And the cops are good cops.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.910
And they're trying to
help us solve a problem.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.690
It's not that it's white
people going to a place

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:45.903
and saving them.

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:48.320
It's everybody working together
because we believe in sort

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.080
of the global family of it all.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.000
Where there are lots of people
from all over the world.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.830
Some people are good,
some people are bad.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:57.470
It's not even about
governments necessarily.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:58.460
It's about individuals.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.010
And so I think, even just like,
looking at the two of them

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.290
and seeing how
different they could be.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.140
But they work together
and they're a great team.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.610
And that's the core of the show.

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.070
And I think that spills out
for the rest of the show too.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.610
Where we don't just have all
the white people are good

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.360
and all the not
white people are bad.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.360
There are good and bad
people all across the world

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.530
at every step of the way.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:23.000
And so we moved very consciously
away from our bad guy

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.700
being an evil terrorist,
but more-- and also

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.190
try to make Oded Fehr
not be handsome dude

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.940
with amazing hair.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.070
SOFIA PERNAS: And Lexi's
character is Egyptian.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.450
She was raised Muslim.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.920
And we say that in the show.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.180
I'm actually Muslim.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.280
And so it was an
interesting convergence

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.910
of characters and real life.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:44.343
But yeah, and so the bad guy
of our show killed my father.

00:42:44.343 --> 00:42:46.010
I'm not giving anything
away, because we

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.010
say this in the trailer.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.110
Just saying.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.690
But so it's sort of
like, there's no like,

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.760
the bad guy is the Muslim.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.985
And that's the narrative that we
are going on for seven seasons.

00:42:56.985 --> 00:42:58.610
It's not-- that's
not what this at all.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.110
STEVEN SCAIA: And that thought
started in the writers room

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.900
where we had a diverse set of
writers from all over the world

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.530
as well.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.960
Because we wanted to have
that unique perspective that

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.507
isn't two guys who,
you know, live in LA.

00:43:09.507 --> 00:43:11.090
MATTHEW FEDERMAN:
Well the story Steve

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.882
was telling earlier
about the refugee camp,

00:43:12.882 --> 00:43:16.520
it came from two of our
writers were born in Iran

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.830
and then fled in the
revolution and were refugees

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.790
at a certain point.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:23.180
And they had pitched a
story, a Casablanca story,

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.520
which to me, was like the
perfect merging of the pop

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.880
culture and the show,
which was, you know,

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.400
he was like, I don't know if
you guys think of it this way.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.260
But to us, Casablanca
is a refugee story.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.533
And I was like, it's funny.

00:43:35.533 --> 00:43:36.950
I've never thought
of it that way.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.947
I've only thought of it
as like, a love story

00:43:38.947 --> 00:43:40.280
or I've thought about the Nazis.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.990
But they had a very
particular view of it.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.790
And so they wanted to do this
story where our treasure hunt

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.320
intersects with Casablanca.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.870
And a lot of the
Casablanca-ness of that movie

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.872
is pervading the episode.

00:43:54.872 --> 00:43:57.080
You know, organically
throughout the story is saying,

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.120
but also, they wanted
to go to a refugee camp

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.570
and they wanted to have
our characters have

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.440
to like, basically take
refuge because the cops are

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:05.940
after them.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.140
It's a whole thing.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.200
But the point is
that, we really wanted

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.520
to tell that story because
especially for, you know,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.390
a CBS audience,
which is probably

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.360
like the most unlikely
audience to watch--

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.080
or a lot of the things that you
would say are issues, maybe,

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.330
you know, it's a place where
you've seen those issues.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.810
And we thought, well it
would be great to have

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:30.320
our characters go there and
really humanize that situation.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.400
And then, because it's our show
and it's a fun roller coaster,

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.582
we set it on a beach so it
kind of looks attractive.

00:44:36.582 --> 00:44:38.540
But like, the issues that
they're talking about

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.520
are like, they don't
have enough money.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.945
You know, but they take
these strangers in,

00:44:41.945 --> 00:44:42.590
cause they're like, listen.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.450
This is a place for people
that don't have a home.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.040
And we're going to
take you in tonight

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.360
and we're going to protect you.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.790
STEVEN SCAIA: And another
big part of the show

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.198
is, it's about culture identity.

00:44:51.198 --> 00:44:53.240
So when you go-- we go to
someplace in the world,

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.810
we want to learn
about that place.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.960
And so there is the
moment in the trailer

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.130
where the pyramid blows up.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.770
And you could look at that
purely from like the Roland

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:03.710
Emmerich spectacle of it all
where this thing happens,

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.570
and, oh, isn't
that cool visually?

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.970
But for us, it actually
ripples throughout the show.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.642
Because it is about the
culture identity of this symbol

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:12.350
for these people.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.570
And we had a lot of long
conversations about it.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.380
We didn't just blow it
up to be controversial.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.970
We blew it up because we wanted
that to be a thing that people

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:23.390
could keep coming back to
throughout the show of, no.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.370
That is what
happens when someone

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.490
who does not respect the culture
of places does this thing.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.760
And it was a great way to get
people who wouldn't necessarily

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.770
want to help us on our
adventure behind us

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.360
because you could just say, hey.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.860
You know that thing
at the pyramids?

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.840
That guy we're looking
for, he did that,

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.940
and he is doing this to
your culture right now.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.357
And we all need to work together
because he took something

00:45:43.357 --> 00:45:44.142
from all of us.

00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:47.840
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Yeah, so we
were like, basing it on Palmyra

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.460
and the Buddhist statues that
were blown up by ISIS and stuff

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:50.960
like that.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.480
Like, when we were thinking
about who is this guy?

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.238
What is he doing?

00:45:54.238 --> 00:45:55.030
Why is he doing it?

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:56.613
We're trying to use
real world analogs

00:45:56.613 --> 00:45:57.920
to everything that's happening.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.643
And, you know, when that's--

00:45:59.643 --> 00:46:01.310
and then, interestingly,
we were talking

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.747
about how when the Notre
Dame fire happened,

00:46:03.747 --> 00:46:06.080
and like around the world,
there was a sense of mourning

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.820
of like, this thing
has been there like,

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.590
longer than our country.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.018
And you know, I
mean, it's a thing

00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:12.560
that you think of
as being permanent.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.610
STEVEN SCAIA: It's
not just the church.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:13.880
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Right.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.600
It's not just a church.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.770
And it means things
to people that

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.210
aren't even of that religion.

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.100
It has a greater
meaning than that.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.650
And how the world can come
together in moments like that.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.500
And so we wanted to have
that represented in the show.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.350
And then also, when Lexi's
character is after revenge,

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:34.100
and Danny's after some
form of redemption.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.680
But in the end, there's
also this thing of like,

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.840
if we do this right,
we can kind of

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.430
bring these people
back together again

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.200
and start a process of healing.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.910
Because we have found
this cultural treasure

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.410
that's been missing
all these years.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.970
And we can bring it
back to the people.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.512
So the first part
of your question of

00:46:49.512 --> 00:46:52.920
like, taking things
from that region.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.040
Like, the classic
line of our genre

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.840
is, that belongs in a museum.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:01.010
And so it's interesting to make
the show in, at the time, 2016,

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.710
where it was like, actually,
that's not the right statement

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:04.210
anymore.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.747
Like we've moved on from--

00:47:06.747 --> 00:47:09.080
we don't actually think that's
the right answer anymore.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.560
And if you go to
places like Greece

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.895
where so much of the stuff
was taken out of there.

00:47:15.895 --> 00:47:17.270
And now they have
a museum that's

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.595
at the base of the Parthenon?

00:47:19.595 --> 00:47:20.360
Parthenon, right?

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:20.930
Yeah.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.720
And they have all of these
blank spots on the walls where--

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.860
and they have written in, this
is what's supposed to be here.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.792
It's in this museum in America.

00:47:29.792 --> 00:47:31.250
This is what's
supposed to be here.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.542
It's in this museum in Germany.

00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:34.700
This is what-- and like,
and what they basically

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.530
said to the world
is, you guys said

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.270
that we couldn't take
care of our stuff.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.640
Now we've built this
really nice museum.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.500
Why are you not giving
us our stuff back?

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.220
We built it so it
should be in its home.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.970
And it's a refrain you hear
several times in the season

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.248
is, that belongs
back in its home.

00:47:53.248 --> 00:47:55.290
We don't talk about it
being in a museum anymore.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.010
We talk about going back to the
people, you know, of the place

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:59.380
where it was taken.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.630
JOSH LANZET: So I know that
we're running out of time.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.463
So I just want to ask
you one final question

00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:05.870
before we let you guys go.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.078
Looking forward from--

00:48:07.078 --> 00:48:08.870
I would love to hear
from each of you, what

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:10.287
are you most excited
for everybody

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:12.612
to see in Season 1 of
"Blood and Treasure?"

00:48:12.612 --> 00:48:13.820
Without giving too much away.

00:48:16.448 --> 00:48:17.990
SOFIA PERNAS: I'm
most excited to see

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:21.110
how, the sort of pages
they take from each other's

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:22.450
books, Lexi and Danny.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:25.850
About how they, you know, in
a lot of these two handers

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:29.090
in these network shows,
you have two people that

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:31.190
are working together that
are living side by side

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:32.060
and learning from each other.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.268
But they never really learn
anything from each other.

00:48:34.268 --> 00:48:37.430
They just remain stubbornly
and rigidly themselves,

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.398
which is not real life.

00:48:38.398 --> 00:48:40.190
I mean, how many times
do your best friends

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:43.370
that you'll start to adopt
certain mannerisms that they do

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:47.340
or certain ways that they laugh
or shrug or move their body?

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.880
And I think that's what
I'm most excited about.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.918
What Lexi learns from
Danny and vice versa.

00:48:52.918 --> 00:48:54.710
MATT BARR: Sort of like
commenting on that,

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:58.160
saying that, what I really
love most about the script

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.100
was the dynamic between these
two and that kind of push pull.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:04.880
It's so fun as an
audience to watch that.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.620
And it has to be written right.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.300
And these guys really
did it, you know?

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:12.170
And I think, rather, just the
movies and shows that I grew up

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:14.930
on that really did that
most effectively to me

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:18.725
were, well they were
hits, but they also,

00:49:18.725 --> 00:49:21.690
you know, they're the
things that stick with me.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.410
And I think that they threaded
that needle really well.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:28.230
With these two guys from
different worlds and yet

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:31.620
somehow they, you know, they
exist in the same space.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.863
And I'll be damned if they
don't, you know, work.

00:49:35.863 --> 00:49:38.030
MATTHEW FEDERMAN: Yeah I
mean, I love those answers.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:40.550
And I feel like
adding to that, I

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:44.608
think this 13 episodes
tells a whole story.

00:49:44.608 --> 00:49:46.150
And so we're not
asking any questions

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.868
that we're not going to
answer within the 13 episodes.

00:49:48.868 --> 00:49:50.660
And then, hopefully
we'll have more stories

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.790
to tell in the future with these
same characters going forward.

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:57.520
So to me, I think the way I
want people to go on the journey

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.270
and then see the way
it all comes together

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.490
and see how like, every
line mattered and everything

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:02.480
that was going on.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.647
It was all part of one big
story that we're telling.

00:50:04.647 --> 00:50:07.130
So at the end of
the 13, it hopefully

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:08.930
as a big emotional
impact of like,

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.635
oh this wasn't just a show
about like people running

00:50:11.635 --> 00:50:13.010
around the world
punching people.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.760
There was a lot more going on
there than what it looked like.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.260
STEVEN SCAIA: And
I think for me, it

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.760
is just being excited to share
the adventure that we all

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.840
went on together.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.590
From the very beginning when
we were in rooms pitching this

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.440
to people, but to us standing
in the middle of nowhere

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.070
and Tangier or Morocco
or that day in Venice.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:34.520
And to be able to share the
amazing adventure that we

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.350
had where we became friends.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:37.460
And now family.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.720
And wanting to share
that with everybody else,

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.200
because the show's a lot of fun.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.042
But it's also
optimistic, and the kind

00:50:43.042 --> 00:50:44.750
of thing you could
all-- the whole family

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:45.792
could sit down and watch.

00:50:45.792 --> 00:50:48.050
And I think I've been missing
that on TV for a while.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.180
And I'm excited for people
to be able to see it.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:50.810
JOSH LANZET: That's awesome.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.185
Well guys, give a round of
applause for Matthew Federman,

00:50:53.185 --> 00:50:55.100
Sofia Pernas, Matt
Barr, Stephen Scaia.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.600
Thank you guys so much.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.830
And thank you.

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.180
[APPLAUSE]
