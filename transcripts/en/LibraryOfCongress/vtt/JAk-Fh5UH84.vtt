&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.220
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper:
Tonight, we are happy again

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.430
to feature the literary
organization Kundiman.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.480
The organization founded in 2004
is dedicated to the creation,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.600
cultivation, and promotion
of Asian American literature.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.620
For more on the organization
you can visit www.kundiman.org.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.250
And, now, I'm going
to get off the stage

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.950
and welcome Kundiman fellow
Gowri K. to tell us more

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.600
about the featured readers
and the setup of this program.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.400
Thank you.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.130
[ Applause ]

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.950
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Good
evening, everyone.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.480
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.940
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Thank you, Rob,
and to the Library of Congress,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.950
to the Smithsonian APA Center,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.970
and Lawrence Minbui Davis
[assumed spelling], and,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.690
of course, to Kundiman for
inviting me to participate

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.540
in this program tonight.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.070
I feel honored and privileged

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.400
to introduce tonight's featured
writers, and also converse

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880
with them afterwards
about their craft.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.890
And after we have a short
discussion, we'll open it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.980
up to the audience for audience
Q and A. So, feel free to come

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.770
up with some questions
as the night goes

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.000
on to pose to our writers.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200
We'll start off hearing
the work of R. O. Kwon,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.680
and later we will have a
reading by Hieu Minh Nguyen.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.020
R. O. Kwon was born in South
Korea and has lived most

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.220
of her life in the
United States.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.110
She is a national endowment
for the arts literature fellow,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.360
and her writing has appeared
in the Guardian, Time, Vice,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.460
Buzzfeed, Noon, Electric
Literature,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.920
Asian American Literary
Review, and elsewhere.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.770
She has received numerous
awards, including those

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.160
from Yaddo, MacDowell, the
Bread Loaf Writers' Conference,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.190
the Steinbeck Center, and the
Norman Mailer Writers' Colony.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.450
Kwon's first novel, The
Incendiaries, was published

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.430
in July of this year
by Riverhead.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.450
The New York Times Book
Review said of her novel,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.410
The Incendiaries is
about extremism, yes,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.810
but it's for anyone who's ever
been captivated by another,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.410
for anyone who has been on
either side of a relationship

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.330
that clearly has a subject
and object of obsession,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.030
for anyone who's had
a brush with faith

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.600
or who's been fully bathed in
its teachings, for anyone afraid

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.900
of his or her own power.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.510
Please welcome R. O. Kwon.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.490
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: Hi, hello.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.220
Hi. I'm so glad and
excited to be here.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.790
Thank you for coming, and thank
you to Library of Congress,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.430
and thank you to Kundiman
and thank you to Lawrence.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.280
I just -- this is so exciting.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.580
Thank you.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.280
I am going to read
from The Incendiaries.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.750
It's my first novel and it's
about a Korean-American woman,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.220
Phoebe Lin, who is pulled into
a radical group that turned

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.750
out to be a cult with
enigmatic ties to North Korea.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.300
The cult eventually bombs
five U.S. abortion clinics,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.680
healthcare clinics,
in the name of faith.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.920
And when several bystanders
die, she disappears.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.590
So, I worked on this
novel for 10 years,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.170
which means I've had -- I've had
a lot of time to attend a lot

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.860
of parties, and dinner
parties, and thanksgivings,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.900
and family gatherings at which
people ask what I'm doing,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.200
what do I do?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.500
And I say I write.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.650
I'm working on a novel, and
they'd ask what it's about.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.430
So, I would tell them pretty
much just what I told you right

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.400
now, and by far the most
common follow-up question,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.290
including from family
members, has been,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.580
is your novel autobiographical
[laughter], which I found

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.420
to be incredibly confusing
and funny and hard to answer.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.520
Because I think they're
all asking

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.520
if I'm a domestic terrorist
or if I've been involved

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.870
in a violent cult, or if
I've blown up buildings.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.410
A friend was just like,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.270
you should just start saying
I'm no longer at liberty to talk

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.170
about this, but [laughter],
I haven't tried that yet.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.470
I haven't tried that yet.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.770
We'll see.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.210
So, short answer,
no, I have it blown

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.200
up any buildings, not just yet.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.530
But, there is a longer possible
answer about what obsessions

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.830
and losses led to this book.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.190
So, I thought I'd touch briefly

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.400
on those before reading
a little from it.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.520
The novel does draw
on my own background,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.660
as a formerly zealous
evangelical Christian,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.180
until I was 17 and
stopped believing.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.950
My entire life plan was
to become a preacher

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.950
or a missionary or maybe a
religious recluse in a cave.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.520
I don't know, I hadn't really
thought out the details,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.750
but I was excited about it.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.710
I've long since left
the faith behind,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.160
but I do often still find
the loss of it to be fresh,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.940
as though it happened
maybe a few days ago.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.070
And, perhaps as a result
of how different I am

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.640
from the God crazed girl
I once was, I'm fascinated

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.980
by the variety in
people's definitions

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.460
of good and of right.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.230
In The Incendiaries, I was drawn
to bridging imaginative chasms

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.490
between rational and
fanatic worldviews.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.620
And, in addition, I have distant
family members I've never met,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.710
who live or lived, for all
I know, in North Korea,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.130
and who I'll probably
never meet.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.510
For a while, to try to fill that
hole in knowledge, that longing,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.350
I kept reading accounts
of North Korea.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.500
And, of course, what little
information that makes it out is

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.490
so incomplete, and
eventually I became interested

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.980
in exploring this gap itself.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.880
But, in writing about
North Korea, I very much --

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.630
I didn't want to make any claims

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.580
about a place I've never
been able to visit,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.740
and that so few people ever see.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.870
Instead, even as I gave
a North Korean pass

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.740
to the novel's cult leader, John
Leal, I hoped to explore some

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.410
of the vast gaps in knowledge
and to dwell imaginatively

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.380
in that place of unknowing.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.970
The book alternates between
three points of view,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.260
that of Phoebe Lin, the woman
who falls into the cult,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.140
John Leal, the cult leader, and
Will Kendall, who loves Phoebe

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.630
and opposes the cult to
much of what it represents.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.190
I'll read a section from
each of their points of view

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.490
from the start of the book.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.950
One, Will.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.370
They'd have gathered on
a rooftop in Noxhurst

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.810
to watch the explosion.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.990
Platt Hall, I think,
11 floors up.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.500
I know his ego, and he'd
have picked the tallest point

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.370
he could.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.760
So often, I've imagined
how they felt, waiting.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.360
With six minutes
left, the slant light

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.380
of dusk reddened the high
old spires of the college,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.540
the level gables of
its surrounding town.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.420
They poured festive wine
into big-bellied glasses.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.120
Hands shaking, they laughed.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.260
She would sit apart from this
reveling group, cross-legged

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.410
on the roof's west ledge.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.180
Three minutes to go, two, one.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.120
The Phipps building fell.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.020
Smoke plumed the breath of God.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.610
Silence followed, then the
group's shouts of triumph.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.340
Wine glasses clashed together,
flashing martial light.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.490
He sang the first
bars of a Jejah psalm,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.790
others soon joined in.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.040
Carillon bells chimed, distant
birds blowing white, strewn,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.090
like dandelion tufts,
an outsize wish.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.190
It must have been then that
John Leal came to her side.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.780
In his bare feet, he closed
his arm around her shoulders.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.020
She flinched, looking up at him.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.000
I can imagine how he'd
have tightened his hold,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.650
telling her she'd done
well, though before long,

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.410
it would be time to act
again, to do a little more.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.910
But, this is where I start
having trouble, Phoebe.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.280
Buildings fell.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.860
People died.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.740
You once told me I hadn't
even tried to understand.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.520
So, here I am, trying.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.400
Two, John Leal.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.600
Once John Leal left Noxhurst,
halfway through his last term

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.000
of college, he drifted until
he ended up in Yanji, China.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.460
In this city, adjacent to
North Korea, he began working

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.760
with an activist group

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.070
that smuggled Korean refugees
toward asylum in Seoul.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.070
He'd found his life's
work, he thought.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.060
Instead, he was kidnapped
by North Korean agents,

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.710
spirited across the border,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.330
and thrown into a prison
camp outside of Pyongyang.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.530
In the stories he
later told the group,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.160
he said the gulag
brutalities were bad enough,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.790
but at least they'd
been expected.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.770
What astonished him was the
allegiance his fellow inmates

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.270
showed toward the lunatic despot
whose policies had installed

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.140
them in their cells.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.680
They'd been jailed because, oh,
they'd splashed a drop of tea

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.160
on his newsprint portrait.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.020
A neighbor claimed to have
overheard them whistling a South

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.930
Korean pop song.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.930
Punished for absurdities,
they still maintained

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.640
that the beloved sovereign,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.210
a divine being, couldn't
be to blame.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.590
At first, he assumed
this was lip service,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.850
the prisoners afraid
to say otherwise.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.200
But then, he thought of the
refugees he'd met in Yanji,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.520
how they talked of loving
the god they'd fled.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.710
They attributed the
regime's troubles to anyone

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.250
but the sole person in charge.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.620
A month into John
Leal's time in the gulag,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.190
prison guards held an
optional foot race,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.690
the prize a framed
icon of the despot.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.440
In the confusion, those
who fell were trampled.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.210
One child died of
a broken spine.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:51.390
Through howls of pain, he
shouted hosannahs for his lord.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.660
They weren't lying,
the poor fools.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.810
They believed in the man as one
might believe in Jesus Christ.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.570
Some people needed leading.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.940
In or out of the gulag,
they craved faith.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.550
But think if the tyrant
had been as upright

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.080
as his disciples
trusted him to be.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.300
The heights he'd have
achieved, if he loved them, if,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.070
John Leal thought,
until his idea began.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.840
Three, Phoebe.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.100
I hoped I'd be a piano
genius, Phoebe told the group,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.360
in the first Jejah
confession she tried giving.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.990
But I didn't just
wait, she said.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.330
I expected, no, I
wanted to work for it.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.340
I spilled time into the piano
as I'd have put cash in a bank.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.350
I saw full concert
halls in the future,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.150
solo recitals, front-page
plaudits.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.640
I practiced Liszt while
imagined spotlights gilded the

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.420
living room.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.130
Recollection is half
invention, but it feels

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.550
as though I spent my
entire childhood training

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.900
to prove I was the significant
pianist I believed I'd be.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.980
So, I piled up trophies.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.460
It wasn't enough.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.860
The teacher flicked my hands

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.430
with a rod each time I
didn't hit the right note,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.730
but I didn't mind.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.290
My ambition outstripped his.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.840
Let my hands swell.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.260
I could use the extra span.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.090
Bright-knuckled, I tried again.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.300
The months ticked
past, then years.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.800
I kept lists of rivals.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.080
I indexed others'
exploits by age.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.900
Kiehl, at five, had
given his first recital

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.660
to the Danish king.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.830
Ohri, 11, debuted at
Carnegie Hall; Liu, 15.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.290
One night, my teacher called
Libich's Etude Number Five the

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.610
most challenging piece
a soloist might attempt.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.290
It's eluded the finest
pianists, he said.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.180
I rushed to find
the Etude score.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.800
I learned it alone, in secret.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.850
I memorized Libich's
high trills.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.770
I flailed through
wild ostinatos.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:03.170
Once, at the table, my mother
asked what I was smiling about.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.590
Haejin, she said.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.740
I blinked, Libich
vibrating in my head.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.430
I don't. She laughed.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.780
It's all right, she said.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.110
I ate while she peeled
a white peach.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.710
The skin dropped
in a single coil.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.420
She picked it up,
holding it to the light.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.160
Such a rich hue, she said.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.170
It flushed pink, backlit; I
nodded, then she put it down.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.560
I could tell she wished to
talk, but I was lost in trills.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.860
I pushed a last peach
slice in my mouth,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.090
and I went back to the piano.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.090
Until then, nothing I played had
evoked the orphic singing I knew

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.640
to be possible.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.040
It was an ideal I lacked
the skill to bring to life.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.630
Each first-place
prize marked a point

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.690
when I had let the music down.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.900
With Libich, I failed less.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.710
His Etude asked so much
of me that, at times,

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.620
I'd forget I had an I.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.310
I should have learned,
from this, that playing had

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.750
to be birthed in a
place without ego,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.260
in which I didn't exist except

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.790
as the living conduit,
Libich's medium.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.300
But then, when I showed the
teacher what I could do,

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.000
he was astonished.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.770
I'd achieved more than
he'd hoped, he said.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.600
He switched the piece in
for the next competition,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.100
a city-level open.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.720
I was driven to the
recital hall.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.290
The sun fell on my hands as
I practiced Libich again,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.310
fingers dancing across my legs.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.210
Spotlit, I listened to
the traffic sing my name.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.510
The lax blue of L.A.,

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.730
heat-rippled, veiled
the horizon.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.130
Like curtains, I
thought, poised to rise.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.930
Thank you.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:53.050
[ Applause ]

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.390
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Thank
you [inaudible].

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.700
Next, we'll hear from
Hieu Minh Nguyen,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.820
a queer Vietnamese-American poet

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.650
and performer based
out of Minneapolis.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.450
He was the recipient of a 2017
NEA Fellowship for poetry,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.190
a Kundiman fellow, a poetry
editor for Muzzle Magazine,

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.720
and an MFA candidate at
Warren Wilson College.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.950
His work has appeared in PBS
News Hour, Poetry Magazine,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.480
Gulf Coast, Buzzfeed,
Poetry London,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.150
Indiana Review, and more.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.560
His debut collection of
poetry, This Way to the Sugar,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.000
published by Write
Bloody Publishing in 2014,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.430
was named a finalist for both
the Lambda Literary Award

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.550
and the Minnesota Book Award.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.450
And his second collection of
poetry, Not Here, was published

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.860
by Coffeehouse Press
in April of this year.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.230
This year, he was also
named one of five recipients

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.340
of the Ruth Lilly and Dorothy
Sergeant Roseburg Poetry

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.480
Fellowship Award.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.190
About Hieu's work, Ocean Vuong
has said, his work is so tight,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.310
searing, and unabashedly
sharp and full at once.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.420
His poems turn me into
a horizontal entity.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.760
Reading them, I have
to lie down [laughter].

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.570
They remind me of gravity,
how it pins me to the world

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.270
without ever touching me.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.450
Hieu's work is like
that, a kind of force,

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.330
or better yet, a
force of kindness.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.510
Please welcome Hieu Minh Nguyen.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:31.760
[ Applause ]

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.570
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen: Thank
you all so much for having me.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:40.900
Thank you to Lawrence Min
and thank you [inaudible]

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.290
for your beautiful reading.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:50.410
I am really bad at like banter,
so I'm not going to do it much.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:55.700
So, I'm not going to talk to
you all, because I hate you.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.340
See, that's what happens, right?

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.640
I just insult the audience.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:05.580
So, I prepared a little
introduction, if I can find it.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.880
Okay, there it is.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.760
First, before I talk
about anything else,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.190
let me talk about the
joys of online dating.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.370
I am an expert at
the brief, efficient,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.410
economical conversation.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.710
Usually people think I'm
joking when I asked them

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.710
about their retirement plan,
about their credit score,

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:36.960
about their potential IRS
audit risk, but I'm not.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.930
Lately, when a new suitor
asks me how I'm doing,

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.080
I respond with good, despite
the world being on fire.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.160
Here, I use the trick
of melodrama in order

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.570
to gauge the reaction of
my potential husbands.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.560
Their responses usually
fluctuate

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.570
between what are you
talking about and,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.350
yeah, I know what you mean.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.790
It's is a small trick I use
to inform myself to whether

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.970
or not the person I am talking
to has been paying attention

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.770
to the atrocities happening
in the world around us.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.600
I use fire to find a companion
in misery, though it's difficult

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.350
to be sure if the boy and I
are staring at the same fire.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.370
And, if we are, who do
we blame for the flames?

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.900
And, was there ever a time
where the world wasn't on fire?

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.540
As soon as I became
proficient in English,

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.940
my mother started asking me
to translate the morning --

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.140
the morning news to her.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.930
She wanted to participate
with the world.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.670
Some things were easy.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.420
I could explain house fires.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.970
I could explain high-speed
chases.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.890
I could even stumble my way
through political scandals.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.830
But, remember, as
a kindergartner,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.510
I had to learn how to study
the atrocities of the world

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.200
and interpret them, not only
into language, but logic.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.620
Nine 11 happened when I was 10.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.360
Columbine happened
when I was eight.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.310
Matthew Shepard was
murdered when I was seven.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.880
Even now, I can hear
my mom saying,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.720
[speaking foreign language],
who, who would do that?

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.620
Who could do that?

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.180
Why? Why would they do that?

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.030
Why would they do
that to that boy?

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:13.670
Gay? Gay? What does that mean?

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.970
Oh, okay.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.650
It's important to mention the
only time my mother speaks

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.210
in English is when I
make her speak in a poem.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.800
So she says, get out,
says, leave but it's me,

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.430
my voice, that slams the door.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.330
The only way out is through
the opening of her mouth.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.010
The only way towards
salvation is forgiveness,

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.190
the aunts would say, licking
their thumbs across my forehead.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.340
Sure, the only mask I own
is humming on my face.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.410
I want to study the
mechanics of leaving.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.420
Go. Go. Go, so I can see.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.960
Slow so I can watch
everything fade to water.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.130
I think it was Sappho who said,
I long and seek after but,

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.670
of course, that's not what
she said, not exactly.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.070
If things happen the
way they are supposed

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.800
to my mother will die before me.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.790
My mother, who, by then,
will love me will die.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.660
My mother, who, by then,
will hopefully be happy,

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.970
will walk without pain from
this life into the next, and I,

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.900
her only son, her
writer son will stay

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.740
to translate her
life into English.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.930
Any adjective can be true
if you cry hard enough.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.030
I can lie and say I
haven't written the poem,

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.970
haven't buried her over
and over at my desk,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.230
haven't described
the ash of her body.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.450
I throw a fistful of sand in
the air and pretend to weep.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.420
I write the poem.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.680
I fill my lungs with English.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.780
I number her skin with English.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.730
I English the light
she walks into.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.050
I kill her just to
raise her from the dead.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.290
I anticipate this grief by
exhausting it with music.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.730
I pry open the casket.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.270
I make her twirl in the center.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:08.730
Question. Who here hates
the word moist [laughter]?

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.600
Can I see a show of hands?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.510
Who like -- who here just like
absolutely hates that word?

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.810
All right, okay.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.390
So, I wrote a poem.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.120
It's called In Defense
of Moist [laughter].

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.200
Most moan, voice their disdain

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:34.510
for the motion their
mouth makes.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.360
The sound whining in their ears,

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.140
chalking up their hate
to just pure phonics.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.440
Moist. Moist.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.870
I just hate -- it
just sounds gross.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.760
It makes everything
sound sexual,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.940
even things that aren't
supposed to be sexual.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.240
Moist towelette.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.540
Moist sponge.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.180
Moist eviction notice.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.530
Moist hoisting oysters
to your lips,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.530
giving you no choice
but to swallow.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.260
Some have even petitioned
to have the word removed

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.150
from the dictionary
completely, but imagine a world

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.630
where you eat damp cake or
someone says -- or someone says,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.300
mmm [phonetic], these
cookies are wet.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.600
What would you do
then [laughter]?

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.400
Maybe you can't handle it.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.580
Maybe it's too precise a word.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.280
Your body swelling with
salt and it's mentioned.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.520
Maybe you sweat too much
and you're embarrassed

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.870
at how the word makes
even your mouth perspire.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.060
Maybe you hate how the
word clings, like spinach

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.690
to your teeth, and
I can't blame you.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.770
I understand what it's
like to hate something

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.340
for no good reason, other
than for the way it sounds.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.450
I know what it's like to
want to replace the words

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.820
that embarrass you, an
entire language really.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.520
In Vietnamese there's only
one word I know for mother.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.370
Only one word I know for son,
[speaking foreign language].

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:50.070
Not like swindle, but
the sound a gong makes

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.370
when muffled by water.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.340
Vietnamese demands precision.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.080
If said in the wrong tone,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.420
son could mean stay,
could mean remain.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.320
My tongue, a pend -- my
tongue a pendulum swinging

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.040
between what is here
and what isn't.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.750
When what's left of this
language gets stuck in my teeth,

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.140
the only synonyms I can
find are in English.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.120
English, a river my
mother cannot swim across,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.590
rising from each attempt
soaked in embarrassment.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.480
My tongue, a stone I
tried to skip across.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.580
My accent, a crumbling monument.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.880
[Speaking foreign language].

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.530
What will happen when there's
nothing left to replace?

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.950
What will happen when she
can no longer understand me?

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.170
Is there a word for that?

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.470
Is it in English?

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:48.200
So, there is -- so, I go

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.400
to Warren Wilson
College for my MFA.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.600
And, in the summertime, during
the residency, there is --

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.510
there is this softball
game that takes place

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:04.270
between fiction writers and
poets, right [laughter].

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:09.920
And, I want to say
like in the history,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.700
in like the 100-year history
of the program, it hasn't been

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.980
around that long, but
the poets have won may be

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.380
like two times [laughter].

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:27.280
Like, this past summer
we lost 70 to 10.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.600
But, like, I also want
to confront the idea

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.940
that like poets are
like passive and weak.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:38.080
And, so, I wrote this poem.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.010
Don't be mistaken.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.850
It wasn't too long ago when
my friends and I walked

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.280
with master locks
around our knuckles,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.730
eager to dare each
oncoming car to flinch.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.980
Listen, if I've learned
anything,

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.550
it's that every play fight
will turn into a real fight

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.010
if you touch the face.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.440
And we were ready, honey-eyed
bastards waiting for any graze

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.760
or slight breeze to
give us permission.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.000
Pacing the same mile radius,
our fists seething with mud.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.510
Don't get me wrong.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.860
I'm not saying I'm
a good fighter.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.600
I'm just saying I was never
afraid to get my ass beat

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.460
in the name of not running.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.590
We fought everywhere, in
the park, in basements,

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.050
silently in school bathrooms
so no one would break it up.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.730
For a long time there
was one rule I live by.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.210
If they jump in,
I'm jumping in, too.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.580
The last flight I
got into it was

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.090
because Jordan [assumed
spelling] called me a faggot,

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.390
his mouth.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.580
Afterwards, we laid in the
grass panting, my ears bleeding,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.070
his mouth swollen and beautiful.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.430
And sure, I left that place
and don't plan on going back.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.230
And sure, these days the friends
I have eat brunch, fly to places

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.530
like Vermont to write poems near
streams while contemplating the

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.600
lifecycles of bees.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.500
Or, cry when they think about
the majesty of elephants.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.570
But, don't be confused.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.120
They may be washed and
usually in bed before 10,

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.320
but my friends now are just like
my friends then, always ready,

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.040
a legion of faggots flushed out

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.010
and shining prepared
for anything.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.590
And sure, this can be an analogy
for the radius of our lives,

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.630
how we will all return
to where we started.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.470
Or, maybe, this is an
analogy for those headlines,

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.590
poets fight oppression
with words,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.390
going on about the strength it
takes to make art in the face

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.810
of those who'd want to
harm us, like Artemis,

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.350
and a crew who'd hunt the
men she'd turned into deer.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.770
Or, maybe, I'm just
saying it's hunted

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.070
that know best how to hunt.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.690
Or, maybe, there's an idea
here that has nothing to do

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.620
with blood, but everything to
do with the animal inside us,

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.010
a singular creature, looking
for a shape, a herd, a pack,

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.500
a pride, to beckon our
teeth from the gums.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.820
Or, maybe, I'm just saying that
my friends will kick your ass.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.610
No, not metaphorically, not
with our words, though probably,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.620
but with our rings on, like
the bees who only swarm

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.690
when provoked, or the
elephants who will rush

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.990
to the aid of their own.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.290
My friends will stomp you.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.900
And sure, that was a simile.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.480
Sure, that was a threat.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.510
That was me saying if they
jump in, I'm jumping in, too.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.500
[ Applause ]

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.660
Standing in front of a mirror,
my mother tells me she is ugly,

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.760
says the medication
is making her fat.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.230
I laugh and walk
her back to the bed.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.870
My mother tells me she is ugly

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.480
in the voice she
says -- okay, sorry.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.060
Standing in front of a mirror,
my mother tells me she is ugly,

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.000
says the medication
is making her fat.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.440
I laugh and walk
her back to bed.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.900
My mother tells me she is ugly
in the same voice she used

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.330
to say, no woman could love
you and I watch her pull

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.390
at her body and it is mine.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.690
My heavy breasts.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.990
My disappointing shape.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.020
She asks for a bowl of plain
broth and it becomes the cup

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.840
of vinegar she would
pour down my throat.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.850
Every day after school,
I would kneel before her.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:04.930
I would remove my clothes and
ask her to mark the progress.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.380
It's important that I
mention, I truly wanted

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.730
to be beautiful for her.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.840
In my dreams I am thin, and
if not thin, something better.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.520
I tell my mother she is still
beautiful and she laughs.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.660
The room fills with flies.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.690
They gather in the
shape of a small boy.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.590
They lead her back
to the mirror,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.960
but my reflection
is still there.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.270
Ode to the pubic hair
stuck in my throat.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:49.500
O diligent survivor clinging
to the edge of a chasm.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.800
Little tickle.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.390
Little wire picking open the
doors, illuminating the corners

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.080
of my body I did not know
could swell with touch.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.980
Bless touch, I guess,
its round noise.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.450
O little brown figure
coiling in the middle

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.770
of that soft pink alley.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.210
How lonely it must be
to come from desire

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.880
but end where light ends.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.160
Son of the floorless
prayer, son of the O horizon,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.740
remind me what it's
like to speak

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.730
without a white man
flickering in my throat.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.970
O small equator, making every
story a ruined portrait.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.360
Bless the fault line
beyond my reach.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.020
Little fracture in my speech.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.050
Little secret I keep
trying to cough up

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.770
but instead cause my mother

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.220
to raise her small
hands to my forehead.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.520
[Speaking foreign language].

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.320
Bless also my mother,
her perfect temperature,

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.940
her concern the only
language we have to say sorry.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.500
Bless language, its
impossible walls,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.600
its flexible agony a thin
line I keep tripping over.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.720
O little thread, undoing the
hem of my body, but wait,

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.430
bless also my body, how
it rejects the unfamiliar,

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.060
convulsing, conversing with
itself, excising, evicting,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.970
cutting down the rope
bridge, rolling the debris

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.650
into a question mark
on my tongue.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.440
I have a few more
poems to share,

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.580
and then I will run out of here.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.970
I'm going to read
a little sonnet.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.520
Maybe a bit dramatic, but I
like candles with my breakfasts,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.630
wear a white gown around
the house like a virgin.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.230
Right or wrong, forgive me.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.080
No one in this town
knows forgiveness.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.160
Miles from the limits, if
I squint there's Orion.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.890
If heaven exists, I will
be there in a minute

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:44.240
to hop the pearly gates,
a ghost felon to find him.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.120
Of blood, of mud, of
wisemen, who am I now

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.620
after all these years
without him.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.710
Boy, widow, barbarian,
tapping hornets in my big grin.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:57.050
He'll fear who I've been since.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.610
I wake up each morning from
all these strange dreams

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.010
where I'm drowning.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:07.480
As boys, your father fed us
fresh meat from the lake,

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.450
taught us to spit bones into the
fire, handed us each a knife,

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:16.250
told us to enter the woods and
return with something dead.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.760
And when we returned
with nothing

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.500
but our bodies, he
assumed he failed.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.810
But, what did he know about
death that we couldn't learn,

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.840
will learn from our hands.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.800
And because you aren't
here, won't ever, again,

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.310
be here to cover my mouth, I'll
confess, out loud, my love,

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.990
so maybe perhaps, you
will hear me and join me,

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.440
here where the sun is
sweet against the water.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.020
And because I love you,
I will gut this distance

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.720
with nostalgia, because
grief can taste of sugar

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.550
if you run your tongue
along the right edge,

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.120
so let me call your
name, or rather mouth it,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.010
like when we watched your father
strike a cleaver into the neck

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:55.070
of a hawk and fell silent, not
because of the blood but rather

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.100
for the way the hawk's
severed body took flight,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.070
leaving behind its head, a
scarlet burden in the soil.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.980
And I wish so badly, I was
brave enough then, to keep it,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.720
to tuck it beneath my tongue
for these twenty years.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.620
And because darling, before I
came alive, I watched the world

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.680
without knowing what to look
for, but I swear, it was there,

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.570
again, above the tall grass,

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:25.050
the headless hawk still
alive, still somehow flying.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:30.630
So, the last poem
I'm going to read.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.200
It's -- so, I've done like --
I've had a lot of weird jobs.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.050
I was like a pizza delivery
boy, and then also I was also,

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.220
with a bunch of my friends,
we used to dance on the corner

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:51.970
with like pizza signs, and we
had choreography and everything.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.010
And I have my friend,
Jeremy [assumed spelling],

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.190
who was my best friend
in high school.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:05.310
And, yeah, so, the next
book I'm working on is a lot

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:10.190
about the east side of St.
Paul, which is where I grew up,

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:16.330
and how it is, though it is
technically part of a city,

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.910
it feels very isolated
from the rest of the city,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.530
and oftentimes functions
as its own small town.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:29.780
And, so, I'm writing a lot
about the people I grew up with.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.460
Of all the things
I've tried to do,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.630
I was probably worst
at selling weed.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.580
Robbed weekly.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.810
Used too much of my
own product [laughter].

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.450
Cut each bag with
a dash of oregano.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.710
Sorry. But then I
have to consider

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.150
that summer Maddie
[assumed spelling] asked me

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.710
to help him boost cars.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.920
His dad called me a liability,
too paranoid to be lookout,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.470
too shaky to use a Slim Jim,

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.290
didn't even know
how to drive stick.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.590
Oh yeah, let's not forget

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.150
that time Moe [assumed
spelling] almost lost an arm

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.230
after I convinced him to pay
me 20 bucks to stitch his wound

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.740
with fishing line instead
of going to the hospital.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.250
Or, that time I almost
convinced --

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.280
I convinced Aaliyah [assumed
spelling] to let me tattoo

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.950
across on her ankle with a
safety pin and a ballpoint.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:16.250
And then there's that --

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.140
and then there's that
time I swiped [inaudible]

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.300
from Carl Maggie's [assumed
spelling] locker and tried

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.140
to set myself straight
by becoming of violinist.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.920
But, of course, the
noise complaints.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.100
The neighbors banging the
portraits off the walls.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.650
The boys talking shit, calling
me prodigy, fancy chink.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.450
And I wonder if you're
still having a good laugh.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.510
Like when they found out
I wanted to be a poet,

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:41.030
so they glued roses and
violets to the hood of my Kia.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.000
And so maybe I wanted, for the
first time, to prove them wrong,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.300
prove I didn't belong there.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:50.720
And so maybe I made new friends,
friends who wrote poems,

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.360
who sat around talking about
poems, who went to school

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.240
to study poems, and lived
in off-campus apartments

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.480
where I crashed on nights I got
too fucked up on white boy drugs

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.040
to drive back to the east side,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.270
where even without me
the [inaudible] glow

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.510
of junkers trace the block
where Mandy [assumed spelling],

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.610
three years sober, tucks
the kids into the bed,

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.150
where Lee [assumed
spelling], first in his class,

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.490
spray paints the fleet
of stolen bikes gold,

00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:13.820
where Andrew [assumed
spelling] stands

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.180
in the kitchen reading
the Bible in the dim light

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.270
from the microwave, where Nikki
[assumed spelling], years later,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.450
coming home after
a double at Champs,

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:24.290
calls to wish me
a happy birthday.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.920
And I am, of course,
too busy to answer,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.380
somewhere in a different
time zone,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:34.300
at a swanky party celebrating
a man I do not know,

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.600
who just won an award for
a book I have not read.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.670
And the woman who smells of
citrus, who's been raving

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.820
to me all night about how
much she admires my work,

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.890
excuses herself to
use the bathroom,

00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:50.430
leaving in the seat beside
me her open purse [laughter].

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:53.510
Thank you so much.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:35:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.340
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Thank you, Hieu.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.920
Reese, can I invite you back
up to the stage as well.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.220
If you'd like to give
a round of applause

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.020
for both of our authors.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:16.500
[ Applause ]

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.030
So, we'll start off with a
bit of discussion up here.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.030
And then, as I mentioned
earlier, we'll open it

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:32.150
up for audience Q and
A. so, please think

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.860
about any questions
you might have

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.250
for our two writers
this evening.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.260
It's lovely to meet
both of you today.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.560
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: Same as you.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.650
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Thank you for
coming to D.C. I'm really happy

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.890
to get to have this conversation
with you both as well.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.690
The first question I have for
you is actually a question

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.740
that I also posed to a couple
of writers back in May.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.170
It was another event
co-sponsored by Kundiman.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.330
It was at the Folger Shakespeare
Library around the corner.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.840
And that night the featured
writers were Kava Akubar

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.140
[assumed spelling] and Kazam
Ali [assumed spelling].

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.760
And I asked them this question.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.180
I would be very interested to
hear your responses as well.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.110
I initially just referred
to Bhanu Kapil's book,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.400
The Vertical Interrogation
of Strangers.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.260
Which, if you're familiar with
it, every poem takes its title

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.560
from a question, and many

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.240
of the questions repeat
themselves throughout the book.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.580
And one of many questions
she poses and returns to in

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.600
that book is the following.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.630
What are the consequences
of silence?

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.390
Now, both of you simultaneously

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.520
and intersectionally
embody various identities.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.140
And, for myself, when I
talk about identities,

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.560
I also like to substitute
terms like truths

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.040
and lived experienced,
so we don't get confused

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.770
by what we mean when
we say identities.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.070
So, based on all of that,

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:54.060
I would ask how you might
answer Bhanu Kapil's question

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:58.380
for your work, for what you may
be using your own writing for,

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.610
your own lives, for the people
you may be reaching out to

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:05.860
with your words, what are
the consequences of silence?

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.360
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen:
That's a good question.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.500
[ Laughter ]

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.500
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.550
I am going to try to even -- I'm
going to attempt to answer it.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.410
But, it is like a really --
it's -- I'm living a lot of,

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.150
there's not just
one consequence.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.160
I think there's a
lot of consequences.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.590
But, if you're talking
about like the self, right,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.530
like if you don't -- it
just means like what happens

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.870
when you don't speak
up for yourself, right?

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:52.390
How do you -- just all the
ways that you can't advocate

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.970
for yourself and what
do you allow when you --

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.340
When you don't speak up.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.730
And I think it's also like a --

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.360
I'm going to -- I'm going to
argue with myself for a second.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.230
I think it's also like what --

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.430
when I say like what
are you allowing?

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.380
It sounds like I'm
placing blame on the person

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.680
that isn't speaking up.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.120
But, like we have to
consider all the --

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.390
all the things that like
that's keeping that person

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:31.030
from not speaking up, and it's
keeping that person silent.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:35.720
So, I think -- I don't blame
people for not speaking

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.870
up sometimes, because
it's like hard.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:45.440
And it also can be -- I
think I turned it off.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.580
&gt;&gt; There it goes.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.370
You got it.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:51.670
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen: All
right, hey [laughter].

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.950
I'm not going to repeat
myself [laughter].

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.860
But, yeah, I think
that's one [inaudible].

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.040
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: That's
a great answer.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.940
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: Yeah, that's a
-- that's a gigantic question.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.240
Good question.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.540
Let's see.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.250
Maybe I -- maybe I'll answer
that just in terms of,

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.370
because people so often ask --

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.670
a question that I
get asked a lot,

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.310
I'm sure you get asked a lot,
I'm sure you get asked a lot,

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.280
is who are you writing for?

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.530
And my truthful stock answer
is that I'm writing for myself,

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:23.050
because when I write I find
it so absorbing that I can't,

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.530
I really can't think about
any sort of external audience.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.850
And, so, I go into some sort
of place where there's just me

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.040
and the language and syllables.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.590
I'm just trying to get things
down to be as good and true

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.920
as I can, and there's
no one else there.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.890
When I step back from
that, and when I think

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.060
about what that means,

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.690
I feel as though in
a lot of ways that in

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.620
and of itself is a political
act, because that means

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.200
that I'm centering myself
as a reader, and that means

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.040
that I'm centering
people like me.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.000
And the more people are like
me the more they're going

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.800
to understand some of the
references, some of the --

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.100
some of the illusions.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.630
And, so, for instance, an
example I often give is

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.470
that there's a -- Phoebe Lin,

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.210
one of the [inaudible]
Korean-American,

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.510
and her mother only
ever called [inaudible]

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.310
and she never calls her Phoebe.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.250
And some people,
multiple people asked,

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.950
do you want to explain
that in the text?

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.840
Do you want to say,
[inaudible] is a Korean name?

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.250
And I was just like, absolutely
fucking not, man [laughter].

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.520
Because any Asian-American
reader I can think

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.880
of would understand
that's her Korean name

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.040
and that's what her
family calls her,

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.320
and I shouldn't have to explain
that for anybody any more

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.160
than -- any more than people who
have ever explained to me what

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.100
on earth all those
[inaudible] terms are.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.120
And, so, I think -- I think in
terms of who is being centered

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.620
as the reader, and so
I've been asked by --

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.760
people have asked along
the way like, do you think

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.060
about white men when you write?

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.910
It's a question I've gotten.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:00.460
And, honestly, I don't
very much [laughter].

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.760
Yeah.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.130
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Thank you both for
your very thoughtful answers.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.220
And, also, the ways in which
you both bring up the politics

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.780
of [inaudible] responses
to that question

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.480
and the politics
of being able to

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:18.670
speak out and feeling even
limited amount of safety or lack

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.140
of real material, physical
violence or consequences,

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.170
and how so many people are
stepping passed that and facing

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.050
that when they do speak up.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.560
My second question I'm going
to follow is from the first,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.650
but comes at it from the
sort of opposite angle.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:40.070
And rather than asking about the
consequences of silence here,

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.090
I want to know what you
find to be the consequences

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:45.830
of actually speaking your
truth or truths, particularly

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.650
as your work gains more and
more exposure nationally,

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.040
internationally?

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.090
I think frequently, particularly
in different communities,

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.140
whether they be identity-based
communities

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.750
or social justice-oriented
communities,

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:00.270
we tend to commend artists and

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:03.450
celebrate artists for
doing the hard work

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.540
of liberating their
traumas into an artform.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.130
I always personally wonder about
the other side of that equation.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.000
And namely, what are the
consequences for that artist,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.880
whether in ways that they may
now have to relate to family,

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.040
friends, community, or other
spaces or groups of people?

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.470
So there, again,
what I would ask is,

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:26.030
what are the consequences then
when you do speak, and certainly

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.380
with a lot of the topics
and experiences that the two

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.970
of you have addressed
in your books?

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.340
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen: We were
talking about this earlier

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:42.880
in a small group discussion, I
think one of the consequences is

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.330
that people then take your
narrative and your story

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.350
as like the bee story, right?

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:54.830
Like, you're supposed
to represent everybody,

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:58.940
and that you're supposed
to -- and it's --

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.430
there's like this responsibility
to get it right, right?

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.920
Because, you know,

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.820
Asian-American literature
has only existed

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.120
for like so long, right?

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:14.710
And, so, it's not that there is
-- I'm trying [inaudible] but,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:20.140
like because there aren't that
many models out there, right,

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.780
like we are expected to be
the model, or we are expected

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:32.070
to speak for multiple people,
and we're just like speaking

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.960
about ourselves and our
own experiences, right?

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.280
Sometimes not even,
right, fiction, you know.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.580
Yeah.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.900
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: I think maybe
one way to answer that is,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.420
so pretty much since December
my writing [inaudible] in a lot

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:55.180
of ways and I've been very
involved in sort of preparing

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.680
for my book to come out, it
just came out last month,

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:05.050
and what's happened with that is
for the last eight months I wake

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:08.450
in the morning, I realize,
and every morning I'm worried

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:11.040
about who I might have
pissed off or disappointed.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.880
And it's just like I don't even
know who, like I don't know who,

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.900
like maybe someone on Twitter,
or somebody who I work with,

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.040
or just somebody out
there might be mad at me.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.590
And I've been thinking
about that.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.340
And I was talking to a friend,
who has published many books,

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.920
and he's also a writer,
he's a writer

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.710
of color, and he was just like,

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.900
I'm afraid about that all
the time, too, and, you know,

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.270
I've been doing this for years.

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:37.980
And he was like, you're
actually right to be afraid

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.140
because you are currently a
representative of your people.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.340
Like people look at
you and [inaudible]

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.720
about Korean-Americans.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.940
And you are walking around
and they'll be like, oh okay,

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.080
I know about Korean-Americans
because of something you said.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.270
And, so, I've been thinking
about that and what that means.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:59.390
But, on the other hand,
I think when I'm writing,

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:02.320
and [inaudible] in the
small group discussion,

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.540
when I'm writing and when I'm
engaging with the fiction,

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.050
there's, again, no space for any
of this and I just have to --

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:14.050
I'm only writing well if
I'm digging for my truths.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.690
Again, I also [inaudible]
with my truths

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:20.360
and with what I'm trying to get
on the page, and when I'm doing

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.170
that there's no space to
worry about what anyone

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.450
else is going to think
and I just have to --

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.090
and I feel as though
maybe that burrowing

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:31.780
and that specificity is in
itself being responsible,

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.470
or as responsible as I can be.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.550
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Yeah, and I
thank you, too, for bringing

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.070
up the issue, both of you,
of representation and how

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.160
when there's already
[inaudible] representation,

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.140
then how much higher the
pedestal is, so to speak,

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.440
that you are then placed
on as the representative

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.300
of all Asian-Americans.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.570
And I think, also, when we
look at that, and I guess some

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.530
of what I have seen
in my own community,

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:58.210
is how there can be a lot of
[inaudible] community criticism.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:00.280
You know, you represent us and,

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.150
even though you don't
represent all of us,

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:04.710
you mentioned these
things in your book,

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.160
and they are real things.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:12.810
And, so, there can be that sort
of intercommunity kind of debate

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.110
and critique that
happens as well.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:15.530
We've started getting
into just the concept

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:17.050
of Asian-American literature
and Asian-American writers,

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.710
and certainly tonight's
event is part

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.140
of the Asian-American
Literature Today series.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:27.000
So, I would like to hear both
of your thoughts on some topics

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.890
that I would say
fall under the topic

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.320
of Asian-American
literature today.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.300
So, sort of multiple-choice
items.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.600
You may choose from them.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.900
You may choose all
of the following

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.120
if you so delight in them.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.960
Asian-American writers
you're excited about,

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.850
whether they are people who've
been publishing or performing

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:46.040
for years, or maybe
more emerging voices.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.580
Asian-American writers
who have mentored

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.750
and supported your development
that you would like to shout out

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:55.280
and [inaudible] boost for all
of the lovely people here.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.300
And, also, just any thoughts
you would want to share

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.390
on the contemporary U.S.
Asian-American literary

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:03.650

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.310
[ Laughter ]

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:09.320
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: Well,
I can start on this.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.840
So, my book came out in July.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:16.170
And this summer there
have been so many debuts

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:20.140
by Asian-American women,
and it's been so exciting.

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.440
There are so many
that, for a while,

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.040
I was just actually keep
a stack of them by my --

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.350
by my own desk, because they
made me happy to look at them.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:28.790
And, so, some of the books
that have come out are by --

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.450
there's a book by Lucy
Tan [assumed spelling],

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:33.040
there's [inaudible].

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.510
There's Crystal Hana
Kim [assumed spelling].

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:38.690
There's, let's see, [inaudible].

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.320
I mean, I'm not listing
everybody,

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.070
Lilian Le [assumed spelling].

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:48.950
It's just -- it's been a -- it's
like -- it's just been like a,

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.560
I mean relatively
speaking, right,

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.950
compared to what
we've had before,

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.250
it feels like an explosion.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.040
And, so, that's been
really exciting.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:04.930
And in terms of mentors,
I don't know, so many.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.350
But, I feel as though like
a few -- like, let's see,

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:11.870
[inaudible] champions
of other writers

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.050
and Asian-American writers.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:19.620
And I also, you know --
I'm also very excited about

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:25.070
and feel indebted to the work
that the ALR have been doing

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.510
with Lawrence and me
and with [inaudible].

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:31.210
[ Applause ]

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.540
At like multiple readings
people have asked,

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.420
do all of you Asian
writers know one another?

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.050
[Inaudible], I think in, as
offensive a way as that sounds,

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.420
but because people are so
supportive of one another

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.750
on social media and because
people are always shouting one

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.050
another out,

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.100
and I feel as though
there is something to --

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.700
I don't know, I just feel the
community is very supportive

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.500
in a way that I --

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.500
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.940

[inaudible] collection,

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:09.250
If They Come for Us, just
came out in early August.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:14.090
And that book is
one of the books

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:16.490
that I carry with me a lot.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:21.780
And she is also doing a lot
of really incredible work,

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.470
not just only in poetry,
but like she is --

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:29.210
she is writing a series
for HBO, and she is --

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.340
she's just like a [inaudible].

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:36.780
And I also read Lucy Tan's
book this summer, too,

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.580
and I really loved it.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.880
And mentors.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.170
One of my mentors, [inaudible].

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:54.450
Just, he is a poet and also
writes fiction as well.

00:49:54.450 --> 00:50:00.020
And I think a shout out to
also Joseph Gatsby [assumed

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:03.670
spelling], who is one of
the cofounders of Kundiman.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:07.060
And, yeah.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.420
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Thank
you [laughter].

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:14.010
I'm going to ask one more
question and then we'll open it

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.360
up to the audience
for questions as well.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.090
And I think someone
will bring a microphone

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:22.170
around to the audience folks
who have something to ask.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:26.660
So, now you both, you each
published one or more books.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.790
A lot of people in the
room today are writers

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:32.880
at various stages
of their careers.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.620
And, so, I wanted
to ask, how are each

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:39.190
of you approaching the writing
process differently the second

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.020
or third time around now?

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.040
And, are there things you
learned through writing

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.950
and publishing your
previous books

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.420
that you think informs
your approach

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.970
to writing the current
material you're working on,

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.270
future publications?

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:54.710
And I think there, too, I
personally would be interested

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:57.000
in hearing, not just about,
you know, the writing process

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.460
and the craft, but things that
you may say you've learned

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:02.700
that inform you in terms
just the publishing process,

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.960
or book touring, or, you
know, what sort of happens

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.810
as your career stands spans more

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.110
and more publications
in the years?

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.440
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen:
One of the things

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:23.030
that I have been learning, a
lesson that I keep with me,

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.380
is that I don't have
to explain myself.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:31.460
I think like, you know,

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.100
coming from all these
intersectional marginalized

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:40.710
identities, like one of the
things that I felt the need

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.870
to do is like defend myself.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.630
And, oftentimes, that looks
like explaining who I am

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.780
and explaining, and it comes
with this idea that like

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:58.360
if people know I am human
then they will accept me.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:05.630
But, then that's like also you
are pandering to these people

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:08.680
who haven't treated you well
in the first place, right?

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.040
Like, you're pandering to like
people in position of power

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:16.400
and not just doing
the work, right?

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:21.220
I think, -- so, yeah,
so like I am learning

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:29.980
to like not feel the need
explain who I am and --

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:33.200
I think we were talking
about it earlier,

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.350
like asking for empathy, because
that's not what we're doing,

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:36.650
right?

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:37.950
That's not what we're --
I'm not asking for pity.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:46.970
I'm not asking to be considered.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.090
I'm just trying to make my own
space, if that makes sense.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.390
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Absolutely.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.740
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: So,
with my first book,

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:05.770
I spent the first two years
rewriting the first 20 pages

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:08.040
over and over and over again
every day, the [inaudible].

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.780
And then I threw it all away and
then I started all over again.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.840
So, I learned from
that to not do

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.210
that [inaudible],
never, ever do that.

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.510
I just -- I had this idea

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.060
that I needed the
sentences to be perfect,

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.480
to be exactly right.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.400
And I had this metaphor in
mind, and the metaphor was,

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.490
you need a solid
foundation to build a house.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.020
And then, at the end of
those two years, belatedly,

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:30.320
I realized it was
the worst metaphor,

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.030
because you can't put -- you
can't put in a foundation

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:34.410
if you don't know what
the house looks like.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.490
And, so -- and, so, with this
new book I've been trying --

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:39.040
my new novel I've been trying,

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.620
I've been working on
it for maybe two years,

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:45.390
and I've been trying to speed
through as many drafts as I can

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:48.970
to try to subvert my own
obsession with syllables,

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:52.150
with language, with
punctuation, frankly.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:54.940
And I've been handwriting, I've
been doing all kinds of things

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:56.760
to try to get through
it quickly.

00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.870
But, I don't -- I mean, the book
is such a -- it's such a like --

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.170
it's just sort of a [inaudible]

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:03.860
I have no idea what
it is and I feel

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.160
as though I've forgotten
how to write.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.370
So, I'm not sure that
this method is any better.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:08.670
We'll see [laughter].

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.040
[Inaudible] a while from now,
we'll see, like eight years.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.340
I don't know.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.640
I'm just hoping like six years,

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.940
I'm hoping this book
will take six years.

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.240
It sounds like a really nice,

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.350
short winter [laughter]
compared to 10.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:26.280
In terms of what I -- one
thing I think I've learned,

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.730
[inaudible] the other
day, I am not --

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:32.060
I don't regret a single
thing I insisted for.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.040
I mean, I insisted
on for my book.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.370
I don't regret a single thing
I insisted on in terms of,

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:40.040
I don't even know,
in terms of --

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.130
in terms of like a single
mark or punctuation,

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:49.630
in terms of never, ever tell
[inaudible] I mean Korean words

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:52.540
or, you know, or French
words or anything.

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:57.790
And I think I learned from that,
that people just aren't going

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.040
to get as mad at me
as I think they will.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.750
I feel as though like
every time I insist

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:04.830
on something I'm just worried
people will get incredibly

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:06.360
offended and they'll
like cut off all --

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.660
like I keep getting worried

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:10.130
that people will cancel all the
contracts or like never want

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.040
to talk to me again
or all these things.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.010
And nobody will ever, people
have said this and it's true,

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:17.310
nobody cares about my book.

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:19.220
Nobody ever cared
about my book as much

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:21.720
as I did, not even my mother.

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.240
And, so, [inaudible] more
of a consequence to me,

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:28.350
which truly like there
are points when I said --

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.430
when like -- when
like I've said things

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:34.230
like I cannot change this
semi-colon to an em-dash,

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.140
it would actually
ruin the integrity

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.050
of the entire book
[laughter], [inaudible].

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.540
And I felt that way and
I'm glad that I stuck

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.730
by what I believed in,
even if I was afraid

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.040
that everyone would
be mad at me.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.030
People just aren't going
to get that mad at you,

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.260
I think is what -- is what
I took away, probably,

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:55.430
I don't know, maybe,
who know [laughter].

00:55:55.430 --> 00:56:02.770
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: I have you -- I
know, so dramatic [laughter].

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.070
Stop the bus.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:07.860
I have another answer,
because you were talking

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.070
about obsessions, right?

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:12.150
And one of the things
that I learned

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:16.130
when writing my second book,
right, is that like I had --

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.960
I felt early on that I can't
write about the same things.

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.360
I can't write about the same
subjects that I did in my --

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.950
in my first book,
because like, you know,

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:26.250
people want to hear
something else.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.110
People want to see
that I moved on, right?

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.440
Like, so it's like learning

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.600
that like your obsessions
can be your obsessions,

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.640
that you can write about
the same thing forever.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.040
It's like okay, right?

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.340
Like if you have --
like if you want to --

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:41.240
if you want to write -- if I
want to write about this cup

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.150
for the rest of my life, I'm
going to write about this cup.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:48.470
It's just like about like
how you approach it, right?

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:53.600
And like -- yeah, but like
seeing things differently,

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.250
and like that is also, yeah,

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.490
obsessed over this
and it's okay.

00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:59.790
Yeah.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:01.090
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: I feel like
one of the themes in both

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.170
of your responses to that
question kind of goes

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:06.530
around giving yourself
permission to do certain things,

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:08.080
to say certain things,
to take up space, take up

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.650
space of opinion and
integrity of your own work.

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:16.510
Thank you both so much for your
answers to all my questions.

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:23.080
[ Applause ]

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.380
Anne [assumed spelling]
is going to come

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:25.680
around with a wireless mic.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.820
If you could just raise your
hand if you have a question

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.380
for either one of our
authors, or you can pose it

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.820
to both authors together.

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.820
And after we do our Q
and A we will conclude

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:38.120
with a book signing.

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:46.950
&gt;&gt; Hello. Okay.

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:49.250
So, first of all, this
is so cool [inaudible].

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.550
It's really interesting
to hear [inaudible].

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:54.350
So, my question is
for Hieu actually.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:58:00.560
So, for part of my senior
project I publish month

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.520
[inaudible] journal for
women online [inaudible].

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:08.520
And I was wondering if
you've ever experienced

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.470
with [inaudible] and
what was your experience?

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.410
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen:
Yeah, of course.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.360
I'm going to be honest.

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:29.000
Okay, so [laughter], I
always thought like haiku is

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.210
like the easy form, right?

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:34.080
Like if I had to -- if
I had an assignment due

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.290
and like I don't think I could
even write one more poem,

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.890
this is going to be the haiku.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:45.330
But, also, like seeing
how much care that people

00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.640
who take haiku seriously, right?

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:53.380
Like, and like what
it can do in that --

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.780
in those restrictions, right?

00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:02.910
And like seeing how other
people navigate that form is

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.210
like really inspiring to me.

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:08.650
I feel like haiku won't
let me come back to it,

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:10.220
because like I disrespected
it [laughter].

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.910
So, I'm like still asking
for forgiveness, you know.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.340
But, it is something that I --

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.520
You know, have learned to
take very seriously and not

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:32.620
like something that I am going
to do because I think it's easy,

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:35.580
right, because it's not.

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.880
Yeah.

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:44.500
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:48.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:50.640
Just because there's a
lot of laughter in here,

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.860
I'm just wondering if you could
talk about the roles of laughter

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:59.040
and or humor, both in
your writing process,

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.760
when you [inaudible] people,
and your own experience

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.810
of like reading and writing
your various forms that you do.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:20.720
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen: I think
of humor as a way to kind

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.370
of ask people to
trust me, right?

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.670
And that --

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.180
If I can't get you to
laugh with me, right,

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:37.090
like then I probably
can't get you to like care

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.210
about anything else I'm saying.

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:43.600
Yeah, and that's the way I
take the role of humor is.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.940
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: I also think --

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.220
I feel as though it
would just feel so false

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.850
to write a whole
book that left off

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:56.150
at either end of the spectrum.

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:58.480
If you're a purely comic
writer or purely tragic,

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.120
that just feels so -- it
doesn't feel like my --

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.040
at least my experience
of the world.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.020
I also feel as though the two --

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:10.560
the two really adapt to
one another and it's often

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.900
in the most tragic moments that
like [inaudible] like a dash

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:17.040
of comedy can make
things even more powerful.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.710
I don't know if you read Alice
Elliott Dark's In the Gloaming.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.010
This is a lovely short story,

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:24.820
but there's this
joke at the end.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.980
And I remember I was
reading that story,

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.040
and I made the mistake of
reading that story in a cafe,

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.880
and like at the joke
I just started

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.820
like sobbing convulsively.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.460
So, that -- somebody came around
and was like, are you all right?

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.760
Like, what's going on?

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.060
I was like I just --

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.700
it's a story, there
was a joke [laughter].

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.410
And, so, I think -- I think
the two can be played off

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.240
against each other in
very effective ways.

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:51.790
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: We had
a question up here

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:54.090
in this second row, Anne.

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:56.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, this is a question --

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.560
well, a comment and
a question for Reese.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.770
So, I was having lunch, and
I'm so glad that you ended

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:05.820
with that comment
about obsession

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.620
and your writing
process and how you sort

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.050
of wrote everything
over and over again.

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:15.140
And I, as a reader of your work
anyway, really appreciate that.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.660
And I was at lunch today
with a bunch of writers

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:21.310
who actually do crime fiction,
things like that, and I

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:23.820
was talking about how I was
coming to this event tonight

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.050
and I was excited and
how it's very short.

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:33.230
But, I feel like you must have
started like an 800-page novel

01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:39.250
and then like over eight years
[inaudible] it taken you.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.770
And you had sort of compressed
it down and sort of taken

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:46.760
out every fluff word,
answer taken,

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.670
like every eight word sentence
and made it into four words

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:52.190
until it meant the same thing

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:54.160
and carried all the
same emotion,

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.010
and just -- but, you made
it into this compressed,

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:02.420
dense thing of emotion and
sort of beauty and rhythm

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.430
and that it actually
took me a while

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:06.730
to read just because I was --

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:08.850
just I had to re-read
some of these sentences

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.500
because they were
just so magnificent.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.610
So, as a reader, thank
you for taking that time,

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:17.130
and those extra years, I
think, really shows up.

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.800
So, anyway, so that's
my comment.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.050
The question is, as far as the
POV of your novel, you know,

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:26.970
like the real chapters I
feel like are, you know,

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.040
in sort of straightforward
first person,

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.190
and then the Phoebe ones, even
though you get to the place

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:38.480
where she's telling the
story in her own words

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.780
through recollection or Will,

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.400
but I feel like they're
actually still Will's chapters

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.080
and he's interpreting
for us what she,

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.730
you know, told him
or a story about her

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:51.080
that he recalls or whatever.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.400
Was that intentional
and have you --

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.320
I'm just wondering if anybody
tried to [inaudible] hey,

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.570
maybe we should, you know,
like take out that Will filter

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:06.310
and just make it straight
Phoebe or whatever?

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.660
I'm just curious.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.640
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: So, as I
mentioned in my reading,

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.530
the novel alternates
between three points of view,

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:15.220
cult leader, Phoebe, and Will.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:19.060
And, in a lot of ways, I don't
think I'm giving too much away

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.360
by noting that the

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.170
novel does indicate
in a lot of ways

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:24.350
that Will's the one really
telling the whole novel.

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:28.670
And, so, the first two years
the novel was told entirely

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:30.510
from Phoebe's point of view.

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:34.160
And then I realized that, well,
so Phoebe goes through a lot.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.550
Like she -- again, I don't
think I'm giving too much away

01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.600
by that she loses a
lot and then she sort

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.040
of gains a lot in some ways.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.840
And then she -- you know,
like she joins a radical cult

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.950
and she is probably involved
in blowing up a building.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.250
Like there's just like --

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:51.040
there's a lot of lived
life experience there.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.470
And it became claustrophobic for
me to remain just in her head.

01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:59.010
And I was thinking a lot
about The Great Gatsby

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:01.490
and the Nick Carraway
with the novel [inaudible]

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:03.220
by having him narrate the novel

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.330
versus pretty much
anyone else in the book.

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:08.590
He's one of the most least of
all characters in a lot of ways

01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:09.890
in these characters' lives.

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.700
And, so, I found that when I
stepped aside and let sort of --

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.060
and let somebody
who loved Phoebe,

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:16.830
but wasn't involved
very much in the act --

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.730
in the sort of main action
of the book, tell the book,

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:21.930
it opened up -- like
it opened up.

01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:23.230
It brought air into the room.

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:26.240
It opened up a lot of
sort of space to play.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.740
So, there's that.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.630
The second question about
splitting up the book.

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.930
So, I -- this is a question,

01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.190
and with first person
novels I know a lot

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.040
of people don't have
any problem with this,

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:40.050
but I found that I wanted the
novel to have a reason to exist,

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.710
even inside of its
own fictional world.

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.370
And, so, in some
ways the novel comes

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:48.090
about because Will's trying
to understand what happened,

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:50.970
what happened to this woman he
loved and what happened to him,

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:52.270
what happened to
their relationship.

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.130
And, so, that -- and
he's sort of trying to --

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.430
he trying to understand.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:58.040
He's trying to explain it.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.350
And, so, that whole explanation
is -- that attempt is the book.

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:05.470
And, so, the novel -- I
never wanted the novel,

01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:08.650
I found I never wanted
the novel to stray outside

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.120
of what Will could either know
or imagine about what happened.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.470
And, so, that provided sort
of like a very useful circle

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.450
around what was possible.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:19.210
So, all of this sounds
very intentional.

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:20.510
It wasn't intentional
[laughter].

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:21.810
Like I feel as though

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:23.110
like nothing I did
was [inaudible] choose

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:24.790
or decided [inaudible]
useable word.

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:31.700
It was more like had to happen
after 50,000 revision attempts.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.080
It's like, oh okay, yeah, this
is what was supposed to happen.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.820
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: I think we have
time for one more question.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.120
Are there?

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.420
[Inaudible]?

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.670
Now I'm just calling
people by name.

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:46.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much to
both of you for being here.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.070
I had a question about
writing [inaudible]

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:56.180
and the actual discipline of

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.550
sitting yourself down
and just, you know,

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:03.280
unloading whatever you have
onto the page, the screen.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.840
And I've been trying
to find the balance

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.620
between writing discipline
and practice

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:13.040
and self-care, because I

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.500
feel like as someone who
grew up in an immigrant home,

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.410
I have internalized this idea

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:24.200
that work is a very zero-some
game, or either you're working

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.040
and you are strung out,

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.350
or you are, if you're not
doing that or some form

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:34.070
of that, then you are lazy.

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:37.910
And I think just trying to
navigate, you know, those values

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:40.080
about work and applying
them to creative life

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.100
I found to be kind
of a messy process.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:47.560
So, I was wondering what each
of you had to say about that.

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:55.930
&gt;&gt; Hieu Minh Nguyen:
I think it's important

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:57.820
to consider it work.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:04.160
That it's just -- it's not just
like something that we are doing

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.640
for fun, but it takes work
and it takes effort and time.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.970
But, also, I think there's a --

01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:16.200
I think it also takes like
being kind to yourself

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.500
when it's not working out.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.980
I forgot -- oh God.

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.960
Okay, this is going
to be so embarrassing.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:28.290
So, what is -- what is
the name of the woman

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:30.820
who wrote Eat, Pray, Love?

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.120
Elizabeth Gilbert.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.790
Well, I was watching one
of her Ted Talks [laughter]

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:43.960
and my friend directed
me to her Ted Talk.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.080
And she talks about in
like, I think it was

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.540
like Ancient Greece
they believed

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.270
in the spirit of
the genius, right?

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:56.160
And that [inaudible] and artists
weren't actually like geniuses

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.600
or whatever, but they had
the spirit of a genius living

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.250
in the walls of their studio.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:05.290
And, so, when they're in
their studio and they're ready

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:09.120
to create, sometimes the genius
would come and use their body

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.030
as a vessel to make art.

01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:15.070
And then when they're in their
studio and they're unable

01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:16.370
to create something,

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:18.890
it's because the genius is
off somewhere else, right?

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:22.400
And, so, that like takes away
the pressure of like I need

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.590
to be like this working machine.

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:26.290
I need to be -- or,
something is wrong

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:27.590
with me if I'm not doing it.

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:30.270
Why can't -- why can't I do it?

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:31.680
And I like that idea.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.810
Thank you, Elizabeth
Gilbert [laughter].

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:41.650
I also like the idea of
considering it work, too.

01:09:41.650 --> 01:09:47.580
So, the -- so, yeah,
so like there's --

01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:56.860
I find like when I
can't create something

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.470
that I can edit something,
right,

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.410
something that I created before.

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:05.100
And I think that, yeah,
that's part of it.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.930
Like figuring out
where your energy goes

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:13.040
if it can't go towards the
thing you want it to go to.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.340
&gt;&gt; R. O. Kwon: So,

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.730
until December I had a very
consistent answer for this,

01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:18.490
because I did really write
pretty much every day

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:19.790
for those 10 years.

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:21.650
But, since December I've been
writing so little fiction,

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.570
and if I'm not writing fiction
I feel a little dead inside,

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.720
so I've been a little dead
inside for a little while.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.020
It's okay.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.320
It's okay.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.600
I soon will get it back.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.990
But, the -- so, until December I
had all kinds of rules in place.

01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:40.640
Like I did not have
internet during the day.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.940
I didn't have a flip phone.

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.240
I've been borrowing a smartphone

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.320
so I could get around
as I travel.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.570
I would not talk to anyone
in the morning before I got

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:52.280
to work, because if I got to
writing because I didn't --

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.740
I wanted to go as fast as I can

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:56.240
from my dream state
to my writing.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.100
I wouldn't even eat until I had
gotten like a solid hour of work

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.580
or so in, because
like I find food

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.140
to be extremely pleasurable,

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.440
and that's very distracting
[laughter]

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.540
if I'm at home writing.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.020
I -- oh man, all kinds of shit.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.270
But, it's been less
useful lately,

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:16.080
again because I've been doing
all this other kind of stuff,

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.530
which I don't regret, but
it's not fiction writing.

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:24.990
And, so, lately I've been taking
-- I'm on the extreme other end

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.290
of trying to do things.

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:28.990
Like at the very least on
a given trying to write

01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:31.040
for like five minutes
or 10 minutes.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.580
At the very least by trying to
-- at the very least trying --

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.080
like if I notice a
word I want to use,

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.430
like writing down that word.

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:42.530
And, so just trying to stay in
touch in some way with a part

01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:44.550
of myself that loves fiction
and thrives on fiction

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:47.400
and needs fiction to live.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.700
And so, yeah, I feel like
those are two ends of --

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:53.610
two like very different
kinds of ends.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:54.910
First, there's the [inaudible].

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:57.250
I was -- I was a -- you know,
I was like a hermit in a --

01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:59.060
hermit in the room answer,

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.490
and then there's the I
barely have time to write.

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:02.790
But, I'm trying.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.090
And I'm trying to stay in touch

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:06.380
with it every day
to the extent I can.

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:07.680
&gt;&gt; Gowri K.: Thank you
all for your question.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.510
Can we please do a round of
applause for [inaudible]?

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:19.500
[ Applause ]

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.540
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper:
And thanks also --

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.300
thanks also to our
moderator, and thanks to all

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.100
of you for coming out.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:30.040
[ Applause ]

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.340
The books are for
sale in the back.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.640
We hope you get some.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.040
We hope you ask for autographs.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.340
And we would love to see you

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:39.610
down the street on
Monday, October 1.

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:44.090
The kickoff for the fall Life of
a Poet series with Ron Charles

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:46.010
from the Washington Post with
Marilyn Chin [assumed spelling].

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:50.170
So, if you're around, it
will be a conversation

01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:53.060
that will hopefully be
almost as luminating

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.520
as this one this evening.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.820
So, thanks so much
for coming out.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.510
And do get a book
and see you soon.

01:12:58.510 --> 01:13:03.500
