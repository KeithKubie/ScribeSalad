been going on it's been quite a while
since I last saw the hyena so I'm quite

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.040
since I last saw the hyena so I'm quite
 

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.650
since I last saw the hyena so I'm quite
excited and quite hopeful that they'll

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:44.660
excited and quite hopeful that they'll
 

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.020
excited and quite hopeful that they'll
have their den somewhere around here now

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.030
have their den somewhere around here now
 

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.180

I see a chair my mouse in the distance

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.190
I see a chair my mouse in the distance
 

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.740
I see a chair my mouse in the distance
and I wonder if perhaps that's not the

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:50.750
and I wonder if perhaps that's not the
 

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.890
and I wonder if perhaps that's not the
one so I think let's just go around and

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:53.900
one so I think let's just go around and
 

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.750
one so I think let's just go around and
we're gonna leave her here we know that

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760
we're gonna leave her here we know that
 

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.610
we're gonna leave her here we know that
this had particular her you know chances

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:57.620
this had particular her you know chances
 

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.200
this had particular her you know chances
are that it's not gonna go anywhere and

00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.210
are that it's not gonna go anywhere and
 

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.180
are that it's not gonna go anywhere and
if it does there are a few mud wallows

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:01.190
if it does there are a few mud wallows
 

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.740
if it does there are a few mud wallows
around here there's one just in front

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:02.750
around here there's one just in front
 

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.970
around here there's one just in front
here to the left

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:03.980
here to the left
 

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.320
here to the left
and then there's another one to the

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:05.330
and then there's another one to the
 

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:11.310
and then there's another one to the
right so hopefully it will go in there

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320
 

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.320
Jennifer and potentially to the other

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.330
Jennifer and potentially to the other
 

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.540
Jennifer and potentially to the other
reserves that are around us the hyena

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:16.550
reserves that are around us the hyena
 

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.700

clan of the world the Juma clan is known

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:18.710
clan of the world the Juma clan is known
 

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.350
clan of the world the Juma clan is known
as the Juma clan just because they tend

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360
as the Juma clan just because they tend
 

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.410
as the Juma clan just because they tend
to spend a lot of time here so if there

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:23.420
to spend a lot of time here so if there
 

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.270
to spend a lot of time here so if there
is if it's not a habitual for them to

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:25.280
is if it's not a habitual for them to
 

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.040
is if it's not a habitual for them to
actually be in another spot then they'll

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.050
actually be in another spot then they'll
 

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.810
actually be in another spot then they'll
potentially everybody will know them as

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:28.820
potentially everybody will know them as
 

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.080
potentially everybody will know them as
the Juna clan but again depends on the

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.090
the Juna clan but again depends on the
 

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.030
the Juna clan but again depends on the
reserves a lot of times other reserves

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040
reserves a lot of times other reserves
 

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.210
reserves a lot of times other reserves
will name them differently but

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.220
will name them differently but
 

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.350
will name them differently but
unfortunately with hyenas not too many

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360
unfortunately with hyenas not too many
 

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.240
unfortunately with hyenas not too many
people take too much of an interest in

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.250
people take too much of an interest in
 

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.570
people take too much of an interest in
terms of the writing community around

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:43.580
terms of the writing community around
 

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.940
terms of the writing community around
here and then sometimes people just will

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:45.950
here and then sometimes people just will
 

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.550
here and then sometimes people just will
refer to them as a clan of hyenas now I

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560
refer to them as a clan of hyenas now I
 

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.920
refer to them as a clan of hyenas now I
think this is roughly where Steve

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:50.930
think this is roughly where Steve
 

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.420
think this is roughly where Steve
mentioned where it is and I can see some

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:52.430
mentioned where it is and I can see some
 

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.340
mentioned where it is and I can see some
old vehicle trucks and then if you see

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.350
old vehicle trucks and then if you see
 

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.620
old vehicle trucks and then if you see
in front of us there's a big termite

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:56.630
in front of us there's a big termite
 

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.510
in front of us there's a big termite
mound so I wonder if this is actually

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:58.520
mound so I wonder if this is actually
 

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.910
mound so I wonder if this is actually
not the spot or the termite mound that

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920
not the spot or the termite mound that
 

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.200
not the spot or the termite mound that
they've been using so I just want to go

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.210
they've been using so I just want to go
 

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.870
they've been using so I just want to go
around see if there's anything around

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880
around see if there's anything around
 

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.030
around see if there's anything around
there that might indicate okay well

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040
there that might indicate okay well
 

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.130
there that might indicate okay well
there's a nice big hole in there I would

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.140
there's a nice big hole in there I would
 

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.930
there's a nice big hole in there I would
have mentioned this is the this is the

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:13.940
have mentioned this is the this is the
 

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.290
have mentioned this is the this is the
den now that is what I presume to be the

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:17.300
den now that is what I presume to be the
 

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.140
den now that is what I presume to be the
hole though doesn't look that used and

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:20.150
hole though doesn't look that used and
 

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.960
hole though doesn't look that used and
you see there's a lot of grass in front

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:21.970
you see there's a lot of grass in front
 

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.970
you see there's a lot of grass in front
so I would imagine that if there's all

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:24.980
so I would imagine that if there's all
 

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.430
so I would imagine that if there's all
that grass in there that potentially the

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440
that grass in there that potentially the
 

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.320
that grass in there that potentially the
hyenas haven't been coming in and out

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.330
hyenas haven't been coming in and out
 

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.090
hyenas haven't been coming in and out
because we've got little ones and if

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:31.100
because we've got little ones and if
 

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.740
because we've got little ones and if
it's quite a busy den then you'll see a

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:32.750
it's quite a busy den then you'll see a
 

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.960
it's quite a busy den then you'll see a
lot of tracks and movements in the room

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:34.970
lot of tracks and movements in the room
 

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.930
lot of tracks and movements in the room
have grass growing in the front now I am

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:37.940
have grass growing in the front now I am
 

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.000
have grass growing in the front now I am
roughly in the area so we're gonna carry

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.010
roughly in the area so we're gonna carry
 

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.530
roughly in the area so we're gonna carry
on looking see if perhaps there's

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:41.540
on looking see if perhaps there's
 

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.180
on looking see if perhaps there's
another entrance onto the other side of

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.190
another entrance onto the other side of
 

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.590
another entrance onto the other side of
this boundary perhaps that's the one

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600
this boundary perhaps that's the one
 

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.530
this boundary perhaps that's the one
that they've been using if not according

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:47.540
that they've been using if not according
 

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.780
that they've been using if not according
to the directions we got we shouldn't be

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:49.790
to the directions we got we shouldn't be
 

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.610
to the directions we got we shouldn't be
too far maybe there's gonna be another

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:51.620
too far maybe there's gonna be another
 

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.470
too far maybe there's gonna be another
round around here that might indicate

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480
round around here that might indicate
 

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.040
round around here that might indicate
where the hyenas are this book looks

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.050
where the hyenas are this book looks
 

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.820
where the hyenas are this book looks
more like it alrighty yeah

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:00.830
more like it alrighty yeah
 

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.540
more like it alrighty yeah
looks definitely more like it now you

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:04.550
looks definitely more like it now you
 

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.360
looks definitely more like it now you
see this entrance over here so this

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.370
see this entrance over here so this
 

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.310
see this entrance over here so this
particular entrance compared to the one

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320
particular entrance compared to the one
 

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.100
particular entrance compared to the one
that we just saw it's it seems like it's

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.110
that we just saw it's it seems like it's
 

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.750
that we just saw it's it seems like it's
been used a lot more you see how there's

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760
been used a lot more you see how there's
 

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.300
been used a lot more you see how there's
very little grass around a bunch of new

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:16.310
very little grass around a bunch of new
 

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.370
very little grass around a bunch of new
tracks all around there and then you can

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:18.380
tracks all around there and then you can
 

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.200
tracks all around there and then you can
just tell that there's been excavated

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.210
just tell that there's been excavated
 

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.880
just tell that there's been excavated
you see the black there at the back and

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:21.890
you see the black there at the back and
 

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.310
you see the black there at the back and
then in there inside of the termite

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320
then in there inside of the termite
 

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.730
then in there inside of the termite
mound

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:24.740
mound
 

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.050
mound
there's probably where the little ones

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:26.060
there's probably where the little ones
 

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.390
there's probably where the little ones
are I'm not too sure how many I think

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:28.400
are I'm not too sure how many I think
 

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.980
are I'm not too sure how many I think
they manage to have a glimpse of one

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:29.990
they manage to have a glimpse of one
 

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.290
they manage to have a glimpse of one
today I believe Cokie was the hyena that

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:32.300
today I believe Cokie was the hyena that
 

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.410
today I believe Cokie was the hyena that
was around this morning so I have a very

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:35.420
was around this morning so I have a very
 

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.760
was around this morning so I have a very
strong suspicion that if there are

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:36.770
strong suspicion that if there are
 

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.590
strong suspicion that if there are
little ones around they are in there and

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600
little ones around they are in there and
 

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.630
little ones around they are in there and
I mean it is as we were saying it's so

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640
I mean it is as we were saying it's so
 

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.720
I mean it is as we were saying it's so
hot this afternoon it's about I think I

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:43.730
hot this afternoon it's about I think I
 

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.210
hot this afternoon it's about I think I
was saying 33 and we refused to accept

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:46.220
was saying 33 and we refused to accept
 

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.240
was saying 33 and we refused to accept
that answer we said it was about 36

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.250
that answer we said it was about 36
 

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.190
that answer we said it was about 36
degrees Celsius so I'm pretty sure the

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200
degrees Celsius so I'm pretty sure the
 

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.320
degrees Celsius so I'm pretty sure the
little ones are inside well not only for

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.330
little ones are inside well not only for
 

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.630
little ones are inside well not only for
protection because the termite mound is

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:55.640
protection because the termite mound is
 

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.270
protection because the termite mound is
their safe place where they hide but

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:58.280
their safe place where they hide but
 

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.300
their safe place where they hide but
also it's a it's a lot cooler in there

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.950
also it's a it's a lot cooler in there

they hatch out on the incubating their
eggs you'll get the males incubating the

eggs you'll get the males incubating the
 

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.389

bellies which is good news because I
 

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.180
bellies which is good news because I
think we were all concerned that they

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:21.190
think we were all concerned that they
 

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.210
think we were all concerned that they
were looking a little bit hungry now

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220
were looking a little bit hungry now
 

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.160
were looking a little bit hungry now
they are on a property that we

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:26.170
they are on a property that we
 

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.770
they are on a property that we
unfortunately cannot go into so we're

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:28.780
unfortunately cannot go into so we're
 

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.480
unfortunately cannot go into so we're
looking at them from quite a distance he

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.490
looking at them from quite a distance he
 

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.820
looking at them from quite a distance he
can see just how far away and how well

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:32.830
can see just how far away and how well
 

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.590

this lioness is blending with the

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600
this lioness is blending with the
 

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.990
this lioness is blending with the
environment so I think it was a very

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000
environment so I think it was a very
 

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.640
environment so I think it was a very
good thing that she is very hot and

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:38.650
good thing that she is very hot and
 

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.260
good thing that she is very hot and
panting cos and she's got her head up

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:40.270
panting cos and she's got her head up
 

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.150
panting cos and she's got her head up
and that made it a little bit easier for

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160
and that made it a little bit easier for
 

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.820
and that made it a little bit easier for
us to see there is a pan or well more

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:44.830
us to see there is a pan or well more
 

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.590
us to see there is a pan or well more

she can go down in there and have a
 

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.600
she can go down in there and have a
drink

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:51.610

it is because they're a little bit more

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:14.890
it is because they're a little bit more
 

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.630
it is because they're a little bit more
commonly seen and then um although the

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640
commonly seen and then um although the
 

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:24.690

parasitize will basically lay their eggs
 

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:36.010
parasitize will basically lay their eggs
in a host species nest and then leave

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:36.020
in a host species nest and then leave
 

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.460
in a host species nest and then leave
requiring no parental care they lay lots

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:39.470
requiring no parental care they lay lots
 

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:41.860
requiring no parental care they lay lots
of eggs that cause a bit of havoc with

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:41.870
of eggs that cause a bit of havoc with
 

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.560
of eggs that cause a bit of havoc with
the host species itself and the host

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:44.570
the host species itself and the host

the host species itself and the host
itself then raises those chicks to

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240
itself then raises those chicks to
 

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.780
itself then raises those chicks to
adulthood and there's many strategies

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:49.790
adulthood and there's many strategies
 

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:52.810
adulthood and there's many strategies
that the the cuckoos employ some of them

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:52.820
that the the cuckoos employ some of them
 

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.150
that the the cuckoos employ some of them
will remove the egg and then lay an egg

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160
will remove the egg and then lay an egg
 

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.430
will remove the egg and then lay an egg
down because somehow birds are able to

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440
down because somehow birds are able to
 

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.190
down because somehow birds are able to
count the female comes back and notice

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200
count the female comes back and notice
 

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.620
count the female comes back and notice
whether there's three eggs versus four

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:02.630
whether there's three eggs versus four
 

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:05.080
whether there's three eggs versus four
so if they just lay a fourth egg there's

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:05.090
so if they just lay a fourth egg there's
 

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:06.760
so if they just lay a fourth egg there's
a very good chance that they will just

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:06.770
a very good chance that they will just
 

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:08.950
a very good chance that they will just
kick it out so some cookies will move

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960
kick it out so some cookies will move
 

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.020
kick it out so some cookies will move

the chick will kill all of the chicks in

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960
the chick will kill all of the chicks in
 

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.450
the chick will kill all of the chicks in
the nest and some of them will actually

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:16.460
the nest and some of them will actually
 

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.090
the nest and some of them will actually
be reared with the chicks themselves

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:19.100
be reared with the chicks themselves
 

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.100
be reared with the chicks themselves
getting much bigger than their doom and

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:21.110
getting much bigger than their doom and
 

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:23.440
getting much bigger than their doom and
aren't competing them all together so

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:23.450
aren't competing them all together so
 

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:25.420

off and then she's left her around it is
 

01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:04.089
off and then she's left her around it is
quite thick around that area so it's a

quite thick around that area so it's a
 

01:32:04.099 --> 01:32:06.249
quite thick around that area so it's a
little bit complicated to try and find

little bit complicated to try and find
 

01:32:06.259 --> 01:32:08.199

that when it rains there are a lot of
 

01:32:35.419 --> 01:32:37.419
that when it rains there are a lot of
natural mud wallows in between the

01:32:37.419 --> 01:32:37.429
natural mud wallows in between the
 

01:32:37.429 --> 01:32:39.579
natural mud wallows in between the
blocks or wherever there are no roads so

01:32:39.579 --> 01:32:39.589
blocks or wherever there are no roads so
 

01:32:39.589 --> 01:32:41.589
blocks or wherever there are no roads so

01:32:59.539 --> 01:33:03.090
we're trying to have a look at some
tracks that are on our left-hand side

01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:03.100
tracks that are on our left-hand side
 

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:08.850
tracks that are on our left-hand side

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:13.570
see in case we don't miss the
 

01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:16.230
see in case we don't miss the
opportunity and it's a little bit of

01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:16.240
opportunity and it's a little bit of
 

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:27.690
opportunity and it's a little bit of
soft sand all the way back here yeah I

01:33:27.690 --> 01:33:27.700
soft sand all the way back here yeah I
 

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:32.330
soft sand all the way back here yeah I
think they're harina trucks yeah so

01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340
think they're harina trucks yeah so
 

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:37.110
think they're harina trucks yeah so
unfortunately I don't know if whoo it's

01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120
unfortunately I don't know if whoo it's
 

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.970
unfortunately I don't know if whoo it's
tricky to try and find a nice track to

01:33:38.970 --> 01:33:38.980
tricky to try and find a nice track to
 

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.060
tricky to try and find a nice track to
show you guys I don't know if your zoom

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:41.070
show you guys I don't know if your zoom
 

01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:43.560
show you guys I don't know if your zoom
comes all the way to here can you see

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:43.570
comes all the way to here can you see
 

01:33:43.570 --> 01:33:45.900
comes all the way to here can you see
this one here at the bottom so this is

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:45.910
this one here at the bottom so this is
 

01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:48.780
this one here at the bottom so this is
what we've been looking at so no there

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:48.790
what we've been looking at so no there
 

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:50.310
what we've been looking at so no there
we go now I've lost it so you see the

01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320
we go now I've lost it so you see the
 

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.650
we go now I've lost it so you see the
back pad is here there's one look here

01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:52.660
back pad is here there's one look here
 

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.120
back pad is here there's one look here
and another one here and then of course

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:54.130
and another one here and then of course
 

01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:57.210
and another one here and then of course
the fingers or the toes I should

01:33:57.210 --> 01:33:57.220
the fingers or the toes I should
 

01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:59.220
the fingers or the toes I should
actually say so there's one two three

01:33:59.220 --> 01:33:59.230
actually say so there's one two three
 

01:33:59.230 --> 01:34:00.620
actually say so there's one two three
four and then there's this little

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:00.630
four and then there's this little
 

01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:02.730
four and then there's this little
inclination here this little dip here

01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:02.740
inclination here this little dip here
 

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.470
inclination here this little dip here
where you can see where the claws wear

01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480
where you can see where the claws wear
 

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.080
where you can see where the claws wear
so when it stepped onto the and here you

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:07.090
so when it stepped onto the and here you
 

01:34:07.090 --> 01:34:08.970
so when it stepped onto the and here you
can almost see where they brushed and

01:34:08.970 --> 01:34:08.980
can almost see where they brushed and
 

01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:10.980
can almost see where they brushed and
then there's another track here and then

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:10.990
then there's another track here and then
 

01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:12.510
then there's another track here and then
another one here and then it's just

01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520
another one here and then it's just
 

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.370
another one here and then it's just
carried on going that way I would assume

01:34:14.370 --> 01:34:14.380
carried on going that way I would assume
 

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.840
carried on going that way I would assume
that it's perhaps one of the juma clan

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:15.850
that it's perhaps one of the juma clan
 

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.460
that it's perhaps one of the juma clan
going back in that direction all they

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:17.470
going back in that direction all they
 

01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:18.870
going back in that direction all they
have to do is pretty much go in a

01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880
have to do is pretty much go in a
 

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:20.370
have to do is pretty much go in a
straight line and it won't take them too

01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:20.380
straight line and it won't take them too
 

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:22.230
straight line and it won't take them too
long to get there so all the tracks

01:34:22.230 --> 01:34:22.240
long to get there so all the tracks
 

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.370
long to get there so all the tracks
around here hold Hanina tracks my guy

01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:26.380
around here hold Hanina tracks my guy
 

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.650
around here hold Hanina tracks my guy
