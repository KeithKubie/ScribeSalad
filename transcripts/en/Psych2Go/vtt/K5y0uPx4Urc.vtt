Twelve things introverts are best at doing

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.240
There's somewhat of a negative stereotype around introverts. People say that they're too quiet to have fun or be social.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.230
Well that is a blatant lie.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.560
Just because introverts don't feel comfortable walking into a room full of strangers or making friends with everyone in a room

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.410
doesn't mean they don't like to be fun or social.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.330
Introverts have some of the best personality traits. They just usually keep to themselves.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.039
Here are just some of the things introverts are great at doing:

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.739
#1 having thought-provoking conversations

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.729
Introverts don't like small talk. The whole "how are you?" "can you believe this weather?" "did you see the game last night?"

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.260
Chitchat is worthless.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.920
Due to their disdain for the idle chatter they're seen by most as unsociable and this is not the case

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.338
Introverts want to get straight down to the meat of things they want to hear your deepest thoughts, your desires and dreams

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.490
None of that "I'm fine. How are you?" talk

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.039
Introverts know that you have a story to tell and they want to hear it they want to know your opinions and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.470
Questions and answers to questions that are infrequently spoken about because of their deep topics

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.059
Introverts have a therapist guidance counselor mentality and charisma

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.599
Causing us to make you feel more comfortable with speaking your mind and soul. This is good for everyone around

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.950
Introverts get the satisfaction of having a meaningful conversation with someone without having to feel the empty space which chitchat

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.240
And you get a part-time therapist someone who will really listen to you and your thoughts

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.079
#2 being effective salespeople

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.800
I know what you're thinking: What?? what in the world an introvert excels at a profession that requires constant visa vie interaction

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.319
Yes! introverts pay attention care and are comfortable in familiar situations

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.829
so they can be confident in their daily jobs even as salespeople

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.659
Being highly cognitive people introverts take time to fully understand their product customer and outcomes

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.279
From this introverts are highly prepared for any unexpected events such as objections crankiness and touchy questions

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.179
They might not be happy with it, but they can handle it effectively nonetheless.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.810
#3 taking care of animals

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.519
Introverts love to be swaddled and love and affection by those close to them especially when it's our furry friends

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.280
So they do enjoy to return the favor

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.689
Introverts are professionals at taking care of animals especially when they do it alone. You need a dog sitter? No problem!

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.779
You need someone to take care of your cat while you're away? Enough said!

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.019
Introverts have no problem snuggling up next to a dog, cat, bunny or goldfish and spending a nice day together

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.709
They enjoy the company of animals more than humans in most situations

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.610
They sympathize with animals. Introverts can calm a troubled pet since they're experienced with calming their own troubled Minds

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.749
They have a lot of energy and want to have fun eat and get their belly rubbed

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.850
But when all the sudden done they need their rest

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.459
same .. same

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.489
#4 being observant

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.290
Introverts aren't quiet without a purpose. They observe. While you're over there talking about the latest fad, or your weird dream last night

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.290
they're listening and watching

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.089
They see the way your forehead wrinkles when your grandpa's mentioned, and they notice when there's a new painting hanging up in the office

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.949
introverts spend time watching and memorizing their surroundings and environments

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.900
So they feel comfortable enough to interact with them who would jump into the darkness without a flashlight?

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.720
Introverts prefer to analyze their surroundings rather than focus on biases so that when they finally voice out their misgivings

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.300
These should be taken seriously

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.940
Introverts are the first to notice anything slightly out of the ordinary

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.780
And they're also the ones to be the devil's advocate and notice flaws and ideas and concepts

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.560
Introverts usually spend a lot of time thinking about the worst possible situation and how to get out of it so trust them

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.719
They know what they're talking about

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.689
#5 being great leaders as

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.768
As are many of these points this one is notably surprising

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.698
how can someone who dislikes abundant social interaction be a great leader when a leaders job is to lead others?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.899
A recent poll shows that not all successful leaders are extroverts.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.849
Outgoing individuals use their charisma and spunk to command attention and get things done

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.539
while reserved bosses lay low and observe their underlings and always know what's best for them the person and the situation.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.329
They never speak just to be heard or because they're the boss they speak to assist and help others because introverts imagine themselves in quite

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.550
every situation

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.740
Just to be prepared

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.610
They're careful and attentive

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.419
Humble and prepared and they're comfortable working alone showing the good leadership isn't always flashy

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.470
So if you ever have a boss that is more on the shy or reserved side

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.309
This doesn't mean that he or she dislikes you or thinks they're better than you

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.040
It could be that they're an introvert as well and don't have anything to say about your performance since you're doing a good job without them
