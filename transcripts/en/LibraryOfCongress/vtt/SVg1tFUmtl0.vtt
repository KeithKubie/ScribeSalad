00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.940
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Thank you and welcome

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.220
to the National Book
Festival, now in its 16th year.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.590
Sorry that I'm not Raina.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.550
I have to keep you two more
minutes until she comes out.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.820
But my name is Nora and I'm a
books editor at the Washington Post

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.600
and we are a charter
sponsor of the festival.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.540
And what can I say?

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.970
We all love Raina.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.500
This book, I just gave to my
daughter who's seven, last week,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.250
and we were in a bookstore and
she didn't have anything to say

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.880
and I asked her how'd she like
the book, how was it going.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.550
She didn't say anything.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.960
And then I said, you know, next
weekend, I might be meeting

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.380
that author, what do you think?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.880
Do you like her?

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.180
She didn't say anything.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.590 position:56%
And then I just was about to say
something else and she turned around

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.420
and said those words that every
parent wants to hear, "Mom,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.080
stop asking me questions.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.310
I'm reading."

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.340 position:56%
So, I really want to thank Raina
for, you know, we're now already on,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.170
I think, her third or
fourth of this week

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.790
and I've got more coming
in the mail, but anyway.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.760
So we have, of course, there's
"Smile," "Sisters" and "Ghosts"

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.660
and "Baby-Sitters Club" and I bet
you've all experienced what I have

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.300 position:56%
and I know thousands of other people
feel this way because I just saw,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.890
noticed that Raina has, I think,
five books on the bestseller list,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.020
in the New York Times
bestseller list this week

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.640
which is a pretty amazing
achievement

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.270
and very, very much well-deserved.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.020
She's really inspired a lot
of young readers and I see--

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.170
love to see all of you out here.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.540
I just have one small
bit of housekeeping.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.700
It's that I hope you all were able

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.660
to get your books signed
earlier today.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.200
She's not going to be able to
be signing after this event,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.910
so I hope you were able to do that.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.430
She loves to meet you all but
we've got a lot of you here.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.510
So, without further
ado, Raina Telgemeier.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.660
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.060
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Hi, guys.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.510
How's everybody doing?

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.090
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.410
Awesome. So, I'm Raina
and I think we're going

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.120
to just quickly do a test to
make sure my clicker works.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.410
It does, excellent.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.560 position:56%
So, I'm the creator of some graphic
novels, "Smile," "Sisters," "Drama,"

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.210
"The Baby-Sitters Club"
graphic novels,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.210
and my newest graphic
novel is called "Ghosts."

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.180
And to introduce you
guys to this book,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.350
what I'd love to do is get a
couple of people to come up here

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.160 position:56%
and read a chapter with me on stage.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.880
So, we need two readers.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.700 position:56%
We need somebody to play Cat who's
the older sister and she's kind of--

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.090
she's a little sarcastic and she's
a little like not happy to be here.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.500
So, I guess I need somebody
who's really not happy to be here

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.410
at all today, like just
really having a horrible time.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.990
Are you having a horrible time
today, with a hat, my friend?

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.650
Can you fake it?

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.540
You're a good actor.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.850
Let's get you up on stage.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.150
All right.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.200
And now we need somebody to play
Maya who's the little sister

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.270
and she is a ball of energy.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.230
She is excited about everything.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.010
You also need to be a very
good reader to play this role.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.310
Are you a good reader?

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.610
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.910
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: OK.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.210
Let's get you up on stage.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.510
All right.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.810
Here's the thing though, I think
we need to stand off the stage

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.110
so that we can see
the screen better.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.410
So, come on down.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.710
Now, I've gotten you up here.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.310
And I actually have a job
for the audience as well.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.740
So, what I want for you guys to do
is to do all of the sound effects.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.440
So, we need a rehearsal
very quickly.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.930
This doesn't require you guys
to yell because there are

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.490
so many people in this room.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.360 position:56%
But if we can do a sound effect for
a cellphone like this on the screen,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.570
like what would that sound like?

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.870
It's good.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.610
And then what about this one?

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.910
All right.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.420
You're going to see this sound
effect three times in this story.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.180
So the first time, I
want it to be very quiet.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.910
So let's try that real quiet.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.920
OK, then slightly louder.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.360
And then super loud.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.730
Is this going to be so good?

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.100
OK, what about this one?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.180
How about this?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.480
All right.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.820
So this one's a little different.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.970
Maya has cystic fibrosis
and that means

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.890 position:56%
that she wears this special vest to
help kick the mucus out of her lungs

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.280
and make it easier
for her to cough up.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.670
So for this one, I want this
half of the audience do the sound

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.260
of Maya's vest which
you see on screen.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.470 position:56%
So let's try that from here on over.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.330
OK. And you guys on this
side of the room get to pound

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.590
on your chest while you sing.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:09.360
All right, now everybody
all together, please.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.430
Amazing. All right.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.960
So this story starts the
way every good story does,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.680
out of fake In-N-Out burger
because I can't use In-N-Out

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.550
as copyright infringement
in my books.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.900
And now, Cat and Maya, you guys
are going to stand next to me.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.420
We have to share the microphone.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.110
We're going to read off the screen.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.710
Dad starts off by saying "One
Double-Back combo, one Cheese-Back

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.200
with fries, a double Napoleon
shake," and then Maya says--

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.180
&gt;&gt; Don't forget my soda!

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.150
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
Here you go, girls.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.630
&gt;&gt; Do they have Double-Back
Burger in our new town, dad?

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.720
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
I don't think so, Cat.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.680
They only have them down
here in Southern California.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.470
&gt;&gt; What are we even going
to eat in our new town?

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.770
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: We are moving.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.390
Up north and to the coast.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.130
Dad got a new job, but we all
know the real reason we're going.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.220
My little sister, Maya.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.520
She's not a healthy kid.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.230
I'm trying not to be selfish.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.450
The text says, "Hey Cat, my
bubbe is cooking dinner tonight.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.550
You want to come over?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.450
Oh, right, I forgot."

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.450
But it's hard.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.590
You OK back there, Cat?

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm OK.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.380
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
Maya has cystic fibrosis.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.370
It's a thing you're born with.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.120
It affects breathing and digestion.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.420
How about a little music?

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.740
Click. And this is the
part where I tell you guys

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.260
that I could not use the
actual lyrics from "Frozen."

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.240
So instead of using those lyrics,
we used "Let it out, let it out.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.020
Can't hold it in, got to shout."

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.570
And there's no cure.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.680
Mom and dad are dragging
us to this gloomy place,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.660
Bahia de la Luna, California.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.440
They say the sun only shines
here 62 days of the year.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.560
When I heard that, I'd said.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.860
&gt;&gt; Ew, I'd rather die.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.010
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Which
did not go over very well.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.100
&gt;&gt; I'm going to miss Ari
and Maddie and Hibah.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.110
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Of course, I
don't want to die and I want Maya

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.570
to be as healthy as possible.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.870
Duh!

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.500
&gt;&gt; You mean all of my friends?

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.150
What about your friends?

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.720
&gt;&gt; They're my friends, too.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.830
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Cat?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.130
&gt;&gt; Yes, Maya, they're
your friends, too.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.670
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
This is it, girls.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.970
&gt;&gt; The green one?

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.270
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
No, the little red one.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.070
&gt;&gt; Cat, this place is so cool.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.370
&gt;&gt; Mmm.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:42.950
&gt;&gt; I can't believe
we get to live here.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:49.620
Look, look, look, the
ocean is so close.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.030
&gt;&gt; It's freezing.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.830
I'm going inside.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.200
So dark in here.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.450
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
What do you think, Cat?

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.930
&gt;&gt; It's dark.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:06.460
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: It's perfect.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.490
&gt;&gt; Ha.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.490
&gt;&gt; Cat! Gasp, pant.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:28.440
Come see my new-- come,
come downstairs.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.740
Come see my new room!

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.040
&gt;&gt; OK, I'm coming.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:39.800
Hey, it's cozy in here.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.120
&gt;&gt; Watch this.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.420
Cannonball!

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.040
Cough, cough, cough.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:54.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: It's about time
for your breathing treatment, Maya.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.800
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.460
The vest helps loosen
the mucus in her lungs.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.520
Her soul does not need
any loosening, though.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.820
&gt;&gt; Mom?

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.680
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Maya's
vest just blew a fuse, sweetie.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.980
You OK up there?

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:24.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just-- I just don't
know this house very well yet.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.920
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Why
don't you take your sister

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.640
to explore the town while we work
on getting the power back on?

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.940
And so--

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:40.440
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's a secret pathway.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.350
&gt;&gt; Maya! We don't know
what's down there.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.650
Ha.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:04.130
&gt;&gt; Maybe this path will
lead us to-- kitty!

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.970
&gt;&gt; Don't touch it!

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.270
&gt;&gt; Why not?

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.650
It's so cute.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.950
&gt;&gt; Because you know what they say

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.110
about letting a black
cat cross your path.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.080
It's bad luck.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.820
And you had enough bad luck lately.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.970
Come on, let's see
where this thing leads.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.190
I'm actually feeling cold.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.990
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Oh no.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.540
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.020
&gt;&gt; OK. Whoa.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.010
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
Awesome job, you guys.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.310
Thank you.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.510
You can have a seat.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:50.760
[ Applause ]

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.170
OK. Where's Sheila Marie?

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.470
I missed-- there she is.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.770
OK. I forgot.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.070
I knew I was going to forget.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.900
I want to take a selfie with
you guys, can we do that?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.230
OK. We might have to take two
because it's such a big crowd.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.470
So, I've been doing this at every
event that I do and then I put them

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.170
on Instagram and I'm goraina there.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.610
So, everybody here, it's best if
you hold up your books or your arms

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.640
and look as amazing as possible.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.830
So, one, and then one
on this direction.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.010
Yeah. Right side of the room.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.620
OK. Thanks so much you guys.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.920
All right.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.690
So, quickly, I'm going to
talk a little bit about comics

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.750
and about why I make
them, how I make them,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.620
starting with my influence
as in my inspiration

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.490
because the number one
question that comics creators

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.520
and writers get asked
is "What inspired you,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.940
what influenced your work?"

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.980
And for me, it kind of
goes back to something kind

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.200
of important, cartoons
on television.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.250
I love anything animated,
"The Smurfs"

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.130
and "Scooby-Doo," anything Disney.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.230
I also love to read and some

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.850
of my favorite books were
realistic and temporary fiction.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.510
That means books about kids
who where kind of like me.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.260 position:56%
So a lot of my favorites were things
like the "The Baby-Sitters Club"

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.090
and Judy Blume and "Ramona" books.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.660
And then I discovered comic strips

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.810
when I was nine years
old in the newspaper.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.590
The first comic strip I fell in
love with was "Calvin and Hobbes"

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.550
which is about a boy named
Calvin and his tiger, Hobbes.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.700
And these two have big
imaginations, they're very funny.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.330
I love reading this comic strip.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.390
So it was very interesting, but it
was also just super fun to look at.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.690
I love the drawings.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.220
It's just minds on paper and

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.290
yet to meet these characters
felt like they were alive.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.820
My other favorite comic
was "For Better

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.800
or for Worse" by Lynn Johnston.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.480
This is a comic about a very
average suburban family.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.410
There's a mom and a dad
and a brother and a sister

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.020
and I also have a mom and a
dad and a brother and a sister.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.320
So it's kind of like reading about
my own life, except in comics.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.080
Uniquely about "For Better
or for Worse" is the fact

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.440
that the characters
all age in real time.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.390
So every year, they would get
older and so with I and I was

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.830
about the same age as the kids.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.180
So it was almost like we
were growing up together.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.350 position:56%
It was almost like they were my next
door neighbors or my best friends

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.790
and not comic strip characters.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.290
So the lines were very blurred

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.660
between what was real
and what was fiction.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.810
And then when I was 10, my
dad gave me this book to read.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.470
It's called "Barefoot Gen" a
cartoon story of Hiroshima.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.700
So this was sort of
a true life account

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.770
of the author's experience
living through the atomic bombing

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.080
of Japan during World War II and
so I started to read this book.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.980 position:56%
It was about these kids and they ran
around and they sing and they dance

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.690
and they're very silly and I
was actually kind of enjoying it

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.720
and at the end of the book, the
bomb falls and half the characters

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.110
in the story actually die.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.550
And so when I read this,
three things happen.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.860 position:56%
Number one, I was really mad at my
dad for giving me this book to read.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.850
Number two, I was mad
at such a horrible thing

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.150
that happened in the world.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.870
And number three, I was mad because
I thought that comics were supposed

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.290
to be fun, I thought they were
supposed to make you laugh

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.840
and feel happy and this
book did the opposite.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.750
So, it was kind of like the rug
had been pulled out from under me

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.050
but it made me aware of the fact

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.610
that comics could be incredibly
powerful ways to tell stories,

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.130
any kind of story you want.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.060
So I sort of filed that
away in my head for later.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.830
And this is what the
interior looked like.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.130
It was a manga.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.430
It was created in the 70s in Japan.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:02.730
It was in black and white.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.830
But I went back to
reading fun stuff.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.860
So, "Bone" by Jeff Smith
is something I discovered

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.160
when I was in college.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.600
Anybody here read "Bone"
by Jeff Smith?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.290
Awesome. So, those of you that
have your hands in the air,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.220
did you guys read this book in
color or in black and white?

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.400
I'm hearing mostly color,
a few black and whites.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.970 position:56%
When I read "Bone" it looked like
this, it was a black and white comic

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.640
and that's because Jeff Smith,
the artist and the writer,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.390
used to self-publish and that
means he was spending his own money

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.060
to print and distribute it and it's
a lot cheaper to do that with black

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.020
and white comics than it is
to do so with color ones.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.750
So that's how influences work.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.780
You put everything into the blender
inside of your brain and what comes

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.760
out are the types of
things you like to draw,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.630
the kinds of stories
you like to tell.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.080
It's all influence going inside of
you and then what comes out is kind

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.220
of your own stamp on things.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.560
And so now, I'm going to show
you some of my early work.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.680
Because another thing people always
want to know is were you always

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.970
as good at drawing and I'm
like, "Yeah, obviously."

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.290
So what you see on the
left there is a scribble

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.990 position:56%
from just before my second birthday.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.350
And just like most kids,
my parents gave me crayons

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.650
and paper to play with.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.180
And I just really liked it.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.860
So I just kept going and
eventually, I got better.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.980 position:56%
What you see on the right, I believe
from around my fourth birthday

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.600
and I don't know why these
are people with pizza faces

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.970
but I mean I was, you know,
they don't look like more

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.700
than a scribble at that point.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.270
That's me and my sister Amara.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.200
She is five years younger than me.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.770
So, for a brief period I
was a better artist than her

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.760
but she then very quickly
become a better artist than me.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.480
And you can see a few of my
drawings on the wall back there.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.070
It's, I believe, the Easter bunny
because it's a rabbit with a basket

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.330
and then a mermaid there
on the right of my head.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.630
When I was in first grade,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.020
I had this amazing teacher named
Miss Stoopenkoff and she made

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.770
up for her silly sounding
name by being one

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.690
of the best teachers
I have ever had.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.680
She gave us this super
cool assignment

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.640
where she gave us each a diary.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.750
And so one day, she'd
write us a letter

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.390
and in the next day we'd write
her a letter in response.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.510
We did this for the entire year and
since I was just learning to write,

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.830
I found this diary pretty recently

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.970
and I could see my own
writing skills improve

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.280
over the course of that year.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.680
But what I also realized and I
didn't even remember this part was

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.870
that I used to make
comics in my little diary.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.920
So, as really as age
six I was making comics.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.260
I never even read a
comic at this point and

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.830
yet somehow my brain was
just tuned to thinking

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.780
in words and pictures together.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.770
So, this is my graduation
program from fifth grade.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.390
You can certainly see the influence
of "For Better or For Worse"

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.700
on my work at this point and that's

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.490
on the same time I started
making my own comic strips.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.310
And here is the thing, I
was not very good at it.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.790
In fact, I would say
I was terrible at it.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.660
I didn't know how to put
panel borders on things.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.800
I didn't really know how
to put dialog together

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.440
and how to do punch lines.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.800
But the point is I stuck with
it and over the course of time,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.100
I got a little bit better.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.080
I'm not saying my comics
were funny at this point.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.760
I'm just saying that I kept with it

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.900
and eventually I got
a little bit better.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.270
An illustration from my
seventh grade yearbook.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.670
At this point, my whole
goal was just to observe.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.750
So what were my friends wearing?

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.050
What do they look like?

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.350
How do they stand?

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.650
What was there body language?

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.120
All that stuff was
really important to me.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.880
And I kept a diary in comic
format just like I did

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.050
in first grade pretty much all
the way to the end of college.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.810
So anything my friends and
I did, I would illustrate.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.160
This is us going to the
supermarket for lunch and talking

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.420
about the gross types of
deli meats that they had.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.460
I was the illustrator for
my high school newspaper.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.330
This one was about prom dates,
which type of prom date you were.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.470
And eventually, I had to figure out
where I was going to go to college

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.010
and I chose to go to a place called
the School of Visual Arts which is

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.300
in New York City and I moved
there all the way from California.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.030
So, why that school in particular?

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.510
Well, you can go there and you
can take painting and sculpture,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.360 position:56%
photography, but you can also go
there and get a degree in cartooning

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.230
which makes your mom really happy
that you have like a diploma

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.910
for your wall that
says comics on it.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.550
But for some reason, oh, well, this
is another reason I wanted to go

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.770
to New York is because
New York is awesome.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.360
"Sesame Street" told me that once
upon a time and then the movie

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.160
"Oliver &amp; Company" sold it to me
again when I was a little older.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.320
So, yes, you can take all
those usual art school things.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.950
This is a different
presentation than I usually get.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.690
It's kind of little rusty here.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.290
So here is the thing, I decided
to be an illustration major

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.890
at the school and that just means
you're getting better at focusing

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.410
on single images, painting
and drawing

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.320
to make your single
images beautiful.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.610
But I'd go to my painting class,
for example, what you see here.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.640
The teacher would say
I would like a painting

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.180
about a magical transformation
and I'd go, OK, well, that's cool.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.330
How about if I do two
paintings instead?

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.290
And maybe after that painting
is done, I'll do three.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.580
Could I also maybe do four?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.880
I mean five?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.610
My teachers were like, "Raina,
just one painting," and I was

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.910
like lots and lots of paintings.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.720
But what do they look like when you
line them all up against the wall?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.300
They look like a comic, right?

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.620
That's all comics are.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.770
They are just words and pictures
and sequence that tell a story.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.850
So we did take a lot of cartooning
classes there and this is

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.250
where I just had the most fun and I
made comics like this one which is

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.540 position:56%
about the fact that my college had a
lot of stairs and this one which is

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.880
about my very first cup of tea, a
super fascinating subject, right?

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.720
This is the entire comic,
just one page, and my goal is

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.410
to capture a mood and a memory
on paper and that's what most

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.420
of my short stories were about was
just these little memories I had

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.720
on my head.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.320 position:56%
So I took all these ideas, all these
short stories and collected them

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.670
into something called minicomics
and that simply means a comic

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.330
that you make yourself by hand.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.390
So I would go to the Xerox
machine, I would print my pages out

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.690
and then fold them and staple them

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.800
into these little booklets
called minicomics.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.100
I called my series "Take-Out."

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.730
I did seven issues, each one was
12 pages long, black and white,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.380
short stories, mostly about my
childhood, and altogether I managed

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.850
to print and distribute about 7000
copies of these little comics.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.380
And it's not like I just walked at
my front door and said, hey guys,

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.020
I have comics, who wants them?

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.990
I had to figure out how to
get them into people's hands.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.350
So, I would go to comic
bookstores and I would tell them

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.350
that I was a creator and ask if
they wanted to sell my work there.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.310
And so they would take
half the commission

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.610
and I would take the other half.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.900
I sold my books for a dollar
a piece, and that meant

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.410
that sometimes I get
a check in the mail

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.100
for like $2.50 and I was like yeah.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.830
But that's what's cool about comics

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.260
since there is almost
no barrier for entry.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.910
So, anybody who wants
to do this can.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.820
You don't need that many tools.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.310
You can use a computer
or you can use a pencil.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.260
All you have to do is print
your books out and you can say

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.630
that you're a self-publisher
which is really empowering.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.430 position:56%
I also used to go to comic
conventions a lot and this is where,

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.450
you know, 150,000 people
who love comics get together

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.750
and gig out for a weekend.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.460
So it's like the National Book
Festival, only it's all comics.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.020
And you get a lot of people who
are fans, you get a lot of cosplay,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.260
you meet fellow creators, you meet
writers and artists and editors

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.960
and all of the big publishers go.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.000
So it's Marvel Comics and
DC Comics and Archie Comics.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.580
And in the center of all
of that, self-publishers

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.570 position:56%
like me could also get a small table

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.890
and sell my work to
that same audience.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.190
So one of the people I met

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.680
at a comic convention was
a guy named David Saylor

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.900
who was the editorial director
at Scholastic and was starting

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.800
up something called
the graphics in print.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.340
And that means that Scholastic,
who's the publisher of, you know,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.740
the "Harry Potter" series
and "The Hunger Games"

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.120
and all this other amazing stuff,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.270
was going to start
publishing comics, too,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.330
and the first comic they
published was "Bone" by Jeff Smith.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.800
So if you've read it in color it's

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.850
because Scholastic
published it that way.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.060
And they asked me if I wanted to
work with them and I was like,

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.670
oh my gosh, that's so exciting.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.370 position:56%
But the problem is the longest story
I had ever written at that point

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.820
in my life was eight pages long.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.670
Graphic novels tend to be
like a hundred pages long.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.390
So I was like what am I
going to do for these guys?

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.170
And the answer was to go back
to something I was a huge fan

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.170
of when I was a kid and that
would be "The Baby-Sitters Club"

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.470
and this is a fan art I did

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.820
of "The Baby-Sitters Club"
when I was 10 years old.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.950
So, I really have been a
fan for a very long time.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.960 position:56%
So what I ended up doing was to take
this old-favorite series in mind

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.370
and to adapt it into
graphic novel format.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.820
So what on earth does that
mean, to adapt something?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.270 position:56%
Well, this is what the books used to
look like, just words, no pictures.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.170
But of course, these novels
were full of exposition

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.320
and that means it was describing
what was happening in the scene.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.290
So it would say Claudia
is sitting on her bed,

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.360
she is wearing this particular
outfit, she is eating Milk Duds

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.730
and she turns to Kristy who is
sitting in the director's chair

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.090
and she says-- so that's what
I would draw and then all

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.440
of the dialog that was in the
books went right into the comics.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.010
So this is what they looked
like when I was done with them.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.250
And you might notice that something
is missing which is the color.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.110
All of my comics used to
be in black and white.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.200
So, we didn't think it was
too strange for me to publish

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.520
"The Baby-Sitters Club"
comics in black and white.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.860
But, of course, 10 years later
we realize that kids really do

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.400 position:56%
like to read color comics so these
books have been republished in color

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.690 position:56%
by Scholastic just recently and it's
the same colorist who worked with me

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.990
on "Sisters" and "Ghosts."

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.980
His name is Braden Lamb
and he is fantastic.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.520
So it's been really amazing to see
these books get sort of a new life.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.470
And in fact, people always
want to know if there are more

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.910
"Baby-Sitters Club" graphic
novels coming and I say there are

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.000
but I'm not going to be
the person to draw them.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.940
So, but here's what's amazing.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.320
They're being drawn by an
artist named Gale Galligan.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.320
She used to be my assistant.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.700
So, she's somebody who's
very near and dear to me

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.240
and she's an amazing artist

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.480
and I think the first book
comes out next summer.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.930
So this is going to be done

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.780
in the impossible three
BSC graphics number five.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.790
So I think you guys will
like that a lot too.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.170
So let me talk about "Smile."

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.970
Thanks.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.250
[ Applause ]

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.550
So "Smile" is kind of the book

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.650
that changed my life
and it's a true story.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.060
And for those of you that
haven't read "Smile,"

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.830
I'm going to summarize it for you.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.820 position:56%
So one evening, after a Girl Scout's
meeting, I was in sixth grade,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.740
I was running home with two of my
friends and I tripped and I fell

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.080
and I knocked out my two front
permanent teeth and then I had

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.040
to spend the rest of
middle school and half

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.340
of high school without them.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.100
And that meant dealing with
surgery and braces and head gear

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.930
and false teeth and
all sorts of things

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.700
that made me feel like
I was a freak.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.530 position:56%
And do you guys want to see a
photograph of what that looked like?

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.070
If you don't, I'm really sorry,
I'm going to show it to you anyway.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.680
So, what happened was I fell and I
knocked one tooth completely out.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.980
It was lying on the pavement.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.340
And the other one got
shoved up into my gum.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.630
And then my dentist's
solution to that problem was

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.310
to put them both back in place.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:19.490
But when he did so, as you can see,
suddenly my two front teeth sat

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.150
up a little higher in my mouth
than they were supposed to.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.230
I think the bones above my
teeth had been damaged as well.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.460
So all of a sudden, I have
this weird gap in the front

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.220
that made me look a little
bit like a vampire and that's

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.250
where I got the name
Vampire Girl and that's

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.530
when people started teasing me
and asking me what was wrong

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.970
with my face and why
I look so weird.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.440
And I was already sort of a
self-conscious kid to begin with.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.740
I was very shy.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.080
So having people up in my face
all the time when I was already

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.410 position:56%
like going through puberty and stuff
was not exactly the way I wanted

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.600
to spend sixth grade, but
I did not have a choice.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.160
So, the story has a
lot of dentistry in it.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.940
This scene, I'm getting an
impression of my mouth made

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.120 position:56%
which means that it's that tray
full of sticky stuff that they shove

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.760
up into your mouth and
then you have to lie there

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.630
and wait while it hardens and
it's horrible and you're gagging.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.900
But then when you spit it out, you
got a perfect mold of your teeth

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.020
and that part is kind of cool.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.360
In this scene, I got a set
of false teeth on a retainer

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.970
that looked really good normal when
I had it in, but when I popped it

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.910
out I could scare my friends.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.480
That part was fun.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.650 position:56%
And there's a flashback sequence to
the time I lost my first front tooth

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.360
as a six-year-old kid in a
carnival in a bounce house

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.660
and everything was great.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.960
I was bouncing.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.880
I was having a super fun
time until I got too close

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.100
to the netting that's on the
side of the bounce house.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.380
So I bounced up and when I
bounced down my front tooth hooked

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.100
on the net and went
flying into the air.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.400
And because it's happening

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.050
in a gravel parking lot,
I never found my tooth.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.340
So people always want to
know if this is a true story.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.640
Did this thing really happen?

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.940
Did that part really happen?

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.240
Is your name really Raina?

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.540
Do you really have brown hair?

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.840
Oh my gosh!

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.140
Everything is real.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.440
Everything is true.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.280
I do sometimes alter details.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.090
So for example, on--
in the first chapter

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.190
of "Smile" I learn I need
braces in the afternoon.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.850
I go to a Girl Scout meeting.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.000
We talked about it and at
that night I trip and fall

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.300
and knock out my two front teeth.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.630
That did not all happen
on the same day.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.780
So, for the sake of the
timeline of the story,

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.290
sometimes I will compress details,
sometimes I change people's names

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.270
to protect the guilty, as we say.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.360
But my family is real, so am I.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.870
And so this is us as
comic strip characters.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.170
They think that's pretty cool.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.700
My friends are a slightly
different story.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.330
Now these are the people who
teased me and called me names

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.000
and bullied me just a little bit.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.770
But I managed to represent
almost all of them in the story.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.400
Like I said, some names were
changed to protect the guilty.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.430
And then after "Smile," oh,
well, before I talk about that,

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.540 position:56%
I'm going to tell you that the other
thing that's real is my clothing.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.300
So kids, ask your parents to
dig up their photos from 1991

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.740
and I guarantee you, they will
also have some acid washed denim

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.590
and some scrunchies and
hopefully some mock turtlenecks.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:01.180
Oh yeah. So after "Smile" I
wrote a book called "Drama"

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.630
and this was my first
stab at fiction,

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.880 position:56%
but it's only just so fictionalized.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.630
So, it's about a girl named
Callie and her two best friends,

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:12.050
Jesse and Justin, who are
twin gay Filipino boys,

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.080
and I happen to also
have best friends

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.900
who are gay twin Filipino boys.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.830
So, I mean their names aren't
Jesse and Justin but it's basically

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.780
like our friendship except
fictionalized and put into a book.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.670
And these kids are all on the
stage crew at their school

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.380 position:56%
and that means they are the ones who
are running the lights and the sound

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.150
and making costumes and props.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.700
And I always like to stop here and
give props to the people over there

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.000
who are running my tech

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.430
because without them I would
not be standing here right now.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.310
Thank you, guys.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.610
[ Applause ]

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.220
Stage crew is a really
important job.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.270
And these are the kids
who love to do it.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.980
So, I wanted to make a
story about those kids.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.700 position:56%
And it's kind of inspired by my life

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.130
and that I was definitely a musical
theater and stage kid when I was

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.290
in high school and middle school,
but I was never the leading lady.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.640
I was always in the ensemble, which
is the kids who stand back here

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.260
and like sing three lines in the
show and not the whole thing.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.580
So I get cast as like
aristocrat number seven

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.220
or hobo number three or a child.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.840 position:56%
So I'm not behind the podium because
I am almost the same height as it.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.400
I'm very short.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.770
So, I spent a lot of time
backstage just kind of observing

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.790
and being aware of what
was going on during shows

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.590
and that was always
really cool to me.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.320
I wanted to sort of
capture that essence.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.190
This is also one of the
things that inspired "Drama."

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.920
I was in student government
in school and I was--

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.510
had a role called the art
commissioner which means that most

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.320
of what my job was was to
paint big posters for dances.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.900
So this is me and my friend Jake
who's totally the inspiration

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.200
for Jesse.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.500
I totally had a crush on him.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.220
He totally did not
have a crush on me.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.580
That was weird.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.880
It's a little awkward.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.580
But yeah, if you read
"Drama" you have a little bit

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.810
of a sense of why that was.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.410
So-- and here's Callie painting.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:00.100
She's making a gigantic
tree prop for her school.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.810
And this is a tree prop I made
one time for my Girl Scout play.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.840
It's just like a little
cylinder tube of paper

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.510
with like pipe cleaners and
leaves and stuff at the top.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.190
So after "Smile" and after "Drama,"
people were just like we want

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.210
to hear more stories
about your life.

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.970
And I realized that there was
one page in "Smile" that talked

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.810
about a road trip my family
took when I was a kid.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.680
We drove from San Francisco
to Colorado.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.080
And what an eventful trip it was

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.300
and I've realized I can
make an entire book based

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.800
on that experience.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.290
So that's what "Sisters" is.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.840
It's about being stuck
in the back seat

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.950 position:56%
of your car with your little sister.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.760
And in my case, it was also a
chance to examine my relationship

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.510
with Amara, which like I said
we're both artists and that's one

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.040
of the only things
we have in common.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.760
We're very different people.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.460
And I wanted to understand
us a little bit better.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.100
So it goes back into our lives
and we talked about what it was

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.130
like to have her as a baby.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.200
And then as we grew up, I guess one
of the things you could say we had

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.390
in common was all of
our childhood pets

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:00.580
and the misbegotten
ways that they've died.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.040
So, here's a picture where
you see how excited we are

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.670
to get our first goldfish
and then a photo

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.740
that tells you how exciting
goldfish actually are.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.070
Amara loves snakes
and I hate snakes.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.750
And the reason I hate them so
much is because when I was little,

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.250
my family went camping and I was
picking blackberries and I was

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.590
like in the middle of the patch
and then I accidentally stepped

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.070
on something rubbery and looked out

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.700
and there was a dead
snake under my sandal.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.390
So I ran out of there and I had all
scratched and scraped up by thorns.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.220
My family thought it was hilarious

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.460
and I did not think
it was hilarious.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.390 position:56%
But my sister was like "I am totally
getting a snake for a pet someday,"

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.810
and I was like "You
are totally not."

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.110
And then my parents totally bought
it for her and they promised me

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.420
that it would never bother me.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.950
I would never have to see
it or feed it or touch it.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:48.350
It would definitely never get out
of its cage or anything like that.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.150
Well, if you bought this book
you know the snake does get

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.680
out of its cage and it
got into my family's car

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.250
and then it stayed
there for six months.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.860
I didn't even know snakes could
do that but apparently they can.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.300
We thought maybe it had gotten out.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.020
We thought it must have died.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.480
No, it did not.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.960
And of course, the snake story
and the road trip story intersect

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.990
in this delightful space.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.460
So I'm not going to say anymore
about that because I want to talk

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.720
about my book "Ghosts" which
has just been out for a little

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.670
over a week and it's already like
I'm meeting kids who were like

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.240
"This is my favorite book
that you've written."

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.110
I'm just like "Wow, did
you read it like today?"

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.660
And they're like "Yeah, I've
read it in your signing line."

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.480
So, that's supper awesome

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.950
but it also took me two
years to make this book.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:39.110
So, it's the curse and the blessing
of being a graphic novelist.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.990
I'm grateful either ways.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.030
It's been a really fun week
and I've been on book tour

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.750
and haven't been home
for about two weeks.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.020
So, it's really amazing
to be standing in front

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.760
of you guys today talking about it.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.060
So this book has actually
existed longer than two years.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.720 position:56%
It's been in my head for a very long
time and these sketches that are

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.740
in the back of the
book, I did in 2008.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.500
And I have been thinking about
these characters for a lot longer.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.630
So it's about this girl Cat who's
11 and her little sister Maya

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.810
who has cystic fibrosis and, of
course, they moved to the town

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:09.170
of Bahia de la Luna because they
think that the sea air is going

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.770
to better for Maya's lungs.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.760
And Bahia de la Luna is not a
real place but it's inspired

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.290
by a place called Half Moon Bay,

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.650
California which is not too
far from where I grew up.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:22.480
And it's this very
windswept beachy, foggy place.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.620
It's very cool and mysterious.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.380
They also have a lot
of pumpkin farms there.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.900
So it's where you go for Halloween
in order to get your pumpkins.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.430
And I always thought what a
cool place to set a story.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.130
What a cool place to set
a ghost story, in fact.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.790
So that's what I did and these
are just some of my old sketches,

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.770
sort of trying to capture
the atmosphere of the place.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.730
So the girls moved there and
Cat is not happy about it.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.720
She doesn't want to
leave her friends behind.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.750
They're from Southern
California where it's much warmer

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.450
so she doesn't like
the cold weather.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:50.750
That's another thing she and I have

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.280
in common is I'm not
a huge fan of the fog.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.580
But one of the first thing

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.040 position:56%
that happens is they meet their
neighbor Carlos who explains to them

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.240
that the town is haunted and
it is filled with ghosts.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.110
And Maya's really excited to
meet a ghost and that's probably

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.740
because she's not a healthy kid.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.350
So, she wants to know
what's going to happen

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.840
to her if she happens to die.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.210
And Cat, who's a little bit
more like me, is very anxious

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.750
and she's worried and she doesn't
want to meet the ghosts at all

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.420
because she's afraid that
they're going to harm her sister.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.100
So, they go anyway and they go

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.430
up to this old mission that's
near their house and that's

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:25.730
where they're looking for ghosts.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.870
Cat is completely losing her mind
and super afraid and then she ends

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.820
up being the first
one to see a ghost.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.480
And then she gets to know
the ghost a little bit.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.590
And this is what happens when
you're scared of something.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.310
Sometimes if you confront your fear
or you get to know it a little bit,

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.800 position:56%
you might be surprised that it's not
quite as scary as you think it is.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.130
So Cat gets to know the ghost and
then the next thing she knows,

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.100
they're becoming her friends
and they're having fun together.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.570
So, that's just one of the themes
in this story and it was inspired

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.890
by a lot of different things in
my life, but it was definitely

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.180
about confronting fear and anxiety.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.550
So here's a couple of
photographs that I took

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.620
when I was researching the book
and doing my location scouting,

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.020
just like you would for a film.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:08.170
I took lots and lots of photographs
of beach towns and, you know,

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.240
the cliffs above the
ocean and really tried

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.840
to get this atmosphere
into my stories.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.370
And this is me at one of missions.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.380
There are 21 missions in California

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.350
and you can go and
visit most of them.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.340
And I believe this
is in Mission Carmel.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.640
And when you're there,

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.750
you can almost feel history
everywhere around you.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.510
You can sort of feel the ghosts.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.990
And so again, that was something
I wanted to capture in this story.

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:33.160
So, very quickly, I'm just going
to tell you about my process

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.820
because this is something
people are very curious about.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.180
They want to talk to me about it.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.310
But it's actually easier
to show how I work

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.140 position:56%
because my entire process is visual.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.440
So when I write stories,
this is what they look like.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.740
Yes, that's right.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.020
I write in a visual
format called thumbnails

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.680 position:56%
which is what you see on the screen.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.480
So a thumbnail simply means like a
rough draft version or a blueprint

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.770
or a sketch of every single page

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.880
where you're indicating
the panel borders.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.730
The characters are stick figures.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.420
All of the dialog is there.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.720
All of the sound effects are there.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.810
And this is a great way for me
to see how comics are paced out.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.110
And as you guys saw
with the reading,

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:13.570
there's a lot of silent panels and
there's a lot of sort of panels

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.740
where a sound effect and the
pictures do a lot of the talking.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.040
So that's how write.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.960
This is how my ideas come out
off my head and onto the page.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.980
And then once I am done with
those, I've done an entire book

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.700
of thumbnails, 250 pages.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.090
I send them to my editor
and we edit from this stage.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.920
So that's where I go to
make my corrections too.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.460
I just redraw my thumbnails.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.240
So depending on the book
that takes-- I've done--

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.080
I thumbnailed "Sisters"
in a month which is crazy.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.050
Most of the time, it takes
me anywhere between two

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.060
and six months to create a script.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.120
And then once I'm done with
that, I move on to pencils.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.590
And for this, I'm using a type
of paper called Bristol board

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.570
which is just a little
bit thicker and smoother

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:52.610
and heavier than regular paper.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.340
And here, I'm simply spending
more time on the artwork.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.870
So, I'm going to go back a slide

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.130
and show you guys what
my thumbnails look like

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:01.720
and you can compare
that to the final art.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.310
It's all of the same information.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:06.550
It's just that I have spent
more time creating the art.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.760
And then directly over
that same piece of paper,

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.990
I ink and I am still very
old school and traditional.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.580
I use a water color brush.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.710
For those who of you that are
like "What kind of brush is it,"

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.960
it's a Winsor &amp; Newton Series
7 Sable brush number 2 size.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.050
And if you're like what, it's
on my website goraina.com,

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.520
so you can check it out there.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.240
And type of India ink?

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.200
It's waterproof that I really
like and then a small liner pen

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.480
for things like eyeballs, shirt
buttons, really small details.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.570
And then everything looks like
that when all is set and done.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.460 position:56%
So I told you that "Ghosts" took two
years and that's time at the desk.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.760
That's not time thinking about it.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.480
It's two years to actually
create the book.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.040
Each "Baby-Sitters Club"
book took one year to create

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.060
and "Smile" took me five years
from start to finish to create.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.370
So I always tell people I hope
you're not an impatient person

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:56.040
if you want to make comics because
it does require you to be patient.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.340
But for me, it's worthwhile.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.640
It's my art form.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.940
I love it the best.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.410
It's my favorite way
to tell stories.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.650
So everything got scanned into a
computer and now I bring the files

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.540
into a program called Photoshop.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.800
This is where I make
all of my corrections.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.160
This is where the coloring
gets done.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.740
And I don't do my own color work.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.050
I work with a guy named Braden
Lamb, who does my colors

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:16.690
and it's really awesome
seeing my pages kind of come

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.250
to life once they get colored.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.430
And then everything gets
assembled digitally.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.070
So, the lettering gets put in

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:27.070
and the page numbers
and stuff like that.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.070
And then, we also work
on the covers this way.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.300
I mean I do a sketch and
then the publisher picks one

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.610
and then I work it up
into a finished sketch

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.280
and then a finished piece art.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.660
We put all the title
font and somewhat

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.830
in this great package the
whole thing is digital.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.970
We send the files to Asia and
they're printed in Singapore.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.360
And then the books come back on a
boat and that takes a while too.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.150
But holding your book for the first
time in your hands never gets old.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.560
I have created eight books
to this point in my career

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.190
and every time a new one
comes out I'm just like wow.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.900 position:56%
It's like I had a baby or something.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.200
No, it's nothing like that.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.580
I've actually never had
a baby, so I don't know.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.290
But I can only imagine that
you've put so much love and care

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.840
into this thing, into making
this thing, and then it arrives

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.380
and then it's kind of like--
it takes on a life of its own.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.180
Each of my books definitely
has a life of its own.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.050 position:56%
People always want to know what is
my favorite book that I have created

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.530
and it is like saying
taking your favorite child.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.380
Like you just-- how
could you do that?

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:24.720 position:56%
Some of you are like "No, I could
do that," but I don't think I could.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.130
You love them all.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.430
So what's next?

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.710
I mean I've had a book
out for a week and a half.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.670
So, like shouldn't I take
a little bit of time off?

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.790
Of course not, that's not how
it works in this business.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.390
We're always thinking
about what's next.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:39.940
So for me, it's going to be-- this
is just a big spoiler for you guys.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.310
I'm going to do another memoir and
this one's going to be about me

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:46.960
and my dad and a certain
book that he gave me to read

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.990
when I was 10 years old and how
that book changed my entire life.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.920
So, that's all I can
say about it for now.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.570
This is about as much
as I've got done,

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.470
maybe 20, 25 pages of thumbnails.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.430
And so you can see us
going to the bookstore

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.230
at San Francisco State
University where he used to teach.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.340
And then we're gigging out
together in the comic book section.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.630
And I don't have a
title for this book yet,

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.380
but it should be out
some time in 2018.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.410
So, cross your fingers
for me that my hand hold

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.780
out for you all this process.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.690
Yeah, and I plan to
never stop doing this.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:21.050
If I can do this my entire
life I absolutely plan to.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.730
It's an absolute joy.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.310
I'm so happy I get
to work for you guys.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.330
And it's just been a great ride.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.510
So, thank you so much.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:40.450
[ Applause ]

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.880
What's the time?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.180
Five minutes.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.480
OK, we have time for
just a few questions.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.000
So if you've got questions
we're going

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.200
to go this side and then this side.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.230
Make them as quick as
you can and I will try

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.680
to answer as many as possible.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:58.350
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
book that you wrote?

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:02.060
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: I can't
answer that question because it's

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.360
like choosing your favorite child.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.810
I like them all.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.340
Yes?

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:12.790
&gt;&gt; What advice do you have for
younger artists and writers?

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.060
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: It's the same
advice for any person of any age.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.360
Start small.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.500
Don't try to write
a long story first.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.910 position:56%
Try writing a short story and seeing
what your characters interact like.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:27.120 position:56%
And then, you can write longer and
longer stories as you pick up steam.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.420
Hi.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.080
&gt;&gt; I would like to know
what were your emotions

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.300
when you were writing
the book "Smile."

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.600
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: My emotions.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.120
Pretty much the same thing

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.200
as what the character is
going through on the page.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.690
In fact, when I'm drawing
and if you look at me,

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.580
I'm like making the same
faces as the characters

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.030
and I'm feeling all this emotion.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.040 position:56%
If it's a memoir, I'm like
remembering everything that happened

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.420 position:56%
to me and I'll be like really
depressed like, damn, my friends are

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.750
so mean to me, but then you finish
the book and you feel great.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.600
So it's kind of like
living to it all over again

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.460
but then I felt better
when I was done.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.970
&gt;&gt; Did you and your sister really
fight as much as in "Sisters"?

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:06.270
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
Do you have a sister?

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:08.870
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: How
much do you guys fight?

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.170
&gt;&gt; I have three sisters.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.470
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: And
do you guys fight as much

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.770
as the characters in the story?

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.070
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.370
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Then yeah.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:16.670
Sisters have a way.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.970
Hi.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.000
&gt;&gt; So in your book "Ghosts,"

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.640
you had the little sister
who had cystic fibrosis.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.350
And my cousin has cystic fibrosis
and not many people know about it.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.870
So I was wondering
how did you like find

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:33.140 position:56%
out about cystic fibrosis and stuff.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: I have a friend
whose cousin has cystic fibrosis

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.780
and systematically, it worked
really well with the story

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.880
because the story is about a girl
who can't breathe and her sister

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.120
who has anxiety and the sister has
to be reminded sometimes to like OK

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.400
and it's Maya who's telling
her to stop and breathe.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.940
And then ghosts, and of course
this is fiction so I had

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.770
to make my own mythology up here.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.510
It's like, well, ghosts
can't breathe either.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.780 position:56%
So Maya finds that she has
something in common with the ghosts.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.990
But ghosts absorb the world around
them and that becomes their breath

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:11.570
and I think Maya kind of breathes
emotionally for a lot of people.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.870
Hi.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:18.280
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, how did your friends
and family react to "Smile"

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.240
like how you portrayed them in it?

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.990
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: My dad will be
like, "That's not what happened."

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.090
But the thing is like
it's my memories

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:27.930
and since I'm the one
that's writing the story--

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:32.570
I sometimes confer with my
family on specific details,

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.600
but every person is
going to remember it

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.080 position:56%
and say it a little bit differently.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.270
So, we get a jest of it, right?

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:40.640
And what I like to tell
people is that even

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.180
if the facts aren't 100% true,
what you remember and your emotions

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.280
about that thing are always true.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.380
&gt;&gt; Would you ever consider
animating movie from your books?

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.680
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: I
don't know how to animate.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.150 position:56%
So if somebody else wanted to do it,

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.000
if anybody in this room
is an animator and wants

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.810
to animate it, we can
talk afterwards.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.300
That'd be amazing.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.820
&gt;&gt; Did any of the old friends that
you have that you wrote about in

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.920
"Smile," did any of them
realize that it was about them

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.260
and talk to you about it?

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.560
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Yes.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.730
I've gotten letters of
apology from a few of them.

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.760
Some of them didn't realize it was
them though which is really awkward

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.980
because we're still like
Facebook friends and stuff.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.280
Hi.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.330
&gt;&gt; Hi. Well, first, thank you for
inviting me up for the excerpt.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: You're amazing.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:29.690
And for my question, at the end
of "Ghosts" you said that you were

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:35.200
at the Day of the Dead celebration
and did you actually see ghosts

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.930
like Cat did in the book?

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.710
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: No, I
did not actually see ghosts.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.350
This is a fictional story.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:45.430
You can imagine them
being there for sure.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.730
&gt;&gt; OK. Is it fun?

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:48.030
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Absolutely.

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:51.970
It's fun but it's also a
really respectful celebration

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.610
where people are all there
for their own reasons

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.040 position:56%
but you're experiencing it together.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:01.390 position:56%
So, I was not sad but I felt all of
these sort of togetherness and a lot

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.000
of emotion from all
the people around me.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.550
So in fact, the scene
that's in the book,

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.900
I waited until after I had been
to that celebration to draw it

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.220
because I wanted to capture
my own experiences there.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:14.110
So you know how Cat's in the
story and she's just like "Whoa!"

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.410
&gt;&gt; That makes perfect sense.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:16.710
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
That's how I felt.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:18.010
Well, thanks.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.310
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:20.610
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Oh, thanks.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.910
Hi.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.600
&gt;&gt; Hi. So I was wondering, if
you were like any kind of food

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.480
that is grown up that you
make, but if you were a food

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.250
that was grown what kind
of food would you be?

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:29.550
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Food.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.050
Oh, I can't say pizza, can I?

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.350
&gt;&gt; No.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.650
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Asparagus.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:34.950
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.250
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: It's like
some people's most hated vegetable

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:37.550
but I love it.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:38.850
&gt;&gt; OK. Thank you.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.150
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Hi.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:41.450
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite thing
when you were a Girl Scout?

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.170
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
About the Girl Scouts?

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.370
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Can you guess?

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:47.670
&gt;&gt; Cookies?

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:48.970
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Yup.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.270
Definitely.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:51.570
Hi.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.450
&gt;&gt; What was the most inspiring
comic you read as a kid?

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Oh, men, I mean
"For Better or For Worse," "Calvin

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.630
and Hobbes," "Luann," "FoxTrot,"
"Bizarro," "Dennis the Menace."

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.690
I didn't read "Peanuts" until
I was a little older but I find

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.060
that to be very inspiring too.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.260
And then I started reading
indie comics like "Bone"

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.340
and that one inspired
the heck out of me.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.640
Hi.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.620
&gt;&gt; Do you and Amara still get
along or do you get along?

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.920
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: We don't live

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.800
in the same city anymore,
so we get along great.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.720
Actually we do, we get
along really well now.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.510
I see now how much
we have in common.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.810
Hi.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.110
&gt;&gt; When you're drawing your comics,

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.610
what's the hardest
detail you have to do?

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:34.910
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Cars.

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.360
Cars are hard to draw
and that's why I don't

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.910
like to write too many comics.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.270
Wait, I did write a
comic about being

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:41.860 position:56%
on a road trip, what was I thinking?

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.970
I don't draw comics about horses.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.390
There's a reason for that.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:47.690
Hi.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:51.490
&gt;&gt; Is it a stressful
or a happy progress

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.030
when you're making the comics?

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: It can be both.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.320
Mostly, it's fun but
it's like any other job.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.530
You really do have to
show up and put in a lot

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.550
of hours every day and
my hand gets tired.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.080
That's one of the most
stressful parts.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.960
And also, sometimes, if I'm trying
to like think of how a story ends

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.880
and I can't do it, I'm just like,
oh no, what am I going to do?

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.520
But then, you know, you
run of time and you just go

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.270
with whatever comes
up in your brain.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.570
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:17.870
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Hi.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.750
&gt;&gt; When you finish one
of your graphic novels,

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:25.090
do you ever celebrate or
like rejoice or anything?

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:29.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: I had an orange
soda when I finished "Ghosts."

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.590
You are jumping up and down.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.900
&gt;&gt; How do you think of names for
people who didn't really exist?

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.500
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
That's a good question.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:43.940
Catrina is named after La
Catrina which is an illustration

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.830
of a skeleton lady that was
done by a guy named Posada

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:51.560
and so she's actually a
very famous paint or image.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.060
And then Maya's name comes from--
I've met a lot of kids named Maya

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.360
and they're always
kind of like cute.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.660 position:56%
They're usually jumping up and down.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.970
And I just think Maya
is an awesome name.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:02.460
And Callie comes from
the State of California,

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.760
which is really embarrassing.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.240
I don't know if the adults will
notice this song "Going Back

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:12.620
To Cali" by LL Cool J. I was--
When I was brainstorming that book,

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.000
I was in the car like driving
around my parents' neighborhood

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.390
and that song came on
the radio and I was

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:19.460
like that's it, her name is Callie.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:24.170
&gt;&gt; Are you going to write any
more books about your life?

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:25.810
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Well,
the next one I'm working

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.800
on is definitely going
to be about life.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.980
And then the two after that
that I have contracted,

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.340
I can't talk too much about right
now, but I do have three more books

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.960 position:56%
that are going to be coming out from
Scholastic in the next six years.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.930
So at least one will be a memoir.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.230
Yeah.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.010
[ Applause ]

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.020
See you guys in 2022.

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.320
Hi.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.590
&gt;&gt; What happens when
you get writer's block?

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:53.890
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Good question.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:57.150 position:56%
Probably the same thing that
happens when you get writer's block,

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.670
you're just like what
am I going to do?

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.360
So sometimes I just try to step
away from my desk for a while.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.050
So I go to the beach or I go hiking
in the mountains or I get in my car

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:09.880
and I drive around and I listen
to LL Cool J. But you know what,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.980
inspiration is everywhere
and you'll never know

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.010
when something is going
to inspire you.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.720 position:56%
So, I try to read a lot of books, I
try to watch a lot of TV and movies,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.640
I try to meet lots of
people and go lots of places

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.320
and things inspire me everywhere.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.670
&gt;&gt; Good to know.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.600
&gt;&gt; Are you afraid of ghosts?

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.090
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: I don't know
if I believe that ghosts exist.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:34.720
So it's hard to be afraid of
something that doesn't exist.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:41.790
Yeah. If I knew they did exist,
I'd be extremely afraid of them.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:43.200
That's why they look like snakes.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.030
Did you notice the-- so maybe
there's a connection there.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.330
Hi.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.890
&gt;&gt; How much books have you wrote?

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.190
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
I've written eight books.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:54.380
That's four "Baby-Sitters Club"
books and then "Smile," "Drama,"

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.420
"Sisters," and, wait, "Ghosts."

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.910
Did I say that one?

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.180
Yeah, eight books total.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.760
&gt;&gt; That's a lot.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.380
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
Thank you, thank you.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.680
Hi.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.510
&gt;&gt; Do you ever write out the script

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:15.120
of what people are saying
before you draw the comics?

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Sometimes I do,
sometimes I will sit down and type

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.710
out dialog just because
I can hear it

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.750
in my head faster than
I can draw it.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.410 position:56%
But for the most part, like I showed
you guys, my scripts are thumbnails.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:29.330
So they are just sort of
the grid of different panels

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.160
and then the characters'
heads almost need

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.930
to be there sometimes
before I could figure

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.270
out what's coming out
of their mouths.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.190
I need to see it in order
to be able to hear it.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:40.020
But yes, I do have a notebook
and I'm always listening

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.390
to people taking around
me and just the way

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.110
that people talk sometimes
gives me ideas.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.390
So, you never know guys.

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:48.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:49.990
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Sure.

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.290
Hi.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:53.260
&gt;&gt; Other than in "Smile" and
"Sisters," which character

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.260
in your book represents
you the best?

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.970
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: So you mean in
my memoirs or in my fictional work?

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.320
&gt;&gt; In your fictional work.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Well, Callie is
a little bit like me but she's kind

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.930
of more like who I wish I was, like
she is great at getting an idea

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.630
and then seeing it all
the way to completion.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.190
And then Cat and I share anxiety.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:15.060
So, she is a lot-- she's worried
about stuff a lot and I admit

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.600
that I am, too, but I'm trying to
work on getting better about that.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.330
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.550
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to
write about your family?

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.680
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Them.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.040
We have so many stories and I
mean the reason I started writing

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.540
about my life was I have
this horrible dental accident

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.000
when I was 11 and it was a story
I was telling people constantly.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.700
So people would be like,
"What happened to your teeth,"

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.880
and I'd be like, "Let me tell
you what happened on my teeth."

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.590 position:56%
And then as I got older, the fake
teeth that I had in my mouth started

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:47.670
to turn a little bit gray so
sometimes people are like,

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.290
"What's wrong with the teeth
in front of your mouth?

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:50.590
They look different."

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:53.020
So I had to explain and every
time I saw a different dentist,

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.580
I had to explain and I was like
I have explained this story

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.510
so may times, what if I just
like wrote the whole thing down?

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:02.090
Yeah. That way, I wouldn't
have to explain it so much.

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:05.750 position:56%
So I did. I just wrote my story down
and I realized that it's a great way

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.700
to sort of deal with your memories

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.570
and like stuff that's
troubling you even.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.840 position:56%
You can write it down and then you
feel better about it afterwards, so.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.440
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Sure.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.740
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.040
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Hi.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.330
&gt;&gt; If you're like writing a
story about your true life then

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.360
if you're trying to
remember what they're saying,

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.060
do you have to like write the exact
thing or do you just like make it

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.400
up if you don't remember

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.890
but you have a general
idea of what they said?

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.190
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Yes.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.490
That's exactly what I do.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:39.180
There is no way I could
possibly remember the exact words

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.510
that we said to each other.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.930
Although, I mean you guys have
access, I'm sure, to like videos

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:46.590
that your parents have been taking
since you're a little kid, right?

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:48.460
And I have just a few of those.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.340
I only have one video
of myself as a kid

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.350
because my grandfather
had this big video camera.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:56.830
It's like five minutes of video
of me in my entire childhood.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:58.350
But I have a lot of photographs

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.590
and that's how the writer
brain works is you're just

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.460
like I can imagine
what we were saying

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.850
to each other when we were young.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:06.150
&gt;&gt; Oh, OK.

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.450
Thanks.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:08.750
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Sure.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:12.050
&gt;&gt; Do you plan on writing any
sequels to any of your books

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.110
like "Ghosts" or "Drama"?

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.390
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Sequels
are tricky, and I'm not somebody

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:18.710
who thinks in terms of series.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.640
I'm really somebody who thinks
in terms of individual stories.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:25.280
So, I feel like I say everything
I want to say about the characters

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.570 position:56%
and their lives and their situations
before the last page is turned.

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:30.620
I don't like the idea
of cliffhangers.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.760
But that's not to say that
I would never write a story

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.060
that had the same characters.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.600
So you know how "Smile" and
"Sisters" are companion books

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.820
but it's not like exactly
what happened next.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.290
There's always a possibility
that I could do

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.730
that with one of my
other stories too.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:44.030
&gt;&gt; OK. Thanks.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.360
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Like
Callie in high school.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.660
Oh man, that is so cool.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.810
Somebody asked me today if Callie
would be a Hamilton fan and I was

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:53.230
like Callie would be like
tweeting at Lin-Manuel

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.730
like on a constant daily basis
trying to get him to like come

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.970 position:56%
to her school and hang out with her.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:03.000
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
thing about Amara?

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.100
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: No one's ever
asked me that question before,

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:11.250
but I never had to think
about it before, so.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:14.230
She's one of the smartest
people I've ever met.

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.670
She's one of the most
talented people I've ever met.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:21.640
And she's a really good
friend to her friends.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.080
She cares about her friends
more than just about anything.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.630
So, there's a lot I
admire about my sister.

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.600
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.040
&gt;&gt; Will you ever make
any movies about "Smile,"

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.030
"Sisters," "Drama," and everything?

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:35.330
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
Well, I'm not a filmmaker.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:37.560
So, if anybody here is a
filmmaker and they want to talk

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.130
to me afterwards, that's fine.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.790
I would love that.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.850
That'd be awesome.

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.720
You should become a
filmmaker, how about that?

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.020
&gt;&gt; That's my dream.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.320
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Awesome.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.940
OK. We'll talk afterwards,
handshakes and business cards.

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.240
I love this.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.540
Hi.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.390
&gt;&gt; Hi. My parents said
I might get braces soon.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.800
Do you have any like
advice about that?

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.110
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: If
it's OK with your parents,

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:02.400
just take some pain reliever
before you go and then ask

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.630
if they'll get you a
milkshake when it's all over.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:07.420
It's really not that bad.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.000
And my situation was
extremely unusual.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.210
I had a big accident so, of
course, my dentistry work was going

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.110
to be a little bit more
extreme than most people's.

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:18.450
Most people, and you guys can
confirm this, it's like you're sore

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:20.740
for a few days and you kind of have
to get used to it but then you do

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:25.190
and then it's just kind of
normal part of your mouth.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:26.490
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.000
&gt;&gt; Hello. I just--
when I was standing,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.820
I have this weird idea
for a question.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.350
You should write a book about
how you are now, like because--

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:36.810
like your fans and everything.

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.010
If you are [inaudible] with
me, they also want to--

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.310
[ Laughter ]

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:44.270
I also would like to bring out how
much I enjoyed your book "Ghosts"

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.820
because I feel like sort
of like me and my sister.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:51.010
I'm just full of energy
and she's not.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.670
[ Laughter ]

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:54.870
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Oh
men, I can relate to that.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:56.170
Thanks.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:57.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:58.770
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Thank you.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.070
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:01.370
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Well, there's
not much to say except thanks.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:02.670
Hi.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:03.970
&gt;&gt; Have you ever thought
about writing a book

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.670
when you first published
your first comic?

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.970
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: Oh,
yes, I did think about that.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:13.300
And I might be reading about that
at some point in the near future.

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.810
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:22.670
&gt;&gt; What would you be if
you couldn't be an author?

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:26.990
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: I
have no idea to be honest.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:30.510
But this is kind of a shout
out and it's also kind

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:35.380 position:56%
of something I've realized is that
I work with people called publicists

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.720
at my publisher, Scholastic.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.160 position:56%
They are people whose job is to plan
out where authors are going to go

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.880
and then make sure there's like
a car to get them there and they

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.150
like book my flights and then
they talk to all the people

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:49.180
at the bookstores about
like the logistics and stuff

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.580
and that person is a
publicist and it's their job

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:55.050
to make authors' lives easier
when they go out on stage,

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:56.870
the National Book Festival
and stuff like this.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:59.470
So my amazing publicist is named
Sheila Marie and she's here.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.460
She's the one who took the picture.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.110
And Scholastic has really,
really great support.

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.490
So, I think it would
actually be fun to do that job

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:10.050
because I love writing emails to
people and I love looking at maps

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:12.520
and I love like booking
hotel rooms and stuff.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.420
So I'm like, oh, that'd be so fun.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.860
They work super hard though.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.930
So, yeah, maybe a publicist,
I don't know.

00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:20.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:21.530
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier:
For other authors.

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:22.950
I don't have to be
in this spotlight.

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.820
That's the thing.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.120
Hi.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.260
&gt;&gt; So, in "Ghosts," Cat is
superstitious about the black cat.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.550
Did you get the superstitiousness
from you or somebody else?

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:36.490
&gt;&gt; Raina Telgemeier: It's
sort of a common superstition

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.450
that a black cat crossing
your path is bad luck.

00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:42.610
And because her name is Cat,
I think she has this idea

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:44.600 position:56%
that she's bad luck too in some way.

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.680
So, yeah, I was working with
certain common superstitions

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.180
but I was just also creating
her as a unique character.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.160
So, can I do one more question?

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.750
OK, we can do one more question.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.090
I'm so sorry, guys.

00:56:57.090 --> 00:57:01.710
&gt;&gt; What is-- What do you think
the easiest thing to draw is?

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:03.980
&gt;&gt; This is going to sound really
lame when I answer this question.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.020
The easiest thing for
me to draw is me.

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:09.240
But I think that's because I look
at the mirror every single day

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:12.020
and I'm used to the shape of my
face and I've been drawing stories

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.850
about my life since
I was six years old.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.750
So, it's gotten to be very easy
for me to do that but I when I have

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.250
to draw like a new
character, I'm like, whoa,

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.510
this is really difficult
and challenging.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.310
But the more times
you draw a character,

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.290
the easy it get-- easier it gets.

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:28.720
So, yeah. All right.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.010
Thank you, guys, so much.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:32.310
