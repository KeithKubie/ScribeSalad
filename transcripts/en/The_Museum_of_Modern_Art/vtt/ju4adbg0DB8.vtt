00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.310
ART DISCUSSION

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.310
OVERVIEW

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.160
Evelyn: Let’s see if I can describe this
but George today wasn’t in such a good mood

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.270
when we got here and it was very crowded and
he just kinda didn’t wanna go.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.230
And then the minute he started looking at
the art and Carrie pointed things out, he

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.410
just, he got so involved in it and started
looking for things himself.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.309
I was just thinking how it brought something
out for him.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.339
It brought something from the inside out for
him – how he was able to get so involved

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.739
in it and enjoy it so much.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.780
That is made me realize what a special program
this is.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.760
George: It also makes me more able to interact
with the women or the man at the front discussing

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760
with me.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.750
And it makes me much brighter.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.040
I’m a much more outgoing person…I can
still fumble, I still have a problem with

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.329
that, but I can still learn a little bit more
now.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.329
Hello.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:24.329
I am Laurel Humble

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.909
Hi, I'm Meryl Schwartz and we work on The
MoMA Alzheimer's Project within the Department

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.320
of Education at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.090
Funded by a major grant from MetLife Foundation,
The MoMA Alzheimer's Project allows Meryl

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.409
and me and our colleagues in the Department
of Education to develop art discussion and

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.400
art-making programs for people with Alzheimer's
disease and their care-partners.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.021
We teach these programs here onsite in the
Museum's galleries and studio spaces, and

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:57.720
also offsite in care facilities around the
city.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.179
Based on our work with this audience, we also
lead training workshops for arts and health

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.319
professionals, and have developed educational
resources used by staff of museums, care facilities,

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.870
and other community organizations serving
people with dementia and their carepartners.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.090
One of these resources is this video!

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.710
This video is for people involved in dementia
care or museum and arts education who want

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.840
to learn more about how to facilitate a discussion
about art with people with Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.330
It is designed for individuals with varying
personal and professional expertise, who are

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.510
likely working in a variety of settings, each
with their own logistical considerations,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.000
such as spaces, time, and budget.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.220
Accordingly, we've chosen not to focus on
those aspects of programming.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.950
Instead we'll focus on the teaching strategies
and other tools necessary for leading a successful

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.650
discussion, including:

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.670
Some background information, like general
information on dementia and MoMA's program

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.519
structure and approach, and the role of the
educator in creating a successful experience

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.390
How you as an educator prepare to facilitate
an art discussion

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.560
How to lead a discussion about one work of
art (in depth, going through a series of steps

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.380
that prompt a variety of participant response)

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.219
And general tips for facilitating your group
conversation, as well as tools for troubleshooting

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.140
challenging scenarios

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.110
Throughout we'll include program footage and
anecdotes from our experiences.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.579
While our discussion will be framed by our
perspectives as museum educators working with

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.849
groups in the galleries, the techniques we
will discuss are applicable to any setting

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.580
or situation, so long as you can access and
display artworks or reproductions of artworks.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.219
We encourage you to think of about these programs
as an opportunity for you to learn and grow,

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.300
which will inform the decisions you make in
your planning and facilitation.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.870
Throughout we will emphasize the importance
of designing experiences that you, as the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.260
educator, find interesting as well.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.099
In the end we hope that you will feel confident
in your ability to facilitate a meaningful

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.170
discussion that leads to new understanding
about works of art and prompts new social

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.430
connections amongst participants.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.930
ART DISCUSSION

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.430
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.200
In this section, we'll give you some background
information to consider when planning art

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.510
discussion programs for people with Alzheimer's
disease, including what our typical program

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.230
structure includes, benefits of engaging with
art in general, basic information about Alzheimer's

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.840
disease and other forms of dementia, including
which symptoms we most frequently encounter,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.120
and finally, a general overview of what you
can do as an educator to create a successful

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.000
experience.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.220
Let's start with an overview of MoMA's art
discussion programs for individuals with Alzheimer's

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.410
disease and their carepartners.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.380
Our programs typically last about an hour
and a half.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.780
In that time an educator leads conversations
about 4-6 works of art that are connected

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.470
by a theme.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.580
The educator uses inquiry-based discussion
techniques, that is they ask questions, to

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.440
prompt interactions with the works and among
participants.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.950
In addition, our educators share some relevant
art historical information to strengthen the

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.250
group's understanding of the works.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.870
The program structure and the teaching techniques
we use are well established in museum education.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.169
In fact, we use them in MoMA's education programs
for people of all ages and abilities.

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.770
This is because we recognize that engaging
with art through inquiry and discussion allows

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.130
all people the chance to

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.349
Articulate opinions and preferences in a space
where there is no one right answer

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.860
Explore and exchange ideas with others

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.580
Experience intellectual stimulation and come
to new understandings

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.199
Reflect on personal experiences and connect
them to world history and events

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.349
And finally, to participate in a meaningful
activity that fosters personal growth

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.130
These benefits apply no matter who the audience
is, but they are particularly significant

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.580
for individuals with Alzheimer's disease who
might be experiencing a dearth of opportunities

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.330
for cultural engagement and personal development.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.210
With a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease there
can be an assumption that people are no longer

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.600
able to learn or they won't benefit from exposure
to new experiences.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.580
But surely the desire for personal growth
and development remains and participating

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.509
in arts engagement programs can satisfy these
lifelong needs.

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:39.509
&gt;&gt;&gt;

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.250
Moreover artwork is particularly well-suited
for engaging people with Alzheimer's disease

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.580
because it doesn't move or change.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.849
You can refer to it and talk about it without
relying on short term memory.

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:56.470
Short term memory loss is one of the main
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but it isn't

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.990
the only one.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.340
We'll talk about some of the symptoms you
may encounter when working with this audience,

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.970
but first, let's start with the basics:

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.050
Dementia is a general term for a group of
brain disorders.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.610
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form
of dementia.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.900
All types of dementia impair mental functioning
and are severe enough to interfere with usual

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.270
activities of daily life.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:28.260
Dementia may also affect language, visuospatial
functioning and/or executive functioning.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.050
Some of you may already have a great deal
of experience working with people with Alzheimer's

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.520
disease or other forms of dementia, while
others may not.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.909
There are a number of resources you can turn
to to find out more, including your local

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:46.919
medical professionals, hospitals or care facilities,
your local Alzheimer's Association, or the

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.879
National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer's
Disease Education and Referral Center.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:57.669
In our experience, symptoms differ from person
to person and many challenging behaviors can

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:01.520
be circumvented through your planning and
facilitation of the experience, as well as

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.020
the tone you set as the educator.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.760
Overall, these are the symptoms we've most
frequently encountered in our art discussion

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.280
programs for people with early to mid-stage
Alzheimer's disease:

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.520
The first is memory loss.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.550
Forgetting recently learned information is
one of the most common symptoms.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.620
Participants may not remember things you or
other participants have said.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.760
We've also encountered difficulty with language.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.250
At times it can be hard to understand a participant's
words and participants may forget words or

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.630
make unusual substitutions.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.040
Some participants may have lost significant
verbal ability.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.060
We've also experienced difficulties with visuospatial
thinking.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.360
Some participants may have difficulty navigating
your spaces.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:52.210
Similarly, they may have difficulty processing
perspective and depth in a work of art.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.870
Another symptom you may encounter is apathy.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.320
Some participants may need prompting to engage
in certain activities.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.430
At the same time, we've seen a lack of inhibition
and impulse control in some participants.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.700
While some may be more inhibited, others may
be candid or unreserved.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.510
In the Tips and Tools section, we'll discuss
ways of addressing some of these behaviors,

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.800
if they come up.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.560
Though it is important to familiarize yourself
with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.779
other forms of dementia, it should not be
your focus during the program.

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:27.649
In fact, in our programs we never mention
Alzheimer's disease.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:31.850
Our goal is to create an experience where
the presence of the disease is minimized and

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:38.459
people of all abilities are able to engage
and contribute on an equal level.

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:43.029
So in subsequent sections we'll be focusing
mainly on what you can do, as the educator,

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:48.680
to create a successful conversation, one where
all abilities are validated.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.640
But generally speaking, what do successful
educators do?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.050
A successful educator does one or more of
the following at any given point during a

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.050
conversation.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.880
First, they model positive behavior for the
group by setting an inviting tone and by treating

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.279
all participants as equally valid contributors

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:11.540
They lead the discussion by asking questions
and prompting different ways of engaging with

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.910
the work of art

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.070
They also sit back and listen when it's appropriate,
at the same time expressing their interest

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.630
and enthusiasm in participant's responses
and comments.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.870
They also contribute.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.430
They'll contribute art historical information
and also act as a co-participant sharing their

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.540
personal thoughts and opinions from time to
time.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.279
They challenge established ideas about the
work of art, or ideas that the group has generated,

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:40.510
encouraging participants to think larger.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.480
And most importantly, they synthesize all
the ideas that have come up during the discussion

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.940
to form one cohesive conversation.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.040
In subsequent sections we'll talk practically
about how to accomplish all these things,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.570
what they look like, and how they feed into
preparation and facilitation.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.120
All in all, the artworks, participants and
you as the educator are all equal factors

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.589
in the experience.

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:08.320
Together you contribute to a program that
includes:

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.690
Generation and development of ideas

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.880
Validation of individual contributions

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.589
Socialization among participants

00:11:18.589 --> 00:11:20.970
And a general sense of sincerity and enjoyment

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.889
It is important to internalize these ideas
as you move forward as they profoundly affect

00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:30.810
the experience you create.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:36.490
ART DISCUSSION

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:42.170
EDUCATOR PREPARATION

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:48.209
In this section we'll discuss how to prepare
to lead an art-discussion program, including:

00:11:48.209 --> 00:11:50.300
Choosing a theme

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.010
Selecting artworks

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.630
Sequencing those artworks

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:59.370
And preparing to lead a conversation about
one specific work from your selection.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.829
So let's begin with choosing a theme.

00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:07.480
The theme provides a framework for the overall
discussion and an access point as you introduce

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.240
each new work.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.990
You should select a theme that is open and
age-appropriate, and that is of interest to

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.300
you.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.610
If you already have works in mind that you'd
like to discuss, then you can build a theme

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.800
around them.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.310
Here are some categories of themes that use
traditional reference points from art history.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.800
Focusing on a specific genre, such as landscape
or portraiture, or a movement or time period,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.430
like Pop Art or art from the 1990s, is a straightforward
way of framing your conversation.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:40.230
You can focus on the work of a specific artist,
or if you are working in a museum or gallery

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.279
space, you can investigate a particular exhibition.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:48.709
But there are also a number of broader ideas
that you can use as a theme, which may be

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:52.580
of interest to you or your participants.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.970
Moving forward, we'll prepare a conversation
with the theme of Family.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.930
Once you have chosen a theme, start to brainstorm
artworks that illustrate that idea.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.279
If you are working in a museum, you may start
by thinking about your own collection, but

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:10.680
if you are working elsewhere you can look
online, in exhibition catalogs or other books,

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.829
and so on.

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:17.070
We believe that you can create a positive
and purposeful experience with almost any

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.839
work of art, so, as the most general rule
of thumb, choose works that you find interesting,

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:26.940
that you are comfortable speaking about, and
that you think will engage your audience.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.940
With that in mind, narrow your selection to
4 to 6 works of art.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.940
You may not end up discussing all the works
within the time of your program, but it is

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.980
better to be prepared with too many works
than not enough.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.680
We've chosen 5 works that relate to our theme
of family -- while they all fit our theme,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.830
each work approaches the idea differently.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.910
The first is Henri Matisse, The Piano Lesson,
from 1916.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:57.139
This painting shows the artist's son sitting
at the piano in the family's living room.

00:13:57.139 --> 00:14:01.839
Next is Family Picture, painted by Mac Beckmann,
from 1920.

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:06.970
It does not depict any one particular family,
but reflects the cultural and economic conditions

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.110
families might have experienced at that time.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:14.780
Our next work is Joan Miro's the Family, from
1924.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:20.070
While the title of this drawing clearly indicates
a family, the abstract rendering of the various

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.620
figures makes for a less straightforward approach
to our theme.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.870
This is Frida Kahlo.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:30.670
My Grandparents, My Parents, and I (Family
Tree), from 1936.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.519
Which is exactly what the title indicates,
a family tree that depicts the artist, Frida

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:40.709
Kahlo, as a fetus and a young child, with
her parents and grandparents.

00:14:40.709 --> 00:14:46.740
The final work is the most recent work, William
Wegman's Family Combinations, from 1972.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.241
The top register includes individual photographs
of Wegman's father, mother, and the artist

00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:52.330
himself.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.790
The lower register combines these photographs,
superimposing two images over each other to

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.459
create a composite individual.

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:05.019
We've chosen to include Family Picture, by
Max Beckmann, which many find to be a rather

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:07.190
bleak, even depressing scene.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.190
It certainly is not the most uplifting image.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.770
And in fact, we're often asked if we avoid
work that may be considered troubling.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.959
It has been our experience, though, that you
can't always predict how people are going

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.470
to react to a work of art.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.440
For instance, in the past I've seen conversations
in front of Rene Magritte's The Menaced Assassin

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.830
that have gone smoothly, despite the very
troubling subject matter -- a corpse laying

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.620
in the center of the room.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.110
In another instance, I observed a tour wherein
one participant had a very negative emotional

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:42.090
reaction in front of Diego Rivera's Flower
Festival: Feast of Santa Anita, which most

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.100
people see as a festive and celebratory work.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.279
Again, it's impossible to anticipate how any
one person will react to a work of art.

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:54.420
Just like the general population, individuals
with Alzheimer's disease come to any given

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.910
artwork with their own aesthetic preferences
and life experiences, so it's best not to

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:04.149
limit yourself based on assumptions about
what might be upsetting.

00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:08.170
We're also often asked whether or not this
particular audience might have difficulty

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.100
processing or appreciating abstract works.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.430
But we have found that this hasn't been an
issue- in fact there can be real benefits

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.529
to discussing abstract works.

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:22.230
Accordingly, you can see that on our tour,
we've chosen to include a drawing by Miro,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.279
which is less representational.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:29.759
Often abstract, or less representational works,
have greater interpretive potential than figurative

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:35.310
works and allow for a greater variety of response,
as there is less pressure to quote "correctly"

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.490
identify elements in the work.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.480
Generally, our advice would be to stick with
what feels comfortable to you.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.029
If you're feeling anxious about facilitating
a conversation about a specific work, for

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:49.410
whatever reason, then just don't use it.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.529
Aside from the artwork content, there are
also logistical considerations that might

00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:56.490
factor into your artwork selection:

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.550
For example, if you will be viewing original
works in a museum or gallery, consider the

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.550
work's

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.949
Scale - Very small works may be hard for a
group to see.

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:09.569
So in this gallery, it would be difficult
to fit a group around the Gauguin work on

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:10.620
the left.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.200
And even if you could, participants would
likely be distracted by the much larger painting

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.449
by Rousseau to the right, so I would not use
the Gauguin, no matter how well it fit into

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:19.550
my theme.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.860
Also, consider how or where the work is installed
- works that are installed salon style may

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.250
be difficult to focus on.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.840
So for instance, in this gallery it would
be much easier to talk about the work on the

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:37.360
left as opposed to asking participants to
focus on one work within the wall on the right.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.180
And finally think about the work's location-
works situated by doors, or elevators might

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:48.050
be distracting, and works far away from others
on your tour may be difficult to get to.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.280
The triptych by Max Beckmann, seen here, is
a rich work, but the fact that it's installed

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.610
right near the escalators and the main thoroughfare
for accessing the galleries on this floor

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.020
make having a conversation there more difficult.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.730
If you are not leading a discussion in a museum
but instead using printed reproductions or

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:11.180
projecting images of artworks, then find high
quality images that retain the original work's

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.950
integrity and detail.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.010
The sequence in which you view the works should
offer a helpful way to connect them in the

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.170
context of the theme you have chosen.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.150
As a general rule of thumb, it is often better
to begin with works that are simpler or more

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.380
straightforward and move to those that are
more complex.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.450
In this same vein, move from more figurative
works to those that are more abstract, or

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.640
more abstractly related to your theme.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.160
So for our example, we'll start with Frida
Kahlo's work, which presents a common or familiar

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.950
way of organizing a representation of a family.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.880
From there we move to a different image of
multiple family members, though in this case

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.270
they are not related to the artist, and may
not have existed at all.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.540
This family is more symbolic of a particular
time and place.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.090
Then we continue on with a Matisse work, which
focuses on just one family member of the artist.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.020
There is an opportunity with this work to
think about the relationship between the artist

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.400
and his son.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.141
Our fourth work also includes a few family
members of the artist, as well as the artist

00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:15.090
himself, though this is certainly not a traditional
family portrait, as Wegman has created "imaginary"

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.520
family members via composites of his and his
parents' faces.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.870
We finish with the least representational
work of the group.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.910
By the time we get to Miro the group will
have had an opportunity to discuss family

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.800
roles and relationships as depicted in more
representational images before applying these

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.300
ideas to an abstract work.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.820
We've covered how to select a theme and artworks
to discuss, as well as how to sequence those

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.820
works.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.950
Next we'll talk about how to prepare for a
conversation about just one of these works

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:48.040
in detail, continuing with Matisse's The Piano
Lesson as an example.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.820
During your preparation, familiarize yourself
with all of the works you've chosen through

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.210
a combination of close examination and research.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:20:01.160
We'll now go through both of these approaches
in detail, starting with close examination.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.450
Looking closely should be the first thing
that you do when preparing a work.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.820
Eventually you'll be asking participants to
look closely, too, so it's important that

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.520
you go through this process as well.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.060
You may be very familiar with the artwork
already or be tempted to do research first

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.910
but be sure to dedicate some time upfront
just for looking.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:26.230
As you look closely at a work, consider its
formal elements, like line, shape, form, and

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.480
color.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:33.160
Notice the work's recognizable elements, that
is, if they are clear, and how they are represented.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.470
Then consider how those elements relate to
each other, including the scale, placement,

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.900
and overall composition.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.950
Think about the materials that are used, and
the techniques or processes that are involved

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.900
in the work's making.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.970
And finally, consider the work's overall style
or tone.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.820
So let's try this ourselves, using The Piano
Lesson.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.070
Look closely and ask yourself:

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.690
What objects or elements do you first notice?

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.550
Do you see the three figures?

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.510
How do they relate to each other in terms
of location?

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:10.510
How are they different, say in their coloring?

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.210
Let's think more specifically about the colors,
both in the figures and overall - are they

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.300
bright?

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.390
Dull?

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.480
Blended?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.560
Uniform?

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.650
Natural?

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:27.380
What about some of the other formal elements-
like lines, or shapes?

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.980
Do any stand out?

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.030
How does it look like this work was made?

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.880
Do you think it was painted quickly?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.790
Or did the artist maybe take longer to paint
it?

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.320
Does it look finished?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.580
What is your overall impression of the work?

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:50.120
Does that sense come from the colors, the
organization, or from something else?

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.640
Now we'll go through this same set of questions,
with Laurel providing her thoughts as she

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.140
considers the work.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.060
What objects or elements do you first notice?

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.200
I first notice the boy sitting down here,
the woman sitting in the upper right hand

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.621
corner, and the big swath of green paint that
takes up so much of the upper left part of

00:22:07.621 --> 00:22:08.621
the canvas.

00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:14.100
I also notice this figure in the lower left
corner and these random objects atop the pink

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.180
surface in the lower right.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.690
Do you see the three figures?

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.740
How do they relate to each other in terms
of location?

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.520
To me they feel scattered about the canvas.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.190
None of them are overlapping or feel that
connected to each other.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.260
The woman on the right is almost floating
in the air above the boy.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.330
And the other woman is so far from the others,
really wedged into the corner.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.790
How are the figures different, say in their
coloring?

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.020
The boy is the most human-like in his coloring.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.400
He looks fleshy, alive.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.440
The one in the lower left is more metallic
color, maybe bronze.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.900
And then the woman in the upper right is mostly
white, with some random patches of colored

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.240
paint applied to her.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.420
Their coloring is all very different.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.150
Let's think more specifically about the colors
overall.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.640
There is variety in the colors.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.680
In some places the colors are very bright,
almost unnatural, like the pink and the green.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.020
Other places they are more dull.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.520
I notice how much grey is used in the painting-
that it's in every part.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.260
The placement of the grey seems very deliberate--
usually any other color is touching grey or

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.740
black, they're rarely touching each other.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:28.340
What about some of the other formal elements-
for example the lines, or shapes?

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.540
Do any stand out?

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.910
I see some variations in line.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.530
There are some very hard, straight lines,
such as the verticals in the center of the

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.990
canvas and along the left, and in the woman
in the upper right hand corner.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:45.350
But elsewhere the lines are more curvy, more
sinewy.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.700
How does it look like this work was made?

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.680
Do you think it was painted quickly?

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.930
Or did the artist maybe take longer to paint
it?

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.010
Does it look finished?

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:58.310
Parts of the work seem unfinished, like the
woman in the upper right hand corner, and

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.290
parts of that curvy line work look scratchy.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.130
The boy's face is also not whole.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:08.560
At the same time, the work seems very meticulously
organized, which makes me think that it might

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.850
have taken some time to create.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.270
What is your overall impression of the work?

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:18.220
And does that sense come from the colors,
the organization, or something else?

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.400
To me the work feels kind of austere because
there is so little interaction between the

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.500
figures, between the various elements of the
work, and between the colors.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.830
Those are just a few thoughts that I had when
looking at the work, and chances are when

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.660
you went through, you answered these questions
differently.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.250
Looking closely as you prepare and asking
yourself the same kinds of questions you will

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.890
eventually ask your participants should help
you notice details you might have otherwise

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.800
missed and also clarify your own understanding
of a work.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.770
Your own observations and interpretations
of a work will guide you when you eventually

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.560
facilitate your discussion with participants.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.000
Moreover, based on what you noticed during
the process of looking closely, you can come

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.020
to your research with more direction and focus.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.330
For example, I was struck by the color selection
in this work, both the very bright colors

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.300
and the use of grey throughout the canvas.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.850
I also noticed the variety of color choices
for the figures, and am curious what that

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.870
might mean about them and their role in the
scene.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.710
I'm interested in finding out more about who
these figures could be.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:24.810
So, again, once you've examined the work,
the next step is to do some research.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.340
Your research will inform your understanding
of the work and help to generate discussion

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.610
questions.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:35.000
Using online resources, exhibition catalogues,
and books, look into the artist's practice

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.420
-- what they created over their lifetime,
themes they explored, materials they favored

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.560
and how they used them.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.160
Also investigate information about the artist's
life, the time period in which they lived

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.470
and worked, and information regarding any
movements or artist groups that they were

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.050
affiliated with.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.200
Research information about the work's subject
matter.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.610
Quotations from the artist can inform your
understanding of how and why a work was made,

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:05.890
and quotes from critics, either from the time
the work was made or from later, provide insight

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:10.470
into how the work has been received and interpreted
over time.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.260
Turning again to our example artwork, here
are a few art historical points that relate

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.840
to the artist and this work specifically.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.160
Henri Matisse was associated with the Fauves,
or "wild beasts," who were known for their

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.850
expressive use of color.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:30.470
This painting was painted in Matisse's apartment
outside of Paris, as opposed to in his studio.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:35.200
The boy sitting at the piano in the lower
right-hand corner is the artist's son, Pierre,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.270
who was around 16 years old at the time.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.540
Pierre and his sister, Marguerite, both took
piano lessons as children.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.010
Matisse had two sons and both of them served
in World War I, though their service took

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.600
place after this work was completed.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.780
This work includes two other works by Matisse,
a sculpture called Decorative Figure from

00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.830
1906 in the lower left hand corner and a painting
called Woman on a Highstool from 1914 in the

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.620
upper right hand corner.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:06.280
Matisse often depicted his other works in
his paintings.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.490
And finally, this work exhibits the influence
of a movement called Cubism, through its use

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.840
of geometric planes and its flattening of
space.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.930
Of all this information, select a few main
ideas that are relevant to the work and your

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.160
theme.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.630
Settling on a limited number of points will
help you avoid lecturing and therefore encourage

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.920
a wider range of participation.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.860
So for our example, because our theme is family,
the information about Matisse's family and

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.360
their lives is very relevant.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.680
Also the more general points about movements
he was affiliated with or that influenced

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:44.250
him, and the information about his artistic
tendencies, could help inform the group conversation.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:48.040
Overall, it's important to note that there
will be a difference in how much you as an

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.180
educator know about the work, and how much
you'll actually be able to share during the

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.860
discussion.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.490
You may do a lot of research about certain
elements of the work, but an opportunity to

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:01.840
share this information may not be organic
to the conversation when the time comes.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.171
We'll talk more about how and when to incorporate
the information you've prepared in the "Leading

00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:09.240
A Discussion" section of this video.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.870
In general, when preparing to facilitate a
discussion, keep the following in mind:

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.980
Consider logistics.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.470
They may necessarily inform the choices you
make as you conceive of your program

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:27.020
Choose themes and works that you find interesting
and you think will prompt robust conversation

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.630
Have your own experience with the work as
you prepare -- look closely and ask yourself

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:32.920
questions

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.500
And use your research to increase your familiarity
with the work but select a limited number

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.360
of art historical points to share.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.330
All in all this open approach to preparing
your discussion will allow you to prompt conversation

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:50.250
that leads to understanding, without over-determining
participant experience.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.690
ART DISCUSSION

00:28:54.690 --> 00:29:01.350
LEADING A DISCUSSION

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.430
In this section we'll cover how to lead a
discussion in front of one work of art, structuring

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.210
your conversation according to the following
scaffold:

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.370
Welcome -- setting up the experience

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.880
Observation --looking closely

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.870
Description -- objectively describing what
you see

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:23.120
Interpretation -- assigning meaning and making
inferences

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.860
Connection -- discovering a greater context
for the work

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.700
Using art historical information and

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.640
Conversation summary

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.580
As we go through this scaffold we'll continue
with our focus on The Piano Lesson, including

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.910
clips from conversations that we've lead in
the galleries.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:44.720
This structure is meant to provide you with
a flexible outline for facilitating your discussion.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.970
It is grounded in prevailing practices in
museum education.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.850
We use it as a guide for structuring our programs
for with people with Alzheimer's disease and

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.860
their care partners but also with other Museum
audiences, because it tends to best draw people

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.540
out and encourage participation, no matter
their level of ability.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.220
In this section we'll cover how to structure
a discussion in general without focusing too

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:11.470
directly on the specific needs of individuals
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.210
Information pertaining specifically to this
audience will be covered in the next section,

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:20.100
Tips and Tools, as will ways of creating a
supportive and validating environment.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:24.100
The tone you set is just as important as the
scaffold you use to provide structure during

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.100
your discussion.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.650
But for now, let's get back to that scaffold,
beginning with welcome.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:34.760
At the very beginning of the tour and in front
of each new work you discuss, welcome all

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:40.270
participants with a relaxed and inviting tone
and orient or reorient the group to their

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.270
surroundings.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.160
Let's take a look at this in the galleries.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.950
Meryl: So I see some of you already looking
at our next work here.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:53.750
Just to remind everyone, we’re on the 5th
Floor at The Museum of Modern Art, our permanent

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.600
painting and sculpture collection.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:02.470
This is the second work in our tour today,
our theme is family.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.910
You can see that before Meryl shared any information
about the work, she first reoriented the group

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.910
as to where they were and how far along in
their tour, and reminded them of the theme.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.660
You also want to take this time to establish
or re-establish the expectations for the discussion

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.240
you'll be having.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.260
During your welcome, explain that you'll be
looking at and discussing a limited number

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.900
of artworks and that you want to hear from
everyone and that you'll all be building understanding

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.610
of a work of art together.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.710
Outline for participants what to expect.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:37.910
Set a tone that invites comments and other
forms of participation.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.270
Once you've welcomed everyone and made sure
that each participant has an unobstructed

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.810
view, allow some time for quiet observation.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.590
Give participants about a minute to just look
closely.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:52.480
This is their opportunity to focus on the
work and to think of questions or notice particular

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.480
areas of interest, which will be incorporated
in the upcoming discussion.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.960
So again, let's look at this in action in
the galleries.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.100
Laurel: So spend a good minute and just notice
the entire thing.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.100
It’s a pretty large work of art.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.760
So look at it from top to bottom, left to
right.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:27.981
Notice some of the details and we’ll discuss
it together…Notice the colors.

00:32:27.981 --> 00:32:34.780
Some of the lines and shapes that are in the
work.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:42.780
Consider how it is painted and some of the
elements included in the scene.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.950
You can see that Laurel has instructed the
group to look closely, and provided a timeframe

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.420
for this observation.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.580
Some participants may not be accustomed to
sitting quietly and looking at one work of

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.320
art in depth, so she has also directed their
looking, encouraging the group to take notice

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.920
of formal elements like colors, line and shapes.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.710
LH Sometimes, particularly at the first work
of art, I explain why we'll be looking closely

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.840
-- saying that often we look at things very
briefly and miss all the rich details of a

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.840
work.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.310
I like to emphasize that this is an opportunity
to slow down and appreciate a work more fully.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.940
Next, begin to describe the work.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.890
Description rests upon naming formal elements
and recognizable subject matter.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.860
Asking questions that touch on these elements
will help to create a collective visual inventory

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:34.000
and establish a fundamental understanding
of what is being seen.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.120
Moreover, taking the time to thoroughly describe
the work allows for a wide range of participation

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.920
and makes sure all participants are on the
same page before you move onto interpreting

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.550
the work.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.000
Let's take a look at this idea in the galleries.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.990
Laurel: So let’s start by describing what
is included in this scene.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.250
What are some of the recognizable objects
that you all notice?

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.250
Participant: A woman and a baby.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:55.250
Laurel: The piano.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.350
And then a woman and a baby.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.400
Where is the woman, Arthur?

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.400
Participant: That thing.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.870
Laurel: Up in the right hand corner, we have
a female figure.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.730
And you said a baby.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.010
This thing right here looks like a young person
perhaps?

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.030
Participant: It looks like a young male child.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.379
Laurel: Like a young male child, ok.

00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:15.879
What else are you all noticing?

00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:16.879
Participant: The eyes

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:17.879
Laurel: The eyes on this figure.

00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:18.879
Yeah.

00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:19.879
How many eyes?

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:20.879
Participant: One!

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:21.879
Laurel: Right!

00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:30.390
We have this kind of very legible eye right
here on the left side of the figure and then

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:34.919
the other side is a little harder to make
out, and we’ll get back to that later.

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:38.169
What else do you all notice about this figure
on the right hand side?

00:34:38.169 --> 00:34:39.380
Participant: Female furniture.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.580
Laurel: Female furniture!

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.060
Bill, how would you describe this figure on
the right side?

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.139
Do you think there’s anything peculiar about
her?

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:50.190
Could you tell she was a female figure from
the beginning?

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.100
Participant: There’s strips on there.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.639
Laurel: There’s strips on there.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.110
Yeah, she’s stripped down, right?

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:01.730
Participant: I can’t tell if it’s…well,
the look is that it’s incomplete.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.730
Not painted.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:08.360
I can’t tell from this angle whether that’s
a deliberate omission or whether it’s painted

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:16.700
to look incomplete but in the coloring, in
the outline, it looks incomplete.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.390
You can see that Laurel has first explained
that the group is now going to describe what

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:25.310
they see and she started with a concrete question,
"what are some of the recognizable objects

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.320
that you notice" to get them going.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:32.850
As a general rule, the descriptive questions
you ask should be more concrete, for instance

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.780
"What do you notice or see in this painting?"

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.690
instead of just "What is going on here?"

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:43.410
In prompting participants to name recognizable
objects the group was able to start identifying

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:48.470
the components of the work, beginning with
whatever jumped out at them first.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:53.370
Moving forward with the description, Laurel
asked participants to notice many of the formal

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:57.860
elements we introduced during the Educator
Preparation section, as well as the subject

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.920
matter and the way in which this work was
painted.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:06.010
As you lead your discussion, you might not
have time to describe every single aspect

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:12.290
of a work in detail, but be sure to investigate
the entire work before moving on to interpretation.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:16.800
Indeed, sometimes, participants want to dive
into interpretation right away -- they will

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.070
see a work and immediately want to tell you
they think it means.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.630
If participants immediately start to interpret
the work instead of describing it, ask them

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:28.560
which visual clue led them to that idea, or
ask them to connect their comment back to

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.460
something they see in the work.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.800
Allow participants to describe freely but
also ask specific questions that guide them

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.540
toward elements that you've prepared to discuss
or will ask them to interpret later on in

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.540
the discussion.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.450
For example, in that clip we saw of Laurel,
she really focused on getting participants

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:49.820
to describe the boy at the piano, Matisse's
son, Pierre, by asking specific questions

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.820
about him.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.250
I knew I eventually wanted the group to think
more interpretively about the boy, as it connected

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:59.490
to our theme of family, so it was important
that we spent a good amount of time just looking

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.790
at and describing him first.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.700
Once you feel that the group has thoroughly
described the work, summarize all the elements

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.870
mentioned and point out any important details
that might have been missed.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.320
Now you can move onto building interpretation.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.710
Interpretation rests on assigning meaning
to various elements of the work and asking

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:24.330
participants to think about what is merely
suggested and to make inferences accordingly.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.890
There are many ways to prompt interpretive
comments, but a good place to start is to

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:34.110
build off participant's description of the
work by asking them to consider the significance

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.580
of what they've seen and described.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:40.901
In this next clip, Laurel prompts interpretive
comments based on understanding of the color

00:37:40.901 --> 00:37:43.060
grey in The Piano Lesson.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:50.360
Laurel: Suzy is saying that the grey is very
predominate in the painting.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.580
Participant: It looks like, feels like, concrete.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:38:01.340
A form of protection, at the same time, the
strength of the facility itself.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.380
Laurel: So, fortification, almost.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.380
Concrete.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.160
Other ideas about this grey and what it might
suggest?

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.740
Participant: It accentuates the colors that
were actually used.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:16.060
Laurel: It accentuates the other colors that
were used.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.020
It really makes them “pop.”

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.590
Participant: A deliberate choice.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.940
The entire background is this grey.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.940
For both interior and exterior, he uses the
grey.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:33.380
And the child’s face, being the only sort
of animate part of the image.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.640
You could see from the clip that participants
were eager to share their thoughts about what

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.180
the color grey suggested, but you could also
ask participants to consider other formal

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:46.180
elements of a work, like line, shape or form
in their interpretation.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:51.150
In that clip, Jordan even speculated as to
why Matisse might have chosen to use the grey

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.790
as he did.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:57.660
You can encourage participants to think of
a work as a series of choices made by the

00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.660
artist.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:03.130
Depending on the work, you can ask participants
about the artist's choice of subject matter,

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:08.700
materials, composition, and their overall
style or technique.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.830
During the interpretive portion of your conversation
you can also ask open-ended questions that

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:16.950
touch on what is not clearly visible in the
work but perhaps merely suggested.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.460
Depending on the work, you can ask participants
to make inferences about what time of day

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.470
or location might be depicted, or imagine
a narrative for the scene, what could have

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.530
happened before or what might happen next.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:33.380
You can also ask participants questions that
encourage them to think about the work as

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.600
a whole.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.620
One way of prompting this is to ask about
overall impression or mood.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.690
Here's an example.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:45.110
Meryl: So I want to take a step back and consider
the mood or this work overall.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:52.690
We’ve done a great job investigating some
of these independent pieces but what about

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.690
the overall mood?

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.360
Carole, do you have a word to describe the
mood of this painting?

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.240
Participant: I would say calm or peaceful.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.340
Meryl: Calm or peaceful, that’s great.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.520
Anya, would you agree with Carole – calm
or peaceful?

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.890
Participant: Yes, the same word.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.930
Meryl: What’s another word someone would
use to describe the mood?

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.190
Participant: I would say somber

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.190
Meryl: Somber.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:17.980
Participant: I mean, even though it’s colorful,
it’s somber, it’s quiet, it’s reflective.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.410
Participant: You know I find it in a way,
happy.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.410
Because of the green.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:30.000
When I look at the green…I cannot omit the
green and the pink colors.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.930
The salmon color.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:40.910
Also, when you see a child, playing the piano,
a relaxed woman, and someone who is sitting

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.560
there casually, it kinda gives me a feeling
of family.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:47.940
Meryl: Ted, what’s a word you would use
to describe the feeling or overall mood of

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.940
this work?

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.530
Participant: The feeling or mood?

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.560
Meryl: Yes, what’s one word.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.560
Participant: I would say somber.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.560
Meryl: Somber.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.980
Yeah, what about it to you feels somber?

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.980
Or, why do you say that?

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980
Participant: The grey.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.920
And the look on the face of the boy playing
the piano.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:14.250
He also looks somber.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:22.150
Meryl: He also looks somber.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:26.380
Another way of prompting an overall interpretation
of the work is to ask participants to think

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.080
of a new title.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.000
Their alternative title may reveal the aspects
of the work that are most important to that

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.310
person, or how they think the entire thing
works together.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.310
Here's Laurel doing just that:

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:43.330
Laurel: I mentioned before that title of this
work is “The Piano Lesson,” but if you

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:57.060
had to give it a different title, what would
you title this work?

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.600
Participant: At Home.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600
Laurel: At Home, uh huh.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.600
Participant: Distraction.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.600
Laurel: Distraction!

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.600
I like that, too!

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.850
Participant: My description would be to call
it The Answer.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.730
And this is the answer – peace and tranquility.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.730
Laurel: The Answer.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.750
Other titles you all would give this work?

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.070
Helen, what would you title it?

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.070
Participant: Departure.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.070
Laurel: Departure!

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.820
And what makes you think of departure?

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:25.250
Moreover, the art historical information you've
gathered during your preparation can also

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.420
serve as a jumping-off point for interpretive
questions.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.430
You might ask participants to consider the
work in relation to biographical information

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:37.640
about the artist, the historical and social
context of the work, or the given title.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.380
We'll focus on ways of using the information
you've gathered to generate new threads of

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.710
conversation in just a few minutes.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:49.310
Again, not all of these ideas might be relevant
at every work of art, and certain ideas might

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:54.320
be of greater interest to a particular group,
but this list provides a variety of possibilities

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.010
for prompting interpretation.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:02.250
As participants are interpreting a work, encourage
them to connect what they're seeing to other

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:07.750
objects, ideas, and experiences, thus situating
the work within a broader context.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:10.240
Let's see this in the galleries

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:15.730
Meryl: This is a work that Matisse made of
his son, doing something that he did all the

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.590
time, everyday, in his living room.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:25.470
So if you were to make a portrait of someone
in your family – 2 questions -- who would

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:26.960
it be?

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.490
And what would they be doing?

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.600
And maybe turn to the person next to you,
and then we’ll share back, turn to the person

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:38.651
next to you and tell them who you would make
a portrait of in your family, and how you

00:43:38.651 --> 00:43:46.010
would depict them, what they would be doing?

00:43:46.010 --> 00:44:15.670
Ted, if you had to make a painting of someone
in your family…?

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:19.010
Oh, I see you pointing at Arlene.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:24.140
And what would Arlene be doing?

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.250
Participant: She’d be snoring.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.300
Meryl: Snoring?

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:40.700
So Ted would make a painting of Arlene, who
would be snoring.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.900
But looking beautiful while she did it.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.390
Participant: But I would paint him, reading
and eating.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.510
Meryl: Uh huh.

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:52.350
So Arlene would paint you, Ted, reading and
eating.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.780
Are those two of your favorite things?

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:54.780
Participant: Yes

00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:00.100
Meryl: Are those the things she’ll find
you doing all the time?

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.260
Participant: Yes

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.020
You can see that Meryl has encouraged participants
connect Matisse's work or analyze his choices

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.210
through their own personal lens, considering
the people in their own lives.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:14.710
Prompting participants to connect works to
their own life experiences also encourages

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:20.750
personal exchange among group members, which
makes for a more social experience.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:24.110
Questions that touch on personal preference,
like, "Do you like this work?

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:25.870
Why or why not?

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:32.020
Would you hang it in your house?" can be applied
to any artwork and are accessible to all.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:36.770
You can also connect works to other artwork
and developments in art history, but, remember,

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:41.250
if you're asking participants to compare the
work you're viewing to others, be sure that

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:45.430
you have a reproduction or other visual reference
on hand.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:49.520
Try and reference only what can be seen and
understood by everybody.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.340
While not all of your participants may be
familiar with history, they may have a sense

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.070
of world history.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:59.360
Relating works of art to major cultural changes
and world events provides an additional access

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.020
point.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.690
During the course of your discussion you will
introduce the art historical information you've

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.260
prepared.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.700
Sharing this information enhances participant
understanding and appreciation of a work and

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.170
elevates your conversation.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:16.490
It can be difficult to determine how much
you want to share about the work you're discussing

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:21.610
-- the information available plus the interest
of your group makes each situation unique.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:27.340
But as a general rule of thumb, use art history
to validate participants' responses and generate

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.700
new threads of conversation.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:35.310
Let's now take a look at Laurel has used art
historical information to validate participant

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:36.370
response:

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:51.420
Participant: See, I focused on whatever that
is, the candle, but now I see the piano because

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:56.770
I believe the pink is the top of the piano
and now I see one of the legs of the piano

00:46:56.770 --> 00:47:02.820
on the left, so it’s coming together but
quite frankly when I first looked at the painting

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.840
I didn’t see anything that was that obvious.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.730
Laurel: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.510
It’s not the most legible scene.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.510
Right?

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:17.790
And how many pianos have you seen that have
a pink top like this?

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.030
Participant: None!

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:24.130
Laurel: And in fact Matisse was a member of
the Fauves, he was a Fauvist, you might say,

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:30.010
which is a word that translates literally
to “Wild Beast,” but the Fauves were known

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:37.050
for using color in a much more expressionistic
way, not necessarily a realistic way.

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:41.140
You can see that Laurel has picked up on something
that Suzy has already noticed, in this case

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:46.480
the unusual color of the piano top, and both
confirmed and expanded on her observation

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.619
by sharing information about Matisse's affiliation
with the Fauves.

00:47:50.619 --> 00:47:53.220
This came about organically.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.340
Laurel shared this information at moment when
it was relevant to the conversation

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.710
Now here's a look at how you can use art history
to spark a new thread of conversation.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.430
Laurel: So Pierre, Henri Matisse’s son,
was 16 at the time this work was made.

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:07.960
Does anyone else think he looks younger than
16?

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.920
Can you place his age?

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920
All: Yes

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:16.590
Laurel: So why do you think Matisse chose
to paint him younger than he was?

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.450
Participant: Because he was an artist and
had to be imaginative.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:25.630
Participant: I think the basic situation,
just looking at the child’s face, I think

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.680
the artist was trying to understand the child.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.600
Trying to represent what the child is thinking
or feeling.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:39.370
Trying to come into contact, to identify more
closely with his own child.

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:43.570
Laurel: So really observing him and trying
to come closer to understanding him.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:49.320
Participant: The fact that this was painted
now, in the middle of the middle of the First

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.320
World War.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.430
To see one’s child, who may go to this war,
as younger or more innocent.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:49:00.850
And he’s wide-eyed with either wonder, terror,
awe.

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:05.320
You can see that Laurel has used her knowledge
of Pierre's age at the time the work was painted

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.590
to generate an interpretive question and spark
a new direction in the conversation.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:14.310
I knew that Pierre was around 16 years old
when this work was made, but knowing this

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.180
didn't prevent me from first asking the group
how old they thought the boy in the painting

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.480
looked.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.370
We had a fruitful conversation about how old
he might be before I shared what I knew about

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:25.100
how old he actually was.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:30.280
And, finally, when discussing a work, always
share the name of the artist, the date and

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.980
title of the work, and materials used.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.700
While sharing this information is essential,
you may not want to lead with it, as that

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.300
could limit participant response.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:46.800
When you feel ready to bring your conversation
to a close, summarize and synthesize participant

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.800
responses.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.010
Here's an example:

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:53.910
Meryl: Now that we’ve had this very fruitful
discussion about Matisse and his family we’re

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:59.410
going to move on to look at another work that
explores another aspect of our theme today.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.420
You can see that the conclusion offers another
opportunity to re-orient participants.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:08.260
In this case, Meryl did so by linking the
discussion back to the theme and by transitioning

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.770
smoothly to the next work.

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:14.670
Your conversation summary is also the time
to ask for final thoughts or opinions from

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:18.840
the group and to share your own broader observations
about the experience.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:23.560
Thank participants for their contributions
and suggest ways they might continue to explore

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.890
the artists, artworks, and ideas that were
discussed.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:31.600
In general, keep the following ideas in mind
when facilitating a discussion about a work

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.490
of art:

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:38.540
Ask a variety of questions in order to prompt
different threads of conversation

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.870
Use art historical information purposefully.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:45.300
It should enhance your conversation, not bog
it down.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:49.650
And finally provide some initial structure
but allow the conversation to flow.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:54.410
Be prepared but don't over-direct the experience.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:59.070
Keeping these ideas in mind will help create
a guided yet open experience that helps participants

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:02.781
to individually and collectively build understandings
about works of art.

00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:06.410
ART DISCUSSION

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:16.700
TIPS AND TOOLS

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.970
In this section, we'll go over general tips
and tools for successfully facilitating your

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:21.990
discussion.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:27.360
We'll first share with you some practical
tips for leading a cohesive group conversation

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.870
and then discuss some challenging scenarios
that may come up and ways you can address

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:31.930
them.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:36.290
So, let's begin with general facilitation
strategies.

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:40.130
No matter the group you're working with, it
can sometimes be difficult to balance the

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:44.880
interests, abilities, and personalities of
each of the participants.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.230
Here are some things you can do to foster
an environment of balanced and lively exchange:

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.530
The first is to animate the experience yourself.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:58.590
Think of facilitating a discussion as an opportunity
to be your most performative self, but at

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:04.190
the same time be sure that your level of enthusiasm
does not come across as insincere.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.920
Also, share personal information about yourself

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.160
Sharing personal information will make participants
feel more comfortable with you.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:18.280
It will make the experience feel less formal
or intimidating and more conversational.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:23.150
During the discussion, address participants
by name and make eye contact.

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.850
Don't be afraid to call on people directly
and invite them to comment in a non-threatening

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:27.850
manner.

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:31.830
Also, make eye contact with whoever is speaking
so that they know that you're listening directly

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.990
to them.

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:39.900
Always repeat all comments back to the group,
summarizing and synthesizing when necessary.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.170
This strategy helps to validate the person
who is commenting, makes sure those who can't

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:49.220
hear are not at a disadvantage, and helps
to reorient those with short-term memory loss.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.580
So, let's take a look at how this works in
the galleries.

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.850
Laurel: What else do you all notice about
this figure on the right hand side?

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:57.400
Participant: Female furniture.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.960
Laurel: Female furniture.

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.190
And what makes you say that, Arthur?

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:04.410
Participant: Well the top is definitely female
and the lower parts are sort of a mixture

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:05.680
of female and furniture.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.850
Laurel: Yeah, yeah!

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:14.210
So at the top you can tell that we have the
head of a woman, her shoulders and torso coming

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:19.350
down, and then she sort of blends into this
furniture.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:22.430
We have the legs that are just down below.

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.100
Jordan, were you going to add to that?

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:29.619
Participant: I can’t tell if it’s…well,
the look is that it’s incomplete.

00:53:29.619 --> 00:53:30.619
Not painted.

00:53:30.619 --> 00:53:36.250
I can’t tell from this angle whether that’s
a deliberate omission or whether it’s painted

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:41.760
to look incomplete but in the coloring, in
the outline, it looks incomplete.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.590
Laurel: Yeah, so there’s something incomplete
about this figure.

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:49.740
And Jordan was saying that he doesn’t know
necessarily whether it was intentional or

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.740
not.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.950
Notice that Laurel repeated Arthur's first
comment -- "female furniture" -- to the group

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:57.380
and then asked him to continue.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:02.150
She then repeated and elaborated on his further
description, supplementing Arthur's observations

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:06.119
with more information that could be helpful
to everyone.

00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:10.430
And later, once Jordan gave his description
of this same figure, Laurel repeated just

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:14.170
the key parts back to the group, maintaining
Jordan's wording.

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:18.970
This selected repetition validated Jordan
but also allowed Laurel to choose one idea

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:22.520
to focus on moving forward.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:27.960
During the discussion provide a visual reference
by pointing to particular parts of the work.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.150
By pointing or gesturing to the work directly,
you quickly and easily direct the group's

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.040
looking and keep everyone on the same page.

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:41.120
Similarly, refrain from discussing any object
or image that isn't immediately visually available,

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.000
including works that you've discussed prior.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.820
Only reference that which can be seen and
understood by everyone, otherwise you're putting

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.780
those with short term memory loss at a disadvantage.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:55.310
It's okay to bring up an idea that you've
discussed before, but if you do, be sure to

00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:59.850
explain it anew so as to maintain group cohesion.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:02.130
Be mindful not to interrupt participants

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:05.890
Don't cut someone off as they're talking or
try to finish their sentence.

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:10.930
This can be distracting and discourage the
participant from commenting again.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:15.109
When responding to participants' comments,
validate with sincerity

00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:19.960
Go beyond just acknowledging responses or
saying that you find them interesting.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.430
Pick up on something specific within a comment
and respond to that part directly.

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:26.560
Being specific communicates sincere interest.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.330
So let's see an example of this from Laurel's
conversation about The Piano Lesson.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.859
Laurel: Marty, what do you notice?

00:55:33.859 --> 00:55:41.180
Marty: I look at the organization as if its
two parts, designated by the long vertical

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.140
in the middle.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:50.661
This part non-human images, except for all
the way in the bottom.

00:55:50.661 --> 00:55:59.280
And it projects a certain sleepiness, or things
that are set in their ways.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:05.710
Whereas the other part is more modern, extreme,
active, and seems to talk to me about the

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:06.710
day.

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:10.250
Laurel: First of all, you notice the structure
of the work, the composition and how it’s

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:11.250
arranged.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:15.660
And I’m so glad you pointed out this strict
vertical blue line – does everyone see that?

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.530
I like how you said that it divides the canvas
into two.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:28.960
On the left, you have this sort of inanimate
selection of objects; on the right you have

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.450
more activity.

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:34.330
Notice how Laurel went beyond just generally
thanking Marty for his comment and instead

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:38.680
expressed appreciation at the fact that he
noticed a particular element of the work,

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.530
a central vertical line.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:44.330
She then invited everyone else to use that
central line to notice the organization of

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:45.330
the scene.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:49.869
In the same way that it's helpful to share
information about yourself, you should encourage

00:56:49.869 --> 00:56:53.430
participants to share their own personal stories.

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:58.010
Even if this temporarily moves the conversation
away from the work at hand, personal narratives

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:02.630
inform individual understanding of the work
and enhance relationships within the group.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.990
Again, let's look at an example of this in
the galleries:

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:08.910
Meryl: Oh, Carole, I happen to know that you
play an instrument.

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:11.990
Did you take lessons your whole life?

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:16.320
Participant: No, I was out of high school
I guess.

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.080
Meryl: Oh, you were out of high school when
you started.

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.150
Participant: I played in a German Oom-pah
band, in Germany.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.680
Meryl: You played in a German Oom-pah band?

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.800
How big was the band?

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.730
Participant: Oh, maybe twenty.

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:33.180
Meryl: Twenty people!

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.180
My gosh!

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.730
Here Meryl takes a bit of information that
she already knows about Carole, that she plays

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:41.900
an instrument, and asks her to share more
about her experiences with the rest of the

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.609
group.

00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:45.380
Encourage group debate.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:50.170
When people offer opinions or ideas, invite
other participants to respond to them.

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.670
This is an easy way of encouraging socialization
among participants.

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:59.810
It also demonstrates that a variety of interpretations
are possible, valid and as ripe for investigation

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:01.200
as the artwork itself.

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.160
Let's see what this can look like:

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.960
Laurel: So if this is Matisse’s son.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.850
How do you think he has treated him?

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:15.350
Would you have thought that there was any
kind of personal relationship?

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:29.110
Participant: I keep on looking at the face
and the black outline on his head and ears

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:35.619
and it just gives me the feeling that there’s
a devilish-ness to him.

00:58:35.619 --> 00:58:42.750
And I still get the feeling that there is
resistance to the piano lesson.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.660
And maybe that’s the relationship between
father and son.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.660
Laurel: Does anyone else see what Suzy sees?

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.660
This idea of resistance to the piano lesson?

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:47.660
Betty, you agree.

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:48.660
Arthur?

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.869
Participant: When she said devilish, I kept
thinking of rebellion.

00:58:51.869 --> 00:58:54.060
Laurel: Of rebellion.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:59.320
Participant: Yeah, at the piano.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:05.900
S19 In this instance Laurel poses a question
to the group regarding how Matisse has painted

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.420
his son and Suzy provides her interpretation.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:13.740
Laurel then asks other participants to respond
to Suzy's comment, looping in Betty and Arthur,

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:17.480
as the conversation continues.

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:21.190
Throughout your discussion, maintain an air
of lightness and humor.

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:25.060
Remember, one of the goals is to create a
fun experience where participants are able

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.510
to relax and enjoy themselves.

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:31.000
From the start and throughout, set a tone
that communicates these goals.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.300
Moreover, there can be a level of tension
that comes with lively debate and perhaps

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.940
a level of intimidation that comes with discussing
art, especially if it's new to you.

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:43.980
Additionally, the symptoms of Alzheimer's
disease may create moments of awkwardness

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.980
or embarrassment.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:49.420
But by maintaining a light and relaxed tone
and by staying focused on the conversation

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:56.450
and not dwelling on challenging moments, any
instances of embarrassment will be minimized.

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:59.350
But indeed, challenging moments may come up
during your conversation.

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.890
We'll now go through a number of situations
we've encountered and suggestions for how

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:07.490
to address them should they arise.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:12.230
Sometimes a participant may make the same
comment repeatedly due to memory impairments.

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:14.920
If this happens, acknowledge the comment every
time.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:20.490
Try to use the comment to further the conversation
by connecting it to a new piece of information,

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:25.800
asking a variety of follow up questions, or
by asking participants to respond to it.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:32.040
So, for instance, imagine that during our
conversation about The Piano Lesson one participant

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:36.180
continues to bring up the reclining figure
in the lower left hand corner.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.270
As this is such a small detail in the work
I wouldn't want to focus on it for too long,

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:45.330
so I need to find ways to honor the participant's
contribution and generate new threads of conversation

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.950
each time it comes up.

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:52.190
The first time it comes up, I could ask the
participant, "What draws you to this figure?"

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:57.600
When it comes up again, I could ask the participant
to describe the color of the figure and how

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.160
that connects to the other colors that are
used in the work.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.120
The next time, I could ask the participant
to describe the figure's pose, and then we

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.990
could compare her pose to the figure in the
upper right hand corner.

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:13.430
And then, if it comes up again I could ask
if the figure seems to be inside or outside

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:14.830
and why.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:18.470
From there, I could go beyond that figure
and ask what other parts of the work indicate

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.190
where this scene might be located.

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:25.550
There are any number of both descriptive and
interpretive questions you can ask to build

01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:29.540
on the repeated comment and integrate it into
the larger discussion.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:34.130
Moreover, you can pose these questions both
to the participant who has made the comment,

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:38.609
but also to the larger group, too, thus drawing
in other participants.

01:01:38.609 --> 01:01:41.950
Finally, never ignore the participant.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:46.010
If necessary you can merely acknowledge the
comment and move on.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:49.280
Sometimes you can ask a question and you just
don't get a response.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.630
But there are a number of ways to adjust your
mode of inquiry to encourage a quieter group

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.110
to participate.

01:01:56.110 --> 01:02:01.220
One strategy to get a quiet group talking
is to invite a brief contribution from everyone,

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.880
for example asking all participants to share
the first word that comes to mind when looking

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.320
at the work at hand.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.080
This can be a great exercise to do as you
start your conversation because it allows

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.950
you to get a whole handful of insights that
you can reference later.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.320
Here's an example of Meryl putting this technique
to use:

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.340
Meryl: Will everyone please give me one word?

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.849
One word to describe the mood of this painting.

01:02:24.849 --> 01:02:30.430
Who feels like…Carole, do you have a word
to describe the mood of this painting?

01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:32.790
Participant: I’d say calm or peaceful.

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.480
Meryl: Calm or peaceful, that’s great.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.940
Anya, would you agree with Carole – calm
or peaceful?

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:42.090
Participant: Yes, the same word.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:46.340
In that clip, Meryl asks for Carole's word,
and then quickly asks if Anya agrees before

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.920
moving onto the rest of the group.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.830
Quickly prompting a brief response -- like
a yes or a no -- demonstrates to group-members

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:58.000
that participating doesn't have to be intimidating;
they don't need to labor over every answer.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.480
Moreover, this activity may make them feel
more comfortable chiming in again later.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.849
Now, in a situation where you have posed a
specific discussion question and no one is

01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:13.180
responding, narrow down your question by offering
possible responses to choose from.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:18.330
For example if a question like "How would
you describe this line?" is met with silence,

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:22.530
follow it up with, "Is it curvy?

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:23.530
Straight?

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:24.530
Short?

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.530
Long?

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:26.530
Thick?

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:27.530
Thin?"

01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:32.170
Participants may be more likely to select
from options than to generate their own responses.

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:36.840
If this adjustment still does not elicit a
response, you can even re-pose the question

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:42.690
as an either/or or yes/no question, for example
just, "Is this line curvy?"

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.950
Again, here's a clip of Meryl narrowing down
a question.

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:52.540
Meryl: Harriet, what is a word you would use
to describe the mood or feeling of this painting?

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:57.201
Participant: I’m having a hard time.

01:03:57.201 --> 01:03:58.240
Meryl: A hard time describing it?

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240
Participant: Yes

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.400
Meryl: Does it feel energetic?

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.760
Participant: A little bit.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.250
Meryl: A little bit energetic.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.920
What feels energetic about it to you?

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.369
Another thing you can do to get participants
talking is to pepper the conversation with

01:04:10.369 --> 01:04:14.000
questions that touch on personal preference.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.940
Asking something like "Do you like this work?"
is a non-threatening and accessible mode of

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.310
inquiry.

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:24.570
Finally, if you are able to draw out someone
who has been reluctant to speak, don't let

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.040
this opportunity pass you by!

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.380
Continue to engage them by asking a deepening,
follow-up question that prompts elaboration

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.700
on their initial response.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:38.780
Alternatively, you may have a participant
who dominates the conversation.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:43.530
Address a longwinded comment by patiently
and creatively bringing it to a close.

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:47.910
You can say, "You're presenting so many great
ideas, we can't possibly discuss them all!

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:52.710
I'll repeat the key ones back," at which point
choose one element to focus on and reroute

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:54.620
the conversation.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:59.170
If a participant continually responds before
everyone else, start to call on other participants

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:03.720
by name instead of posing general questions
to the whole group.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.609
If a participant makes a comment that seems
unrelated to the work or your conversation,

01:05:08.609 --> 01:05:14.080
trust that some element of the work or the
experience is allowing them to make a link.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.590
Accept the comment and ask the participant
to elaborate or explain, which may give further

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:21.280
clues as to the connection.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.190
Always be aware of the possibilities of these
connections and don't be dismissive.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:30.860
For instance, one time I was leading a discussion
of the Piano Lesson, and a participant suggested

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:36.820
that the work looked like a landscape -- specifically,
a forest scene with big groups of tall trees.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.480
I think we'd agree that, while this work does
contain abstract elements that are open to

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:46.080
many interpretations, it is not a representation
of a forest.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.510
But there are a lot of reasons I could see
why she might have made that connection -- the

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:54.020
scale of the work, perhaps, and the big green
patch in the center, suggest an airy openness

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.890
you might find in a nature scene.

01:05:55.890 --> 01:06:00.340
I noticed that the figure in the lower left
corner is lounging the way you might if you

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:04.390
were outdoors enjoying the shade of a tree,
so I followed up on her comment by drawing

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:08.619
everyone's attention to the pose of that figure,
asking the rest of the group if they agreed

01:06:08.619 --> 01:06:12.670
that the figure looked they way you would
if you were reclining and enjoying the outdoors.

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:17.391
In that way, I was able to honor the participant's
comment and also incorporate it into the group

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:19.849
conversation.

01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:23.880
If two people are having a side conversation,
allow them to continue as long as they are

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.330
not disruptive to the group.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:29.080
Participants might feel more comfortable talking
one-on-one.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.260
If and when you feel it's appropriate, you
can ask these participants to share their

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.230
comments.

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:38.480
You may be in a situation where you have difficulty
understanding a participant's response due

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.460
to limited verbal ability, or a participant
may be non-verbal.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:46.820
Regardless, it is essential to communicate
directly with that participant.

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.100
Don't just talk to a care-partner instead.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:54.119
If you have trouble understanding a participant,
get closer and ask them to repeat.

01:06:54.119 --> 01:06:58.380
Try to interpret what they are saying, repeat
it back to them and ask if you've understood

01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.810
them correctly.

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:04.580
You can also use non-verbal communication
cues, like pointing, to help further clarify

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.380
their comments.

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:10.840
In fact you can take advantage of a number
of non-verbal communication cues throughout

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.470
your discussion.

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:17.190
If you notice someone smiling, pointing to
the work, shaking or nodding their head, share

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:19.760
these observations with the larger group.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.609
You can pay attention to people's gaze to
see what part of the work attracts them and

01:07:23.609 --> 01:07:25.880
integrate that into the conversation.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.380
For example, you can say something like, "I
see Harriet is looking at the figure in the

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.380
top left.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.560
Does everyone else see her?

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.790
How would you describe her?"

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:37.910
And keep in mind that even if participants
are not responding verbally, it does not mean

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:40.210
that they are not engaged.

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:44.270
Some participants may have varying language
abilities and some people might just be reluctant

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:46.350
to talk in a larger group.

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:51.590
Look for other clues of engagement: are participants
looking at the work or at you?

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:54.160
Do they seem to be taking an interest in what
is going on?

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.750
Are they smiling?

01:07:55.750 --> 01:08:00.410
These are all good indicators that they are
engaging in their own way.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:04.730
Of course, these are only a handful of the
challenging situations you could encounter.

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:08.270
New challenges come up every time we teach
and accordingly, we're always learning new

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:11.210
things and improving our practice as educators.

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:14.500
In sum, keep the following in mind:

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.700
Take the lead.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.960
You have the ability to inform how participants
interact through your approach and demeanor.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.620
If you remain relaxed and flexible, your participants
will follow suit.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:30.520
Also, address and encourage each individual
participant, making sure that everyone is

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.609
involved in their own way.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:36.109
Do your best to ensure that you've engaged
with every participant individually at some

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:39.020
point during the conversation.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:44.250
And finally, maintain the integrity of the
group in order to best foster social exchange.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:49.020
Find ways to prompt connection between participants
throughout; don't create separate planes of

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.020
conversation.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:54.380
With these approaches in mind, you'll be able
to frame the conversation in a way that minimizes

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.400
challenging moments and encourages varied
forms of engagement.
