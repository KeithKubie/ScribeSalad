00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.190
We are asked, what is
the volume of this box?

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.900
And they tell us that
each cube is a cubic foot.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.630
So just as a reminder,
volume is a measure

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.560
of how much space does
something take up.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.690
And it's usually
measured in cubic units.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.730
And here we're talking
about cubic feet.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.270
And when they say that
each cube is a cubic foot,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.420
they're saying that each
of these little boxes,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.790
each of these cubes here, is
exactly a 1 foot by 1 foot

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.110
by 1 foot cube.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.679
We're in three
dimensions right now.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.220
We're talking about
three dimensions.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.420
3D, you literally
need three dimensions.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.610
You need how tall you
are, how wide you are,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.820
and how deep you are.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.840
And for a cubic foot, each
of those dimensions is one.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.500
So each of these
are one cubic foot.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.470
The entire shape has one,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.490
six cubic feet in it.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.250
So the volume of this
entire box is 6 cubic feet.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.080
And you see right here
the unit says feet,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.020
and it has a
superscript here of 3.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.367
This is feet to the third power.

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:01.200
You could view this as
feet times feet times

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.120
feet, or cubic feet.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.040
So this is 6 cubic feet.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.026
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:08.400
What is the volume
of this shape?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
So this one is quite
interesting right over here.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.620
You have-- let's see
if we can count these.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.316
So you have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:23.840
eight unit boxes,
or I guess these

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.020
are cubic inches
for this example.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
So we have 8 cubic inches.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.620
This is a lot of fun, especially
when we get to rotate it.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.780
So here, each cube is
a cubic foot again.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.740
So we have one, two,
three cubic feet.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.190
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.356
I like the ones that have
these kind of crazy shapes

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:47.340
that we have to rotate to be
able to see all the boxes.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.610
So each of these
is a cubic meter,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.520
which means that in each
dimension, each of these boxes

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.330
is a 1 by 1 by 1 meter.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.610
But how many boxes are there?

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.110
Let's see.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.510
We have one.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.490
We have one.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.390
Let me see if I can get a view
where I can look at it better.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.030
We have one, two, three,
four, five, six boxes.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.290
So the total volume
here is 6 cubic meters.
