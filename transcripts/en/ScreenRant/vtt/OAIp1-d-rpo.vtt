00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.620
No matter how skilled a writer, director,
or editor might be, there are always going

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.450
to be scenes or sequences that end up cut
from a finished film. Whether it's original

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.820
endings that didn't work with audiences, or
scenes that just couldn't fit the running

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.880
time, these scenes and alternate takes are
ones fans need to know about. Here are Screen

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.320
Rant's 10 Amazing Movie Scenes You've Never
Seen.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.320
Interstellar

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.800
No matter how confusing the ending of Christopher
Nolan's space epic was, it wrapped up almost

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.080
all of the suspense: the hero Coop sends the
science needed to save humanity back in time,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.710
before he travels back to Earth to meet his
elderly daughter, and heads out to find another

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.710
astronaut stranded on humanity's new home.
Some viewers had a problem with such a neat

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.540
and tidy ending, but the original script had
the wormhole to earth collapse when Coop sent

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.941
the data back. It apparently would have ended
with him floating inside a black hole, never

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:57.060
knowing if humans died out, before eventually
running out of air. They probably went with

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.930
the better ending in this case.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.180
The Shining

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.290
One of the most iconic horror movies of all
time, The Shining was always as flawless as

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.079
it's remembered to be. The movie originally
ended with the father, Jack, frozen in the

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.190
hedge maze, as his wife and son are treated
at a nearby hospital. The hotel manager shows

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.750
up claiming that there was no evidence of
any of the movie's action. Just when audiences

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.640
start to wonder if it was all in the characters'
heads, it's revealed that the manager knew

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.380
the truth all along, and even hired Jack to
keep the murders coming. After testing the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.490
film in theatres, director Stanley Kubrick
cut the scene from every print.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.760
Vacation

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.380
The movie that introduced the Griswold family
to the world was an instant hit, spawning

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.050
multiple sequels of disastrous family vacations.
The family's cross-country road trip to Walley

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.409
World - a parody of Walt Disney's famous theme
park - ends with them finding the park closed

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.480
- until they force their way in with a guard
held at gunpoint. But the original ending

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.590
was even weirder, sending Clark and his family
to the home of the park's founder, forcing

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.260
HIM to entertain them at gunpoint. The ending
tested so badly with audiences, it was completely

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.909
re-shot, but was softened up a bit and used
for Christmas Vacation years later.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.159
Mad Max Fury Road

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.620
Tom Hardy takes up Mel Gibson's role as the
drifter Max Rockatansky in Fury Road, helping

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.590
a group of women escape from a madman's fortress
and, eventually, reclaim it. According to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.430
director George Miller, the movie originally
was planned to have Max return to the Citadel,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.620
and reveal that he had fallen in love with
Furiosa, leaving them to build a new and better

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.230
city. It was Tom Hardy who challenged the
director, claiming that Max would be nowhere

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.271
near ready for a new family or responsibility.
Miller realized he was wrong, and the new

00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:39.859
ending was shot instead, with Max Disappearing
back into the Wasteland with a single nod.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.040
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.060
The third Terminator movie isn't remembered
too fondly, but one deleted scene is must-see

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.620
viewing for any fan of the series. When cutting
edge combat robots are being sold to the US

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.860
Military, the real soldier the Terminator
are based on is finally revealed: Chief Master

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.989
Sargent Candy. Seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger
playing the man behind the machine may not

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.319
fit with the overall tone, but there's no
denying that it features some of the best

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.949
jokes in the franchise.

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.829
Edge of&nbsp;Tomorrow

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.980
Tom Cruise and writer Christopher McQuarrie's
time travel/alien invasion story tackled some

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.439
seriously complicated time loop tactics, forcing
the hero to relive the same defeat over and

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.010
over again. Until the ending, when he saves
the day, he is sent back to the helicopter

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.909
that set the movie in motion, wins the war,
and meets the woman of his dreams - for the

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.499
first and hopefully last time. But the original
ending was planned to be nowhere near as happy.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.379
The hero still kills the villain, but the
movie would have ended when he wakes up a

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.469
day earlier - leaving the audience to wonder
if the entire story even happened, or will

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.889
happen all over again. It was only when Cruise
explained that the movie's comedy would be

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.980
stronger than expected that the director agreed
to give a happy ending to better fit the tone

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.499
of the story.

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.939
X-Men: First Class

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.400
The power of mind control can be a dangerous
thing in the wrong mutant's hands, so it's

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.421
a good thing the X-Men's Professor X always
acts responsibly. Well, almost always. When

00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:09.299
Charles and Erik are out recruiting mutants
in First Class, Charles finds a unique way

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.569
of showing his power. Instead of just reading
one mutant's mind, he alters her perception,

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.049
making his metal-bending partner appear in
women's clothing without him ever being the

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.400
wiser. It's such a good gag, it really is
hard to believe it didn't make the finished

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.510
cut.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.130
Star Wars

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.660
Remember when Obi-Wan warns Darth Vader that
killing him would make things even harder

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:36.000
on the former Jedi? The original trilogy doesn't
actually deliver on that warning the way you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
would think - but that wasn't always the case.
George Lucas long considered having Obi-Wan

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.650
reappear in Luke's battle with the Emperor,
even using powers from beyond the grave to

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.250
keep the Sith Lord's powers from him. The
twist would have ended with both Obi-Wan and

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.320
Yoda being brought back to life... And old
Ben revealing Luke's Uncle Owen was actually

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.680
Owen Kenobi, his brother. The prequels changed
all that, but we can still dream of what might

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.690
have been.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.690
Kill Bill

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.630
It's hard to believe that there were scenes
Quentin Tarantino was forced to leave out

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.700
of his Kill Bill epic, but one of the biggest
nods to the movie's Hong Kong action roots

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.880
wound up on the cutting room floor. The scene
from Volume 2 saw The Bride and Bill run into

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.620
an Australian martial artist out for revenge,
with Bill showing just how deadly he is, even

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.340
at an old age. It's easy to see why it was
cut for the flow of the second film, but Michael

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.870
Jai White's skills would have been more than
welcome for fans of flying fists.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.060
The Wolverine

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.380
Logan took some time off from his brightly-coloured
X-Men allies for a solo story more in line

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.310
with westerns than a typical comic book movie.
But The Wolverine still planned to include

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.140
one of the greatest nods to the characters
comic book roots - and a costume that fans

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.810
have been begging for ever since he first
appeared on screen. The final scene would

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.970
have shown Logan receiving a gift, opening
the chest to find his classic comic costume,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.960
complete with the brown and yellow mask. Out
of all the deleted scenes in comic book movies,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.560
this is the one that definitely should have
made the final cut.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.850
Those are the movie scenes too crazy, too
awesome, or too good to be true that we think

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.750
movie fans need to know about, but which ones
did we miss? Name them in the comments and
