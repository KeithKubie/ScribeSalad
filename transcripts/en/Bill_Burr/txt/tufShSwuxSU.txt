Speaker 1:          00:06          Like a boss. Kenny was, let's talk some F1 action. Did anybody, did you watch the Australian grampy grampy Grand Prix down in Melbourne, Australia? Uh, it was a great fucking race and it lived up to the hype that this year the Ferrari's we're going to be going, I've only watched this sport for one season, so I don't know shit about it all. I knows last year it was all about the Mercedes team, Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, you know, they had the whole days of thunder. You know, I'm the guy who's been around the block on the other fucking, I'm the Tom Cruise Guy, somebody fucking Robert Duvall and everybody else, which is watching last year. And if those two guys didn't hate each other, it would have been fucking boring as shit because basically every race was a race to the first corner. Whoever got there first was just driving through clean air and the cars was so equally matched.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Nobody could catch up with somebody. You basically had to fuck up where your car died. Um, so all the exciting racing was for like funeral fourth, fifth, sixth place or whatever. Three cycles going after it for the last, you know, championship point is they say, you know, back in 10th place that was exciting. But up front it was just Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg just just doing laps was, you know, Kinda got a little boring. So this year they were talking about how um, Ferrari was very quiet, eerily quiet during the off season working on their [inaudible] suspension and the engine and all that type of shit with the new regulations, whatever the fuck they are. I don't know what they are.

Speaker 2:          01:42          Uh, the ties are 25% wider than last year then

Speaker 1:          01:46          that they were going to make a serious challenge for, uh, against Mercedes issue. So the fucking race starts and a, the Australia Dude, I already forget his name. Rico Rican Berg. I have no fucking idea. Like eventually I'll, I'll, I'll get these people's names. Style Ricky rocket, I forget. Okay. Everybody wanted him to win. The poor bastard. He's down there and they're taken like the, the, the warmup lap or whatever. And uh, not even a warmup lap. They just going around and getting ready to get into positions. Just to do the warmup lap and his car gets stuck in sixth gear.

Speaker 2:          02:21          I think there's a, an electronic sensor issue, um, that it's stuck in sixth year. So if it can be cleared with a reset,

Speaker 1:          02:30          we've all been there, right? The side of the highway, except he's got 100,000 people in a fucking zillion millions of fans around the world watching this shit. So they got to push his car and they got to take out the fucking transmission in like five minutes, throw a new one in there, try and get it back in the fucking car before the race starts. That alone, if they just showed that, that would've been amazing. They can't kept cutting back to it. I wish they showed more of it. A long story short, he wasn't able to get out there until, uh, the second lap. He was already two laps down. So that kind of sucked for all the Australian fans and uh, then his car shit, the bed halfway through the race, however, so the race fucking starts. All right. I think Lewis Hamilton had the pole and then Sebastian Vettel, um, for Ferrari was in second place and uh, Louis had a great start and he was out front and I go, wow, I guess that's it.

Speaker 1:          03:19          I guess the Mercedes are gonna win it this year, right. So they get about 20 laps in and Lewis Hamilton pits, it's one of these races, it's like 57 laps. And the announcers were saying that they were going to pit one time and it's all when you pit and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So all this shit is becoming fascinating to me. So Lewis Hamilton goes into Pitt, right? Sebastian Vettel was, I don't know how far behind, a couple seconds behind he decides to stay out there. So the whole time when Louis was out there in first place, Sebastian's behind him. All right. So Lewis is driving in the clean air. It's like, you know, if you were on a fucking on a lake and you bring, it's just still water. You could, you could go way faster and your boat as opposed to if the water was all fucking choppy, you got to go slower than, it's the same thing except it to, it's with air.

Speaker 1:          04:08          I'm just saying this for everybody else out there. Who's dumb like me in the fact that air is invisible, you don't understand it. So no matter what this guy's doing, Sebastian Vettel, he can only get so close to a, to Louis Hamilton because all the air coming off of him, and I guess the tires are bigger this year, which causes more turbulence. It would actually, it, he's going to use more fuel and chew up more of his tires if he gets too close to him, which is really fucking, I dunno, I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. So Hamilton was having problems with the tire. He pits early

Speaker 3:          04:41          and it's the soft tire for Mercedes. So it starts to cool off down here. It can fill it.

Speaker 1:          04:46          So the Ferrari team takes a gamble and says, fuck this. We're gonna stay out there. So Sebastian now is in first place driving into clean air. He's got the nice smooth lake, he's bringing the boat across except it's a car and it's going through air. You still with me and he stays out there for one lap and they go, he's definitely going to come in for the second lap. Meanwhile, um, Louis Hamilton came right back out of the pits and then was you know, technically in fourth place but he's, you know, but he already pitted the other two guys in front of them have to pit and so does the other guy. So technically it's like he's still in first place but now he's driving in dirty air back there. So Sebastian's flying around the track, he goes around a second time and you know the tires are getting chewed up. He's driving like a fucking maniac and then he comes around a third time and then like he's not gonna, he's not going to fucking stay out there. He stayed out there again,

Speaker 3:          05:35          Hamilton losing time on this lab. Bet on you. Imagine not losing time, but he is going to lose time if he carries on and doesn't a pit. And guess what Ferrari have left him out. And

Speaker 1:          05:45          now basically it was like this was the most exciting part of a consistent to fucking race. So basically what he's trying to do, he's trying to get out so far ahead that he has time to pit when he goes in, get his tires and get back out on the track in front of fucking uh, Louis Hamilton. It was like a fucking movie. He pulls in his fourth time around

Speaker 3:          06:08          Zen. So we're Ferrari just waiting for that gap.

Speaker 1:          06:11          They fucking take the tires. You've got to go so fucking slow too. Now he got to slow down to like, like you're driving a Prius when you're in there. And as he's slowing down this show and Lewis is coming around, he's coming around, he's coming around, he gets the tires, fucking Sebastian's coming out. It's like a fucking action movie. And it was literally, he just,

Speaker 3:          06:28          Sebastian's battle comes in to stop now. Lewis Hamilton, is that the penultimate quarter? But Sebastien panel's going to come out, I guess walk surpassed bevel now ahead. Oh, blue is Hamilton. How about so behind for stepping or we've got federal Vistaprint. Hamilton,

Speaker 1:          06:43          Sebastian for Ferrari. Just get out in front of Louis Hamilton and then that was the race. You saw the Mercedes guy slammed his hand down on the guy in the pits, right? The head fucking guy, right? The guy goes the eyes wide shut illuminati parties at the end of the fucking race right there. Probably on some yacht that's like invisible, like the air that they drive through. Right. He fucking slammed his hand down like medium and then fucking slammed it down a second time. Right. Then I was like, this guy knows that this fucking race is over. And that was it. Ferrari won the first race.

Speaker 3:          07:13          So does Jim Federal starts off 2017 by winning the Australian grown play,

Speaker 1:          07:19          you know, backing up their lack of shit talk. They were real quiet in the off season. So, uh, I was actually really, you know, I like way my, I'm one of those guys, I like both, both team proceedings and Ferrari. I mean, I don't know how you'd get mad at either one of them. The fucking beautiful, amazing cars that they've built all this fucking, uh, over the years. So I'm just happy that this seems like there's going to be competition and if it can be as exciting as that, um, for the whole season, uh, I think, um, maybe some more you guys can get into it. Like I did, I believe the next races in China, in Indochino, in China. Um, that's going to be the next one. But I was, I was thrilled with the race. Um, I don't know how many F1 fans listen to this shit. Uh, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

Speaker 4:          08:07          It was a great race. I enjoyed it a lot. Thank you. Thank you very much. The basketball, all that wraps it up for our first round in the Australian grumpy here in Melbourne. See everyone in two weeks time in Shanghai, in China for round two. Thank you very much.
