00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.110
MIHAI IONESCU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.670
Welcome to another session of
"Developers Live." We're going

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.010
to talk about payments,
Wallet APIs, very

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.970
exciting session today.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.680
We're going to start with
some announcements.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.570
There have been quite a
few things happening

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.210
since we last talked.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.880
Then we have a demo.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.480
My colleague here, Peng,
will demo some of the

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.690
latest APIs in action.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.950
And, of course, we're going to
end with a Q&amp;A session and

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.850
answer your topics
raised on the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.940
forums and on the Moderator.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.725
So let's start with some
announcements.

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:55.280
A very exciting week, so what
happened this week?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.630
PENG YING: Yeah, so I can
finally talk about one of the

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.240
products I've been working
on for quite a bit.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.150
Well, I mean, this is
like the second

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.360
iteration of the product.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.900
But it's something that I think
is really useful to

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.420
developers and merchants.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.020
So the product itself is called
Google Wallet for

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.390
online commerce.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.010
And the idea is that, right now,
purchasing on the mobile

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.490
web is something that's very
time-consuming and difficult.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.310
I've seen statistics that state
something like 97% of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.360
all mobile web purchases
are canceled.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.670
What we set out to do is we set
out to make this process

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.220
more frictionless.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.150
And in order to do so, what
we're doing is we're

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.180
leveraging the power of Google
Wallet to enable these

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.020
transactions.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.100
And what I mean by that is
anybody who has made a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.280
purchase on Google Play, who has
made a purchase on Chrome

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.270
Web Store, or bought something
with Google Wallet has their

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.560
credentials stored
within the cloud.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.130
And what Google Wallet for
online commerce does is it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.760
allows merchants to leverage
these credentials.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.490
So when you allow a customer
to purchase Google Wallet,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.360
what happens is we pass
over a one-time use

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.000
card to your servers.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.600
And you can process the
transactions with your typical

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.240
transaction rails.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.030
And then I'll be showing a demo
of this in the near--

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.560
well, I'll be showing
a demo of this

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.460
later on in the session.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.240
So very exciting announcement.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.530
I think it has tremendous
benefit for mobile web

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.200
developers.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.730
MIHAI IONESCU: Absolutely.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.510
I'm looking forward
to the demo.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.100
What else?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.420
Oh, an announcement about
your questions on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.030
the forums and Google+.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.130
We're getting a lot of those.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.230
And we want to consolidate
them in just one place.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.510
And the best place to do that,
we think it's Stack Overflow.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.130
We've already been consolidating
a lot of Stack

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.980
Overflow questions from
other Google APIs.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.830
So look for an announcement
early next week.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.170
We're moving all our questions
to Stack Overflow.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.370
And the tag, of course,
will be Google Wallet.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.340
So we'll announce it
on the forums and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.142
on the Google+ page.

00:02:58.142 --> 00:02:58.640
PENG YING: Yep.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.770
So shall we talk about
the benefits?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.540
There's a few benefits--

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.040
MIHAI IONESCU: Of course.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.080
PENG YING: --of using
Stack Overflow.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.150
So one of the ones that I've
seen, well, one of the ones

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
that we've noticed is that
when you're using Google

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.020
Groups, which is our typical
one-to-many forum support

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.620
platform, is that when you have
a question about, let's

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.050
say, Google Wallet for digital
goods or checkout or something

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.400
else, these groups are kind of
isolated communities where the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.450
topics are all solely focused
on this one topic.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.700
And within Stack Overflow,
instead of that, it's a huge

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.800
community where these questions
are tagged with the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.190
topics that they're on.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.370
So what this enables us to do
is instead of having these

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.220
small, segregated groups, you
have one huge community with

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.550
everybody answering, everybody
interacting.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.400
So we hope that by switching
over to Stack Overflow, we

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.800
provide both a better
experience, and we help build

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.640
out the community for Google
commerce-related products.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.890
MIHAI IONESCU: Definitely
much easier to search.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.800
And right now, there's
also some

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.240
cross-pollination among APIs.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.320
Developers use different APIs.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.110
Stack Overflow is a much
better place to find

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.160
information about all available
Wallet APIs.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.380
Good.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.760
What else?

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.240
What else is new for
the next few weeks?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.300
We have some new conferences
that we're going to present

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.470
Wallet and talk about
Wallet APIs at.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.459
A very exciting one--

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.890
Google for Entrepreneurs
in Kansas City.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.420
So if you're from the Midwest
area, make sure you make time

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.030
to attend that.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.810
It's on November 13 at the
Kauffman Conference Center in

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.940
Kansas City.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.300
Cool.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.350
So let's do the demo.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.780
PENG YING: All right.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.540
Let's do the demo.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.480
If you could--

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.860
let's take a look
at my laptop.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.250
And then so right now, this
is the Five Guys.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.600
We announced Five Guys, one of
our premier launch partners.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.470
And the idea is that
normally I would--

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.890
so think of this as the
Five Guys mobile site.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.320
And then what we're going to be
doing here is just taking a

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.470
look at how the flow is
different between using Google

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.950
Wallet for digital goods and how
it can simplify the flow.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.340
So let's say I want to order
lunch, and there's a

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.180
Five Guys around me.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.410
This is the one in San Diego,
which has Google Wallet for

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.090
online commerce enabled.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.720
So I just want to
get a burger--

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.680
regular hamburger, delicious,
delicious hamburgers, all the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.170
Way, of course.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.870
MIHAI IONESCU: All the way?

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.740
PENG YING: All the way.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.030
And then here you can
see it, the Buy with

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.950
Google Wallet button.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.270
So if I want to continue
my typical

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.340
checkout, I would do that.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.710
And then I would have to either
login or create an

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.900
account or checkout as guest.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.930
And then I'd have to enter in
some additional information

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.420
such as credit card
names, info.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.940
MIHAI IONESCU: So how
much data is that?

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.500
PENG YING: It's a few
extra fields.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.690
But in this case, so if I'm
using an Android device, I'm

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.190
already typically logged
in, which is

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.630
something I can leverage.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.490
And in this case, I'm also
logged into their browser, so

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.430
it knows who I am.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.270
I can simply click Buy
with Google Wallets.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.580
I can enable this transaction.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.640
And then Use the Same Shipping
Address, Use Google Wallet.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.270
So this is pre-authorizing Five
Guys to have access to my

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.120
Wallet credentials.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.310
So next time, you'll see
how the flow changes.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.770
I'll do this twice.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.020
I'm going to continue here.

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:24.900
And then boom.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.910
So it has all my payment
credentials and payment

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.820
information and contact
information.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.280
Now, if I place this order,
I'll actually get a

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.830
cheeseburger in San Diego.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.870
And I'm in Mountain View, so
unfortunately, I'm won't

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.700
complete this one.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.140
But we can go over to--

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.680
we made a sample as
well, so we go to

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.760
wallet.java.appspot.com.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.110
Actually, let's go to
our documentation.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.360
Because the sample is also
iFramed in our documentation.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:57.066
So go to developers.googl
e.com/wallet-online.

00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:01.190
And so this is our sample and
our documentation as well.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.860
And I just want to walk
you through it.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.400
So if I wanted to buy a camera
on our sample, I would add it

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.760
to the cart.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.350
And then here, I could either
buy with Google Wallet or

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.020
Continue Checkout.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.560
The button changed a little bit,
which is why the spacing

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.800
is a little bit off.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.970
But that one's going to be fixed
in the very near future.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.710
So I'm already pre-authorized
on this site.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.500
So instead of confirming my
selections about my method of

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.630
payment, about my shipping
address, I can simply click

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.000
Buy with Google Wallet.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.310
And it automatically passes the

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.970
information over to the merchant.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.990
And in this case, it's Sandbox,
fake information, so

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.860
no real-world transaction's
going to be processed.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.040
I can place this order,
and I'm done.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.740
It might take a second,
a quick second.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.000
And there you go.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.780
I have my receipt.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.290
I have purchased my good.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.280
I didn't have to add any of
my billing or shipping

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.540
information in my mobile
device, which is

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.240
super painful at times.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.800
And I can continue on with
my rest of the day.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.090
Let's say if I wanted to buy
another item, or in this case,

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.300
maybe I want to upgrade
my camera, I can go

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.390
through the same flow.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.480
And because I'm pre-authorized
now, what you can also do is

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.830
tie the Continue Checkout
button with the

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.350
Google Wallet call.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.147
And so Continue Checkout can
also request credentials from

00:08:17.147 --> 00:08:18.430
Google Wallet.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.410
Think of it as a OAuth2-style
payment credential access, so

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.480
something that could be
potentially super powerful.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.390
I can continue through it.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.490
And I'm done.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.289
And because what's happening
here is that Google Wallet is

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.309
passing over a one-time cards to
the merchant, merchants and

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.460
developers don't really have
to change their existing

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.770
payment rails.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.100
So it's super, super simplistic
integration.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.780
And we can walk through-- well,
I don't think we need to

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.460
walk through it today.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.540
But you can take a look at the
documentation yourself.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.010
It's under Tutorial.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.240
Right now, sign up,
unfortunately, is closed.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.490
We're only working with
the partners.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.530
But if you are interested in
becoming one of our upcoming

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.660
or future partners, then you
can sign up through--

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.230
there's a link on
the FAQ page.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.480
It's right at the bottom.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.220
So contact us.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.630
And then we are always looking
to add additional partners.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.000
Cool.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.360
So if you want to find out
more, visit this site,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.150
developers.googl
e.com/wallet-online.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.700
Play with the APIs or play
with the sample.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.410
Take a look at the APIs.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.620
And then if you're really
interested, express your

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.480
interest by contacting us.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.540
MIHAI IONESCU: What other
merchants do we have that

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.540
there are live with this
API right now?

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.900
PENG YING: So we have
1-800-Flowers is

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.890
live with this API.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.930
And I forget the last one.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:48.460
MIHAI IONESCU: Rockport.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:48.950
PENG YING: Is it Rockport?

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.160
MIHAI IONESCU: Rockport, yeah.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.090
PENG YING: OK, so Rockport is
also live with this API.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.980
And we hope we get a
few, or many more.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.360
MIHAI IONESCU: If you want to
buy flowers or shoes or--

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:58.580
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.990
Flowers, shoes, or
cheeseburgers.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.200
MIHAI IONESCU: We've covered
the entire spectrum.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.570
But flowers would
be really nice.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.320
And you want to buy
them on the spot.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.405
And you have only your
mobile device.

00:10:09.405 --> 00:10:09.985
PENG YING: Exactly.

00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:12.510
MIHAI IONESCU: You don't need
to insert all the address

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.930
information, all the
card information.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.500
Just one click--

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.135
PENG YING: And you're done.

00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:19.350
MIHAI IONESCU: --your loved
one gets the flowers.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.210
PENG YING: I can see this
being really useful,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.490
especially for mobile
ordering.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:29.500
I can see instead of going to
whatever fast food place where

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.120
we're getting lunch and then
waiting in line and then

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.500
placing your order and waiting
for it to be cooked, that

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.650
people can just go on their
phone and place their order

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.390
ahead of time and then
go and pick it up.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.580
I think that's something that's
a huge time saver.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.640
There's also a lot of other
potentials in this.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.650
I think mobile commerce
is one field

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.220
that's definitely growing.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.060
So with that, there's a lot of
opportunity here, like maybe

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.350
hotels or something.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.940
MIHAI IONESCU: More
time to eat, and

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.180
more time to buy stuff.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.085
PENG YING: Like hotels and
travel will probably be

00:11:00.085 --> 00:11:01.840
another big area.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.810
MIHAI IONESCU: It's making
lives easier and

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.260
commerce more efficient.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.400
Thanks, Peng, for the demo.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.625
We hope you liked it.

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:12.760
And make sure you go check
out the demo line or the

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.690
documentation.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.120
And if you're interested in
trying it in the Sandbox and

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.660
learning more about the API, use
the merchant sign-up form.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.230
And we'll get in contact
with you.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.680
Great.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.040
So next, let's look
at some questions.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.910
We've got quite a few questions
submitted in the

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.175
forums and in the Moderator.

00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:34.030
Charles started the first one.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:38.450
So it's a subscription
API-related question, that's

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.450
subscription for digital
goods API.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.160
And the question is, "Can I
create a subscription with no

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.560
expiration date?"

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.340
So that is a very
good question.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.410
And currently, the API requires
you to specify the

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.770
number of times the subscription
payment recurs.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.990
So you cannot create an
open-ended subscription with

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.220
no expiration date.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.170
But it is indeed a very
valid case and

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.570
something that makes sense.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.110
So we are working to add that
additional functionality.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.930
And we hope to have it soon.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.400
So thank you for the question.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.530
And it's something that's
in the works.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.290
You want to take the next one?

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:16.950
PENG YING: Sure.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.640
So "When will the Save-to-Wallet
Offers API be

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.720
generally available to online
merchants?" We get questions

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.300
about when things are going to
be released all the time, and

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.430
when will they be available to
merchants, or when are we

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.440
going to do this.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.100
Unfortunately, we can never
comment on any of that.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.400
I wish we could.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.600
But in this case, all I
can say is soon, in

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.790
the upcoming future.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.420
MIHAI IONESCU: We do have some
documentation, though, if

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.170
people want to learn
more about it.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:49.560
PENG YING: We do.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.420
I think--

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.230
I forget.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.965
I haven't taken a look
at the API myself.

00:12:52.965 --> 00:12:56.770
So I don't know too much about
how available it is, either.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.660
But there is documentation
available.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.340
MIHAI IONESCU: I'll
take the next one.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.790
Along the same lines, "Any word
on support for Sprint

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.810
Galaxy Note 2?" So I think
we support all

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.360
Galaxy devices on Sprint.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.910
Sprint is one of our partners
for Google Wallet.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.650
And I would be surprised if
Galaxy Node doesn't work.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.710
I may be wrong.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:26.700
But to make sure you have a
device that works, there is a

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.680
list of available devices.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.800
And it should be listed there.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.840
And the list is in
the Help Session.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.930
So if you go to
wallet.google.com, and at the

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.690
bottom of the page you click on
Help, you will see the Help

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.800
Center, and then there's a
link to eligible devices.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.660
And most if not all of Sprint
devices are listed there.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.150
So you can check that.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.200
Next one.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.485
PENG YING: I guess this
one's for me.

00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:54.410
"T-Mobile--

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.022
what are the chances of an
agreement coming through or at

00:13:57.022 --> 00:14:02.230
least support for the Galaxy S3
for Google Wallet?" Again,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.750
we're working with all
of the carriers.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.420
And I can't say any more
details, but we're working

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.740
with the powers that be.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.200
MIHAI IONESCU: So Galaxy
now works on MetroPCS.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:17.120
We just announced availability
on MetroPCS.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.680
And T-Mobile is buying
MetroPCS.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.795
So you never know.

00:14:19.795 --> 00:14:22.200
PENG YING: I heard MetroPCS
is growing a lot.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.650
They've had huge subscriber
growth.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.250
MIHAI IONESCU: All right,
I'll take the next one.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.740
The question is, "When will
support for international

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.950
buyers be added to the Google
Wallet for online commerce

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.210
API?" So we just talked about
it, the Google Wallet for

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.110
online commerce.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.180
We saw demo that Peng did.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.370
And right now, it's released
to a limited number of

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.250
participating partners that we
just launched with yesterday.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.010
It's not even fully available
in the United States.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.200
Things will slowly
be released.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.010
If you are a United States
merchant, you can

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.370
apply to test it.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.380
We just showed you the sign-up
link in the FAQ section.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.530
And then we hope to have more
merchants available soon, also

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.210
internationally.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.380
PENG YING: Yep.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.390
That'll be very awesome.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.770
We want to expand as quickly
as possible.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.340
MIHAI IONESCU: It is a
really useful API.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.010
And we've seen a lot of interest
from merchants.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.815
And we love international
merchants.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.060
Next one?

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.340
PENG YING: Next one's for me.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.500
"Will there be any APIs exposed
for adding loyalty

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.880
cards?" Again, I wish I could
comment on things.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.810
I mean, I can't speculate on
when things are going to be

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.990
launched or if they're going
to be launched, even.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.140
So I guess it's going to
be a waiting game.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.960
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, which one
is going to be released first?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.510
PENG YING: If it's launched,
then it's launched.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.910
And then you'll know.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.150
MIHAI IONESCU: I'll
take the next one,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.640
which is somehow related.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.440
There is one merchant who
says, "We are running a

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.270
universal loyalty platform
using NFC tags.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.560
If I want users to be able to
adopt into the Google Wallet

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.580
ecosystem, what is the tag
specification to be used?" So

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.920
if I understand the question
correctly, it is about

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.690
NFC-enabled loyalty cards.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:19.200
For example, at the grocery
store, instead of swiping the

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.450
card, you just tap the card.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.810
And that'll be your
loyalty card.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.520
If you have multiple cards like
that, definitely it makes

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.850
sense to add all of them
into the phone.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.880
And don't go--

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.930
when you switch retailers--

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.410
PENG YING: --NFC to NFC.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.780
MIHAI IONESCU: And then you
just tap the phone, and

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.190
automatically it
will just work.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.890
So instead of carrying
a lot of cards, you

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.420
just carry the phone.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.730
So as we talked in the past,
this would fit perfectly

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.790
within the Wallet ecosystem.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:51.330
Right now, as we said earlier,
we don't have an API.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.140
But, yeah, it's something
that is definitely worth

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.080
considering.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.440
PENG YING: Yeah, they could
even-- so like, we do some

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.390
stuff in the background, too.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.980
So it doesn't have to
be NFC-enabled.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.720
It could be maybe
a back-end API.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.730
When the transaction gets to
Google, then we can do

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.630
something with the transaction
information as well.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.950
MIHAI IONESCU: So an API for
the merchant, we enable the

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.369
loyalty card directly
on the phone.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:17.910
That would be something great.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.420
Let's see.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.060
I guess that's it
for questions.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.790
Anything else we want
to announce?

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.040
So we can recap.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.770
So we had major release
this week.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.210
PENG YING: Google Wallet for
online commerce, now available

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.480
for consumers.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.150
Soon for developers and
merchants like yourselves.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.780
MIHAI IONESCU: And then next
week, look for an announcement

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.360
for Stack Overflow.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.810
We're moving all our questions,
all our support to

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.050
Stack Overflow across
all Wallet APIs.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:00.610
And if you're in the Midwest
area, Kansas City, there is a

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.220
Google for Entrepreneurs
Conference at the Kauffman

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.570
Center, November 13.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.280
If you have time, it's going
to be really cool.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.616
Make sure to attend
and sign up.

00:18:09.616 --> 00:18:10.040
PENG YING: Awesome.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.730
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.690
Well, thank you.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.490
PENG YING: Short and
sweet this week.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.450
Next week we have a great show
for you-- or not next week.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.140
In two weeks, we have another
great session for you.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.680
We'll be bringing on a partner
to showcase how they've

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.520
implemented Google Wallet
for digital goods.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.390
MIHAI IONESCU: Monetization.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.460
PENG YING: Yeah, monetization.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.390
MIHAI IONESCU: It's
making money.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.740
PENG YING: It's going
to be fun.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.330
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.240
Thanks, everyone.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.460
And see you in two weeks.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:32.930
PENG YING: See you.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.180
MIHAI IONESCU: Bye-bye.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:19:00.233
