00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.250
Solve for x, and we have the
absolute value of 2x minus 5

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.150
is equal to 11.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.340
Now, the big, I
guess, insight you

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.370
need to have whenever you
have an absolute value

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.994
equation like this
is just to remember,

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.640
if I have the
absolute value of a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.000
is equal to 11, what
do we know about a?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.460
That means that a is equal to
11, or what else could a be?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.830
Well, it could be negative 11.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.110
a could be equal to negative
11 because there's two possible

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.070
a's that are exactly
11 away from 0.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.660
It could be positive 11 or
it could be negative 11.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.950
That's the exact same logic you
apply in an equation like this.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.180
If the absolute value of
2x minus 5 is equal to 11,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.800
that means that the stuff
inside the absolute value sign

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.550
either equals 11 or the stuff
inside the absolute value sign

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.770
is equal to negative 11.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.140
Because if this is equal to 11,
the absolute value of 11 is 11.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.140
If this thing over here
is equal to negative 11,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.514
when you take its
absolute value,

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:05.360
it'll still be equal to 11.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.940
So let's write that down.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.270
So 2x minus 5 could
be equal to 11 or 2x

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.470
minus 5 could be equal
to negative 11, right?

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.720
Because in either case, if
we took its absolute value,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.240
you would get 11.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.550
Now, let's just solve
each of these equations.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.550
Over here, we can add 5 to
both sides of this equation.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.820
We get 11 plus 5 is 16.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.440
2x minus 5 plus 5 is just 2x.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.770
2x is equal to 16.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.630
Divide both sides by 2,
we get x is equal to 8.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.760
Now, let's do this situation.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.140
2x minus 5 is equal
to negative 11.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.410
Let's add 5 to both
sides of this equation.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.210
The left-hand side we just
get a 2x, the 5's cancel out.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.370
2x is equal to negative 5
plus 11, that's negative 6,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.130
and then we can divide
both sides by 2.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.820
And we get x is
equal to negative 3.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.760
So we've gotten two
solutions depending

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.770
on whether this thing
in here is either

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.450
equal to 11 or negative 11.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.770
We got x could be equal to
8, in which case 2x minus 5

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.040
would be 11, or we have x is
equal to negative 3, in which

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.930
case 2x minus 5 is
equal to negative 11.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.260
Let's verify it.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.940
So if x is equal
to 8, let's show

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.180
that it satisfies this equation.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.890
So we'd get 2 times 8 minus 5.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.290
The absolute value of 2 times 8
minus 5 should be equal to 11.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.026
2 times 8 is 16
minus 5 is 11, so we

00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:44.540
have the absolute value of
11, should be equal to 11.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.970
And we know that's true.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.130
The absolute value of 11 is 11.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.740
So it all works out.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.740
Now, let's try it with x
is equal to negative 3.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.530
We get the absolute value of
2 times negative 3 minus 5

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.050
should be equal to 11.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.250
So what's 2 times negative 3?

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.440
2 times negative 3 is
negative 6 minus 5.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.740
The absolute value of that
should be equal to 11.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.810
Well, negative 6 minus
5 is negative 11.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.500
So the absolute
value of negative 11

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.170
should be equal
to 11, and it is.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.600
The absolute value
of negative 11 is 11.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.480
So we get 11 is equal to 11.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.605
So they both work.
