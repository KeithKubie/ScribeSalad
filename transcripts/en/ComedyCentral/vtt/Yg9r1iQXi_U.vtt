00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:06.105
[indistinct audio]

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.709
- NO! [audience ohs]
- OH!

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.046
REJECTED!
[laughter]

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.048
MAYBE HE SHOULD JUST BE ONE
OF THOSE INDOOR KIDS THAT READS.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:19.551
MAYBE MOLLY MAIDS THERE
WILL HELP CLEAN UP YOUR FACE.

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:25.024
[laughter]
THAT DOESN'T LOOK VERY HARD.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:30.063
I WANT TO TRY.
SCORE.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.100
DO YOU WANT ME TO HONESTLY TELL
YOU HOW MANY TIMES THAT TOOK?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.202
- YEAH.
- ONE.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:36.269
YOU NEVER SEE RICH PEOPLE WITH
TRAMPOLINES.

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.905
[laughter]
IT'S LIKE AN ABOVE-GROUND POOL.

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.809
IT'S JUST NOT AN UPSCALE
PIECE OF LAWN FURNITURE.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.544
HEY, AT LEAST THEY SPRUNG
FOR THE SAFETY NET.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.245
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.548
WELL, HERE'S ONE THING
THAT COULD GO WRONG.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.916
THE KIDS COULD START
DOUBLE-BOUNCING

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.718
THE [bleep]
OUT OF EACH OTHER.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.086
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW
WHAT A DOUBLE-BOUNCE IS,

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.389
IT'S THE TRAMPOLINE EQUIVALENT
OF A SPEEDBALL.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.225
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW
WHAT A SPEEDBALL IS,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.926
IT'S WHAT KILLED JOHN BELUSHI.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.263
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW
WHO JOHN BELUSHI IS,

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.265
HE'S JIM BELUSHI'S BROTHER.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.434
FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO DON'T KNOW WHO JIM IS,

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.603
HE'S THE GUY
FROM ACCORDING TO JIM.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.106
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DIDN'T
WATCH ACCORDING TO JIM,

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:17.577
CONGRATULATIONS.
OH, WOW, IS HE UP THERE.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.313
SOMEBODY JUST CAUGHT FIRE
NBA JAM STYLE.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:25.951
SAVOR THE MOMENT, SCOTTY SKILES,
'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT TO TURN SOUR.

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.354
[audience oohs]

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.490
THAT'S A TECHNICAL FOUL.
GET OFF THE RIM.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.128
YEAH, SUCK IT, VINCE CARTER.
DANGLING BY YOUR ELBOW?

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.230
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
SUCH A BIG DEAL ANYMORE.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.701
- AHH!
- MMM. IT HURTS TO HEAR.

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.137
THIS IS WHERE HE
AND HIS TORN ACL

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:47.239
COULD LEARN A LESSON
FROM SASHA.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.976
JUST DISTRIBUTE THE BALL,
SET SOME SCREENS,

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.377
AND DRAW DEFENDERS
OUT OF THE LANE

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.446
SO REAL PLAYERS
CAN PUT ON A SHOW.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:56.215
- [whimpering]

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.351
- AND WHY IS HE CRYING
LIKE NANCY KERRIGAN?

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.089
YOU'RE WHITE.
YOU DON'T GET TO DUNK.

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:06.826
BY HAVING GIRLS PLAY THEM.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:09.395
I DON'T MEAN THE WNBA.
I MEAN GIRL GIRLS.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.199
THERE'S LINGERIE FOOTBALL,
FOXY BOXING, AND STRIPPER GOLF.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.767
BUT LADIES HAVE NOTHING
TO MASTURBATE TO

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.436
WHILE THEY WATCH SPORTS,
AND IN MY BOOK, THAT'S SEXIST.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.971
THAT'S WHY I CREATED
THE INTER-SHOWBIZ

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.040
BOTTOMLESS BASKETBALL LEAGUE.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.080
- [groans]

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.653
[cheers and applause]

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:42.394
- IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH PLAYING
AGAINST THE CAST OF TREME.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.497
FINALLY,
BY NOW EVERYONE KNOWS

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.065
INSTEAD OF WINNING BASKETBALL
GAMES THE HONORABLE WAY,

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:49.702
ARIZONA STATE CREATED
THE CURTAIN OF DISTRACTION

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:53.306
TO SCREW WITH THE OPPOSING TEAM
WHILE THEY'RE TAKING FOUL SHOTS.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:03:00.713
[LAUGHS]
YEAH, THAT'S INNOCENT ENOUGH,

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.683
BUT THEN THEY STARTED
TO GET A LITTLE PERSONAL.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.485
&gt;&gt; YOUR TEST RESULTS ARE IN.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:09.822
YOU HAVE HODGKIN'S
AND NON-HODGKIN'S AND HERPES!

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.757
YOU GOT THE HERP!

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:14.260
&gt;&gt; HODGKIN'S AND NON-HODGKIN'S
CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:18.397
THIS NEXT ONE I THOUGHT
WAS REALLY SCARY.

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:22.902
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] HOO!
YOU CAN'T RID OF THE BABADOOK.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:26.305
YEAH! NOBODY CAN GET RID
OF THE BABADOOK. WHOO!

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.442
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T MESS
WITH THE BABADOOK.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.144
THAT'S JUST IRRESPONSIBLE.

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.580
THIS ONE WAS
A DOWNRIGHT TEARJERKER.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.317
&gt;&gt; THERE HE IS. THERE'S MY DADDY
AT THE FREE THROW LINE.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.853
PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING
AND RAISE ME.

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.058
&gt;&gt; IS THAT A MIXED BABY?
YOU GIVE ME THAT MIXED BABY.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.759
I WILL HAPPILY RAISE HIM.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.464
I'M NOT GONNA LIE, I FOUND THIS
NEXT ONE A LITTLE OFFENSIVE.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.935
&gt;&gt; EINS, ZWEI, DREI, VIER.
I DECLARE A THUMB WAR.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.770
&gt;&gt; AH, JESUS!

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.441
&gt;&gt; COME ON ADOLF, NOBODY [BLEEP]
WITH THE JESUS!

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.943
AND THEN, JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:07.079
THEY COULDN'T BE
ANY MORE DISTRACTING,

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.649
YOU HEARTLESS MONSTERS GO
AND DO THIS.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.120
&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT YOUR MOM!
READ THIS.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.256
&gt;&gt; "MISS THE FREE
THROW, PLEASE."

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.992
&gt;&gt; KEEP UP THOSE BRUTAL TACTICS,
ASU,

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:22.395
AND YOU MAY ACTUALLY GET OFF
THAT NIT BUBBLE.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:25.831
WOMEN ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO TRAP
MEN BY GETTING PREGNANT.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:29.769
WHICH IS CRAZY BECAUSE RUINING
YOUR BODY

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.472
PERMANENTLY SEEMS LIKE
A GUARANTEED WAY

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.173
TO MAKE SURE
I DON'T STICK AROUND.

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:38.511
BUT THIS NEXT GIRL'S PRANK
TAKES IT A LITTLE TOO FAR.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.446
&gt;&gt; HI. SORRY. I'M ANDREA.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.114
UM, DO YOU NOT
RECOGNIZE ME AT ALL?

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:43.482
YOUR BOYFRIEND GOT ME PREGNANT,

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:44.817
AND HE'S GONNA
HELP ME OUT WITH IT.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.519
HE GOT ME PREGNANT AT A PARTY.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.922
ARE YOU GONNA
HELP ME AT ALL OR...

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.891
&gt;&gt; YEAH, OF COURSE.
HEY, I GOT YOU.

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.592
&gt;&gt; NOT FUNNY.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:57.029
A GIRL TRIED THE PREGNANT
BASKETBALL PRANK ON ME ONCE,

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.064
OH, BUT I THINK
I HANDLED IT PRETTY WELL.

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:03.602
&gt;&gt; HEY, THIS IS YOURS.
YOU GOT ME PREGNANT.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.171
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SURE?

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:07.473
&gt;&gt; I'M SURE.
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, HONEY.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.874
I HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:10.576
&gt;&gt; [GIGGLES]
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:15.948
&gt;&gt; WHO'S THE BABY?
YOU SEE THE DOGGY?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.421
PEDAL! PEDAL! PEDAL! PEDAL!
DUNK IT!

00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:27.159
YAY! I REMEMBER MY PROM.
ALL RIGHT, ONE LAST PHOTO.

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.095
I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF YOU,
SON.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.996
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:33.433
SHORTLY AFTER THAT...
I'M SORRY.

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:37.570
HE ROLLED INTO THE STREET
AND WAS HIT BY A CAR.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.005
NO PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE
TO BURY THEIR BASKETBALL.

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:41.340
OKAY, GOOD NIGHT.
BEFORE I GO,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.574
I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION:
WOULD YOU RATHER?
