EDDIE KAY: I'd like to introduce
John Fox, who is a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
Harvard Ph.D. anthropologist,
who has excavated ancient ball

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.200
courts in Central America,
traced Marco Polo's route

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.880
across China, and bicycled
Africa's Rift Valley in search

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.424
of human origins.

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:26.070
He has contributed commentary
to Vermont Public Radio, has

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.522
written for "Smithsonian,"
"Outside," and "Salon," among

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:33.040
other publications, and in 2010
was awarded a MacDowell

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.140
Colony Fellowship.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.430
He is also the author of "Around
the World With a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.150
Million Kids: Adventures of an
Online Explorer," a collection

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.230
of essays written while
co-leading the groundbreaking

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.860
Quest Interactive Educational
Expeditions.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.916
Please join me in giving a
warm welcome to John Fox.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:55.876
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:58.390
JOHN FOX: All right, thanks
very much, Eddie.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.390
And thank you all for
coming today.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930
And anybody that is remote,
hopefully you can hear me and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.020
see me as long as I stay
in my box over here.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.570
So, great to come
here and talk.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.420
I have to say thanks, first of
all, to Google, because I used

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.770
Google extensively in
researching this book--

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.540
particularly Google Books, which
I never realized until I

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.760
actually had a book project
myself to write what an

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.350
extraordinary resource
that is.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.530
So kudos to all you guys do.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.780
It's definitely a huge help.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.760
So first a little background on
how this book came to be.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.490
It started, interestingly, with
a question that my son

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.440
asked me when he was 7.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.940
He is now 12, and he's
still as fanatic

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.830
about sports as ever.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.370
I was living in Vermont
at the time--

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.250
had not moved to Boston yet--

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.500
and it was a spring day.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.120
It was Red Sox season.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.720
It was one of the seasons
where they were actually

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.390
winning from the get-go,
which was good.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.010
It was a good spring.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.199
And we were playing catch
in the backyard--

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.990
really sort of typical
father-son scene--

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.640
and my precocious son stops, and
he says, hey Dad, why do

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.800
we play ball, anyway?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.480
It was one of these kind of
existential questions that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.550
kids tend to ask at that
particular age-- sometimes

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.580
maddening, but always
intriguing.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.150
And it kind of stuck with me.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.860
As the play went on, the
moment passed, he got

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.960
distracted by other things,
and that was that.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.320
But for me it kind of stuck.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.880
And the reason it stuck was
years before, as a graduate

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.890
student in anthropology, I had
done research on an ancient

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.370
game played by the Maya and the
Aztec in Central America.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.970
And I'd written a dissertation
that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.540
probably five people read--

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.510
maybe six.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.660
And I'd spent time in the wilds
of Honduras excavating

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.880
these ancient stadiums that I'll
talk a little bit more

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.910
about and became captivated
by that subject.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.450
But I had set it aside, done
other writing and other work,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.340
and the years had moved on.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.450
But his question sparked a new
interest in the topic.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.180
And it kind of broke it open
in the way that kids can do

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.010
that, because it took it from
a kind of esoteric, academic

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.170
subject to something much bigger
and philosophical.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.940
Why do we play ball?

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.130
Why do we play the
games we play?

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.890
How did we get to the games we
play today in terms of the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.920
history of these games?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.210
And ultimately, why do they
mean so much to us?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.960
Why are we so unbelievably
obsessed and

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.710
captivated with them?

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.970
So that set me off on a
journey-- literally--

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.130
around the world and through
time exploring a lot of the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.390
games we're familiar with
and some that we're not.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.710
So today I'm going to whip you
through the centuries and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.420
across some continents to give
you an overview of where the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.430
book and the story took me.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.580
And then I'll open it up for
questions, and we can talk a

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.610
little bit more.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.000
So this is an image
that I love--

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.649
really, really, really love.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:24.160
It was photographed by a woman
named Jessica Hilltout in a

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.000
book called "Amen," and it was
during the last World Cup in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.510
South Africa.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.730
And she decided to look
at the other side

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.470
of the game of soccer.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.550
So while all the fanfare was
happening in Johannesburg, she

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.530
went off into all these
villages in Africa.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.820
And she gave out
soccer balls--

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.420
like nice, shiny Adidas
balls-- in return for

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.270
photographing the balls
that kids were

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.200
using in these villages.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.110
And this is one of them made
from rags and twine.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.460
The photos in this book
are just incredible.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.910
One of the things that they
convey is this kind of desire

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.000
to play, the desire and the
passion around these objects--

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.880
the ball--

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.550
that whether you have the
technology, and you have the

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.000
money to purchase the latest
and greatest, you

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.420
figure out a way.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.910
And it says a lot about the
spirit of the game.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.240
I had to throw this in.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.350
I realize 1,000,360,000 results
for "ball" is actually

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.240
a pretty good number.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.410
I googled "God" right after
this, and it was only a few

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.990
hundred billion more
than ball.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.210
So it clearly is a pretty
dominant theme

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.420
globally, I would say.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.950
I would love your help
in moving my book up

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.800
the rankings here.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.880
As you can see, they're
not close to the top.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.680
So first of all, I decided to
start at the beginning, or

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.210
even before the beginning.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.375
In other words, "why do we play
ball" starts with "why do

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:03.270
we play at all?" And
what is play?

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.250
And I found in my research
there's a lot of incredibly

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.540
interesting research
going on now--

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.150
scientific research--

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.950
around the importance of play,
not just socially, but also

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.770
psychologically,
developmentally,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.670
especially for kids.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.850
And a lot of this research is
focused on animals, because as

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.950
this great scholar Johan
Huizinga who wrote this

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.290
treatise on play in the early
20th century commented,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.300
"Animals haven't waited for
man to teach them how to

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.830
play." So anybody who has a dog,
goes out and plays ball

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.720
with them, or has seen other
animals play knows that this

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.810
is really true, that
play is not

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.380
something that we invented.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.680
It's something much deeper and
much more ancient than that.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.220
So I went to Florida to a place
called Gulf World--

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.900
pretty quirky, old, kind of
falling apart marine park--

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.180
where I met a scientist named
Stan Kuczaj, who's originally

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.000
a psychologist and is now
a dolphin researcher.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.590
And he's been studying, for
years, play among dolphins.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.410
And he's found some really
interesting things.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.720
One is that dolphins are
extremely playful,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.430
particularly this one type
that he studied called

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.730
rough-toothed dolphins.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.860
They use play as a way of
learning about the world and

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.020
testing their physical limits,
understanding the boundaries--

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.130
both the social boundaries
of their pod and their

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.230
relationship with
other dolphins--

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.260
but their physical boundaries in
terms of how to swim in the

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.720
wild and be safe and dodge
predators and be on the alert.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.080
So he's done all these studies
that really indicate that play

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.780
for dolphins is a fundamental
part of their survival.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.130
And this is interesting, and
this research is interesting,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.030
because for years play was seen
as the opposite of what's

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.500
serious or work.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.620
It was seen as something
frivolous, and scientists had

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.790
really struggled to find any
biological reason why any

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.370
animal should play.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.190
In fact, if you really boil it
down, play often exposes

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.470
animals to danger.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.940
It depletes their energy.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.950
It puts them in precarious
situations, oftentimes, where

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.920
they're distracted.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.230
So in many respects, play should
be the opposite of

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.210
something that selected for,
and yet it's selected for

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.570
again and again.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.010
There's been some other really
interesting studies done with

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.610
rats where one group of rats
is separated from another.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.490
One group is allowed to play
and encouraged to play with

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.450
frenzy, and the other is shut
out and apart from each other,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.970
and they're not allowed
to play.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.200
And over time, the
ones that are

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.390
playing develop a protein--

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.260
a neurotrophic factor-- that
actually stimulates the

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.340
prefrontal cortex, which is
where emotional intelligence

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.600
and decision making
originates.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.730
So a lot of these studies are
showing that play actually

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.150
makes you smarter--

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.510
makes animals smarter and most
likely humans in the way it

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.790
helps us actually develop our
brains, our social skills, our

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.650
emotional intelligence.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.280
So that was where the book
started, was what is play, and

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.190
where does it come from?

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.440
And there's a lot
more on that.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.780
Sweeping through time--

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.840
so there's not much evidence
for ball play or sports,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.200
obviously, among
hunter-gatherers in the

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:39.690
Paleolithic.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.360
There's not much evidence for
much of anything in that

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.580
period except for some cave
paintings and stones and such.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.580
But it's also not a stretch to
think that play and sports

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.940
probably originated
in the hunt.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.050
When you think of the skills
that are involved in the hunt,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.780
they're not that far from the
skills that ultimately are

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.470
involved in sports.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.930
And even the tool kits of the
Paleolithic hunter-- the

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:10.110
spear, the rock, the net, the
throwing stone-- these are

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.710
things that you might find in a
sort of prehistoric sporting

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.150
goods store.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.620
So there's not a stretch
to think that sports

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.330
evolved as a way of--

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.900
like the dolphins--

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:28.320
testing boundaries, of using
play as a way of honing skills

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.590
that would have more application
in real life, in

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.590
the hunt, in protecting
yourself and your

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.930
family, and so on.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.130
But that's mostly speculation.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.410
It's really not until the growth
of civilizations--

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.850
Mesopotamia and Egypt--

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.750
we actually start to see
evidence that they were

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.380
playing ball.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.480
They were playing sports.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.970
They had already begun to
worship this sacred orb, as I

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.160
often call it.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.630
This is a depiction from a
tomb in Egypt, 1500 BC,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.645
showing King Tuthmosis with a
ball in his left hand and a

00:11:03.645 --> 00:11:06.880
stick the right and these
little servants

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.770
offering him new balls.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.040
This particular scene is shown
again and again and again in

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.040
this period of ancient Egypt.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.250
And it seems that there was an
actual ceremonial game played

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.480
by the pharaoh called
seker-hemat in which the ball

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.650
was struck into the
four directions.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.380
It was seen as defeating the
serpent enemy of the gods.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.850
There was a lot of mythology
around it and a lot of

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.930
ceremony around it.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.010
It's the first time we find
archaeological balls in some

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.210
of these tombs.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.380
Some of them are made
from papyrus.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.540
Some of them are skin stuffed
with all kinds of materials.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.190
There's even a kind of primitive
bowling set that was

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.330
found in a tomb of a young
boy during this time.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.100
So we know that these games had
already started, already

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.695
had meaning in these cultures.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.640
Of course, in ancient
Greece and

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.830
Rome these games continued.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.610
The ancient Greeks played a game
called episkyros, which

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.930
was kind of like rugby.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:12.500
There were anywhere from 12
to 15 people on a side.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.220
It's hard to understand all of
the rules from the text, but

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.360
it's clear that they played
these sports.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.010
They weren't part of
the Olympics, ever.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.960
The Olympics were seen as
serious games for serious

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.630
warriors and athletes, whereas
ball games were seen as fun,

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.130
frivolous play, like
child's play.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.850
So they were in two different
categories.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.315
But they did play a lot
of ball sports.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.940
Real organized sports in the Old
World really kick off in

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.300
around the 10th century
in England.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.720
And that's when football,
broadly

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.480
speaking, hits the scene.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.030
And when I talk about
football, I mean,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.590
like, all of football--

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.180
American football,
soccer, rugby.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.720
The root of all those games
goes back at least to

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.230
10th-century England.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.275
And there's wonderful accounts
from the earliest periods of

00:13:08.275 --> 00:13:13.940
the medieval era of these huge
mob games being played between

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.330
one village and another.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.660
This is a depiction from the
early 19th century in the

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.990
Normandy region of France.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.150
And it's hard to tell here, but
there's just basically an

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.980
enormous scrum going on
of hundreds of men

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.020
tousling over a ball.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.030
And so for hundreds of years
through the medieval period,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.610
this was happening in villages
all over Europe, where one

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.170
town or one parish would compete
against another.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.230
They were, kind of as a holdover
to earlier times,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.840
highly symbolic affairs with
religious connotations.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.590
This game la soule, played in
France, the name is believed

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.160
to come from sol, or the sun.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.910
And some of the beliefs were
that whichever side managed to

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.880
capture the ball in these
contests would ensure a good

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.450
harvest for their town or
their particular area.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.360
Or in some cases, it was the
fisherman versus the farmers,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.820
and if the fishermen
won, there would be

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.690
good fish that year.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.280
So these were symbolic
affairs.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.210
They were usually played
around feast

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.900
days like Mardi Gras--

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.480
so right before Lent--

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.070
kind of crazy affairs--
lots drinking, lots

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.080
of playing and carousing.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.150
And that's really how football
started, which is not that far

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.400
from where it's ended up.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.730
So this book that I wrote was
way more than history.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.080
I've always liked to use
whatever I do as

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.650
an excuse to travel.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.120
That's the only way I became an
archaeologist or have done

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.510
anything exciting in
my life is just

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.140
very, very into traveling.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.940
So for this particular chapter
on football, I learned about a

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.010
holdover of this mob football
game that's played twice a

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:03.260
year on the island of Orkney,
north of Scotland, which is a

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.520
very cold, very remote,
kind of rocky place.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.130
And on Christmas and New Year's
Day, the two sides of

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.520
town face off against each
other, just as they did in

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.070
medieval times.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.130
The sides are known as the
uppies and the doonies,

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.690
because there's one street in
town called Post Office Lane,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.920
which is probably from
here to that wall.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.140
And if you're born on the
upper side of that, then

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.780
you're an uppie for
your whole life.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.220
It's like being a Celtics fan
or Red Sox fan for life.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.130
And if you're born on the other
side, you're a doonie,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.020
because you're on the
downward side.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.380
And there's no choice.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.495
You don't put on a uniform.

00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:41.680
You don't get to decide.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.170
It's just that's the way you're
born, and that's your

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.320
side for life.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.780
On these two days, all of the
men from town who are on one

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.510
side or another get out
in front of the

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.670
church at 1:00 PM.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:57.220
An incredible handcrafted ball
made by the local shoemaker is

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.140
thrown from the front of the
church into this pack of men--

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.220
literally a sea of men.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:08.160
And for the next six hours, they
struggle over this ball.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.620
There's really no rules
to speak of.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.410
There's unspoken rules
of etiquette.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.530
But pretty much, it's just
a brutal affair.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.490
And the objective is the uppies
have to take the ball

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.550
uptown and touch it to this
ancient wall at Mackinson's

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.140
Corner, and the doonies have to
go the other direction and

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.970
submerge it in the sea on the
downward side of town.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.430
And other than that, it's
all hell breaks loose.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.090
And it's one of the most
incredible affairs.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.740
I'll hopefully show you at the
end a little clip so you can

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.150
get a better sense of it.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.370
But this is how football
got started--

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.700
was really a kind of
tribal affair.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.950
And this sense of belonging that
these men have and this

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.890
ritual that they go through
every year, it's not only a

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.200
game, but it literally
is kind of the

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.280
cornerstone of their culture.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.420
If you took this game out
of it, they wouldn't

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.110
know what to do.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.329
And that's how they speak of it,
is that kind of passion.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.650
So it was really incredible to
be able to see that and it

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.359
does give you a sense of why
we play these games.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.500
This is another scene.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.390
You can see the church.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.000
This is right after the ball
gets swallowed into the mouth

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.270
of the pack, as I
like to call it.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.579
And you won't see that
ball, maybe, for

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.550
another couple of hours.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.670
You'll see the scrum bouncing
off alleyways and making its

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.700
way through town, but it's
rare you see the ball.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.910
All the shops and the streets
are barricaded very heavily,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.980
because this pack will go right

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.210
through the windows otherwise.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:48.120
The year I was there, there
was a guy who was a

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.450
flat-lander from London
or someplace who

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.820
came up to watch it.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.400
And the poor guy left his
BMW on the street.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.720
Like, he didn't know.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.840
And the pack literally went up
and over this thing and just

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.620
squashed it.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.765
And then they were fighting
over who was

00:18:01.765 --> 00:18:02.410
going to pay for it.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.740
And they were like, (SCOTTISH
ACCENT), oh,

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.990
it's an act of God.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.380
So on from there.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.960
So football began as
this mob sport.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.480
It was the people's game from
the very beginning,

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.840
and it still is.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.690
We think of the global expanse
of soccer, football, there's a

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.500
reason for that.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.970
It has roots where everybody's
involved.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.320
It brings everyone in.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.540
Tennis developed in a completely
different way,

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.020
although in a similar
time frame.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.030
So tennis has its roots in
13th-century France, and it

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.700
started in the monasteries,
interestingly.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:47.980
The monks, who were busy
wearing hair shirts and

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.280
prostrating themselves, did
occasionally have fun.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.900
And they invented this game of
tennis, which they called jeu

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.550
de paume because it was played
with the palm of the hand,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.070
originally.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.650
And for the first 200 years of
the game, there was no racket,

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.620
and there was no net.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.940
It was basically a kind
of hand ball game.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.210
But they played it
in the cloisters.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.930
And the depiction on the left is
actually from the 1600s in

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.640
Paris of one of these
jeu de paume courts.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.850
And you can see if you think of
your history books and what

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.510
a medieval courtyard
would look like.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.410
It's got these sloping
penthouses and these galleys

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.660
on the side and a kind
of courtyard.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.850
So the court, as it's evolved
through time and as it's still

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.170
played today, reflects this.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.790
On the right is one of these
jeu de paume courts.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.520
In the US it's called court
tennis, and in England it's

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.950
called real tennis.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.370
And you can see it hasn't
changed much.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.000
Still got the penthouses, still
got these galleys and

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.740
these unusual lines for
how you score points.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:03.905
So tennis began as a monastic
sport, but then the princes of

00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:06.470
the neighboring area were, of
course, being educated in the

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.430
monasteries.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.230
So it quickly became
the sport of kings.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.560
It was an elite sport.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.550
Shakespeare wrote about
it many, many times.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.580
Through the 1500's and 1600's,
it was the absolute rage on

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.000
the royal circuit to the extent
where there were 250 of

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.160
these rather enormous,
substantial courts in Paris

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.740
alone in that time period.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.270
Today, there is exactly one in
Paris, which I went to, and

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.420
one on the outskirts of Paris.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.440
This one on the right is at the
Chateau de Fontainebleau,

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.370
which is one of the palaces
of the French kings.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:47.910
And I got a lesson in how to
play this ancient form of

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.390
tennis and come to appreciate
it at the same time.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.370
One of the cool things about
this game-- there are are many

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.650
cool things about it--

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.970
first of all, that it's
even still surviving.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.400
There's, I think, 45 courts left
in the world where you

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.480
can actually play this game.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.260
One of them is in Boston
on Boylston Street,

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.630
and I played there.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.380
This is from the 1600s, showing
there was an actual

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.420
person called a paumier who was
responsible for making the

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.620
balls and the racquets,
kind of a court pro.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.600
And they still exist.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.390
And this guy [? Mattie, ?]
who I spent time with in

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.680
Fontainebleau still makes
the balls by hand.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.750
You can see, essentially, the
same technique, the same

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.070
technology--

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.080
very simple, very primitive,
you can say.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.100
But that's part of the art of
the game is the fact that you

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.190
go to a court where somebody
can make the balls just the

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.980
way you like them.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.860
And that's a real skill
that is, frankly,

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.690
dying and dying fast.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:56.230
OK, you're going to have some
travel whiplash here, but at

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.300
the same time tennis was
exploding in Europe, of

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.930
course, Europeans were heading
to the New World to conquer

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.170
and create mayhem, among
other things.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:11.910
And they arrived full of their
game, and they had other balls

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.060
that were filled with wind.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.390
And they brought those
with them.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.320
Columbus, on his second
voyage, brought

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.830
some of these balls.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.730
And they arrived in
the New World and

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.170
in the Yucatan region.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.580
And they encountered the
Maya Indians and

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.790
the Aztecs, of course.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.360
And they were shocked to find
that there was a sport being

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.940
played there that was quite
sophisticated, and even more

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.110
shocked to find that they were
playing with this substance

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.590
that they'd never seen before,
that they thought was

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.180
possessed by demons.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.660
Because the substance would
bounce 12 feet in the air,

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.910
ricochet off walls, and had
this life in it which was

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.910
perplexing to them.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.110
They had never seen anything
like it-- of

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.710
course, it was rubber--

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.480
because they never encountered
rubber before.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.330
It was indigenous to Mexico
and Central America.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.680
The Maya, and the Olmec before
them, had been playing this

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.050
sophisticated sport with this
solid rubber ball for, at that

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.230
point, almost 2,000 years.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.840
The earliest ball courts that
look like this date

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.240
to about 1200 BC.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.550
So at the same time those
Egyptians were playing their

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:26.450
games, which were kind of
ceremonial, the Maya, the

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.970
Aztecs, and their predecessors
were playing what was actually

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.940
a much more sophisticated
and complex and

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.290
very athletic game.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.790
The game today is
called ulama.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.570
So that's the name that I
usually use to talk about it.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.700
It was played in a
court like this--

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.360
lots of different shapes, but
usually an alleyway where the

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.410
actual play happened
between two teams.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.960
There is a lot of different
kinds of markers, but here you

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.290
can see rings fairly high up.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.640
The object to the game was to
knock this rubber ball usually

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.960
with your hips, sometimes with
your forearm padded, through

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.690
one of these rings and otherwise
score points.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.610
This is a depiction, from a Maya
polychrome vase that's

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.220
been rolled out by a
photographer, that shows one

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.320
of these games in action.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.370
So you see these players
in motion.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.230
You see them against a temple
behind them with musicians,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.490
and it's this big ceremony.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.310
And so a lot of the depictions
of this game that we see are

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.340
highly ceremonial.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.380
And in fact, we see enough of
these to come to understand

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.190
that there was life and death
consequences associated with

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:50.680
this game, and that at least in
some of these rituals, most

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.790
likely the losers lost their
heads, quite literally.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.630
So this is a depiction from a
site called Chichen Itza in

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.685
the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:24:59.685 --> 00:25:02.190
I don't know if anyone's
ever been there.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.790
Yeah.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.670
It's a pretty widely touristed
site, and they have this

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:10.440
enormous ball court there,
which is kind of Madison

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.380
Square Garden-scale
ball court.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.120
And on the side in stone
is this carving

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.510
that shows two players.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.330
One of them is standing on the
left with a knife in his hand

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.070
made of stone and a head
in his left hand.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.810
And on the right is a player
whose head has been

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.780
decapitated, and out
of it sprouts

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.900
serpents and squash plants.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.260
And in between is the
ball, but the ball

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.350
is shown as a skull.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.830
So there's this symbolism.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.450
And we see these kinds of
depictions again and again.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:50.260
And clearly, there was a very
symbolic connection between

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.760
playing this game, the sacrifice
of the loser-- or

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.360
the captive, if there was
warfare leading up to this--

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.940
and the offering to the gods.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.660
And it was believed that--

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.940
with these squash plants
you'll see--

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.840
through this act, you
regenerated the cosmos.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.470
This was part of this
ritual cycle of the

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.780
Maya and the Aztecs.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.580
And it was just a fundamental
part of their religion--

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.930
a lot more than just
a ball game.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.020
I spent time in this small
village in West Mexico.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.690
There's only about 100 people
who still play this game.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.140
It's the oldest continuous
sport in the world.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.330
And they still make these
rubber balls.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.690
You can see a player
there leaping to

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.410
connect with a ball.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.510
But this game is dying, in part
because with development,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.690
it's really hard to
get the rubber.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.460
And a lot of the rubber
plantations are located in

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.270
areas that are dominated
by narcotraficos.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.250
So if you want a ball, you might
pay for it with your

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.190
head or other body parts.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.000
So unfortunately, this
game is dying--

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.250
dying quickly.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.890
So then I looked from there at
lacrosse, which was a chapter

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.860
which I won't talk about.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.890
But I got into baseball,
because it has been our

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.335
national pastime.

00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:16.760
And I wanted to understand,
how does a game become a

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.420
national pastime, and what
does that actually mean?

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.740
Some form of hitting a ball
with a bat goes way back.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:29.710
This is a French medieval
document from 1301 that shows

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.770
a pretty good line drive
happening in

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.680
the lower left there.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.910
So clearly, hitting a ball
with a bat is not that

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.520
sophisticated a thing to do.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.300
There were probably cavemen
doing that.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.070
Doesn't necessarily make
the game baseball,

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.960
but it has deep roots.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.650
But the game really emerged in
England, again, much to the

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.270
chagrin of nationalist
Americans.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.360
This is one of the first
depictions of a game described

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.430
as baseball, with two
words, from 1744.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:08.000
And this is actually a woodcut
from a children's book by John

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.760
Newbery, for whom the Newbery
Medal is named after.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.520
And it was just a silly little
story about little kids, but

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.730
they're playing an early
version of baseball.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.340
Again, in this case, they're
using their hand, because back

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.670
then it was like, if you had
a bat, you had a bat.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.420
If you didn't, you hit
it with your hand.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.510
But you can see the three stones
that were used as bases

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.900
and this guy on the left
who's pitching it.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.390
And they describe in there that
the idea of the game is

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.840
to strike the ball and then run
the bases in the circuit.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.750
And the way you got somebody
out was to soak them, which

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.680
means you hit them
with the ball.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.200
And baseball's rules,
originally, were all about

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.250
getting soaked by the ball.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:58.510
It was only in the late 1850s
that they changed that rule,

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.840
because it was becoming more of
a grown up game, and people

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.120
didn't want to get hit by the
ball every time they ran to

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.020
first base.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.400
But the interesting thing about
baseball is that it

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.200
really started as a
children's game.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.640
It was not taken seriously until
some local businessmen

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.710
in New York in the 1840s started
playing it on their

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.160
breaks from work and started
putting rules around it and

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.410
turning it into a real sport.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.150
And one of the interesting
stories in baseball that I

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.760
researched is around this man.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.340
I don't know if anybody
knows who this is.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.540
AUDIENCE: Cartwright.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.395
JOHN FOX: This is Doubleday.

00:29:40.395 --> 00:29:43.940
Yeah, Abner Doubleday,
Cartwright is the real father

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.820
of baseball.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.570
So Abner Doubleday, who's long
been held up as the father of

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.800
baseball, invented in a cow
pasture in Cooperstown in

00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:01.080
1839, the whole story is
essentially made up.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.230
And the story of how this story
came to be is pretty

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:09.570
interesting and speaks to the
desire for a national game.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:13.040
The brief version is that
Albert Spalding--

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.492
AG Spalding--

00:30:14.492 --> 00:30:18.360
of Spalding Sporting Goods
now was a great pitcher--

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.400
pitched with the Red Stockings,
pitched with the

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.740
White Stockings, and was
manager, was one of the stars

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.330
of his age, basically,
in the mid-19th

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.300
century, late 19th century.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.020
But he had bigger aspirations.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.040
He started to see that this
baseball thing had traction,

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.070
and he had the instincts
of a businessman.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.540
So he started Spalding Sporting
Goods and very

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.940
rapidly became incredibly
successful business.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.680
He just monopolized the sporting
goods industry.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.610
And so he became kind of the
father of the game, like,

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.670
marshaling it along, and turning
it into a real sport,

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.730
and evangelizing it.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.940
And around that time, this
controversy had been swirling

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.260
about, where did baseball
originate?

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.170
It's the ultimate
American game.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.970
It's the era of Manifest
Destiny, and

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.220
America needed a game.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.760
Unfortunately, the reality was
that a lot of the experts of

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.130
the time knew that this game
had English roots.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.770
And so there was a lot of
controversy around, well, was

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.150
it really from England,
or was that a

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.470
separate, different game?

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.830
And was it really an
American invention,

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.110
like all good things?

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:36.390
So Albert Spalding, in 1905,
actually formed a national

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.280
committee to research
baseball's origins.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.810
And he put out ads in newspapers
far and wide.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:48.170
And a letter came into a
newspaper in Ohio from this

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.770
guy named Abner Graves--

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.090
just random guy-- saying,
basically, I was there when

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.190
baseball was invented.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.450
And it was by the Civil War
hero Abner Doubleday.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.180
We were playing marbles in a
cow pasture, and Doubleday

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.790
came up, and he scratched out
the diamond in the sand, and

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.440
he showed us how to play it.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.150
And that was that.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.830
And that was good enough
for Spalding.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:15.710
There was no other evidence,
and he essentially declared

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:21.470
that the game was invented
in Cooperstown in 1839.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:26.010
And most people were fine with
that, because it fit the time

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.820
period-- that idea of invention
and Manifest Destiny

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.300
around sport.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.930
Unfortunately, there
is no evidence to

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.240
support that at all.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.540
In fact, Doubleday, when he was
supposed to be inventing

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.502
baseball, was at West
Point, which is more

00:32:38.502 --> 00:32:39.790
than 100 miles away.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.970
And all the records show
that he never left

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.800
during that time period.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.460
He left behind like
67 diaries--

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.600
never mentions baseball once
in all of his diaries.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.820
And this guy, Abner Graves,
who concocted this story,

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.400
ended up being a complete
nut job.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.710
He claimed to have been on the
Pony Express like 10 years

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.790
before the Pony Express
had started.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.443
He ended up killing his wife and
spending his final years

00:33:05.443 --> 00:33:08.200
in an insane asylum.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.550
But even as recently as four
years ago, I think, Bud Selig,

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.260
who is the Major League Baseball
commissioner, said

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.070
that he still believed
that Abner Doubleday

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.330
had invented baseball.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.765
So it just shows you these
nationalist myths die hard.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.970
American football--

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:32.070
so where we left football was in
the alleyways of Orkney and

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:36.900
this mob game, the medieval game
that was being played.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.250
That went on for some years,
but football was a

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.610
troublemaker sport
from day one.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:48.330
People were getting mauled and
killed, and property was being

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.090
broken in these big
mob scrums.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:55.030
In the 15th century alone, the
game was banned like nine

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.360
times by the English kings.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.070
You couldn't play it
within London,

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.160
because it was too dangerous.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.910
So this game, from the very
beginning, was kind of marked.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:07.700
People had an issue with it, so
much so that with all these

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.659
bannings, there was a period
in the 1600s to the early

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.460
1800s where the game
was dying off.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.880
It just wasn't played
that widely.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.190
And where it was kept alive was
in the public schools of

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.670
England-- what we think of
as private schools--

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:26.580
these little schools like Eton
and Rugby where these elite

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.530
kids were educated.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.690
And one writer described these
places as the "ludic zoos of

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.665
the age," because this is where
these games that would

00:34:36.665 --> 00:34:39.610
have died otherwise were
preserved by these scrappy

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.356
kids, basically.

00:34:41.356 --> 00:34:44.440
And what happened in those
schools is different versions

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.139
of football developed.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:49.639
So at Eton, they developed a
game that was focused more

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:54.260
around kicking and keeping
the ball low.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.390
And at Rugby, where they had
this huge expanse of green,

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.390
they developed a running
and carrying game,

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.680
which involved tackling.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.440
So you had these different
kinds of games.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.940
Some of them allowed tackling
and holding and running with

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.830
ball, and others didn't.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.220
And there was just kind of
a mishmash of sports.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:20.590
And it was really here in the
late 19th century that these

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.450
sports started to
get codified.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.960
So soccer--

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.280
association football--

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.630
in the 1860s got its rules.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:32.160
And it looked like America was
going down the path of more of

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.000
a soccer type of sport.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.370
And it was actually Harvard that
intervened, because all

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.840
of the local Ivy League schools
had banded together

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.100
and said, we're going
to codify rules.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.940
You can't tackle.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.590
You can't carry the ball.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.460
And Harvard said, we're out.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.390
We're not playing by those
rules, because we've been

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.110
playing for years by
these Boston rules.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.780
And the Boston rules allow ball
handling and tackling

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.630
under certain circumstances.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.990
And they eventually
had their way.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.660
They eventually imposed their
will over this commission, and

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.090
American football evolved
as the physical

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.990
game that it is today.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.980
But what I always find
interesting is people talk

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.130
about Americans as rejecting
the global game of soccer,

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.360
which I don't think is the case,
because soccer didn't

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.780
really exist at all until
the 1860s as a game

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.970
with its own rules.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.050
By that time, we were already
incubating other

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.940
versions of the game.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.700
So it was really more a case
that we had a form of the game

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.440
that we liked, and that by the
time soccer became anywhere

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.300
near a global game, we were
already doing our own thing.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.905
And Americans do have that
independent streak, so we

00:36:46.905 --> 00:36:51.860
weren't about to reverse
history and go back.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:57.790
To cover football, I went out to
Ohio to the one factory in

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.310
this place called Ada where they
produce every football

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:05.460
that's used in the NFL and
have since the 1950s.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.620
So basically, 150 workers in
this old-school factory that

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.100
hand make these footballs with,
again, pretty basic

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.160
machinery, which was
pretty cool.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.780
I learned that it takes five
cows to service a single NFL

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.550
game, if you add up the leather
involved and where the

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.130
leather comes from.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:32.190
So I always found that
a fun little fact.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:36.020
So I got to see how this was
produced and learn about the

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:42.770
whole way that football took
this rough game of soccer or

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:47.400
rugby and created this
incredibly disciplined game

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.530
with incredibly sophisticated
rules over a pretty brief

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.210
period of time.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.010
But unfortunately--

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:58.180
or fortunately, depending
on how you roll--

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.005
it never shook off the
violence at its core.

00:38:01.005 --> 00:38:01.320
[SNEEZE]

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.020
JOHN FOX: Bless you.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:08.390
And in fact, with every rule
that was laid down to control

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:12.420
the violence early on, the
game got more violent.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.950
So early on, there were
these massive scrums

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.850
and these mass plays--

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:22.040
flying wedges and other plays
designed to essentially mow

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:29.090
down the other team with full
brute force so badly that

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:33.400
early on, one year there was
something like 14 college

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.950
players who died on the field
playing football.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:38.760
There were no helmets.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.150
So it was a brutal game.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.150
Teddy Roosevelt formed a
commission around it, because

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.160
there were schools who
were banning it.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.450
So this was a theme that goes
back centuries for football.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.730
And of course, the theme
is still with us today.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:02.190
In fact, I think it
comes in cycles.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.150
And in recent years, of course,
there's been a lot of

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:08.330
talk about brain damage
from concussions.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.100
This is actually from--

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.470
some of you guys, I'm sure,
played "Madden," or still do.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.910
But this is from an earlier
version where, when there was

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:18.560
an injury, the ambulance would
come out and run over all the

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.280
players, which was
kind of funny.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:27.500
But this violence is still with
the game and in recent

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.620
years has become, of course,
really controversial.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:35.520
This is a suicide note from
Dave Duerson, who was a

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.580
Pro-Bowl Chicago Bears, then
New York Giants, two-time

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.570
Super Bowl winner who is
believed to have suffered from

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.330
this disease--

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.710
chronic traumatic
encephalopathy, which is

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.780
caused by repeated
concussions.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.080
Science is still not 100%,
but it's believed

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.680
to cause this condition.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:02.520
And he was severely depressed
and abusive to his family and

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.260
ended up killing himself.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.030
But he didn't shoot himself
in the head.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.300
He shot himself in the chest and
left a note to say, please

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.230
see that my brain is given to
the NFL bank, because he

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:17.250
believed that it was because
of football that he was not

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.660
feeling like himself.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.286
And of course, now there's 200
lawsuits in the NFL, and a lot

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.550
of parents aren't letting
their kids

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:24.780
play high school ball.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.270
There's some terrible stories
from Western Mass recently

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:31.010
about concussions in games.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.400
So it's become more and
more of an issue.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.040
And finally--

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.900
and I'll drop off here--

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.280
I looked at basketball, which
is my favorite game,

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.490
personally.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:46.760
And I love this story just
because it is the one sport

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:51.770
that we play today that was
invented from whole cloth in

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:55.980
Springfield, Mass by this
guy James Naismith.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.680
And all these other games
evolved over centuries, and

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.290
this one was really, truly
invented and in a matter of a

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:08.470
few years had spread globally
through the YMCA, which is

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.230
where the game originally
was invented.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.790
And one of the things I talk
about in the book--

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.650
because unfortunately, a lot of
history of sports is about

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:22.240
men, like a lot of history--

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.790
this game very quickly--

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.630
like literally within a year--

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:32.115
got completely taken over by
women, who realized that it

00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:32.990
was a game they could play.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.800
It wasn't highly physical.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.210
It was skill based.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.850
It was good exercise.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.690
And this is a wonderful image
from Smith College from about

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:46.780
1894 showing women trying to
play the game in these long

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.030
petticoats.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.750
So that's the whirl
of this book.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:57.770
And you'd have to read the book
to find out if I ever got

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:02.160
an answer to my son's question
of why we play ball.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.860
It's one of those questions that
there's certainly not a

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.380
single answer to.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:10.080
But I think over the course of
these trips and these chapters

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.940
that I hopefully was able to
distill some of the things

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.010
that make these games
so important to us.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.840
And part of it for me was being
able to convey that to

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.660
my son, to be focused on the
things that matter, rather

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.890
than all the other stuff that
doesn't matter that we read

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:27.140
about in the papers.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.960
I do want to mention--

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.940
and then I'll take questions--
that we're making a

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.300
documentary about
this right now--

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.760
I've got a clip, but I'd
rather open it up for

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.760
questions if there are any--

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.910
which hopefully will
be out in the fall.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.200
And it's called "Bounce: How the
Ball Taught the World to

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.760
Play."

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.470
And we've been shooting in
different locations.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:55.535
We're going to Mexico next
month to film ulama.

00:42:55.535 --> 00:42:58.440
We're working with two great
filmmaker friends of mine who

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.780
are using this incredible
camera, and so far, the

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.040
footage looks wonderful.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.650
And it's basically a cinematic
exploration of the ball and

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.780
global passions for sports.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.900
So look for that hopefully
next year.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.800
That's it.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.060
I'll take questions, thoughts,
whatever you got.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.902
Yeah.

00:43:28.902 --> 00:43:31.162
AUDIENCE: Who won, the uppies
or the doonies?

00:43:31.162 --> 00:43:34.600
JOHN FOX: Oh, good question.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:40.670
So when I got there, I found
that if you're born there, it

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.930
depends which side of Post
Office Lane you're born.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:45.020
But of course, there's a lot
of people who come from

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.080
outside who watch this game.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.650
And you, as visitor, also have
to be an uppie or a doonie.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.210
So they devise these very
elaborate rules.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.500
It's wherever you set
foot in town first--

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.480
which side you first
set foot on--

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.713
determines, again, whether
you're an uppie or

00:43:59.713 --> 00:44:00.120
a doonie for life.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.360
So I ended up setting foot
on the doonie side.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.130
That's where I got out of the
taxi in front of my B&amp;B.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.180
And I was psyched, and I was
talking to all these doonies

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.520
and feeling like one of them,
and then I found out that they

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.880
hadn't won in like 12 years.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.140
So I was instantly a member
of a losing franchise.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:23.340
But they won for the first
time in 12 years.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.330
And it wasn't because I did
anything, unless I have some

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.040
great luck.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.780
But it made it all the more
exciting, because I was

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.260
literally hanging out with these
losers for two days and

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:34.920
interviewing them.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.530
And I'm like, yeah, but they're
going to lose, and

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:37.130
that's no good.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:40.060
And then they won, I was like,
oh, this is a great story.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.350
So now I'm a doonie for life.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.490
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
ask if you know why it's

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.010
called pigskin.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.470
JOHN FOX: Yeah, so it's called
pigskin because the early

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:54.870
balls used for football and
other games were basically

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.090
inflated pig bladders.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.205
They didn't have
rubber until--

00:44:59.205 --> 00:45:02.240
well, the Mayans had invented it
years before, but we didn't

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.850
figure it out until Goodyear
created vulcanization.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.670
So they actually were made of
pig skin, and that's where

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.740
that term "pigskin"
comes from.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:18.540
So the outside has pretty much
always been cow skin, but it's

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.880
still got that name
stuck with it.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.390
Yes?

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.200
AUDIENCE: Did you see any
trends over time in the

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.670
rewards for the games?

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.120
Like all this competitiveness
goes towards [? a cause ?]

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.060
like winning, and you get
credibility or pride.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.490
But over time, in your study,
did you find that--

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.210
with the Mayans, you were
talking about it was literally

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:37.650
life or death.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:40.916
The gladiator games, and now
we've moved towards a little

00:45:40.916 --> 00:45:44.030
more mediated version of that.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.070
JOHN FOX: Yeah, well, it's
an interesting question.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:51.230
One of the things that I found
interesting is that very early

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.860
on in these ancient games, the
object of most of the games

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.940
seemed to be to capture a
ball and bring it back

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.310
to your home territory.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:03.410
And it seemed to have, again,
this symbolism around the

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:08.280
capture of the hunt, of the
prey, or agriculturally, of

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.580
the Sun and the symbolism
around that.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:14.250
And then it shifted at some
point from capturing something

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:19.210
to essentially invading enemy
territory, which is what a lot

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.700
of our games are.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.500
It's about penetrating the
defense and scoring a goal.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.420
So there's that, and somewhere I
think there's an interesting

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.940
thing that happened, and we
moved toward the invasion of

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.510
enemy territory.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:36.540
I think in terms of the actual
bounty, obviously, one of the

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.520
biggest ones was the idea of
getting paid to play the game.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.050
And that was a huge controversy
in most of these

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.720
sports in the 19th century.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.620
Lacrosse was an interesting
example because lacrosse, of

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.690
course, was originally a
Native American game.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.350
And it was in Montreal where the
Native Americans, who were

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.140
on reservations there,
introduced this game to some

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.470
of the Westerners there who
thought it was a pretty cool

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:05.220
game, and they started
playing it, too.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.500
But of course, the Indians in
the surrounding communities

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.560
were way better than the
white guys who were

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.020
playing this game.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.600
There was no contest.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.030
But the Indians were
dirt poor.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.320
They had no money, and so these
white clubs would start

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.810
paying these Indians to play.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.780
But then they were considered
ringers.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:27.390
So then they established rules,
effectively, that no

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:31.224
Indian could play lacrosse in
any of these circuits and any

00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:32.290
of these clubs.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.470
So the Indians were literally,
during that period, banned

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:36.360
from playing their own game.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.920
And it was largely because they
were seen as violating

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.700
this kind of amateur code and
getting paid for it, even

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.950
though they were just
trying to survive.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:46.290
And there's a lot of
stories like that--

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.540
that period of time where the
people were really grappling

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:53.910
with this idea of sports being
gentlemen's games played for

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:59.390
love of nation or amateur ideals
versus getting paid.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:03.230
And obviously, that all kind of
got blown up along the way.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:06.670
But I think it's still with us
when you see debates around

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.730
NCAA and college football.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.910
There's still a lot
of that around.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:11.960
Like, what's right?

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.010
What's wrong?

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.710
What's too much?

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.250
What are the right reasons
to play and the

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.700
wrong reasons to play?

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.760
Yeah.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.010
AUDIENCE: So now we see all
these games as competition.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.790
But you talked about,
originally, some of them were

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:27.970
played in monasteries
and stuff.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:33.320
Was it still a competition, or
was there some higher goal?

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:37.790
Can you talk about what's
the purpose, somehow?

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.350
JOHN FOX: Yeah, that's a
good question, because

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.520
I think it's true.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.450
I think competition's been
probably part of it all along,

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.390
but there was much more of an
emphasis on shared outcomes.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.500
I would say in my view, even
with the Kirkwall Ba'--

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.010
the crazy game in Orkney--

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.970
even though there's ferocious
competition and there's a

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.660
winner and a loser, the object
of that game is the game.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.540
The object of that game is to
perpetuate this tradition and

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.970
the rules around it, which are
the founding rules of that

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.540
social order.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.290
To me, that's like the
goal of that game.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.130
And the fact that there are
winners and losers is

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.720
essential to creating the
dynamic of a good sport.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.140
But it's not what
it's all about.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.520
And at the end of the day,
these guys are like--

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.580
and I interviewed lots of
people-- they were like, it's

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.630
how you play the game.

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:37.730
And they don't say it like your
kid's coach does, which

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.620
is kind of a truism.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.850
But they say it with complete
conviction.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:43.870
This is what it's all about.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.230
It's about keeping
this thing alive.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.620
So I think those two things
can co-exist.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.430
I think it's more like
a sliding scale.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.810
I would say we've kind of slid
off maybe one end of that

00:49:56.810 --> 00:50:01.285
scale these days with
a lot of sports.

00:50:01.285 --> 00:50:01.750
Yes.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.370
AUDIENCE: Sort of curious--

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.508
how did the spectator,
who observes without

00:50:07.508 --> 00:50:09.005
participating, come about?

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:13.000
How long has that been around?

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.910
JOHN FOX: That's a
good question.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:17.870
I mean, if you look at football,
it really was-- at

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:19.480
least for men--

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.540
it was pretty much all in.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.790
When you see these scrums, and
you see these big games,

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:27.550
everybody played a role.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:31.230
And even in Orkney, you'd see
these 80-year-old men who

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:33.690
wouldn't be the guy in the
middle of the scrum--

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:35.580
because their wives would
kill them, even though

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.850
they want to be there.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.390
But they'd be the guys on the
outside of the pack calling

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:43.640
the moves and strategizing--

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.750
not coaches, but very
much players.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:49.210
And I think that goes back
to medieval times.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.450
I think tennis actually started
to break that down a

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.240
little bit.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.690
And part of it is you have these
galleys, and it was this

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:59.350
kind of elite, royal game.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.970
So ladies would sit on the
edges, and people would

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:06.040
gather, and it would be kind
of a society affair.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.730
And then getting into the 19th
century, then, of course,

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:11.010
people started to figure
out that you could

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:12.580
pay for these things.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:16.010
So I think it started probably
pretty early on, but it

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:18.470
started in some sports and
not in other sports,

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.720
interestingly.

00:51:22.964 --> 00:51:23.940
Yeah.

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.220
AUDIENCE: It seems like what
happens in the [? arcades ?]

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.900
is very much something that
binds a town together.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.550
And what strikes me as odd is
that that's not more common--

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.885
that you don't see that in
more-- especially small--

00:51:33.885 --> 00:51:35.135
communities.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:37.400
Why is that?

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.120
Why are there not more of these
kind of examples of

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.350
community games that bring
towns together?

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:47.880
JOHN FOX: Yeah, I don't know.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.960
I know what you mean.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.380
I'm not sure I agree 100%.

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.290
I think there are obviously a
lot of communities that are

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:59.650
really brought together
by their home team.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:02.160
I mean, especially college
football--

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.950
it's crazy.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:05.795
There was a study down
in Tennessee--

00:52:05.795 --> 00:52:07.045
a sociological study.

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.090
After family, football came
before church in Tennessee as

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.310
the most important thing
to people there.

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:23.280
But of course, there,
it's very much my

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.560
team versus your team.

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.090
But I think those things still
exist in some communities.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:32.910
I just think in a place like
Orkney, they've literally

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:34.060
worked really hard at this.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.990
First of all, it's like a tiny
rock out in the ocean.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:42.370
So it's been kind of protected
from the ways of the rest of

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:43.550
the world for some time.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.860
So I guess it's been able to
sort of live in its bubble,

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.650
whereas in other places, people
are coming and going.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.110
People are transient.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.270
People are trying to make
money off things.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.712
It just changes the dynamic
through time.

00:52:56.712 --> 00:52:57.170
I don't know.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:00.700
That's what I'm guessing.

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.925
You had a question, sir.

00:53:01.925 --> 00:53:04.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just a small
terminology correction.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.250
Sorry.

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:08.100
The Smith College women's
basketball team

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.060
were wearing bloomers--

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.798
JOHN FOX: Oh, bloomers, OK.

00:53:10.798 --> 00:53:12.590
AUDIENCE: --which were a late
19th-century invention for

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:14.390
women's athletics.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.520
JOHN FOX: They were, indeed.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.300
Good call.

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:21.600
They were not wearing Spandex
or other useful

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.310
materials for play.

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:25.120
Good.

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.600
All right, well thank
you guys very much.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:32.167
[APPLAUSE]
