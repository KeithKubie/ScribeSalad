00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.691
So the last equation that we'd created for
Grant to tell him how much he would earn

00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:08.516
in the future, once people actually paid
for the glasses, wipers, and nozzles they

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:15.359
had ordered, was that his total future
earnings = 84w, where w is the price per

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:20.257
wiper set plus 60n, where n is the price per
nozzle. However, there's been another

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.501
change in the situation. In considering
the last change that happened to Grant,

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:28.146
which was the cancellation of orders that
made him really, really sad, this is a

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:33.291
super positive update. First, Grant got a
telephone call from an elderly wealthy

00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:37.187
gentleman, named Mr. Belvedere, who
happens to be super interested in glasses

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:41.433
wipers and in the nozzles that Grant has
developed to go along with his wiper

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:45.092
blades. He was so enthusiastic about
Grant's inventions that he offered to

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:48.813
triple all of the orders that Grant had
brought in so far, which means that

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:54.245
Grant's total future earnings, which we
know before were 84w + 60n, will be

00:00:54.257 --> 00:00:58.690
multiplied by 3. Then a second piece of
good news came. A school principal called

00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:04.038
Grant and let him know that she wanted to
order, one wiper blade set and one pair of

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.068
nozzles, for each of her 150 students who
wear glasses. This however happened after

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:14.410
Mr. Belvedere decided to triple the orders
that had come in so far. So his tripling

00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:17.790
does not apply to this new batch orders
from the school.
