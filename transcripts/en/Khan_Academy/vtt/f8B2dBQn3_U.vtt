00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:09.240
Let's compare 9.97 to 9.798.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.870
So to figure out which
one of these is greater,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.010
I like to start with
the largest place values

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.550
and then keep moving to
smaller and smaller ones

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.500
until we actually
see a difference.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.622
So they both have nine 1's.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.080
So at least in the
ones place, they

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.590
seem comparable to each other.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.280
Now let's go to
the tenths place.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.790
So this number on the left
has a 9 in the tenths place,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.306
while the number on the right
has a 7 in the tenths place.

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.180
So right now, we could
view this-- let's just

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.346
write the whole numbers out.

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:44.960
So this one is 9 plus 9/10.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.010
We haven't gone to the
hundredths place yet.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.510
So far, out of the two digits,
the two places we've looked at,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.210
this one on the
right is 9 plus 7/10.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.056
So this immediately cues to
me that the one on the left

00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:03.930
is the larger number.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390
You're like, hey, how
do I know immediately

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.490
that's the larger number?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.198
I have all this other
stuff to the right.

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:09.770
I have this 98 to the right.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.260
I have this 7 to the right.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.050
And the way to think about it
is, no matter what you have,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.250
even if you really increase
this right-hand side

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.510
here as much as possible,
you're still less than 9.8.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.110
In fact, if you keep
incrementing the thousandths

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.340
here, you go from
9.798 to 9.799 to 9.8.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.490
So you would have to actually
increase to get to even 9.8.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.050
And this is at 9.9.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.460
So you can really just
look at the discrepancy

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.570
in the largest place
value to recognize

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.570
which number is greater.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330
This has 9/10.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.750
This has 7/10.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.260
It doesn't matter what's
going on in the hundredths

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.672
and the thousandths place.

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:55.130
And to make that clear, let's
actually add up these numbers

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.740
and compare them as fractions.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.740
So let's keep on
going with this.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.310
So you have 7/100 here.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.169
And here you have 9/100.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.952
And then finally,
here you have 0/1000.

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:15.910
And here-- let me do that
in a different color.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.280
I already used blue.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.460
And here, you have 8/1000.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.040
So plus 8/1000.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.730
So let's put everything
in terms of thousandths

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.220
so that we can add
these all up and have

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.500
two fractions over
thousandths, or things

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.440
in terms of thousandths.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.930
So 9 is the same
thing as 9000/1000.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.520
9/10-- well, let's see.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.230
If you multiplied it by 10,
you would get 90 over 100.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.070
Multiply by 10 again,
you get 900/1000.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.660
7/100 multiplied
by 10 is 70/1000.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.930
And let's do that over here.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:10.560
Once again, 9 is 9000/1000,
and then plus 700/1000

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.450
plus 90/1000-- just multiply
the numerator and denominator

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.200
by 10-- plus 8/1000.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.460
And so what is this
number on the left?

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.450
This number on the left is--
how many thousandths is it?

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.813
It's 9,970.

00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:49.730
So it's 9970/1000, while
this number on the right

00:03:49.730 --> 00:04:05.400
here is 9798/1000.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.750
So here, once again, you're
comparing two numbers.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.570
They have the same
number of thousandths.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.990
This has 900.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.560
This only has 700.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.380
So even though
this is almost 800,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.240
800 is still less than 900.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.320
So no matter how you think
about it, the number on the left

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.620
is greater than the
number on the right.
