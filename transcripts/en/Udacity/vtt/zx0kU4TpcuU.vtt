00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.950
Here we would say that there are two levels of the IV, or independent variable.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.230
Giving high fives and no high fives. It's important to remember that I'm

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.040
treating the two groups exactly the same way. The only difference is one is

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.650
getting high fives. And the other is not, so I'm only manipulating the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.420
independent variable. So, now that we know what the independent variable is,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.290
what is the dependent variable? My coworkers, happiness, or high fives? Select

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.930
the one you think is a dependent variable.
