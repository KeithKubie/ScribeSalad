00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.850
ALI AFSHAR: Hello, everyone.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.200
Welcome to Google Developers
Live with Google Drive.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.725
I'm Ali.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:47.480
CARRIE ROWE: I'm Carrie.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240
ALI AFSHAR: And thanks
for joining us today.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.070
Today, we're going to have a
special look at how you can

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.020
get a job in Google Developer
Relations.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.500
That's quite exciting for us.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.060
We're always looking for

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.260
talented, passionate engineers.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.910
This is particularly relevant
with a new film that's coming

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.390
out about Google.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.996
And of course, we recommend you
go and watch that film.

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:09.898
CARRIE ROWE: Yeah, that's
really exciting.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.940
But first, we've got product
news and announcements.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.330
ALI AFSHAR: So one thing to
announce today, a couple of

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.320
weeks ago, we announced that
we're unifying storage across

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.880
our Google products.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.840
So before, when users had 5
gigabytes of storage for

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.090
Google Drive, now this
is combined.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.660
And you get a 15 gigabyte
free storage.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.990
We think that's really
nice because it

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.290
provides choice to users.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.770
If you want to use
it in Gmail, you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.660
can use it in Gmail.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.970
As part of this, the Google
Drive SDK returns the value

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.230
for complete storage.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.060
Some apps could check this if
you want to see, does the user

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.960
have storage for me to store
a file in there or not?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.760
And now, it returns the
complete value.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.680
So that's our updates
for the week.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680
CARRIE ROWE: Oh, Ali, did
you build that yourself?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.560
ALI AFSHAR: I didn't build it.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.620
I did write the blog post.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.460
Please check out the blog
post if you would like

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.230
more details on that.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.480
But as I say, I think users will
find that useful to have

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.080
the choice.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.750
CARRIE ROWE: That's
really exciting.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.730
So now, we know all of you are
really excited to learn about

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.279
how you can get a job at Google,
and specifically join

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.560
our developer relations team.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.790
And Ali here has interviewed
a ton of people.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.510
And so he is a great expert on
what to do, what not to do.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.840
So Ali, when you've see people
not succeed in our interviews,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.820
are there a few things
that you see

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.640
happening all the time?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.930
ALI AFSHAR: There are a few
problems that people do have

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.950
that come up again and again.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.240
And if I could just mention
them, they're usually one of

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.920
three things.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.320
Firstly, not having adequate
computer science knowledge.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.410
Of course, engineering jobs at
Google, you need a good amount

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.970
of computer science knowledge.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.460
The second thing, particularly
useful for developer

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.840
relations, is ability to

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.990
communicate technical concepts.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.550
Now, we regard that as
a very high skill.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.400
And if you're good at that,
then really it's

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.750
something for you.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.870
The third thing is a bit of a
silly one, and it does apply

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.070
to wherever you're applying for
a job, resumes that are

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.840
incomplete or have information
that just is infactual really

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.730
is not a good idea.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.860
So if you say you can do
something on your resume,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.560
really please be able
to do that.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.600
CARRIE ROWE: And that's
really good advice for

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.300
wherever you go.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.300
Don't lie on your resume.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.740
ALI AFSHAR: Exactly.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.530
CARRIE ROWE: And so given the
fact that there's a movie

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.750
coming out, we thought it'd be
really fun to do our own

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.095
little movie.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:32.982
So let's cue to What Not
to Do in an Interview.

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:33.930
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.722
[TYPING]

00:05:37.722 --> 00:05:39.480
-We're going to start off
with a coding question.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.640
I'd like to see you show me how
to reverse the characters

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.730
in a string.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.450
-You do know I'm an engineer
and, you know, I've been

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.830
coding for, like, the last
50 years, you know.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.030
-So it shouldn't be difficult.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.986
-Come on, I'm not here to
play your stupid games.

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:54.500
-So I see on your resume that
you've used Django for three.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.180
Years can tell me the advantages
of Django over

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.170
other Python frameworks?

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.021
-Is that on my resume?!

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.370
-So why Google?

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.700
-I mean, Google, Microsoft,
Facebook--?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.590
-Why developer relations?

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.080
-So I tried to apply as a SWE,
as a software engineer.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.990
But I got rejected.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.030
So I thought I might try
developer relations.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.520
-You just finished
your PhD program.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.840
Can you tell me about your
research that you've been

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.398
doing for the past
seven years?

00:06:20.398 --> 00:06:26.860
-Uh, I, um, mm--.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.770
-What are you interested in
when you're not at work?

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.210
What do you like to do
with your free time?

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.113
-I write code.

00:06:31.113 --> 00:06:32.451
-So now that we have a few
minutes left, it's your chance

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:33.890
to ask me any questions
you might have

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.646
about Google of Devrel.

00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:36.582
-Um, no thanks.

00:06:36.582 --> 00:06:37.518
I know everything.

00:06:37.518 --> 00:06:39.445
-Oh.

00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:41.265
[END VIDEO PLYBACK]

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.880
CARRIE ROWE: Wow, Ali.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.400
You are a really bad actor.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.980
ALI AFSHAR: Thanks, Carrie.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.870
CARRIE ROWE: Don't quit your
day job as an engineer.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.000
ALI AFSHAR: Thanks, Carrie.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.060
Obviously, that wasn't one
of my proudest moments.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.090
But it should give you an idea
of some of the common mistakes

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.392
you can make.

00:06:56.392 --> 00:07:00.170
To make up for that, we have
made a video of slightly

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.260
better answers for these.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.690
And hopefully, here is where
I can regain some of my

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.940
credibility.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.820
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.250
[TYPING]

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.720
-We're going to start off
with a coding question.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.640
I'd like to see you show me how
to reverse the characters

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.340
in a string.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.666
-Really interesting question.

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:19.992
I've often thought about that.

00:07:19.992 --> 00:07:22.160
Do you mind if I write some
code on the board?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.940
-No, that's perfect.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.745
Please go ahead.

00:07:23.745 --> 00:07:24.625
-Excellent, thank you.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:25.460
-OK, great.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.416
Thanks for showing
me this code.

00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:28.960
Now, I'd like you to take
a moment to explain the

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.270
algorithmic complexity
of your solution.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.640
-Sure, it's clearly O(n).

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.865
We're running through each
character in the string once.

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:39.305
Obviously, it does depend
on the complexity of

00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:40.121
your hashing algorithm.

00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:43.420
But apart from that, I'm
confidently saying O(n) here.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.800
-So now can you please tell
me how the internet works?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.920
-Sure!

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.150
The internet is a series of
connected computers all around

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.230
the world which know how to
communicate with each other,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.000
and they're used for the
exchange of data and

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.980
information.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.085
Anyone can connect to
the internet with

00:07:57.085 --> 00:07:58.120
many different clients.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.710
And you connect your client to
the internet, and you can use

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.510
that to fetch data, send data.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.310
And that's how we
browse the web.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.740
That's how we make calls
on video conferencing.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.150
That's basically how
the web works.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.490
Any specific details about it
you'd like to know more?

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.500
-No, I just wanted to see
how you'd explain it.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:13.820
Thank you.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.150
-Thank you.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.800
-So I see on your resume that
you've used Django for the

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.820
last three years.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.939
Can you tell me some of the
advantages of Django over

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:20.810
other Python frameworks?

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.290
-You say advantages.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.770
If I could possibly put some
advantages and some

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.490
disadvantages of Django?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.300
Because obviously, when you
get to know this framework

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.496
well, you'll see that there
are good and bad points.

00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:31.000
The advantages are--

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.330
-So why developer relations?

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.530
Why DevRel?

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.500
-I've worked for the last few
years on developer products.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.820
And I'm really passionate
about the developer

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.559
experience.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.590
I think if developers write good
products, especially on

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.160
Google platforms, that's a good
thing for developers, and

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.900
good thing for Google,
and ultimately a

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.320
good thing for users.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.695
-So why Google?

00:08:51.695 --> 00:08:55.060
-Google has the opportunity to
work on the biggest, most

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.760
impactful projects that are
affecting our world today, the

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.705
chance to touch the lives of
everyone in the world.

00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:05.010
And there aren't many other
places I can do that.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.750
-When you aren't at work,
what do you like to do?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.430
What are you interested in?

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.350
-I play sports, you know.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.785
I run.

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.480
I play soccer.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.920
We call it football,
of course.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.912
And I spend time
with my family.

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:18.240
-So now that we have a few
minutes left, you have a

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.240
chance to ask me
some questions.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.650
-Sure.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.770
Could you tell me, for example,
what a typical day at

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.098
work involves for you?

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:25.576
-I'd be happy to.

00:09:25.576 --> 00:09:27.010
-Thanks.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.520
I'm so [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.150
Google.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.350
ALI AFSHAR: Thanks, Carrie.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.250
CARRIE ROWE: And actually, hey,
you are good enough to

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:35.580
work at Google.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.380
How about that?

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:36.960
ALI AFSHAR: Who knew?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.490
Thanks.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.630
That's really great.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.680
CARRIE ROWE: So if you do
really well in all your

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.735
interviews, you can

00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:43.310
developer relations team.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.900
And you get one of
these cool hats.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.370
And the tail spins.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.700
So please check out our website,

And we would love for you to

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.690
And so if you go to the
jobs.google.com website, if

about the specific roles on
our team and the types of

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.300
skills and responsibilities
that we're looking for.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.490
ALI AFSHAR: And we're really
excited to hear from you.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.490
I'm available, too, if you have
any questions on what our

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.510
typical day of work involves,
or the kind of problems we

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.980
come up against, and
the kind of things

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.500
we're trying to solve.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.150
I'm always available to chat.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.390
So that's great.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.740
So now, we'll go to our regular
segment, which Carrie

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.820
is going review an application
for us.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:42.450
MALE SPEAKER: App of the Week.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.060
CARRIE ROWE: All right, so
today, we're going to talk

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.620
about Lucid Charts.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.100
And they're one of our
first drive apps.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.050
So we're really excited
to demo them today.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.370
So for anybody's who's ever
created PowerPoint

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.790
presentations, one of the most
painstaking parts is creating

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.760
all of these flow diagrams,
org charts.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.850
And now, Lucid Charts allows you
to create that directly in

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.300
Google Drive, which
is fantastic.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.820
You can create it once,
share it with

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.020
everybody, edit it together.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.210
Let's take a look.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.530
So I've installed Lucid Chart
Diagrams through the connect

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.800
more apps through the Drive
Chrome Web Store.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.362
And let's take a look at how
easy it is to create an app.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.690
So while it's loading, I think
I want to create a chart on

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.320
Harry Potter.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.460
Because I love Harry Potter.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.340
So let's call this
Harry Potter.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.600
So one of the things we talked
about in how to get a job at

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.060
Google, you have to be a super
interesting, geeky person.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.270
I kind of geek out about
Harry Potter.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.570
So let's see how you do this.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.710
So I want to create a chart
for Harry Potter.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.000
So it's as easy as dragging
and dropping a flow chart

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.260
diagram over here.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.950
So let's call it Harry Potter.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.140
He's the most important one.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.210
And then, beneath him, let's
add in his friends.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:04.160
Hermione, Ron, and we
can't forget Hedwig.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.100
And then, what's really cool,
too, they have all this super

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.170
easy functionality.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.870
If you want to connect stuff,
there are arrows.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.750
It's as easy as click
and drag.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.660
And then, if I go back
to my Drive, it's

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.880
right here in my drive.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.330
And that's so--

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.430
it's a wonderful integration.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.620
We love to see all
the cool things

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.190
developers do with our products.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.680
It's really great.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.160
ALI AFSHAR: So yeah,
I love Lucid Chart.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.020
As Carrie said, one of our
oldest apps, and one I use

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.930
just about every day, really
fantastic and great

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.280
integration.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.340
So please, try them out.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.790
That's really great.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.890
So thank you, everyone,
for joining us.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.120
That's us for this week.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.060
Hopefully, you'll join
us again next week.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.740
And if you have any questions,
please catch up with us in the

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.080
Google Drive community.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.400
We're waiting to
hear from you.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.510
Thanks very much.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.160
CARRIE ROWE: Thanks, everybody!

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.410
Bye!
