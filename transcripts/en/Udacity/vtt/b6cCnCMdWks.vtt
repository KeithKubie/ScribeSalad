00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The main theorem that we're going to use to get that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
was devised by Euler, and the theorem is that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
if a and n are relatively prime, then a raised to the totient of n power

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is 1 mod n.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'll talk soon about what the totient means.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If we can obtain this, then what we want to do

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is set ed - 1 is equal to the totient of n.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Then we would have exactly the correctness property we need

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
with the assumption that m and n are relatively prime.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is the totient function,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and what the totient function means is the number of positive integers

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that are less than n and are relatively prime to n.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We'll have a quick quiz to see that you understand what the totient means,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the question is what is the value of the totient of 277?

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And I'll point out that 277 is my favorite prime number.
