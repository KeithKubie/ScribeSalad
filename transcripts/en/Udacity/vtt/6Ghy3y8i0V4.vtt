In the last couple of lessons, we learned

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.130
to build fluid designs that reflow across different screen

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.010
sizes smoothly. Of course, truly adapting a design

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.000
across multiple environments, from a four inch cell phone

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.620
to a 27 inch desktop monitor, it's not

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.600
quite as easy as just dividing the screen app

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.400
using percentages. Sometimes, different devices ,call for fundamentally

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.090
different design. We can accomplish this using media queries.
