1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,920
The Joe Rogan experience. So when,
when you first start rapping, like, uh,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,590
you wrap them with kids in
your neighborhood or you
like aspiring to be a rapper

3
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:12,990
and, right and shut down and
try and things on your friends,

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,120
like how do you get started? Well, the way
that I started, I was writing, you know,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,510
like poetry first. Really? Yeah. But
what kind of poetry? Just like, you know,

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,350
like hoods, stuff, you know,
just stuff that rhymed, but like,

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,170
just sort of writing it down. Like it
was a, it was almost like writing raps,

8
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,430
but it just,
you know,

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,960
it's without saying it right is you
read it and shit like that, whatever.

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,490
But I would just write poetry
about, you know, everyday shit.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,260
You know what I mean? Nothing, you
know, it wasn't like doing like the,

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,640
I dunno if there's like categories
of poetry, but it, you know,

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,320
it was just stuff that, that would
happen from day to day, you know. And uh,

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
I had a knack for writing. I realize
that now is wanting to be a journalist.

15
00:00:59,521 --> 00:00:59,870
That's,

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,480
you know what really the
thing that I thought I was
going to be at school. Right.

17
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,800
Do you right now, uh, I
was for a while, but I,

18
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:11,490
I looked at kind of stuff just again,
everyday stuff or you know,

19
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:14,400
I'd like randomly pick
something to write about.

20
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,360
So if it was Ken about the cannabis
industry, I'd write something about that.

21
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:22,620
If it was about the music industry,
I'd write something about that. Like I,

22
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:24,930
that every now and then I
would, uh, there was, uh,

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,840
back in the early two thousands,

24
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,420
there was a magazine called
industry insider magazine.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,300
And occasionally I would
write articles for that.

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,820
I wasn't really that great because, you
know, I was so spotty in school that,

27
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,870
you know, my, you know,
it needed work, you know,

28
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,940
but they left it raw the way that,

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,260
that I would put it out there and people
got my point and that, that was cool.

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,690
But I looked at it, uh,
in the way that the,

31
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:57,450
the music that I've done in a lot of
the songs serve as a certain form of

32
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,020
journalists, journalism for
me, you know, like, you know,

33
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,020
bringing up certain issues that
people don't necessarily hear.

34
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,850
Like throw your set in the air
as a song on temple's boom.

35
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:10,650
And it's a song about how you would get,
you know,

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,180
in inducted into again,
how you get put into a gang,

37
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,600
how you fall into it. And some
people might think, you know,

38
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,350
by hearing it that it was glorifying
it and praising it, but it wasn't,

39
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,430
it was basically this is how
it is. This is so, you know,

40
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,760
the signs to look for if your kids are,
you know,

41
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:33,900
fucking around with the wrong people,
you know? And that's, you know,

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,510
I took it like, okay, you know, maybe I'm
not a journalist like I intended to be,

43
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,490
but this is my way of it.
You know,

44
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:46,260
I can enlighten people with certain
things and uh, you know, like anything,

45
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:50,250
somebody's going to read something or
hear something and maybe misinterpret what

46
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:52,770
you say.
But you know,

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
it's all about who's who's listening
and who's reading and who's watching and

48
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,950
stuff like that and their interpretation
of it. And some get it, some don't.

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,280
And that's just the nature of it. But
like most people get it. And I've,

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,080
I've come across people that have
come to me and come and said,

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,050
hey man, your your, your songs on
temple of boom men. You know, they,

52
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,910
they help to get me through these
times or these songs raised me,

53
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,650
they taught me this, this and
that. That's awesome. And to
me, you know, that, that's,

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,300
that's the impact right there. That's
the shit that means more than anything.

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,050
Because I'm sure you remember songs that
got you through, right? Oh yeah, for sure.

56
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,130
You know, there was songs from Krs
one public enemy that, you know,

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,910
got me through and fired me up, you
know, and inspired and stuff like that.

58
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,490
Era's ones. Another one people
forget about, man, I'll be
in my car. Just gone. Ooh,

59
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,070
that's nice. Yeah. I mean he, he taught,

60
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,740
he taught me how to be a bull horn, you
know what I mean? Like tell you know,

61
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:55,210
like yeah, tell the truth, you know,
yours get the word out and, and,

62
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,530
and not be fearful of what might happen
because he could have been one of the

63
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,250
biggest stars in, in hip
hop. He chose not to be,

64
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,320
he chose to be a voice. And sometimes
in being that voice, you know,

65
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,270
you get objects put in front of you
and uh, certain opportunities don't,

66
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,750
you know, get put on your table
because he says some great shit, man.

67
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,490
He's talking about getting
mad at the president.

68
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,910
It's like being mad at the manager
at McDonald's. Yeah. You know,

69
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,350
for the way the corporations
being run. Yeah. It's, it's, he,

70
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,720
he is a very insightful in,

71
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:33,910
in the shit that he says and he is
very unafraid to state it in state.

72
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,660
His opinion,

73
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,020
if for you to get like people coming up
to you when they first started coming up

74
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,290
to you, telling you that your
music got them through things,

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,990
that it means so much to them
when that first started happening,

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,090
that must've been surreal, you know?
Yeah, it could because as a artist,

77
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:52,750
as especially as a young artist you,
that's not something you think about.

78
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,420
All of these songs are going to,
well it depends on,

79
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,030
on the artist you are right guys hit.
How old were you?

80
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,200
Like 23 or something like that.
And how old were you when that was like a,

81
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:07,201
we released in 91 and it really started
going for us in [inaudible] 90 2022 kid.

82
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,030
He had so crazy there goes the baby fro.
Wow.

83
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,500
Wow. Look at the baby fro. Yeah,
but I mean think about that man.

84
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:21,850
That is so crazy for you to go
from the guy who yo MTV raps.

85
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,590
Who remembers that?

86
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,880
I did a bungee jump at this spring break
with a trench from naughty by nature.

87
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,280
Was that the one that was in Cancun? None
of that was Daytona beach right there.

88
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,070
Okay. When MTV was still, when
MTV was still allowed over there,

89
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,440
it was back when MTV had music.
Yeah.

90
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,500
When they had music format
empty was MTV was music videos.

91
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,630
Yeah. Good luck finding a
fucking music video now.

92
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,480
They still got to go to youtube.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Wow.

93
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,440
That's wild.

94
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,380
What was it like when it first started
popping off and you were 22 years old?

95
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,560
Was it, did it feel real? It was a,

96
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,100
it was a crazy thing because it's not
something that I had ever envisioned

97
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,920
happening. You know, I
didn't think that, you know,

98
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,020
the music would blow up like that,
you know,

99
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:14,021
we were doing it to obviously try
and make a name for ourselves and,

100
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:19,660
and uh, make music that people like, but
fuck, we didn't see that coming at all,

101
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,780
especially with insane in the
brain when they told me, uh,

102
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,800
when like when killer man started going,
it was like surreal because, you know,

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,280
we didn't think that song would
take, just because you know, of,

104
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:35,960
of the chorus itself, you know, fuck
what the song is about. You know,

105
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,810
we knew that the chorus was,
you know what,

106
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:43,150
they were going to hear more
than anything. And so I, you
know, we, we thought, Nah,

107
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,310
we're going to have a good underground
album. We didn't realize it would blow up.

108
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:50,000
We didn't think they were going to put
killer man in the juice movie and that

109
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:54,920
would blow that song up even more
so than it was it was getting, um,

110
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,520
because we had released funky feelings
ones first and it was a double Aa side,

111
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:03,260
single funky filling and kill a man
on the other side, which means, um,

112
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,370
at that time that Dj's had the option
of which song they wanted to go.

113
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:12,260
Whereas most of the time you had a side
B side and the a side is most definitely

114
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:15,590
the one that the record
company wants you to push.

115
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,090
We gave it a Aa side because we thought
maybe the djs would like kill a man

116
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:21,860
more.

117
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,010
They went with funky fill when the record
company because they figured it would

118
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,680
be easier to market.
Right.

119
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,700
And then the DJ started flipping the
record course and we started getting

120
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,680
traction behind that.
Our record was out,

121
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:38,681
like six months had dropped off
the chart and they flip the record.

122
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,900
Our shit slowly starts
to go back up the chart.

123
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,580
We got back on the chart
and started climbing and we
were getting a whole lot of

124
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,990
mixed show play.
And uh,

125
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,700
then we started doing a lot of
promotional shows that being one of them.

126
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,500
And it started going and kill a man.
Started getting us going. And uh,

127
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,730
I mean we toured for
probably a year and a half,

128
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,900
like a lot of just a lot of promotional
shows, you know, not getting paid,

129
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,880
you know, just, you know,

130
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,010
Sony having us out there promoting the
record and by the time, uh, you know,

131
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:16,970
our record got back back up into
the middle of the charts. I mean,

132
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:19,270
it was still rising and they saw that.
They're like,

133
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,640
we got to get them off the
road and making a new record.

134
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,530
So that's when we got up there with
black Sunday and a with black Sunday and

135
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,930
insane coming out again.

136
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,960
That's not a song I thought would blow up
when they've chose that for the single.

137
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm like, well, all right, there's better
songs but fuck it. That's the one. Okay.

138
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,340
So it comes out, boom, it explodes.

139
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,840
And now we have our black Sunday
charting it, number one coming in.

140
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,490
And our,

141
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,870
our first album had come all the way
from the bottom to hit number five.

142
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,200
So we had to two albums in the top 10
to hunt or top 10 of the 200 songs,

143
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,010
you know, on the chart, which no
one had ever done in hip hop before.

144
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,390
We had one in five slot.
And uh, you know, fuck,

145
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,750
we definitely didn't think that was
going to happen. I mean, you know,

146
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:14,751
it was all a surprise and it went from
one minute you could go to a mall and be,

147
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,230
you know, an assuming and nobody even
knows who the fuck you are and you know,

148
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:23,790
you're getting about your day to now
you go to the mall and the whole fucking

149
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,660
mall is swarming on you. Like
fucking, you're like, you know,

150
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,490
Paul Mccartney or something.
It was the craziest shit. They,

151
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,040
they would ask us to leave the mall's
like, really? Yeah. Like, uh, we used to,

152
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,630
I used to go to this one called the
Montebello Mo. It was in Montebello.

153
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,150
I can't remember what the name of the
mall was, but it was in Montebello,

154
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:46,350
the only one down there at the time.
And we knew everybody there,

155
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,910
you know, as we're coming up because
that's where we'd go shop. So, you know,

156
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:55,170
you make friends and people in the
shop and stuff like that. And uh,

157
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,340
when we come back off the tour this
time and go try to go to that mall,

158
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,110
you know, one of our friends fucked
up in war Cypress Hill jacket. Oh,

159
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,380
and that's like a fucking billboard
when you're standing next to one of us.

160
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:11,730
Right. So before you know it, boom,
we get swooped in and you know,

161
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,420
as a pre cell phone too. Yeah. In the
mall security. Cause I, Hey man, you know,

162
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,520
I know it's fucked up.
You guys got to go

163
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,660
really? Like, yeah man, it's a commotion.
You guys gotta go, they're telling me,

164
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,620
I'm like, they think someone's going
to fight. I'm like, wow. All right.

165
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,850
I never went back to that mall after
that. I was like, all right, cool.

166
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,660
Because you know what,
I didn't want to cause them problems too.

167
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,050
It was now it was tough to go
somewhere at that time and not get,

168
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,430
you know, swarmed and get swarmed.
Yeah. It was, it was, uh, it was quite,

169
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,790
quite, uh, an experienced
man like, you know,

170
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:55,200
cause you only ever hear about it until
it happens and you might, you know,

171
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,230
if you have friends in the industry
and it's happening for them,

172
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:01,920
you might see it in directly, you know,
like through the, through their shit.

173
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,890
And uh, you know, we had friends in
the business, you know, for cred.

174
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,040
Kid for us was one of my friends,
um,

175
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,240
before we got out there and cause
he's still around. Yeah. Yeah.

176
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,090
He still does stuff, you know. Um,

177
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,430
I don't know if he's putting out
so much new music these days,

178
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,560
but he's still here and there.

179
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,710
He's doing some of the
cannabis industry stuff too,

180
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,320
because he is a big kind of sore.
I've got to tell you,

181
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:29,100
my man smokes used to smoke
like a train man, like him.

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,240
And I would trade joints off left and
right, but you know, for a time, you know,

183
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,090
I would go hang with him and his gigs,

184
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:40,080
I'd be his bodyguard cause I was the one
that was not afraid to carry the hammer,

185
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,220
meaning the magnum in my waistline. You
know, I was, we were cowboys, man. We,

186
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:48,000
we were always armed at that time,

187
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,530
from 89 to probably 97 or 98,

188
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:56,950
we were holding pistols on our hip,
like cowboys.

189
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,630
And you know, he knew that. So yes. But he
would ask me to go to the gigs, you know,

190
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:05,650
t, you know, double as his body
guard. I was in his body guard,

191
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:08,770
but I was his bodyguard. Do you know
what I mean? Right, right. And, um,

192
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,490
I'd see the way he handled it
and let's see the way, you know,

193
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:16,990
people crowded around him
and, and uh, you know,

194
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,960
so I learned how to deal
with it. Watching, you know,

195
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:23,750
how he would do it in a negative way
or a positive way. Cause you know,

196
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,030
use some times, embrace the crowds.
Sometimes it's like fuck off of me.

197
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,110
You know, like a lot a lot of
artists are, you know, and uh,

198
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,110
that sort of prepared me so that when,
you know, we got an RF lane, you know,

199
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,130
I knew how to sort of deal with it and
I, you know, was always courteous and,

200
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,330
and cool and respectful and never the
guy that is like, Nah man, fuck that.

201
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:50,200
Get out of here. Cause I see it in some
of my homies were like that, you know,

202
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:54,250
and I didn't, I hated the feeling
that when the fans would walk away,

203
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:58,240
just totally fucking wind out of
their sails and shit like that.

204
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,300
Now they don't like this
artist ever again. You know?

205
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:05,770
And I saw that and I never wanted to have
anyone walk away with that experience.

206
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:10,510
So I always embraced it, even when it
was a pain in the ass, you know? So.
