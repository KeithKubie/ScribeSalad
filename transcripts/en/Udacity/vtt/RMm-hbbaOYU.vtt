00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
To put it with Steve McConnell,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the goal of simplifying the test case is to make it so simple

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that changing any aspect of it changes the behavior of the error.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Or, in our words, to make it so simple that every aspect in it is relevant.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There is also a nice quote which is usually attributed to Albert Einstein.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This of course calls for a simple process for simplifying.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Namely, for every circumstance of the problem,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
check whether it's relevant for the problem to occur.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If it is not relevant, remove it from the problem report or the test case in question.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
To see whether you got all this, let's have a quiz.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Namely a word problem first stated by French novelist Gustave Flaubert in 1843.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
A ship sails the ocean.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It left Boston with a cargo of wool.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It grosses 200 tons.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It is bound for Le Havre in France.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The main mast is broken.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The cabin boy is on deck.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There are 12 passengers on board.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The wind is blowing east northeast.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The clock points to a quarter past 3 in the afternoon.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It is the month of May.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now, for the question. How old is the captain? Over to you?
