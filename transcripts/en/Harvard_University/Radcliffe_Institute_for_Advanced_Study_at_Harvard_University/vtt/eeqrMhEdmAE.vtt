00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.220
- Welcome to this
panel, which is called

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.580
Ways of Knowing the City.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.890
And we have three speakers.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.320
I'll tell you a bit
about them in a moment.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.560
And we have a dynamic format,
which I'll also explain.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.130
But first, a little bit
about the topic, affect

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.300
and experience and a rich
array of sensory information

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.049
will always be essential
parts of knowing a city.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.740
Modern media and the city
are closely intertwined.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.070
Film is like the
kinetics of experience

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.880
in the city with its new
forms of modern transport.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.950
Photography is like a glimpse,
a vignette, a framed moment.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.510
In the 19th century, French
poet Charles Baudelaire imagined

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.330
the persona of a
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.510
a stroller, or someone who
walked the city in order

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.220
to experience it and to take in
fleeting expressions and to be

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.300
simultaneously part of
and apart from the crowd.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.760
And these observations would
be social and aesthetic.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.090
So Baudelaire's
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] has had

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.350
a long after-life as a figure
for urban life and even

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.180
for modernity itself.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.110
And the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
anticipates street photography

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.935
and even tourism.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.850
Cities function as keepers of
cultural and historical memory

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.810
as well.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.780
Scholar Andreas
Huyssen posits cities

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.000
as palimpsests of history,
incarnation of time in stone,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.350
sites of memory extending
both in time and space.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.280
And Italo Calvino, in
his novel from 1972,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.370
Invisible Cities
wrote that quote,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.680
"the city does
not tell its past,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.310
but contains it like the
lines of a hand written

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.000
in the corners of the streets,
the gratings of the windows,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.480
the banisters of the steps, the
antennae of the lightning rods,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.380
the poles of the flags,
every segment marked

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
in turn with scratches,
indentations, and scrolls."

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.430
Our understanding
of city environments

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.610
will always be intertwined with
the development of literature,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.570
film, photography, and newer
media as artistic modes.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.230
Today, in this
first panel, we will

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.540
ask how we can connect these
nuanced humanistic perspectives

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.000
and their document
of human experience

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.910
with new forms of
media and big data that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.160
investigate the modern
urban experience

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.560
and produce new
forms of knowledge

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
using powerful new tools
and conceptual paradigms.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.620
How do the non-human
and the human

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.590
intersect in urban
environments today?

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.110
Collectively, we'll try
to make some headway

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.700
on this topic in panel one.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.260
This panel lasts in total
for an hour and a half.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.500
First, we'll have presentations
about 15 minutes each

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.770
from our three speakers who are
in the order in which they'll

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.040
present, Heidi Ewing
who is a filmmaker

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.270
and co-director of the Emmy
awarding film Detropia,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.700
a documentary about
the contemporary state

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.840
of her hometown, Detroit,
which premiered at the Sundance

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.880
festival in 2012.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.180
Mark Shepard, professor of
architecture and media studies

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.380
from the University of Buffalo,
a practitioner and a theorist

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.290
who explores in his
work the complex notion

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.840
of the sentient city.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.270
We tend to think of
people as being sentient,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.580
but in fact cities can be.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.130
And finally, Sooni Taraporevela,
the photographer, screenwriter,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.390
and director.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.450
And her photography
exhibition Home

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.790
in the City, Bombay
1976 to Mumbai 2016

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.070
is currently showing at
the Whitworth Gallery

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.200
in Manchester,
England and has been

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.230
listed as one of the top five
art exhibitions in the United

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.450
Kingdom by The Guardian.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.170
So after the panelists have
completed their presentations,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.510
I will moderate a short
discussion among them

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.190
for about 15 minutes.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.710
And then we'll
have a Q&amp;A session

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.480
where members of
the audience can

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.060
come to the mic that will
be in the central aisle

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.890
and ask questions of the
presenters themselves.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.840
So with no further ado, I
suggest that we get started.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.030
And I invite Heidi
Ewing to the podium

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.420
to give her presentation.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.279
Thank you.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:31.686 --> 00:04:33.093
- Thank you very much.

00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:38.130
Well, thank you to
Liz, and to Radcliffe,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.020
and everyone here for
taking an interest

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.270
in cities and urbanism.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.160
I think it's funny
that Angela mentioned

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.950
the need for confessions
when we talk about cities.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.080
It's very true about Detroit.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.830
So my confession, I actually
grew up 20 minutes north

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.470
of Detroit.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.800
It's very important.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.490
And my father was a Detroiter.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.060
And my parents were part of
the so-called white flight out

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.330
of Detroit after the
uprisings, riots,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.520
however you'd like
to call it, in 1967.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.880
My granny, from the
north side of Detroit,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.980
refused to leave till
she couldn't get up

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.390
her stairs at the end.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.250
Her body gave out.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.250
She used to proudly call
herself the last white lady

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.110
on the block.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.970
That's my confession.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.660
So has a documentary director,
I make a living following

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.300
the stories of real people
and, with my camera,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.519
capturing the change.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.310
And, well, you hope
there's going to change

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.710
and evolutions over
a period of time.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.740
And what I've learned
in my career so far

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.410
is that narratives are
very, very powerful.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.750
A narrative is a powerful tool.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.940
In the film Detropia, which
is one of my films from 2012,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.790
I had the chance to
chronicle the narrative

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.890
of an entire place or
attempt to chronicle

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.780
the narrative of an
entire place, which

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.545
would be the city of Detroit.

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:58.170
And during the
production of this film,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.090
something unexpected happened.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.660
Before my eyes, the
conversation about Detroit

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.070
completely changed.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.100
From the time I began
shooting the film in 2009

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.220
to its theatrical
release in 2012,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.850
the local narrative,
meaning the story

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.760
that the Detroit residents
themselves told themselves

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.150
about their city, began to clash
with the national narrative,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.620
which by that I mean the way in
which outsiders and the media

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.960
chose to see the city.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.620
And this sort of happened,
I guess, by coincidence

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.790
while we were making the film.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.460
So I'd like to start with
the Time Magazine cover.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.010
So this was 2009.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.440
This was when I
began to Detropia.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.530
Soon after this, Time Magazine
published the cover story,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.420
"The Tragedy of Detroit."

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.610
The article described
Detroit as a place that

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.510
looked as if it had quote,
"been savaged by a hurricane

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.050
or submerged by a
ravenous flood," unquote.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.070
Why hadn't the world
noticed, the article asked.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.110
To me, who grew up in
the Detroit Metro area,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.290
Time was simply
mimicking what we

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.590
had been shouting for years,
what we knew all along.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.850
Segregation, racial
inequality, subpar education,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.130
massive governmental corruption
at the local level, an auto

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.860
industry that had refused to
change, a city that refused

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.910
to diversify, crime was
wild, jobs had vanished,

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.440
we knew these things already.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.350
The article was not a shock.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.350
But the nation seemed shocked
as this got a lot of attention.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.860
This Time Magazine cover, there
was a lot of recoverage on it.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.550
But the interesting
thing is we locals,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.710
we Detroiters and
Metro Detroiters--

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.220
my father was in manufacturing,
so was very close

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.500
to our hearts, what was
happening to Detroit--

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.650
we had another narrative, a
counter-narrative perhaps,

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.810
that we told about our own city.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.220
And that was one very
close to our hearts.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.020
And it was a story of deep pride
in Detroit's place in history.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.330
To us, in symbolic
terms at the very least,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.170
Detroit was the most
important place in America.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.750
And when I started
shooting Detropia,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.750
I found that that
narrative was still alive.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.540
And so I'd like to show
you a clip from the film.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.970
This is one of my
subjects, George McGregor,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.114
President of United
Auto Workers Local 22.

00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:23.780
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.270
- During World War
II, America was

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:34.329
like, wow, we built war
machines for the world, right?

00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:38.140
Right over here, where
[INAUDIBLE] in Fleetwood,

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.390
they turned that from
an automobile factory

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.760
to building airplanes
right there on 4th Street.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.810
We built everything.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.600
We put them on a
ship and shipped them

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.812
to England and everywhere.

00:08:48.812 --> 00:08:49.770
Y'all know what we did.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.970
Keep up with that history.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.100
Now, we can't even
buy American made

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.575
washing machine or an iron.

00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:04.090
So where did our
manufacturing base go?

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.410
Where did it all go?

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.880
Because we built everything.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:14.520
We built everything,
everything, America did.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.890
We have a standard
of living in America

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.650
that the working guy provided
a standard of living,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.900
which is eroding now.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.770
But it's a standard of
living that the working guy,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.750
and it started right
here in Detroit.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.890
Right here in Detroit, a middle
class started right here.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.260
Everybody knows.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.880
We just got to face
up to it, so we're

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.550
able to send our kids to school.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.426
We're able to set up
a little bit of money.

00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:42.800
Some of our guys
were able enough

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.820
to get a little place
of north or whatever.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.185
It's middle class, got a boat.

00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:50.720
You understand what I'm saying?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.639
Middle class.

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:53.180
Middle class.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:03.700
Leave it to Beaver, the white
house, the picket fence.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.656
Leave it to Beaver, wasn't
that the middle class?

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:08.230
Come on now.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.970
We're looking at
it on TV, right?

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.570
Weren't we?

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.180
Do Then we see it
come into our lives.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.780
There it is, the middle class.

00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:20.510
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.130
- I love that guy,
George McGregor.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.424
What a way to synthesize the
feelings that a lot of us

00:10:28.424 --> 00:10:29.840
have and a lot of
Detroiters still

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.750
have about the place and
the importance of Detroit.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.869
You know, hearkening
back to Angela's talk,

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:37.910
you know, he is a product
of the great migration.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.190
His family was from
the south and came up

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.310
to work in the
factories, he included.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:49.022
And the black middle
class, he's evidence of it.

00:10:49.022 --> 00:10:50.480
Anyway, my parents
and grandparents

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.551
all sounded like George.

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.050
Detroit's role in the creation
of the middle class lifestyle

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.330
should be honored and cherished.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.900
This narrative acted as a type
of urban institutional memory

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.180
shared by natives of the city.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.580
But what I found most
surprising while making Detropia

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.960
is that this strong connection
to history, which we don't find

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.529
that very often in
20-somethings right now,

00:11:11.529 --> 00:11:13.070
but this strong
connection to history

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.860
was still prevalent even
among the youngest Detroiters

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.170
I met who had never
experienced not

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.170
even a moment of this heyday
that we always, always heard

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.520
about.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.790
Even for them, Detroit
remained thick with nostalgia

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.710
for the elusive past.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:33.530
And I'd never seen people
in their 20s feel so old

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:39.140
and talk so old and have such a
grasp and nostalgia for an era

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.400
that they never lived.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.160
And that I found over and
over while making Detropia.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.640
And that brings us to
Crystal and how she

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.530
interacted with her own city.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.450
She was in her mid
20s when we met her.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.130
She was born and
raised in Detroit.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.670
She was one of the residents
that could easily have left,

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.780
but had chosen to stay.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.820
And all the characters
in the film Detropia

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.760
could have left, that we
focus on, and chose to stay.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.590
And that's very significant.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.810
But the city had too
much of a grip on her.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.370
And the past had too much of a
grip on her for her to leave.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.740
And she used to go when
she wasn't waiting tables,

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.840
she would do urban explorations.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.030
And she would break
into old buildings

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.180
and try to figure
out who lived there

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.780
and what life had been like.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.652
So I'd like to show Crystal
[INAUDIBLE] from Detropia.

00:12:25.652 --> 00:13:02.030
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.774
- July 4, 2010,
Independence Day.

00:13:06.774 --> 00:13:09.830
I'm going real revolutionary.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.220
We're in a beautiful building.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.520
History is just one of my
things even since grade school.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.710
That's a passion.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.580
What was there?

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.290
Who was there?

00:13:43.098 --> 00:13:47.640
These hallways, though-- I mean,
I'm picturing this place clean

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.710
and there being-- you
know, people walking around

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.446
and shit happening.

00:13:57.881 --> 00:13:59.255
Bring that shit
on up here, girl.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.000
Wow.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.670
It's amazing where you see where
they just ripped out the wall.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.420
Because there's copper
piping right there.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.805
Can you imagine like having
breakfast right here?

00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:26.680
You know what I mean?

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.065
Like, look at your view.

00:14:28.065 --> 00:14:29.440
Look at your view
in the morning.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.300
Like, yeah, I'm going
to go out and conquer

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.920
the world, because I can damn
near see it from right here.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.305
Motown right up the street.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.240
We can't leave, man,
can't fucking leave.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.020
I feel like I was maybe
here a little while back,

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.390
or I'm older than I
really am, but I just

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:05.920
have this young body
and spirit and mind.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.110
But I have the memory of this
place when it was banging.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.270
That's how I feel.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.630
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.520
So So I found people
like Crystal over

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.410
and over again while
making Detropia

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.590
that were haunted by
the past, something

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.150
I didn't expect to find
when making the film.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.000
Crystal had every
reason to believe

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.022
that she was the last
person on Earth that

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:30.230
was interested in all these
empty blocks of her city,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.420
but that assumption
was very wrong.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.280
As we know, the
2008 market crash

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.080
landed plenty of
young college grads

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.090
back in their parents
basements, maybe

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.870
in some of your basements.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.370
But

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.000
Rumors of $500 houses,
large lofts for artists,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.300
and quasi-lawless city
in search of residents

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.850
sounded pretty appealing
to some people.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.550
The newcomers, who are mostly
young single and white,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.800
came with no malice to Detroit.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.100
Yet, they also came with
little to no appreciation

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.300
or understanding
of Detroit's past,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.350
including its very
charged racial past.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.840
They preferred to talk
about the new trendy ideas

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.900
like large scale urban farming,
which was a major idea being

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.420
floated in Detroit or
to start microbreweries

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.849
or graphic design firms.

00:16:12.849 --> 00:16:14.390
They were not
interested in pondering

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.190
all that had been lost before.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.430
They were not haunted
by the past of Detroit.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.130
Detroit gained 14,000
white residents

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.290
between 2010 and 2014.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.410
It was the first uptick
like that in 60 years.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.970
This attitude that
a lot of them had,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.780
which was that Detroit was a
blank slate or an empty canvas,

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.450
this idea crept in.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.070
Detroit was almost
their Petri dish

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.424
for experimentation
of all kinds.

00:16:40.424 --> 00:16:41.840
The new narrative
was that Detroit

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.990
could be almost a
playground for young whites.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.000
And they could live
cheaply and well.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.340
And here's an example of that.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.714
These are two
artists that we met

00:16:49.714 --> 00:16:53.120
that are in the film Detropia,
Steve and Dorota Coy.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.290
This is sort of just after they
moved into the city, the Coy's

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.150
Detropia, please.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.619
- Dorota and I met in Hawaii.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.410
We knew we weren't
going to stay in Hawaii.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.490
And so we were just
tossing around places.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.347
We wanted to be somewhere
urban, of course.

00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:25.930
We had a project
that we wanted to do,

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.780
like street art,
public installation.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.350
And so we just
started evaluating.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.170
We looked at Baltimore.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.150
We were looking
into New York City.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.410
And Detroit came up.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.430
And I knew that's
one thing Detroit

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.380
had an abundance of was
space and old warehouses.

00:17:51.188 --> 00:17:54.860
I feel like we've assimilated
into that community of artists

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.540
that are moving here
and coming here.

00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:05.400
That's pretty sweet.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.910
I've never had
appliances this nice,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.890
so I feel like I should
be taking care of them.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:27.720
Yeah.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.770
We bought just a
couple of weeks ago.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.380
And we're able to keep our
studio, because everything

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.270
is so affordable.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.670
Detroit is constantly
amazing me.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.800
I feel like it's redefining
what the value of things are.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.699
You know, $25,000
for an amazing loft?

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:54.240
I don't know.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.240
That just makes it
accessible to people like me.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.550
I would never be able to afford
to own a home as an artist.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.470
And here I am with a
studio and an apartment

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:09.290
in a major city functioning
for like $700 or less a month.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.620
We can experiment here.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.103
Because if we fail, we haven't
really fallen anywhere.

00:19:25.287 --> 00:19:27.120
- So you see the
difference in the newcomers

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.290
and the old timers there.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.200
You know, at first,
Detroiters reacted

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.440
with curiosity and
skepticism at the newcomers

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.130
and their embrace of this new
Detroit that they could see.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.930
And there was some
humorous headlines.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.970
My favorite headline was
from the Detroit Metro

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.520
Times that was reacting
to these carpetbaggers.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.970
And it said, "Major Cities
Unloading Undesirable Hipsters

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.360
in Detroit."

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.630
Can I see the billboard
Bushwick, please?

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.840
And you know, this was sort
of a little advertising.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.250
This is in Bushwick,
New York in Brooklyn.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.187
It's like, you're
going to be a hipster

00:20:04.187 --> 00:20:05.270
and have a hipster's life?

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.640
You can live cheaper and
better if you come to Detroit.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.320
There was also this graffiti
campaign "move to Detroit,"

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.160
which you would
see on the bridges.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.520
This was not a massive campaign.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.550
But it goes to show sort
of this looking at Detroit

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.710
in a completely different way.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.350
And suddenly, it sort
of had a street cred.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.770
A lot of New York Times
articles and the like

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.160
were obsessed with these
young white newcomers,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.099
endless articles about them.

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:31.390
And what were they doing there?

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.020
And would they
help save the city,

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.670
and all of that sort of thing.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.260
So there's this
comeback narrative

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.810
of Detroit started to arise.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:44.510
And it's really interesting,
because the corporations really

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.510
soon followed all
of this coverage.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.020
In 2011, just as Detroit
entered bankruptcy proceedings,

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.430
Shinola, the fancy
watch and bike company,

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.000
set up shop in the city.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.870
Their pitch was that
by purchasing a $550

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.840
watch or a $3,000
bicycle, hip consumers

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.530
could buy into the revival
of one of America's

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.240
great industrial cities.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.430
So corporations and investors
really heard the call.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.971
Dan Gilbert, the owner of the
Cleveland Cavaliers and Quicken

00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:12.530
Loans, began to scoop up a
lot of these skyscrapers that

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.440
had been long emptied and
filled them with luxury lofts.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.960
In 2013, Whole
Foods came to town

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.115
and was greeted with
a full-fledged frenzy.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:23.990
The city had arrived.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.030
Whole Foods was there.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.370
So the rebranding of
Detroit's national narrative

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.200
had been sort of complete.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.800
But had the city actually
improve, and for whom?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.770
And who does this
revitalization benefit?

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.770
Well, here are the facts,
just facts, just numbers.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.510
Detroit has been
number one on Forbes

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.330
most dangerous cities list
now for four years in a row.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.930
Detroit only has enough
jobs to employ roughly 37%

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.250
of the population.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.530
The public school
remains in a disgrace.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.060
On the whole, black
residents which

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.980
make up over 80% of
the city have not

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.260
benefited from this new Detroit.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.470
A very small area called
midtown in the downtown area,

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.120
you see restaurants,
you see galleries,

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.320
you see more tourists.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.630
You do see an economy
coming through here.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.760
But the rest of the
140 square miles

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.000
remains exactly as I've
always remembered it

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.860
since I was a child.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.770
Detroit declared
bankruptcy in 2013.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.960
Today, still the population
continues to decline.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.330
However, they think that
by 2018 the population,

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.130
the endless decline,
might actually bottom out.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.940
And that is significant.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.960
It's not insignificant.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.127
But narratives are powerful.

00:22:31.127 --> 00:22:32.543
When I started to
Detropia, people

00:22:32.543 --> 00:22:34.340
would ask what I was
working on, I'd say,

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.500
I'm spending a lot
of time in Detroit.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.820
And they would always answer,
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.514
A snide remark, oh, Detroilet
and things like that.

00:22:42.514 --> 00:22:44.930
Now, when I say I'm going back
to Detroit for the weekend,

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.220
they say, oh, my god, cool.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.750
I heard it's back now.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.140
And I'm dying to
go check it out.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.640
And maybe that narrative,
the Detroit phoenix

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.030
rising from the ashes, will
someday become a reality.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.340
Perhaps, Detroit's
affordability and strange allure

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.950
will continue to bring more
people to the city, people

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.620
like yourselves, with
good ideas of how

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.510
a greater number of
Detroiters can actually

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.870
benefit from this new interest
and investment in the city.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.240
We're far off from this, I feel.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.120
But the fascination with
Detroit continues to grow.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.310
And somehow the city
has a hold on us.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.780
In fact, writer
Drew Philips likes

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.600
to say Detroit is the most
interesting city on the planet.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.460
Because when you
scratch the surface,

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.380
you only find a mirror.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.620
There's just something about
this city, about this story,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.960
we cannot shake.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.460
So I hope you continue
to explore it.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.530
Thank you so much for having me.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:42.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.280
- So thank you first, of
course, to the organizers,

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.630
to Eve, to Julie, to Erik,
and naturally to Dean Cohen

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.550
supporting for
consistently supporting

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.880
what seems to have been
an incredible run here

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.890
in the Radcliffe Institute.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.610
I'd like to especially
thank you Eve Blau, who

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.680
was the protagonist
in bringing me here

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.640
last year to this workshop
on urban intermedia, which

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.650
provided an impetus
for me to organize

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:16.210
my thoughts around this issue of
how what we know about the city

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:20.130
is conditioned through the
lens with which we see it

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:25.550
and, subsequently, how that
lens in turn conditions us.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.050
You

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:31.540
It's fortuitous to follow
Heidi, I think, in the sense

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.650
that what I'm going to
talk about is in a sense

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.490
the other side of what
might be described

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:44.830
as the power of personal
narrative to articulate a place

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.370
and how we read a
city through people.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.000
And I think we, in
the keynote, heard

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.720
quite a bit about this
notion that people

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.069
define cities, which then
in turn define people.

00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:02.110
So it's this relationship
that I'm interested in.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.780
And I'm interested
in looking forward

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:11.170
in terms of contemporary
modes of observing

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.100
the city, in particular the
role of big data, algorithms,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.670
and so-called intelligent
urban infrastructure

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.220
are shaping what we know
about the city today

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.730
and how, in turn, it's
beginning to shape us.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.130
And my interest here
lies in questioning

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.340
how this reciprocal relationship
between the methods and objects

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.300
of urban research changes
when we shift from employing

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.750
representational tools by
which the present city is

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.410
observed to methods involving
data mining and analysis that

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.650
aim to derive observations
and make predictions

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.950
about future situations.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.690
So this is primarily a
story about shifting focus

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.650
from deploying representational
tools, such as the film

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.880
camera as instruments
for recording

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.660
or for urban observation,
to instrumenting

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.150
physical environments
themselves,

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.030
and ultimately the people
that inhabit them with sensors

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.440
and software systems to quantify
urban life in ways that claim

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.460
to lead to ever more
optimized, efficient,

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.760
and sustainable cities.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.040
Now, devices for
observing the world

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.870
have been around for a while.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.120
Much has been said about
the camera obscura,

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.570
for instance, and its role
in recording geometrically

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.700
accurate views of the city.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.430
These are four drawings
by Canaletto representing

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.360
the Campa San Giovanni e
Paolo in Venice, produced

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.080
with the aid of a
camera obscura resulting

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.510
in studies for this painting.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.840
And as historian
[INAUDIBLE] has noted,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.610
the camera obscura
can be understood

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.830
not only as a
performative device, which

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.900
is to say a tool
for representing

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.170
an urban space, for
example, but also

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.130
as an epistemological
model that articulates

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.860
a relationship between an
observer and the world.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.190
Here, we find the construction
of a monocular subject

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.790
isolated and ensconced within
a dark room to which the world

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.200
has gathered its image
through a pinhole or oculus

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.860
and projected onto
an interior wall

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.650
of an observational device.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:22.780
Now, if we compare this device
with that of the stereoscope,

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.620
a different story and a
different observing subject

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.820
emerges.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.610
As a byproduct of early
19th century advances

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.610
in physiological
optics, the stereoscope

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.300
capitalized on the discovery
that with binocular vision,

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.790
each eye sees something
slightly differently

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.780
due to the angular disparity
existing between them.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.600
The production of depth
in sight was subsequently

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.870
understood to be in some way
related to the mind's ability

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.830
to unite and reconcile
two dissimilar images.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.660
Within this context,
the stereoscope

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.290
was developed to reproduce
this optical experience

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.430
mechanically.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.550
Now, significantly, the
device marks an intent

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:06.370
not just to represent
a given space,

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.500
but actually to
simulate its presence.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.770
What is sought is not
merely a likeness,

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.586
but a lucid tangibility.

00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:16.210
With the stereoscope,
one is confronted

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:20.820
not with the view of the world
through an aperture or a frame,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.660
but rather with the
technical reconstitution

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.420
of an already reproduced
world fragmented

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.675
into two non-identical models.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.090
Through the incorporation
of an observing subject

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.930
into the mechanics
of the device,

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.275
the stereoscopic image
is subsequently produced.

00:28:40.275 --> 00:28:44.070
Now, the body is immobilized and
integrated with the apparatus.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.960
The subject becomes
a participant

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.120
in the production
of a verisimilitude

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.840
through a process of unifying
and reconciling the experience

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.260
of difference.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.260
This junk disjunction between
an experience and its cause

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.750
is rarified, the real
conflated with the optical.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.450
Absent is the notion of a point
of view in a Cartesian sense

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.160
as might be characterized
by the camera obscura.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.590
There is, in the end,
nothing out there.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.860
So the radical differences
between these pre-cinematic

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.040
devices highlight the role of
the apparatus in constituting

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.190
not only the parameters of
what we know about the world,

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.130
but also how we conceive
our relationship to it,

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.440
and ultimately how
we know the world

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.790
and locate our agency
to act within it.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.530
Now, fast forward to late 20th
century urban observations

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:39.730
and the work of William Whyte
and his street life project,

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.360
which aimed to study how
people behave and interact

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.390
within urban environments
and with urban environments

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.330
through a structured
research protocol

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:52.000
that aspired to empirical
observations, in this case,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.630
involving time
lapse photography.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.420
This is a photograph of the
apparatus in question, a Super

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:05.390
8 film camera and a clock which
was persistently in the frame.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.250
Now, I'd like to play for you
a short excerpt from his film,

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.780
The Social Life of Small
Urban Spaces, which

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.510
documents the project and
distills a few observations

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.130
from the results.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:26.400
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.910
- This is the plaza of this
[INAUDIBLE] building in New

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.300
York, late morning.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.225
With a time lapse camera, we
were testing a hypothesis.

00:30:34.225 --> 00:30:36.410
The sun, we were
pretty sure, would

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.330
be the chief factor
in determining where

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.900
people would sit or not sit.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:46.910
Now, just after 12:00 they begin
to sit right where the sun is.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.560
I was enormously pleased.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.350
What a perfectly
splendid correlation.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.210
It was quite misleading,
as we were to see later.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.960
But it was a very
encouraging way to start.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.180
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.680
- So this notion,
I want you to hold

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.160
on to this notion of
misleading correlations.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.230
What's important here
is that the project

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.350
departs from a set of hypotheses
about how people interact

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.140
and behave in smaller
spaces and deploys

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.420
the filmic apparatus
in a structured way

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.490
to test these hypotheses.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.330
This is what we might
characterize today as a small

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:25.160
data study, which is to say
small data being characterized

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.720
by their generally
limited volume,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.300
their non-continuous collection,
their narrow . variety,

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.220
and usually generated to
answer very specific questions.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.470
You start with a
question about a space,

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.200
what people are doing there.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.580
Now, I'd like you to compare
Whyte's apparatus with this.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.780
These are two smartphones
affixed to windows recording

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.750
activity happening on a
street outside, In this case,

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.620
in Manhattan as well.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.390
And this is a demo clip from
a startup called Placemeter.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:06.220
Placemeter is a service that
deploys crowdsource smartphones

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.330
as video sensors for
monitoring activity

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.670
on city sidewalks
and public spaces

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.520
in cities around the world.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.460
These video feeds are
analyzed in real time

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.530
based on computer
vision algorithms.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.890
And they process activity
in the video frame

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.860
based on a set of predefined
classifiers established

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.310
through AI and
machine-learning algorithms.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.040
Here's how a Placemeter
presents itself.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.820
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.220
- If you could
measure urban areas

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.300
the same way you do with
page views on the web,

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.620
you'd have enough data
to make better decisions

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.690
about your community, meaning
stronger businesses, better

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.420
neighborhoods, and
more livable cities.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.900
Placemeter does just that.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.900
It's an urban
intelligence platform.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.330
It processes videos from its
own easy-to-install sensor,

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.170
existing camera systems,
or even prerecorded video.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.900
It analyzes pedestrian
and vehicular movements

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.460
and turns them into meaningful
data for municipalities

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.720
and businesses worldwide.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.070
This way, retailers can optimize
storefronts and operations

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.010
for physical stores.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.840
Commercial realtors
can provide clients

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.780
with solid proof and analysis
of foot traffic potential.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.600
And municipalities
can make smarter

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.110
decisions with public money,
delivering better services

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.150
and safer streets to all.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.820
at least the demo.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.130
So in contrast to
Whyte's method, which

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.630
deploys time lapse
photography in attempt

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.200
to test the set of hypotheses
about how people inhabit

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.350
urban space, Placemeter
employs big data analytics

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.840
in an attempt to make
discoveries and derive

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.900
hypotheses from patterns
of movement and activity,

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.210
quantifying the life
of the street in terms

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.420
of a set of pre-established
classifiers.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.870
Former editor in chief of
WIRED magazine Chris Anderson

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.930
has described this new
era of big data analytics

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.300
as, "a new era of
knowledge production

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.699
characterized by
the end of theory."

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:13.580
In other words,
big data analytics

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.300
enables an entirely new
epistemological approach

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.590
for making sense of the world.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.870
Rather than testing
a theory by gathering

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.480
and analyzing relevant
data as Whyte did,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.449
big data analytics
seems to gain insights

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.389
that are born from the data.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:30.139
OK.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.710
But what are big data?

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:36.440
Rob Kitchin, in his book
The Data Revolution,

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.210
identifies a series
of characteristics

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.219
which help frame it.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.260
Big data are huge in volume.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.449
They are high in velocity.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:48.170
They are diverse in
a variety of type.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.684
They are exhaustive in scope.

00:34:50.684 --> 00:34:52.100
In other words,
you're not dealing

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.900
with a sample size of a subset.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.360
But you're actually attempting
to get the entire population

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.120
as your data set.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.490
They are fine grained
in resolution.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.040
They are relational in nature.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.760
And they are flexible, holding
the traits of extensionality

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.980
and scalability.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.340
Now, currently, Place Lab
is being deployed in Paris

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.700
to study urban design proposals
for renovating urban traffic

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.750
services.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.701
and traffic circles into more
pedestrian friendly zones

00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:21.200
in the city.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.510
They do things like
study how these park

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:26.960
benches are used or
not used, bike paths

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.070
widths, and so forth.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.510
But this trend here is
toward instrumenting

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.220
physical environments
with sensors

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.110
and employing big data analytics
to quantify urban life in ways

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:42.110
that are characteristics of
many, many so-called smart city

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.980
initiatives, which we're
seeing pop up around the world.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.270
From this Songdo International
Business District

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.330
in South Korea, also
known as New Songdo,

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.790
which is a new city built
from scratch by a partnership

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.880
between New York based
developer Gale International

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.760
and the New York office
of Kohn Pederson Fox,

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.350
as well as Cisco Systems, the
digital plumbers so to speak.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:08.900
To Masdar City in the
United Arab Emirates

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.930
developed by the Mubadala
Development Company

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.930
in association with
British architecture firm

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.720
Foster and Partners.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.830
To Hudson Yards in New
York, a partnership

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.700
between related companies Oxford
Properties and the New York

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.920
office of Kohn Pederson Fox.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.700
I'd like to talk a little
bit about Hudson Yards.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.760
When completed, this
$20 billion project

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.624
will span seven city blocks
on the west side of Manhattan.

00:36:34.624 --> 00:36:37.040
It's literally the largest
real estate development project

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.440
ever undertaken in the US.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.110
It will incorporate more
than 18 million square feet

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.190
of commercial and
residential space,

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:50.150
including 100 retail shops,
4,000 residences, and 14 acres

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.550
of parks and public plazas.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.650
This massive development
effort promises

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:58.190
to showcase the latest smart
city technologies promising

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.610
the world's first connected,
responsive, clean, responsible,

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.130
reliable, and
efficient neighborhood.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.840
Who wouldn't want that?

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.830
Who would want to
live in a dumb city?

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.020
The project also pretends
to be the world's

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.830
first quantified community, a
literal testbed for experiments

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.760
in urban data science led
by NYU's Center for Science

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.450
and Urban Progress, or CUSP.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:27.260
Constantine Kontokosta,
CUSP's project leader,

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.970
describes the
quantified community

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.270
as a fully instrumented
urban neighborhood

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.580
that uses an integrated
expandable sensor

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.100
network to support the
measurement integration

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.160
and analysis of neighborhood
conditions, activity,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.599
and outcome.

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.640
So they're doing things
like measuring, modeling,

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.150
and predicting pedestrian
flows, gauging air quality

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.030
both within buildings
and across open spaces,

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.970
measuring and modeling
energy production and usage

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.310
throughout the project,
measuring health and activity

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.580
levels of residents and
workers using a custom designed

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.940
opt-in mobile application.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.010
Now, how many
people in this room

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.830
are familiar with the
Quantified Self movement?

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:08.370
Not many.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.330
OK, few, few.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.990
So the notion of a
quantified community

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.020
stems from the idea of the
Quantified Self, which simply

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.480
involves people
logging personal data

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.300
about their daily activities
using wearable sensors.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:26.020
You might have heard the
device, a Fitbit, for example.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.460
Apps such as fitness activity
trackers, for example,

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.920
monitor a range
of health factors,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.460
heart rate, steps taken, floors
climbed, calories burned, even

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.820
sleep quality, and produce
representations of our progress

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.420
toward self-identified goals
that are shared and aggregated

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.770
through online portals.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:46.920
Here, the notion is that through
the continuous self-monitoring

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.380
of physiological
condition, we can

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.240
bring about personal
behavioral change.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.270
We can change our
behavior if we just

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.470
know enough in quantifiable
terms about what the data is.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.590
Now, scaling this paradigm
to the neighborhood,

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.200
the quantified community
then is the idea

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.060
that continuous
monitoring of the built

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.210
environment, the status
of its technical systems,

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.630
and human activity all can be
fed back into that environment

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.480
to alter its future
performance and ultimately

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.910
the behavior of its inhabitants.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.130
Here, people engaged
with their neighborhood

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.650
not only by consuming
its services

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.200
and administering
its systems, but also

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.160
by serving as sources of
measurable behavioral data.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.960
People in this context
become censors.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.067
They become,
themselves, censors.

00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:36.150
And Shannon Mattern has
done some interesting work

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.660
on this, article
in Places journal

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.700
online recently,
actually about a year

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.440
ago now, where she identifies
some of the key problems here.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.300
Yet, if we were to measure
the behavior of these citizen

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.990
sensors as an index of the
engagement with the city,

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.522
we find that their
actions, in fact,

00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:55.980
are limited by the
instruments that

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:02.280
render those actions visible
and worth accounting for.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.290
She references
Hannah Arendt here

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.210
in saying the trouble
with modern theories

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.140
of behavioralism--" this is
Arendt in 1958 in her book

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.900
The Human Condition-- "is
not that they are wrong

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.560
but that they could become true,
that the very instruments used

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.120
to measure behavior
are indicative of

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.710
and constitutive of
societies of automatism

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:26.220
and sterile passivity."

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.290
So the data that
we generate based

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.870
on determinist assumptions
and faulty methodologies

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.790
in some cases could
end up shaping

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:36.870
populations and building
worlds in their own image.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.180
So the quantified
community at Hudson Yards

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.210
thus can be seen as a test
bed for future urban life

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.120
where urban intelligence,
the so-called smartness

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.570
of the smart city, is rendered
not as conscious liberal

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:52.140
or objective, but
rather as performative.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.170
In the shift from observational
tools to environments

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.080
that observe, both the
city and its citizens

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.320
converge into populations of
human and non-human actors

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.560
and actants that comprise
not individual bodies

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.470
and personal experiences,
but rather patterns

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.190
of activity and behavior
iteratively mined

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:15.430
and interpreted by
algorithmic processes.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.955
Now, this testbed
world of big data,

00:41:17.955 --> 00:41:22.050
a world where correlation
supersedes causation,

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:27.300
is a probabilistic one where few
things are certain and most are

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.090
only probable, such as the
relationship between cheese

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.760
consumption and the
number of people being

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.240
tangled in their bedsheets.

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.050
It presents an
urban epistemology

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.790
that is not concerned
with documented facts

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.150
representing spaces or
making representative models

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.300
of our world, but rather
creating models that are in

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.510
and of themselves territories.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.500
So the question
is what questions

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.650
do we need to be asking
about these new territories?

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.690
Dalton and Thatcher have
argued for a new field

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.690
of critical data studies that
situates these territories

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.810
in broader social, cultural,
and political contexts and that

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:09.110
address the technical, ethical,
political, and economic,

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.140
temporal, spatial, and
philosophical implications

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.330
of this shift from
observational tools

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.230
to observing environments.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.660
And in closing, I'd like to
transpose their so-called five

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.270
questions at the
end of that essay.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.770
to urban environments.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:27.700
And in doing, so we might ask
what historical conditions have

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:31.340
led to the instrumentation of
cities with big data systems

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.990
and infrastructures?

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.500
How is big data being
deployed or employed

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.650
in the production of urban
space and infrastructure?

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.440
Who controls the production
and analysis of big data

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.210
in urban environments?

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.510
What implicit and
explicit biases, motives,

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.360
and imperatives
drive their work?

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.730
Who are the urban
subjects of big data?

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:56.030
And what new forms of
knowledge are they producing?

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.490
And ultimately, what
productive insights can

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:02.210
urban big data offer after all?

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:06.716
What other forms of knowledge
could it help to produce?

00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:07.712
Thank you.

00:43:07.712 --> 00:43:16.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.620
- Thank you so much for inviting
me, Liz and Becky and everyone

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.600
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.810
I'm so happy to be
back at Radcliffe

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.030
as an undergraduate in the '70s.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.670
And I'm going to be speaking
about a subject that is dear

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:35.200
to my heart, the maximum
city I call home, Bombay,

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.250
the mega city that was
renamed Mumbai in 1995

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:43.030
by the right-wing party,
Hindu party, Shiv Sena.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.560
It's for that reason
that I'm going

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.850
to refer to it in my talk
as Bombay and not Mumbai.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:52.920
It's a city which has a density
of more than 44,000 people

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:58.360
per kilometer and a population
of over 18 million, all of them

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.060
jammed-- all of us
jammed-- into an area that

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.780
is only 233 square miles.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.540
They have written
screenplays set in the city

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.170
and directed two films,
a feature and a VR short,

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:13.650
where the city is
very much a character.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.910
The way I've come to
know Bombay is not

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.100
through my screenplays
or my films,

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.700
but primarily through
the act of photography,

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.430
just me and my one camera.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.380
I began shooting
the city in 1976.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.890
And I haven't
stopped since then.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:31.810
My photographic
journey began here

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:37.890
in Cambridge in 1976 with a
loan of $220 from my roommate

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.590
Cathy Dement, god
bless her always,

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:45.370
to buy my first camera, a
Nikkormat with a 50 millimeter

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:46.480
lens.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.210
I worked with Steve Geovanis
in the music library.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.660
He was a junior and a
stringer for The Boston Globe.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.860
He taught me the basics of how
to shoot and develop and print.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:03.400
Shortly after I got
my camera and lenses

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.030
and got my lessons from
Steve and prepared Cathy,

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.480
I took a leave of absence for
a semester and returned home.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.080
Ostensibly, to spend a
semester photographing Bombay,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.460
but in reality because I was
just desperately homesick.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.770
My talk is going to be
more showing than telling,

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.290
because I believe that
the act of looking

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.574
is as good a way of knowing
a city as any other.

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.410
This was one of the photos I
took on that first trip home.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.470
It's the gateway of India from
the sea lounge of the Taj Mahal

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:38.755
Hotel 32 years before
terrorists held

00:45:38.755 --> 00:45:42.850
it hostage for five
extremely bloody brutal days.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.160
Now, of course, there
can be no open windows,

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.350
because of security.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.230
No matter how modern
an Indian city is,

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.155
there are never any boundaries
between inside and outside.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.090
These horse carriages used
to be symbolic of the city.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.920
Now, they are banned,
except for a few

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.160
who take tourists on rides,
much like New York City.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.300
The lifeline of the
city, its local trains.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:15.920
Though this was taken in 1976,
the tracks remain the same.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.210
This building still exists
next to a train station.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:24.600
Our neighborhood bar serving
moonshine, that is long gone.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.920
In its place as a 35 story
building empty of residence,

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.630
like most of these
new buildings are

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:32.220
that are bought for investments.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.170
Nobody lives in them.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.460
Though this was taken
in 1976, many wells

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.290
still exist in the city.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.890
Water is always a valuable
and scarce resource everywhere

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:45.400
in India.

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:49.720
This photograph
is the equivalent

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.140
of two kids riding a
camel down Mass Ave. They

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:58.640
are on one of the city's main
arterial roads, Marine Drive.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.830
So when I returned
home, I also started

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.330
photographing my family, my
grandmother, my grandfather,

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:09.560
on his favorite trip, to get
his fountain pen repaired.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.800
He always left a tip.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.170
My neighbor across the way,
[? Yasmin ?] [? Irani ?]

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:18.760
studying on her balcony.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.490
I call this photo,
Evenings at Cozy building.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.220
This was where I grew
up in an extended family

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:26.380
and my parents still live.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:30.600
This was a typical scene
at home every evening.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.570
I call this photo
Streetside Services.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:36.710
And this was actually
taken only last year.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.800
This is a typist typing
out something for someone

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.950
on an actual manual typewriter.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.580
And this is Streetside
Services from 1976.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.800
A palmist reads someone's hand.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:56.830
And behind him, a lawyer is in
his open-air office consulting.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:00.220
Again, but this time more
recently, Bombay's famous road

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.310
Marine Drive lined with
art deco buildings.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:04.870
And this was at a
public air show.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.110
These were innocent times
when this gentleman could

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.840
be a security guard
at the airport

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.270
and I, as a skinny
19-year-old, could

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.600
be a security guard at
Harvard guarding the chemistry

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.430
labs at night.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.370
Bombay is a city of
infinite variety of worlds

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.470
within worlds of
different classes,

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.410
communities, religions, rituals.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:33.440
I grew up with girls who are
Christians, Jews, Hindus,

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.430
Muslims, Jains.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.950
I was a Parsi
Zoroastrianism myself.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.740
This is Sean Ma, the son and
my husband's college friend

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.970
[? Lang ?] Ma.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.370
They live opposite the
Chinese temple of Bombay.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:47.340
And we visit their home and the
temple every Chinese New Year.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.520
Though I come from an
extremely collective society,

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.490
in my creative work,
I've always been

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:55.790
interested in the individual
within the collective,

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:59.200
like in this photo.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.770
The women of the Red Light
District, Kamathipura.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.210
The celebration the
city is most known for,

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:10.290
the Ganapati festival of the
much-beloved Hindu God Ganesh,

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.890
who is immersed in the sea.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.980
Then in 1986, I
began my film journey

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.740
with my first screenplay I
ever wrote for the film Salaam

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.350
Bombay!, a collaboration
with my friend

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:25.020
also from Radcliffe, Mira Nair.

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.270
The film was about street
children in Bombay.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.310
And I'm very proud of my
unique credit on that film,

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:34.900
screenwriter slash
still photographer.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.760
This was taken at
an actor's workshop

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.130
we held before filming began.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.120
This is Bernad,
a street kid, who

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:45.800
was then adopted by a
cinematographer Sandi Sissel.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:50.260
Bernad moved to Los Angeles in
1992 and began living there.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.330
He is married to a
wonderful Chinese lady.

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.310
And they have a
13-year-old daughter

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.850
who is a national level
competitive ice skater.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.780
And Bernad has been living in
Hollywood for the past so many

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.290
years since 1992.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.980
And he's been working
at, appropriately enough,

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.130
Panavision.

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.640
Time pass, a unique
Indian concept.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.460
All these hundreds of
people have so much time

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.410
to pass that they
are all staring up

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:20.700
at us shooting on the
second floor of a building,

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.290
except there's nothing to see.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:27.170
Because the set was boarded
up to keep sound out.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:30.730
This is our sound man Neal
on location hard at work.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.200
The gang of street
kids we hung out

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.420
with before wrote
the screenplay,

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.630
the boy on the right
looks like such a toughie.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:44.320
But once his cap was off,
it was another story.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.330
The boy touching
his bald head is

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.940
who inspired the main
character of the film.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:53.000
He's the real
[NON-ENGLISH], the tea boy.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.980
The Bombay film
industry was always

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.130
known for its elaborate
hand-painted [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.840
They don't exist anymore.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.780
A famous artist M.F.
Hussain began his career

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.370
as a painter of
these [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:09.320
Two thespians enjoying a
well-deserved cup of tea

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.350
after a bout of artificial red.

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.540
Naseeruddin Shah and
Stellan Skarsgard

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.960
shooting for the film Perfect
Murder on the streets.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.020
Bombay used to have glamorous
movie premieres in gorgeous art

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.850
deco movie theaters.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:26.790
This was one of the last of
the grand premieres in the '80s

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:28.200
with a Navy band playing.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:34.240
The star of the
film, [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.460
And the red carpet of
those days, where you could

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:37.930
be much closer to the action.

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.140
Ever since I was a waitress
at the Hong Kong Bar

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.770
and Restaurant here on Mass
Ave, I've always paid attention

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.670
to waiters and waitresses.

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:56.340
This photo and the next one,
taken more recently last year,

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.710
this was taken at
a film festival

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:02.790
after party in one of the
city's richest residences.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:04.380
I imagine the
mistress of the house

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.980
instructed her staff to clean
up immediately any of her guests

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.160
dropped anything, even if it
was in the middle of the party.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.350
A New Year's Eve
dance in the '80s,

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.350
again, Bombay's mosaic of
Christians, Paris, Sikhs,

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.330
all rocking and rolling.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:27.060
Unfortunately, its cosmopolitan
character has since eroded.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.180
Of all Indian cities, women
of freer and safer in Bombay

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.460
as you can see in this photo.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.670
And the classic trope
all over the world

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:40.060
and particularly in India,
the loose women parting

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.840
with the cigarette and
smoking versus the goddess.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.180
Bombay always been known
as the city by the sea.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.730
Countless generations
of citizens, regardless

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:55.850
of cost, class, and community
have enjoyed the many sea

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.380
fronts that line our coasts.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.170
Even if one lives
in the interiors

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.720
in the most overcrowded
of localities,

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.180
there's always the
sea to give relief.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.730
This is about to
change forever thanks

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.610
to a misguided mega-project
to build a 12 lane

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:14.690
coastal road using public
funds that will only benefit

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:18.620
a small percentage of car
owners, a road that will damage

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:24.510
the environment and make the sea
a distant dream that once was.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:30.160
My favorite bird, the smartest
as well, a Bombay crow.

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.520
Rear window in Bombay.

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.380
So that was Bombay then.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.570
And I'm going to
show you Mumbai now.

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.360
I'm not going to speak, because
I'd like you to just look.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.240
And I could we dim
the lights, please?

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.721
That's it thank you so much.

00:58:34.721 --> 00:58:43.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:46.630
- So thank you to all
three of our presenters

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:51.460
for their provocative and also
very compelling presentations.

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.970
And now, we'll try to
pull things together just

00:58:54.970 --> 00:59:00.040
for a few minutes before we open
up the floor to your questions.

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.580
And it's actually not very
easy to pull things together.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.940
Because on the one hand,
we have Heidi's work

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.730
and Sooni's, both
of which come out

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:17.470
of a very long relationship
with a particular place

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.930
and also using different media.

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:23.050
And not exclusively
for artistic purposes,

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:27.070
but certainly those
are among the purposes.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:30.220
And then we have
Mark's work, which

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:37.210
shows how we can use the
same media or similar newer

00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:40.120
media not in
representational modes,

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:44.710
but in modes that allow
us to mine data from them.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:47.680
And Mark also observes
that what we see

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.200
is conditioned by
the lens that we use,

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.480
which in turn affects us.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.410
So without getting
too tangled up

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:59.230
in the idea of new
technologies, I

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:08.040
wonder if we can somehow put
the two approaches together

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.600
in terms of what they yield.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.200
So I would like to ask
each of our three speakers

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.240
to comment on the kinds of
knowledge and understanding

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.350
about urbanism today that
are produced by their work

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.020
and through what
artistic strategies

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:30.500
the particular power of your
medium shows change over time.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.010
So that's my question
to each of you in turn.

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:36.220
And I don't know,
perhaps, you'd like to--

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.500
- Well, I haven't really
thought about it in those terms.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.280
I think that the difference
between, I think,

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.810
the work actually that I'm
showing versus what you were

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.584
showing and also to a lesser
extent-- we have more in common

01:00:49.584 --> 01:00:50.500
with what we're doing.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.360
But I think that
it's interesting

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.080
that the data can show
maybe where these people go

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.150
and what spaces they inhabit.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:01.510
Whereas, I'm interested in
how an individual relates to

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.690
and feels about their
environment and what

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.190
kind of personal
stories that they

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:09.820
create around a tactile space.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:14.830
And it's funny, because
in Detroit, for example,

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:17.770
people always talk about the
emptiness, the empty spaces.

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:22.540
And we were sure in our film
to very rarely show just

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.370
an empty building on a street.

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:26.580
There was always a
person scurrying by

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.970
or someone in the window.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:32.740
We even have a shot in the film
where a crane is taking down

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:36.820
all these houses as part of
the mayor's oath to the people

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:41.480
to tear down like 60,000
houses, unoccupied houses.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.730
And we would be shooting that.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.925
And then just one
street behind there

01:01:44.925 --> 01:01:47.860
would be a little kid in the
window, maybe the last family

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.030
on the block.

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:53.199
And so there was
this push to shrink

01:01:53.199 --> 01:01:54.490
the city while we were filming.

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:57.546
It was when Mayor Bing
was the Mayor of Detroit.

01:01:57.546 --> 01:01:59.170
And it was all about
shrinking the city

01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:01.044
and turning off street
lights and turning off

01:02:01.044 --> 01:02:02.680
water and saving money.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.820
And if there was only one person
on the block, they should move.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.440
They should just move.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.420
And that would be
more practical.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.120
But there wasn't money
to give them to move.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.330
And so it was like, what
makes a neighborhood?

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:18.160
I mean, there's
birds, and trees,

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.220
and grass, and stray dogs,
and maybe one old lady

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.990
on the block.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.570
And what is her value?

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:27.490
And if there's only
one person interacting

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:29.920
with a space that was
made for multitudes,

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.370
does the value of
that space change?

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:36.575
And in the eyes of
the lady on the block,

01:02:36.575 --> 01:02:37.450
it's her whole world.

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:38.300
It's her memories.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:38.890
It's her life.

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:40.473
It's the smells and
sounds of her kids

01:02:40.473 --> 01:02:41.780
who used to live there.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.510
And so for her, it's a
hypertacile, real, living

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:46.010
thing.

01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.593
It's her life.

01:02:46.593 --> 01:02:47.470
It's her memory.

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:50.320
And to the city,
it's just a nuisance.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.387
Because it wasn't
made just for her.

01:02:52.387 --> 01:02:54.220
So these were the kind
of conversations that

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.480
were happening in the city.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.270
And we tried to capture
in the way we could

01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:01.079
through our lens, which
doesn't answer your question,

01:03:01.079 --> 01:03:01.870
but it's an answer.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:04.760
- Yeah.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.640
OK.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.670
Well, I'll take a crack
at trying to approach it.

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:13.710
I think the intention in
presenting the kind of talk

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:17.280
that I presented in
this milieu is really

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.550
to try to push back to some
of the overarching claims

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:27.460
that people working in this
field of, let's call it,

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:31.260
smart city development
make about what not only

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.260
the aspirations
are, but what are

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.850
some of the potential
capabilities are.

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:40.470
And I think that one of the
things that we are witnessing

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:43.830
as some of these
proposals, projects,

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:47.430
are moving from the
realm of speculation

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:52.180
to being built or enacted is
that the kind of territory

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:56.040
is shrinking in terms
of there's a kind of gap

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:03.630
between what something is being
projected to be capable of

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:08.800
and in fact what is being really
used for or is useful for.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.640
And I think one of the things
that people are coming around

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.470
to is just this notion that
specifically this type of work,

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:21.930
this so-called small data,
is extremely valuable

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:25.740
to understand the
qualitative components

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.270
or the qualitative aspects
of an urban environment.

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:37.100
In looking at correlations
not caring about causation,

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.110
the idea is that you
would make discoveries,

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.640
that you would operate on--

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.350
I was having a
conversation last night

01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:48.420
about people working with
the New York Public Library's

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:54.570
digital collection of menus
across hundreds of years.

01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:58.290
Or, 100, 150 years,
I'm not quite sure.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:01.950
But being able to look
and try to correlate

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:06.720
the presence of grapefruit
on a menu with, let's say,

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:12.210
droughts in California
or supply chain shifts

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:16.110
is the kind of question
that big data enables.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:24.890
The problem is that
much like 20th century

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:29.940
kind of techno-determinism in
urban design in particular,

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:34.430
higher in design, there is
the drive that this empiricism

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:38.480
becomes totalizing.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.760
And so in this
context, I think it's

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:45.440
important to be able to not
just look away or say this is

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.940
only quantitative information.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.780
Cities are far more
complex and diverse.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:54.050
They are filled with
non-addressable spaces, spaces

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:57.890
which aren't easily
quantifiable.

01:05:57.890 --> 01:06:00.980
And within this context,
it's important to be

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:06.990
able to point to
examples where knowledge

01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:10.470
of ways of knowing
the city exceed

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:15.930
the ability of any one media or
medium and any one discourse.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:19.920
And so it's, in a sense,
what kinds of questions

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:25.260
do we need to ask from the
perspective of the humanities

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.160
to be able to engage
with what's ultimately

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.760
a fairly powerful force
and, to a certain extent,

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.200
beginning to drive decisions.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.380
For example, in Detroit
about what parts of the city

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:43.140
do we reconfigure urban
services, street lights,

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.740
for example, water, electricity.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:51.810
How can we input into this
policy-making, decision-making

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:58.512
process in ways which can
make qualitative difference?

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:05.220
- I've always found photography
as an ideal medium to document

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.970
change and preserve memories by
[INAUDIBLE] of things that are

01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.170
disappearing.

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:12.420
And that's always
been my personal,

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:18.840
kind of, motivator to
photograph the city as well

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.440
as the community I belong to,
both of which are disappearing.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.590
The city that I knew is
disappearing and the community

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.320
I belong to as well.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.990
I was struck by the
images of Detroit.

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:35.670
And it's funny that it would
never happen in my city

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:41.580
that there would be spaces that
are kind of derelict and empty,

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.150
because it just doesn't happen.

01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:46.320
There's not an inch of
empty space in Bombay.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.270
And probably in
other Indian cities

01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:52.080
as well, it's always
broken down to be built up.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.170
Nobody leaves anything
derelict ever.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:57.240
And so there's a lot
of churning going on

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.810
in Indian city,
especially Bombay.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.790
Bombay is full of change now.

01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:05.100
It's full of the mega
development projects.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:09.180
They all involve corruption,
including public works.

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.040
And there are a lot
of active citizens

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.470
who are trying to
oppose it to, I'm

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:16.410
sorry to say,
little or no avail.

01:08:19.649 --> 01:08:22.380
- We're almost at our
discussion period.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:25.020
But I'm just going to take
the moderators prerogative

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.060
to ask Sooni one
more question, which

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.210
is that the beautiful
photographs that she showed

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:34.635
us were divided into two series,
as she herself specified,

01:08:34.635 --> 01:08:37.710
A first earlier series
in black and white

01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:40.620
and a second more
contemporary series filled

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:47.100
with the drama of color and
also with all kinds of contrasts

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.319
that speak to the
contemporary moment.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:54.330
So I wanted to ask about
your different strategies

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.069
and whether you
consider it all one

01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:58.470
body of work or several body.

01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:01.410
- I don't know about
considering it one body work.

01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:03.870
I think they're
two bodies of work.

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:08.160
The color is actually
a result of technology.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.609
Most of these were
camera phone pictures.

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:14.910
And though I'm a purist,
I love the camera phone.

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:16.439
Because I always
have it with me.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:18.689
And I always used
to resolve to carry

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:22.109
a camera with me every day,
but I never managed to.

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:24.270
And now, I always
have it with me.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:27.660
And the other thing is I'm
a very avid Instagrammer.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.410
Because when I
started photography,

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:33.210
there was of very few
avenues to share your work.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:34.950
And when Instagram
came out and I

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:37.859
could share my work with
friends across the globe,

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:39.689
I completely dived into it.

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:43.109
I have some 3,000 plus
photos on Instagram,

01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:44.760
including a lot of these.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.270
So it's a question
of technology that

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.310
made the second body of work.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.660
- Thank you.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.160
All right.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.770
So we'd like to give
you all a chance to ask

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:57.570
questions of our presenters.

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:01.260
As you can see, there's a mic in
the center of the aisle there.

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:03.010
And if you'd like
to ask a question,

01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:05.670
please just come up to the mic.

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:08.730
If there are several of
you, you can stand in line.

01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:12.780
And when it's your turn,
please identify yourself.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:16.600
And please ask a question
along with making any comments.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.190
So I know it's hard
to be the first one,

01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:22.200
but I can't imagine
that some of you

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.855
don't have questions for
these amazing speakers.

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:29.450
- Can I go right ahead?

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:30.730
- Go for it.

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:34.950
- Well, this is a comment
and a question for Sooni.

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:38.370
When I was 12 or 13,
I was lucky enough

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:43.680
to capture or just flick the
channel and see Salaam Bombay!

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.510
And besides the commercials
there always were,

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:51.060
I was struck by your movie.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.740
And it's been an
inspiration for me

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:56.580
since then to study cities
as a political science major,

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.240
to look at cities as a civic
space that's continuously

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:00.930
transforming.

01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:03.040
And I thank you so
much for your art.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:03.250
- Thank you so much.

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:05.500
- And I'm definitely going
to look for your Instagram.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.520
Because I loved your writing
and your storytelling

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.870
and your photography.

01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:13.110
And I want to continue that.

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:15.710
My question to you
is I'm Bangladeshi.

01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:16.460
- Sorry?

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.400
- I'm Bangladeshi.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.162
- Yeah.

01:11:18.162 --> 01:11:19.620
- So three or four
years ago, I was

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:24.030
working with an NGO called BRAC
on water policy in Bangladesh.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.010
And Dhaka has been
a city that has

01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:29.730
changed within 10 to
20 years, 10 of which

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:31.050
I've never been back.

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:32.310
I was born in this country.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.170
I consider myself an American.

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:37.650
But I have history and
roots that obviously go back

01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:39.860
to being Bengali.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:45.810
So I wonder when I was passing
through the city corporation

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:49.350
and seeing this tall
building, how people--

01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:51.510
when growing up in
Cambridge and continuing

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:53.880
to live in Cambridge when
I can walk up to my city

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.610
councilor and say, can I
make officer hours with you?

01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:59.400
Can I talk about a city
ordinance with you?

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.840
How do we bring that
with keeping in mind

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.570
the differences between
and the stereotypes that

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:09.390
are associated with
democracy and Westernization?

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:11.340
How do we bring that
kind of openness?

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.270
How do we bring that civic
conversation back to our people

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:19.860
and integrate our values
and culture and history

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:24.090
into what we can transform our
cities and our way of life?

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:24.900
Thank you.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.205
- That's a good question.

01:12:26.205 --> 01:12:27.205
I wish I had the answer.

01:12:27.205 --> 01:12:27.670
- I just trying
to figure it out.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:27.920
Yeah.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.670
- I would love to know
the answer to that.

01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:33.930
Because we had one
avenue in India

01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:36.990
called the RTI Act, which
is Right To Information.

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:40.530
And now, the current government
wants to repeal that as well.

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:44.610
So nothing is public.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:48.420
In my city, Bombay, they
will have a Development Act.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.530
And they will do
it, and then they

01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:56.340
will make it public for five
days of public comments.

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.940
And the act will have such
far reaching consequences.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.370
And it would never happen
in any Western city,

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.590
but it happens
constantly in India.

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.320
Because there's
no accountability.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.430
There's no feeling that they
are accountable to the public.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.850
Politicians feel that they
are almost like royalty.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:16.740
Nobody can question them.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.050
And there's a huge
amount of corruption

01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.740
involved in all these projects
and all these public projects.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.710
So I'm sorry to be so
pessimistic about it,

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:28.380
but realistically
speaking I don't know when

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.640
it's going to change really.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.150
And what I talked about,
this coastal road,

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.790
we tried very hard, but
we didn't get anywhere

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:37.949
unfortunately.

01:13:37.949 --> 01:13:38.990
- Well, thank you anyway.

01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:41.323
- And thank you for your kind
words about Salaam Bombay!

01:13:41.323 --> 01:13:42.240
- Of course.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.430
- Thank you so much.

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:51.700
I have a query
beginning with Mark.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:57.610
In your comment about
empiricism becoming totalizing

01:13:57.610 --> 01:14:00.240
and, I think in your
engagement, there

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.430
is a deep yearning for
the non-totalitarian

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:05.290
and the creative.

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:10.570
So it is in that spirit, the
discourse of this smart city,

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:16.600
how does it cultivate the reason
and practice of soul city?

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.960
And I'm here reminded of the
great work of anthropologist

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.960
Ulf Hannerz who nearly
50 years ago wrote

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.610
a book called The Soulside.

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:29.780
So how do we think of the
[INAUDIBLE] space, this sphere

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.420
of this soul sphere as well?

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:37.420
My connected query to
both Heidi and Sooni is--

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.370
thank you so much--

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:42.160
among your many
important engagement,

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.680
one dimension is the engagement
with loss and disappearance,

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.480
and therefore ways
of knowing the city,

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.820
especially when Sooni,
you make the comment,

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.510
"seeing is a way of knowing."

01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:59.500
But that act of seeing,
does it also involve

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.050
an act of weeping or crying?

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:04.720
Therefore, I think
with the theme

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.630
of loss and
disappearance, how do

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:12.090
we bring weeping as a way of
knowing which then becomes

01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:14.890
a companion to solidarity.

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:17.200
Therefore, the
question would be that

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.220
what is this base of
hope in this context?

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:24.430
And how do we think
of the city space

01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:29.181
in terms of poetics of space,
but also the emergent spaces

01:15:29.181 --> 01:15:29.680
of hope?

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.260
- If I can just take
the first question--

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.680
can you just repeat the author?

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.580
I'm not sure I'm
familiar with this text.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.230
- He's an anthropologist.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:45.500
His name Ulf Hannerz,
originally from Sweden

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:49.900
who did fieldwork with, I think,
an Afro-American community

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.310
in Washington DC.

01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:54.610
But I am just reminded
of the title Soulside.

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:55.280
- Soulside.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.510
- Just to bring the connection
of this soul sphere,

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:01.210
because in my work,
I'm also trying to--

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:05.350
I'm coming from India with of
kind of, as Sunni mentioned,

01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:08.770
the regal discourse
of the smart city.

01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:11.770
So we need to bring a
discourse of the soul city.

01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:12.270
- Sure.

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:13.640
Yeah.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.690
That's a great question.

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.850
There's a couple of ways
one can respond to that

01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:22.000
or people have
responded to that.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.520
One is to say simply that
this soul side of the city

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.000
is a non-addressable space.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.750
At least, it's not
addressable in the sense

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:31.990
that it doesn't
have an IP address.

01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:35.110
The soul doesn't have
an IP address, right?

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:39.040
And to a certain extent,
one finds that response

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.590
unsatisfying.

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:43.750
Another way of approaching,
responding to that,

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:48.160
is to suggest in a similar
way that we were talking about

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.370
this morning where
people moved to the city,

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:54.090
and it changes them.

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:56.440
Their attitudes change.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.700
Their values change
in some respects

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.180
or at least grow and develop.

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:10.000
And I think back to
Martin Heidegger's essay

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.620
on "The Age of the
World Picture."

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:16.685
And he's talking about
this quantification.

01:17:16.685 --> 01:17:22.540
In the age of the world picture,
the certain move or shift

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:28.480
toward a degree of,
shall I say, bigness

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.330
moves over from the
quantitative to begin to have

01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:34.430
a qualitative component to it.

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:36.640
It has a quality to it, right?

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.940
And he describes this as
a kind of modern condition

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.590
and as a result
from a whole range

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:44.710
of technological developments.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:48.320
Similar claims are
being made about how--

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.470
and this is the kind of
darker side in a sense of some

01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:56.230
of the propositions--

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:57.700
Chris Anderson's
claim of the end

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:03.300
of theory, where correlation
supersedes causation.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.510
We're talking
about a different--

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:07.370
in the sciences, in
the hard sciences,

01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:12.280
it's not such a leap
to say we don't really

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.230
care why this is happening.

01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:19.720
But we can show you
evidentiary data that

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.340
prove this correlation exists.

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:29.040
When we're talking
about the soul side,

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:34.580
it's a question of has
that quality, which

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.340
comes from a quantitative
condition being

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:41.440
pushed to a certain scale,
already become part of us?

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.000
And I think that's
the challenge.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.250
That's what we're looking at.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.260
- I think it's so
evocative, the concept

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:54.770
of weeping and acknowledging
the loss of what

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:58.220
was no longer coming
back and that there

01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.830
is a crying and a
weeping that I think

01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:04.700
you could feel in some of the
clips that I showed today.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.149
You know, spaces matter.

01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:07.190
And neighborhoods matter.

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:09.300
And where things
take place matters,

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.300
especially in a city
like Detroit, which

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:15.110
not unlike what Angela was
mentioning about Los Angeles,

01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:18.950
the highways, the freeways, the
way they were built in Detroit

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:24.290
also completely segregated
blacks from whites in Detroit.

01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:25.940
It was intentional.

01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:28.070
It was done.

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:31.130
The concept in mind was to
just keep everyone apart.

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:34.430
And it's very, very hard to
undo an infrastructure like that

01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:36.130
even with good intentions.

01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:39.080
The city planning was
done a certain way.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.335
And that has not been resolved.

01:19:41.335 --> 01:19:43.460
So when we talk about all
the development happening

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.876
in this one area,
now they call it

01:19:44.876 --> 01:19:51.620
Midtown, that is easily
accessible by suburban people.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.867
So they come in to the
Tigers games on the weekends.

01:19:53.867 --> 01:19:54.950
They'll come to the opera.

01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:56.270
They'll go to the Detroit
Institute of Arts.

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:57.542
They'll go to these places.

01:19:57.542 --> 01:19:58.500
It's easy to get there.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.570
There's parking.

01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:01.790
And for a lot of
black residents who

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.400
live in the Greater
Detroit City, which

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.760
is a huge massive place,
it's not convenient.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.650
It's expensive.

01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:11.690
They don't feel comfortable.

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:14.180
All the development and
all of the new residents

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.620
are mostly white.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.440
So in a way, it's
like recreating

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.830
the problem that was never
solved the first time around.

01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:26.870
And so I think that in order
to help bridge this divide,

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:29.930
they should start with the
spaces that events are held in.

01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:32.960
There is a lot of foundations
right now in Detroit,

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.140
sort of NGO-type money
flowing into the city.

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.480
And always, when you're
invited to an event,

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.850
it happens at the
Detroit Institute of Art

01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:44.300
or it happens at the Masonic
Temple or a known space

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.830
in this Midtown
area, because they

01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:47.871
think it's going to be
convenient to those people

01:20:47.871 --> 01:20:48.680
interested.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.455
If they move those
events and said

01:20:50.455 --> 01:20:52.580
I'm doing it at Baker's
Keyboard Lounge, completely

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.205
the other side of
town, or I'm doing it

01:20:54.205 --> 01:20:56.330
at the raven on the East
Side on Chene Street

01:20:56.330 --> 01:21:01.790
and you partnered with these
older black local businesses

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:04.020
that have credibility
with their neighborhoods,

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.810
if they work together
to get the word out

01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:09.050
that there's going to be
meetings in unexpected places

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:11.770
and vice versa, I think that
that would go a long way

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:15.890
to the longtime residents
feeling left out

01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:19.580
of this new Detroit and
cut out and forgotten.

01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:26.690
It makes people feel
useless and disrespected.

01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:28.820
And also, there's
this sense of history

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.910
that this racial divide is
just being recreated again.

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:33.950
So I actually really think
some of these changes

01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:37.880
have to happen with where
events and invitations are

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.720
made in Detroit.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.620
It's that simple.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.030
And that has not even been done.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:44.620
I mean, that's how
basic we're talking.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:48.080
- I'm going to answer
your question about hope.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.440
There's certainly no
hope for the politicians.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.660
But I have a lot
of hope, because

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:59.390
of what I've seen with the
people of the city, of my city,

01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:03.980
when there are disasters like
floods, how people react.

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:07.790
You know, you must have
seen in these photographs

01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:12.890
a woman who has no home who
has everything outdoors,

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:14.880
and she's still smiling.

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.400
That's what gives me hope.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.980
It gives me hope that
people who have nothing

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:22.580
still continue to smile and
still continue to have hope.

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.050
And that's an amazing thing.

01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:25.880
And that exists in the city.

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.110
And that, I think,
nobody can destroy.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.890
And the other hope
of the city is

01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:34.580
people are constantly coming
to the city, because for them

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.650
the city represents
hope as opposed

01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:38.960
to villages where
they are starving.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.180
And they say that nobody
starves in the city.

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.010
I'm not sure how true that is.

01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:46.516
But that's what they say.

01:22:46.516 --> 01:22:47.016
- Thank you.

01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:53.060
- Hi, my name is [? Palavi ?]
[? Mondi. ?] I'm a Loeb Fellow

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.760
at the Graduate School
of Design this year.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:00.260
Otherwise, I reside in the
world of cities and water,

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:03.200
be it climate change
or restoration

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.990
or [INAUDIBLE] systems.

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:08.990
So having follow
some of your work--

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:11.270
Sooni, I've obviously
seen the film--

01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:16.760
I'm very intrigued by the
dystropic view of Detroit.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.600
And I've only anecdotally
heard a lot around water

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.540
infrastructure and
how that intersects

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:28.880
with issues of people
living and the community.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.650
The real estate
interests sort of giving

01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:38.980
this brand of the Renaissance
and the white flight

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.840
into Detroit and really
issues around accountability

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.550
and how we actually ensure
that what happened in Flint

01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:54.670
doesn't become a phenomenon
that a lot of cities in the US

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.230
are just waiting to witness.

01:23:57.230 --> 01:24:01.060
So my question
really is if I ground

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.740
this discourse in the
field of resilience--

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:09.250
which is also becoming a
very hot discourse area

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:12.020
and how it intersects
with urbanism.

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:18.430
Sooni, since you mentioned
Mumbai and the opportunities

01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:23.770
even though there's no physical
space for these opportunities

01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:28.600
to play out in a conventional
sort of design, architecture,

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:36.390
or urbanism standpoint, I
wonder how we as a community,

01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:42.310
looking at cities from different
expertise or disciplines,

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:45.640
how we want to acknowledge
the opportunity

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:49.930
to tell the stories
that need to be told,

01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:52.780
sort of represent
realities in ways

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:58.600
that are not convenient or even
for that matter constructive?

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.240
And I really want to
open it up to whoever

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:08.620
wants to take a pass at how
can we tell the stories.

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:13.090
Not to just sort of make the
world be aware of realities,

01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:19.910
but address it in a way
that's universally applicable,

01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:24.230
but also challenging for
this discourse to inform us

01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:26.274
in how we want to move forward.

01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:36.740
- Well, if I
understood correctly,

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:39.730
it's always a
documentary's-- you know,

01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:43.840
we're often asked to be also
activists and to use our work

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.610
for a specific purpose.

01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:51.450
And we've always sort of
evaded sort of the agenda film

01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:56.620
and tying our movies
in a bow at the end.

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.600
There's a whole trend of
documentary filmmaking

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.016
where at the end
it's like, if you

01:26:00.016 --> 01:26:04.127
want to help, turn off your
faucet and turn off your light.

01:26:04.127 --> 01:26:05.460
These are the things you can do.

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.090
Go to this website,
and you can--

01:26:07.090 --> 01:26:08.870
and I think that's great.

01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:10.660
Our work's never fit
into those boxes.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.730
So sometimes we do reveal
inconvenient truths

01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:16.210
and don't offer solutions,
which can frustrate people.

01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:19.100
But what I think is
really important,

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.850
at least in my
medium, is to partner

01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:24.520
with organizations that have
the will and the resources

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.510
to make a curriculum.

01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:27.880
For example, several
of my films are taught

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.740
in schools and universities.

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:33.430
And we helped make a curriculum
or made it easy for people

01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:35.587
to make a curriculum in
Canada and elsewhere.

01:26:35.587 --> 01:26:36.670
How do we teach this film?

01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:38.950
How do we make your
film or your photograph

01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:42.040
into a tool for other people
who do have ideas, solutions,

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.670
and agendas?

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:47.500
So, for example, I made a
film called 12 &amp; Delaware

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.680
about the abortion battle--

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.110
it's on HBO this film--

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:55.330
raging on a street corner
in Fort Pierce, Florida.

01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:57.880
So on one side of the street,
there's an abortion clinic.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.940
On the other side
of the street, there

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:01.240
is a crisis pregnancy
center, which is basically

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.611
a fake abortion clinic.

01:27:02.611 --> 01:27:04.360
Women think they're
in an abortion clinic,

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.276
because they're getting
a free pregnancy test.

01:27:06.276 --> 01:27:07.814
But it's actually
a pro-life front

01:27:07.814 --> 01:27:09.730
where they will give an
ultrasound to the girl

01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:12.640
and tell her she'll get breast
cancer if she has an abortion

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.160
or tell her that she's not
as far along as she is.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.960
So by the time she
figures it out,

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.120
it's too late to get an
abortion in her state.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.040
So we got inside this crisis
pregnancy center and filmed.

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.230
And then we got inside
the abortion clinic.

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:28.900
And it's a character-driven film
about this one street corner

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:30.690
and the battle, the
abortion battle.

01:27:30.690 --> 01:27:33.190
Now, what we've done with that
film is when we were finished

01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:36.370
with it, we've allowed
NARAL and Planned Parenthood

01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:38.050
to use it for other events.

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:40.960
And as long as we don't
have great disagreements

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.840
with what they're doing with the
film, we happily hand it over.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.950
So I think that that is really
how we can get our messages out

01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:51.580
and also interpreted
by different people

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:54.430
in different ways, so that you
can actually reach more people

01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:59.260
and start using our work
for more concrete solutions.

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.740
- As one filmmaker said, if
you want to send a message,

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:05.140
go to UPS or FedEx.

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:08.320
And so I kind of agree with
that and kind of don't.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.060
Because after we
made Salaam Bombay!,

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:13.540
we started an organization
for street kids

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.600
called Salaam Trust that
is still very active

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.990
I don't know how
many years later.

01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:26.320
I think film is an easier
way to be an activist

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.570
than a still photographer.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.090
There have been
still photographers

01:28:30.090 --> 01:28:33.080
who have been activists and
who've been working for change.

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.980
But I don't think that
is my primary goal when

01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:37.120
I take photographs.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.240
I take photographs, because I'm
just obsessive about putting

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.972
frames around reality.

01:28:41.972 --> 01:28:42.680
I don't know why.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.830
I think I was born like that.

01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:46.840
But in the films
that I make, there's

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:50.020
definitely some food
for thought and hope

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.360
that things will change.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.950
- So we have one minute left.

01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:59.050
But these two people have been
very patiently standing online.

01:28:59.050 --> 01:29:02.380
Is there is there a way
for you to very quickly ask

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.794
your question?

01:29:03.794 --> 01:29:05.460
- I mean, I can ask
it as fast as I can.

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:08.160
- Yeah, as fast as
you possibly can.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:08.925
- Sure.

01:29:08.925 --> 01:29:12.160
Hi, thank you so much
for sharing your work.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.690
My question is about nostalgia.

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:17.620
I think in the films, it's very
clear when nostalgia comes up.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.780
I think with data,
it's less clear.

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:23.350
I'm interested in how data
talks about nostalgia.

01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:25.270
Does data talk about nostalgia?

01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:28.621
And I'm also curious
when we change

01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:30.370
cities, when we try
to be purposeful about

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:32.440
change, how do we use nostalgia?

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.490
Is it useful?

01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:37.150
And whose nostalgia do we use?

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:37.930
- In one minute.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.710
Well, that's a great question.

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:47.530
It's characteristic of the kinds
of more interesting questions

01:29:47.530 --> 01:29:49.690
that are being asked
about data today.

01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:51.580
And I guess the one
thing I could say

01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:55.510
is that nostalgia
is being looked at.

01:29:55.510 --> 01:30:02.550
But it's more how can
data and analytics operate

01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:04.330
on the objects of nostalgia?

01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:07.630
So it would be about
archives, looking at archives.

01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:11.590
And to what extent can it
reveal something or discover

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:15.940
correlations or relationships
which we don't already

01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:18.820
know about nostalgia--

01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:21.100
in one minute.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:23.500
- OK.

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.841
Were you-- did you
have more to say?

01:30:26.841 --> 01:30:27.340
- No.

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:27.840
I was not--

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:31.100
- If you can quantify nostalgia
with data, I mean, call me.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.206
I'd love to see that.

01:30:33.206 --> 01:30:35.080
I mean, I thought it
was interesting actually

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:39.530
looking at Angela's streetcar
map versus the subway map.

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:41.530
Something about
that, seeing them

01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:45.009
next to each other and all
that was lost when the street

01:30:45.009 --> 01:30:47.050
cars were removed from
those black neighborhoods,

01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:50.470
I actually surprisingly
found that effective.

01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:51.940
And that was just a graph.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.680
So, actually, I
think it's intriguing

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:57.800
the idea that you can move
people emotionally with data.

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.190
I think that's an
interesting Area

01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:02.860
- But I would also like to
conclude with an argument

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:04.630
for a very small data.

01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:08.980
Because humanists are very
good at close reading.

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:12.400
And so Heidi and I were
speaking about the title

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.010
of her film, Detropia.

01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:17.950
And for me, there are
all these associations

01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:23.350
that come out of just that one
term, like utopia, dystopia,

01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:28.900
cornucopia, detritus,
deteriorate, -opia,

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:34.660
hope, and I suppose
nostalgia as well.

01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.530
But so it feels as
though somehow our task

01:31:38.530 --> 01:31:43.870
is to balance vast sort of even
unimaginable quantities of data

01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:46.210
along with the incredible
importance of very

01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:47.470
small things.

01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:49.660
So let's conclude on that.

01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.400
Thank you to our
three presenters

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.690
for their wonderful talks.

01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:56.520
And thank you to you
for your attention.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.370
[APPLAUSE]
