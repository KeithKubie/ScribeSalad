00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.930
Consider the table
with function values

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.900
for f of x is equal
to 3 sine of 5x

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.620
over sine 2x at x values near 0.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.170
From the table,
what does the limit

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.240
as x approaches 0 of 3
sine of 5x over sine of 2x

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.520
appear to be?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.310
So what they have is they're
approaching 0 from below here.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.060
So first negative 0.1,
and f of x is 7.239550.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.160
Then we get even a
little bit closer to 0.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.720
x is negative 0.01.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.140
Once again, we're approaching
0 from values less than 0.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.490
And now we've gone
up to 7.497375.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.289
We get even a little bit closer
to 0, and we get to 7.499974.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.080
Now let's see what
happens as we approach 0

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.500
from above, from
values greater than 0.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.680
When x is 0.1, it's 7.239550,
actually the same as this value

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.830
right over here.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.440
When it is 0.01, it's
7.497375, actually

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.200
the same value as here.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.847
And once again,
when we're at 0.001,

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:03.680
so we're approaching
from above, from values

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.580
greater than 0, 7.499974.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.100
So this is an interesting thing.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.430
The limit in both cases
seems to be approaching,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.096
getting closer
and closer to 7.5.

00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:20.220
And so you could imagine
that this would be-- well,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.800
let's actually graph that just
to verify it for ourselves.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.150
So we could type in our answer
here and check our answer,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.130
and we got it right.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.030
But just to visualize
what that looks like,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.370
let's actually get our
graphing calculator.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.370
So I have the graph, just
to show you how I get here.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.610
So if I were to start
on the home screen,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.110
just press Graph,
define my function of x.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:59.180
And we could just write 3 sine
of 5x divided by sine of 2x.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.120
And then let me define my range.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.950
So, let's see.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.340
x, I want it to be-- yeah,
sure, I could make it around 0.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.229
And let's see, I'm
getting y values

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.300
that go up to-- let's
see, around 7 or 8.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.620
So I could make my y, let me
do a little bit of negative y

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.190
values.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.225
So let me start at
negative 1 for my y range,

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:22.052
and go all the way
up to, let's say 8.

00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:23.510
Because this doesn't
look like it's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.560
getting above 8, or
at least in the range

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.800
that we're talking about.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.287
And now let's graph this thing.

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:30.370
So let's see what it does.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.930
OK, so the graph is doing
all sorts of neat things,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.500
but then as we get
closer and closer to 0,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.520
as x gets closer and closer to
0 from the negative direction,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.920
we see that the function
is approaching 7.5.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.150
Likewise, when x is
getting closer and closer

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.740
to 0 from the
positive direction,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.820
the function seems to
be approaching 7.5.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.410
So you have this-- well, the
function isn't defined at 7.5,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.390
or it's pretty clear that when
you approach from both sides,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.920
you're getting there.
