00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.754
Some advice that I have for people who are learning how to code for the first

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:06.978
time is to not get frustrated or discouraged, especially, if you feel like

00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:10.306
people are ahead of you or have been coating for so long and your just starting

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:16.370
out and there's no way you can catch up. For me, when I first started coding,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.815
it was fall quarter freshman year of college and there have been people who've

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.101
been coding since they were six years old or, you know, in a variety of other

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:29.415
classes in their high schools. And I'd never coded before and felt pretty

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:34.144
insecure about my, my coding ability. I never had that, that confidence that I

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:39.000
could, you know, hack something out really quickly. But I stuck with it, and I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.756
think that's what made the difference. I was loving everything that I was

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:46.876
learning. I was motivated to go do extra credit or, you know, work on

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:52.838
assignments that weren't necessarily due for a certain class I was in. And

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:58.830
suddenly, two, three classes in, I felt like I was caught up. I felt like I

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.700
could find my niche within computer science, where I could be the best. I could

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.277
be the one who was teaching other people how to do things. And from there, it's

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:12.537
been an amazing transformation, in terms of how confident I in my coding

00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:14.330
ability.
