[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:08.262
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.700
EVAN RICH: All right.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.170
So thank you for having us.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.210
We're excited to be here.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
This is actually our second
Google cooking demonstration.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380
So for those of you who
haven't been to one,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.500
we have been to one.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.670
They're amazing, OK?

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.890
Yeah.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.590
So like you said,
we own Rich Table.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.890
We opened it about six and a
half, almost seven years ago.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.840
And it was just kind
of the restaurant

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.590
that we wanted to eat in and
the way that we wanted to dine.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.510
So we've spent our lives working
in these really fine dining

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.670
restaurants that are super
serious about food, got

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220
to get dressed up
to work in there,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.580
and we never really felt that
comfortable going to eat there.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.430
We loved cooking and thinking
about food in that way,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.300
but the dining style
was just not really us.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.450
I mean, I'm not the
most elegant person, OK?

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:04.900
SARAH RICH: What are
you talking about?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.250
EVAN RICH: But with Rich
Table, we opened it up,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.790
and it's more of a casual
kind of atmosphere, come

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.930
dressed how you are.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.820
We bought an old
barn in Petaluma

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.980
and put it all over the
walls, made tables out of it.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.770
And then we just kind
of cook what we crave.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.880
We like to say we cook
with our stomachs.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940
So we change our
menu pretty often.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.710
And anytime you
come in and see us,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.640
you'll see the stuff we've
eaten on our days off.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.490
So we'll do Korean stuff, we'll
do Chinese, we'll do French,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.640
we'll do Japanese,
whatever we kind of feel,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.130
and we'll just kind
of put our take on it.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.290
People ask us what kind
of restaurant it is,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.822
and we just say, we go to the
market, we see what's good,

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:46.280
we cook it, and
let our backgrounds

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.680
speak for themselves.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.590
Before we were open, that
was a really difficult thing

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.886
for people to grasp onto
when they asked, oh, you're

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:55.760
opening a restaurant,
what kind of restaurant

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.690
are you opening up?

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.030
And it was just kind
of like, I don't know--

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.690
SARAH RICH: Food restaurant.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.481
EVAN RICH: --we're
going to cook good food.

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:04.490
And they were like,
huh, interesting, OK.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.390
We'll have to check that out.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.240
SARAH RICH: PR
people don't really

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.544
like that kind of an answer.

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:11.162
EVAN RICH: Yeah.

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:12.620
So being in the
Bay Area, there are

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.750
a ton of vegetables,
ton of great products.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.090
So we try and keep things
as simple as possible,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.110
because it's real easy
to make delicious food.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.780
It's difficult to
keep it simple.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.630
We're chefs, so making
things really chefy

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.310
is pretty easy for us.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.290
But once you sit
down and eat it,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.927
it's kind of like, eh,
this is a little too much,

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:34.010
I'm not really getting it.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.980
So the challenge for
us is kind of embracing

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.170
what the farmers cook out
here, keeping it simple,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.420
but still making it
interesting enough

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.982
to have people come to our
restaurant every night.

00:02:43.982 --> 00:02:44.690
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.541
And I would say, listening to
all the really lovely things

00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:49.040
you had to say about
the restaurant,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.849
it made me think about
seven years ago when

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.890
we were trying to put this
idea together and open

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.510
this restaurant, we had no idea.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.220
You know, we had hopes
and dreams for it,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.280
but we had no idea that it
would become what it is.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.010
And we're really proud
and excited that we

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.920
have been able to
create this restaurant

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.460
that people really enjoy.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.190
And so the cookbook
itself really

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.650
tells the story of how we
created the restaurant.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.120
It's not just a book of recipes.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.990
It tells the story of how we
met in New York, fell in love,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.436
decided to take a chance on
California and move out here,

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.310
had a couple of kids
and opened a restaurant.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.880
So I think there's a lot in
there that you can read about

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.260
and really relate to as well.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.980
And so the recipes
in the book really

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.110
comprise the first maybe two or
three years that we were open.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.220
And in that period
of time, we were

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.612
drawing from a lot of
personal influences,

00:03:39.612 --> 00:03:41.570
whether it's restaurants
that we had worked in,

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.890
chefs we had worked with,
or family memories, which

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.840
is exactly where this
recipe came from.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.220
Evan's grandmother was
Austrian and would make

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.861
a big Austrian meal on Sundays.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.610
EVAN RICH: Sauerbraten
and potato pancakes

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.285
every other Sunday.

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:00.280
It was the most amazing.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.760
SARAH RICH: They would do
Sunday supper together.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.860
EVAN RICH: I was very
young so the sauerbraten

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.910
was a little weird to me.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.840
But the potato pancakes dressed
with butter, and sour cream,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.310
and applesauce were like--

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.200
I mean, I can
taste it right now,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.360
it's the most amazing thing.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.954
The funny thing
about the book is,

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:19.339
it took us about
three years to make.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.660
So realistically, 90% of
those recipes in the book, we

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.550
don't actually do at
the restaurant anymore.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.070
Because we take
versions of it and we're

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.760
always changing and evolving.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.850
And so people come in now
and they're like, hey,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.620
I want to try the
sweet potato pancake.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.180
We're like, well, we got version
12 of the potato pancake,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.680
how about you try this one?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.520
But I like to think of the book
as a tool for everyone else

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.020
to have some great ideas and
then put your own take on, put

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.990
your own spin on it.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.890
So the recipes are
really honed in

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.900
and the flavors are
nice and balanced.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.090
And it makes it easy for you
guys to execute this stuff.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.840
But as you'll see when
I make this recipe,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.214
we'll kind of give
you some ideas

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:03.410
of how to make it your own,
or how to put your spin on it,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.150
or how to just have fun with it.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.140
So everyone always asks,
oh, what recipe did you use,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.640
so-and-so?

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.780
And you're kind of like, I
don't know, we just kind of cook

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.154
and then we put
together recipes.

00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:16.920
So these are good
baselines for everyone

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.880
to put together a good
repertoire of fun things

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.770
you can cook at home.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.020
So today we're going to make
the sweet potato pancake.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.990
So my lovely wife over here
is going to start the potato

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.130
pancake, OK?

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.930
So my grandmother
used to make them

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.910
which just russet
potatoes, but today we're

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.535
going to make them
with sweet potatoes.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.060
So this is kind of
our version of it.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.780
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.470
So I don't know if
any of you have ever

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.260
made potato pancakes, or latkas,
or anything like that before,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.330
but it's basically
the same sort of idea

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.490
just using the sweet
potato instead.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.830
So it'll have a little bit,
obviously kind of a sweeter

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.250
flavor, not so potatoey?

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.100
I don't know, for a
lack of a better--

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.860
so I've just got a regular box
grater, which you probably all

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.150
have access to.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.800
And I've got my sweet potatoes.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.010
These were really
pretty gigantic ones.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.299
So they're cut smaller to
make it a little bit easier.

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:10.590
And I'm just going to grate it.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.329
Just be careful of your fingers.

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:18.370
EVAN RICH: So we're doing
it with sweet potatoes,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.460
but go to the market, see
what potatoes are available

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.880
and use those.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.990
So white potatoes,
little creamer potatoes,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.520
any kind of potato you want.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.660
And you can even go as far
as like, oh cool it's winter,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.910
they have a bunch of root
vegetables, I have kohlrabi,

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.380
I have radishes, I
have daikon radish.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.030
Something that kind of
looks like a root vegetable

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.460
like this, you can
make this cake with.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.587
So this is an ingredient you can
kind of mix and match and make

00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:49.420
it your own as well.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.210
With my grandmother's version,
she also did the potato

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.780
and then took a Vidalia onion
and grated it the same way

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.660
and mixed it all up, just
to bring another level

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.680
of sweetness to it.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.140
But with the sweet
potato, the sweetness

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.710
is there, so we excluded the
onion so it isn't overly sweet.

00:07:10.874 --> 00:07:11.790
SARAH RICH: All right.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.860
So I'm just going to throw
the sweet potato into a bowl.

00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:21.430
So I've got a couple of
things I'm going to add to it.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.910
I'm going to crack this egg
and just whisk it a little bit.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.400
EVAN RICH: And so right now,
you're almost making a batter.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.730
So if you just put this
into the pan alone,

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.687
you could slowly cook
it and the starches

00:07:41.687 --> 00:07:44.020
would help bring it together,
and it would kind of work.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.150
But to make this, we're trying
to make almost like a cake.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.310
So less of a crispy
potato pancake,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.540
but more of an actual
pancake with potatoes in it.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.504
SARAH RICH: So I
added some salt to it.

00:08:01.504 --> 00:08:03.920
Anytime you season something,
I don't know if you noticed,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.920
but I seasoned up
high and I seasoned

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.350
everything instead of just
throwing a big clump in there

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.940
and then going from there.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.220
You want to really try
to get your seasoning

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.860
all over the place so that
you can incorporate it really

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.725
evenly.

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:18.550
If you throw your big clump
in there and mix it up,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.370
you'll mix it in there, but
this is just a better way

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.500
to really incorporate it evenly.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.280
This is just a little
cream of tartar.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.420
And the egg.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.890
EVAN RICH: The cream of tartar
just helps stabilize the egg

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:39.530
and make it more of a
cohesive package, I guess.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.549
It's not that necessary, but
we just do it because we're--

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.250
SARAH RICH: Helps to keep the
egg from being super liquidy,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.210
I guess.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.890
And then this is wonder flour.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.260
So wonder flour is a
special kind of flour

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.010
that it doesn't clump the
way regular flour does.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.840
So it works really
nicely here so you

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.640
can avoid some of
that clumpyness

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.920
that you can get from flour.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.610
You can find it in pretty
much all grocery stores.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.470
It is really not hard to find.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.070
But if you don't find it and you
just want to use regular flour,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.904
you can do that too.

00:09:10.904 --> 00:09:12.403
EVAN RICH: So it's
the type of flour

00:09:12.403 --> 00:09:14.470
that you would get if
you're making gravy.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.150
And at the end, instead
of putting AP flour

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.864
in which will clump,
you put it in at the end

00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:23.030
and it thickens your gravy
up without having to make

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.610
a roux or anything like that.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.840
So it just helps absorb
and it doesn't clump up.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.655
SARAH RICH: What do
you think, more egg?

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.050
EVAN RICH: Yeah.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.213
Yeah, looks good.

00:09:35.213 --> 00:09:37.570
SARAH RICH: OK.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.320
I'm just checking.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.480
EVAN RICH: I'm the
sous-chef here,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.021
I don't know why
she's asking me, OK?

00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:41.780
[LAUGHS]

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.696
SARAH RICH: All right.

00:09:42.696 --> 00:09:44.233
So that's all mixed
really nicely.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:47.520
I don't know if you can see.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.230
So whenever you have
something like this

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.600
that it's got
something raw in it,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.570
whether it's a meatball or
hamburger, you've got raw meat

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.670
or you've got raw egg
and you don't really

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.400
want to taste it like this to
see if it's seasoned properly,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.110
you can just cook
a little bit of it

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.110
first and then taste it
yourself, see what you think.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.590
Add more salt if you
need, or not if you don't.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.360
EVAN RICH: OK.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.420
So with this dish,
with everything we do,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.530
there's a formula, right?

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.460
I'm sure with what
you do every day,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.670
you have a formula
of how to execute

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.000
things and stuff like that.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.440
So with our cooking, there are
a few formulas that we use.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.060
So one is flavor base.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.090
So sweet, salty, acidic,
and bitter, right?

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.600
So mixing these flavors
together in a dish

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.150
really help bring out
flavors, but there's also

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.010
a textural thing.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.700
So creamy, crunchy,
creamy and crunchy

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.280
are usually my
balance, and then just

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.240
kind of everywhere in between.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.280
So the potato kind of
has a mix of all that.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.460
But we're also going to
add another layer of it

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.760
with some potato chips, OK?

00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:00.170
So it just brings
another layer of flavor

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.470
and another layer of
complexity, right?

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.470
So part of making
dishes interesting

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.740
is bringing these
layers of complexity.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.220
And keeping it simple
is what we try and do,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.100
and texture brings
another layer.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.890
And the way that we're going
to cook these potato chips,

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.010
it just brings another
flavor to the sweet potato

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.800
that help elevate the dish.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.900
So I'm just slicing
these on the mandolin.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.580
So basically making sweet
potato chips, real simple.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.520
I mean, it's very easy.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.530
We've got a pot of
oil on the stove.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.372
That's probably about
low to medium high.

00:11:39.372 --> 00:11:40.330
SARAH RICH: 350, about.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.680
EVAN RICH: 350.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.350
You don't want to go too hot,
because it'll burn the chips.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.480
So sweet potatoes have
a lot of sugar in them,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.870
so too hot on the pan,
too hot in the frying oil

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.980
will burn them really quickly.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.480
So you want to go low and slow.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.020
And so the oil is
just barely bubbling

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.170
when I drop everything in there.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.830
And so it'll be perfect.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.570
So I just want to kind
of let them go real slow.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.170
They'll cook nice and evenly
and they won't really brown up.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.030
And there is a moment
when they're perfect,

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.330
and then two seconds later,
they're a little too dark.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.000
SARAH RICH: And I would say,
we give you a temperature guide

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.080
and we say about 350, but
just use your instinct.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.690
As you're cooking, if that
seems to be a little high,

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.220
depends on how much sugar
is in the actual potato,

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.290
they're all different.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.409
How thick you cut it, all of
those things can affect it.

00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:36.450
So just, maybe you need
to turn it down a little,

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.160
maybe you need to
turn it up a little.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.900
Don't just take our word
specifically exactly

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.880
to be right.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.255
EVAN RICH: And so
if you're going

00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:47.460
to make this specific
dish or a dish like it,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.043
these are something
you can definitely

00:12:49.043 --> 00:12:51.960
make ahead, put them on the
side, and just have them ready.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.244
Because a lot of the cooking
we do, you cook it to order

00:12:55.244 --> 00:12:56.160
and then you serve it.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.720
So something like
this, the potato

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.800
pancakes if you're
making this at home,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.841
you're going to want to
cook the potato pancakes,

00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:03.600
plate them up, serve
them, and eat them.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.820
You can make the potato pancakes
and reheat them in the oven.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.010
But the best way to do it
is to cook them, serve them.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.777
At my grandmother's
house on Sunday,

00:13:13.777 --> 00:13:15.360
my grandmother would
be in the kitchen

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.954
making the potato pancakes and
putting out batches, coming

00:13:18.954 --> 00:13:21.120
back, eating a little bit,
go back into the kitchen,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.450
cook some more potato pancakes.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.158
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:13:23.158 --> 00:13:25.399
EVAN RICH: So depending on
what you're trying to do

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.690
or how many people you're
cooking for, you kind of want

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.210
to just like, OK cool,
I'm going to cook these,

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.910
I'll have everything else
ready, and then we'll

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.845
plate everything up.

00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:35.220
SARAH RICH: But
you can also have

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.950
an oven on a low
temperature with a nice--

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.130
put a pan in there so the pan
gets warm, like a cookie sheet.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.659
And you can cook one,
two, three, four of these,

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:46.200
as you cook them
put them in the oven

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.400
so they stay nice and warm.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.080
You're not heating them,
you're not reheating them,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.790
you're just keeping
them nice and warm

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.320
and then plate them right
away and send them out.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.062
EVAN RICH: OK.

00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:55.770
So while she's getting
all the pans ready

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.436
and these are frying,
I'm going to start

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:58.650
making the salsa verde.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.480
And so salsa verde,
to me, is one

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.680
of these sauces that
I make very often

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.770
and a bunch of
different versions.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.090
One of the things we always
like to have on a dish

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.980
is something bright and fresh.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.030
And a salsa verde, to me, is
one of these things that's

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.620
just really light,
really bright,

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.180
and just brings a really,
really nice element to a dish.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.652
So you can make it a
bunch of different ways.

00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:28.110
But the way we
usually start it off

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.310
is with some
shallots and garlic.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:36.150
And so the texture in this
sauce is important to me,

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.690
so I don't want to mince
things up too much.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:44.550
In the cookbook, we tell you to
put it all into the Robot Coupe

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.940
and it works perfect.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.540
But when you do-- so that's
the Robot Coupe right there.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.870
So when you do it, you
just want to get everything

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:56.070
in and quickly pulse
it, like [VOCALIZING],,

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.010
and not break everything
down too soupy.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.030
So I like to do it by hand.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.700
And I think when we
made the cookbook,

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.741
we were just trying to
think about the people who

00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:05.860
are cooking at home.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.070
But if you're not
making too much of this

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.620
or cooking for too many
people, doing it by hand

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.600
is really easy.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.440
And it shouldn't be a problem.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.904
So I just mince
up some shallots.

00:15:15.904 --> 00:15:18.320
SARAH RICH: I'm going to stop
you while you're doing that.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.940
EVAN RICH: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.650
SARAH RICH: I'm going
to go ahead and start

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.550
cooking the pancakes.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.620
So I've got a little bit
of olive oil and butter

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.910
in the pan.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.210
I put the olive oil in
first, just to kind of--

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.430
I'm warming up the
olive oil, but it's also

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.309
keeping it kind of
a low temperature

00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:33.600
so that when I add the butter,
there's less of a chance

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.280
that I'm going to
burn the butter.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.842
I don't want to get
really color on it.

00:15:37.842 --> 00:15:40.050
That can be really good
flavor, but that's not really

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.790
the flavor I'm looking for here.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.440
But the flavor of the
olive oil and the butter

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.870
will be nice with the pancake.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:51.990
So I'm just going to put
some of the mixture in there,

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.070
adjust my temperature.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.740
A lot of cooking is really just
about adjusting temperature.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.100
You're constantly like, oh
it's getting a little too warm,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.240
it's browning on the edges.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.710
Or it's not warm enough, I need
to go up, I need to go down.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.980
Don't just turn on the stove and
walk away and say that's right.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.380
You're constantly
looking and adjusting.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.700
OK, back to you, Evan.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.100
EVAN RICH: And so for me
with this salsa verde, so

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.460
in my mind, salsa
verde is a raw sauce.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.900
So we do raw
shallot, raw garlic.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.420
And raw garlic in
it is really nice,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.170
because it just has this spice
and this kick to it that really

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.420
brings a nice element,
and it works really well

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.640
with this dish.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.680
And so in the cookbook,
there is an actual recipe.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.380
So I usually just throw
it together and taste it.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.974
So just read the recipe.

00:16:35.974 --> 00:16:36.682
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:38.316
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:38.316 --> 00:16:39.690
EVAN RICH: And
then for this one,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.790
we're going to do
some raw arugula.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.920
And so this just arugula
you can find anywhere.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.200
I suggest you go to the
market and you taste through

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.750
and find the spiciest one
that works really well.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.910
But we also make salsa
verdes with cilantro,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.390
we make it with kale,
we make it with cabbage.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.819
It's more of a way to use raw
green vegetables that help

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.711
bring a nice element to a dish.

00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:11.210
SARAH RICH: It's a
really nice sauce

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.575
to use on pretty much anything.

00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:13.699
EVAN RICH: Steak, potatoes.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.430
SARAH RICH: Steak,
chicken, vegetables.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.740
EVAN RICH: We actually just
put a new version of this dish

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.690
on the menu last night.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.730
And it's not a potato
pancake, but it's roasted

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.772
young potatoes that we
got at the market with a--

00:17:27.772 --> 00:17:28.979
SARAH RICH: It's really good.

00:17:28.979 --> 00:17:31.280
EVAN RICH: --sour cream
potato puree on the bottom,

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.610
a little salsa verde trout
roe, and then potato chips.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.670
So it's this, but kind of
taken apart and put together.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.165
The flavor is all the same.

00:17:39.165 --> 00:17:41.540
SARAH RICH: We have another
recipe in the cookbook that's

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.850
a roasted cauliflower
that's got a bone marrow

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.310
salsa verde and kumquats,
that's really nice too.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.940
EVAN RICH: And so you
want to chop it up nice

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.740
so it becomes a
nice sauce, but you

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.470
don't want to go too much,
because then all of a sudden it

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.980
turns into mulch and it starts
tasting like lawn clippings

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.040
and stuff like that.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.035
And the idea is--

00:18:00.035 --> 00:18:02.160
SARAH RICH: It's not the
flavor you're looking for.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.826
EVAN RICH: Yeah.

00:18:02.826 --> 00:18:05.660
Well the idea is, you're using
all this raw fresh ingredients,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.060
and you want to taste that
raw fresh ingredient, right?

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.750
Like, arugula is amazing, that's
why you put it on everything.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.580
But if you cook it,
the flavor goes away.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.640
If you chop it up too
much, it tastes like grass.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.014
And so you don't want
to chop it up too much,

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:20.930
but you want to chop it
up enough so that when

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.600
you add all the olive
oil and stuff like that,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.460
it comes together like a sauce.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.770
So then this other
green is parsley.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:32.390
And this just brings
a nice green flavor.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.750
So for me, parsley
is just this like,

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.037
when you say something green, I
think of the flavor of parsley.

00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:41.120
Actually one of the
restaurants I used to work at,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.990
we used to make a parsley sauce
that we would call chlorophyll.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.840
And it was just like,
we'd make it and then

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.739
incorporate it into all
these green purees that

00:18:49.739 --> 00:18:50.780
would just turn it green.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.730
And it was just
basically enhancing

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.530
that green flavor,
that green color,

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.280
and it just worked really well.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.010
So this helps the freshness
of the dish, to me.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.420
OK.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.260
So I have parsley, arugula,
shallots, and garlic.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.000
And then for this one, we're
going to add dried apricots.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.010
So dried apricots
are an ingredient

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.847
I really love to use.

00:19:14.847 --> 00:19:16.430
So we get them at
the farmer's market.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.530
And it's something that
they grow in California,

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.530
and they dry them out,
and it's a great product.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.462
And it also has this nostalgic
kind of feeling for me,

00:19:25.462 --> 00:19:27.170
because when we were
young, I don't know,

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.330
I used to eat dried apricots,
my mom would give them to me.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.241
SARAH RICH: You've got
mom and grandmom here.

00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:34.490
EVAN RICH: They'd be so proud.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.710
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.780
EVAN RICH: And it also brings
this really sweet acidic note

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.520
to the salsa verde.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.040
So the potato pancake
is really heavy,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.685
and sweet potatoes
are full of flavor.

00:19:51.685 --> 00:19:52.810
You want to pull those out?

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.211
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:56.460
EVAN RICH: And so you need
something to break that up.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.440
And this whole
sauce is the element

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.270
of the dish that's
going to break it up.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.090
And so in the cookbook, it
says to just throw these right

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.980
into the food processor
and kind of pulse them up

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.172
and it creates a nice
little dice for everything.

00:20:13.172 --> 00:20:13.880
And that's great.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.860
But cutting them by
hand, I like to leave

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.940
them a little bit bigger.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.690
Because when you're
eating the whole dish,

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.460
you want these nice little
pops of sweetness and acidity,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.820
and it really works nicely.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.620
So I don't really chop them
up, I just kind of dice them

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.520
smally.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.830
You having trouble with that?

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:34.538
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:20:34.538 --> 00:20:35.592
EVAN RICH: Yeah?

00:20:35.592 --> 00:20:36.765
SARAH RICH: There we go.

00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:38.390
It's only a million
people watching me.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.830
EVAN RICH: Yeah, right?

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.880
SPEAKER 1: Quick question
for the audience.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.530
So I'm curious, how
many people like

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.330
to cook at home, raise of hands?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.239
How many people cook at
home at least once a week?

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:47.780
Keep them up.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.089
Twice a week?

00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:49.880
Three times a week?

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.589
SARAH RICH: Nice.

00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:51.671
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:52.430
EVAN RICH: Wow.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.990
SPEAKER 1: I had a quick
story while they're there

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.440
cooking here.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.270
That before we opened
the teaching kitchens,

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.100
we actually had Googlers that
would never cook at home,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.499
and I'm sure it still happens.

00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:01.040
And we realized at
that point that we

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.498
should open some
teaching kitchens,

00:21:02.498 --> 00:21:05.120
because we were serving
you too much food.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.010
Keep up the great work.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.980
EVAN RICH: Well so, with
this potato pancake,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.170
it's important you
just go low and slow

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.930
and just kind of let
it all come together.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.530
So the potato itself
has so much sugar in it

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.340
that if the heat is too
high, it will start burning.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.770
But I don't know, I guess you
guys can't-- a little bit,

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.730
but it's just nice
and caramelized here.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:32.120
And you want it to go slow
so that the potatoes cook

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.870
and everything comes together.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.500
But if you go too high,
it'll start burning.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.500
The dark flavor is good.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.196
So you can go a little higher
and get it a little darker.

00:21:42.196 --> 00:21:44.570
And that's that bitter element
that you want in the dish.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.100
But going too fast
and too far, it

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.070
will just start tasting burnt,
and that's not what you want.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.870
OK.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:57.440
So I have my diced apricot,
parsley, arugula, garlic,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.257
and shallot.

00:21:58.257 --> 00:22:00.590
And then I'm basically just
going to put it into a bowl.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.500
And so we've done this
with dried cherries,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.940
you can do it with raisins.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.010
Whatever you're-- this
is the basic formula.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:20.500
So we have nice fresh, a
little bitter from the garlic,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.600
and the onion, the arugula,
everything comes together.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.150
And then that dried
fruit just helps

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.224
create a nice, bright,
acidic note to it.

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.390
And so I'm just going to
add some extra virgin olive

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.600
oil to it.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.710
So at the restaurant, we only
use California olive oil.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.550
So I like to think of it as,
the Italians flood the market

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.330
with really crappy olive oil.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.910
But then Californians
really grow

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.350
some passionate,
beautiful olive oil.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.550
So we just go to the
market and we find some.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.750
We actually use one that we get
at the ferry building, Sciabica

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.860
and Sons, and they make a
great extra virgin olive

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.060
oil that's called Sevillano.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.465
We only use two olive
oils at the restaurant,

00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:01.880
so the Sevillano
and then they make

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.430
another one called 8020, which
is kind of a cooking olive

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.130
oil that is like
a second pressing,

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.970
so the smoke point
is a lot higher.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.800
And that's the only oil that
we use at the restaurant.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.150
OK, so I added just enough
olive oil to make it a sauce.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.360
And this is actually
better when you make it

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.086
a little bit further ahead.

00:23:22.086 --> 00:23:23.960
Because you want everything
to meld together,

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.354
you want it to marinate,
you want it to sit.

00:23:26.354 --> 00:23:28.020
You don't want to
make it too far ahead,

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.010
because the color
will start to go away

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.870
and it won't be so
bright and fresh.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.620
But definitely make it--

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.080
chips and this, make
it an hour or so ahead,

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.140
put it aside, and then have
your party or do whatever,

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.475
and then make your stuff.

00:23:45.475 --> 00:23:46.240
You all right?

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.599
SARAH RICH: Mm-hmm.

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:48.956
It's amazing.

00:23:48.956 --> 00:23:50.830
EVAN RICH: And then it's
not in the cookbook,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.160
but depending on what the
dried apricots taste like,

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.720
or whatever you're
putting in there,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.570
I always like to put a
little bit of acid in there.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.060
So champagne vinegar is
one of these vinegars

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.480
that's super strong acidity.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.370
So rice wine vinegar is a little
less acidic and more sweet.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.430
Sherry vinegar is a little
sweeter with less acidity.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.850
And I just find that champagne
has the brightest note,

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.620
so you don't have
to put so much in

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.380
and it just gives a
nice pop of acidity,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.850
which helps break up the
richness of the whole potato

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.314
pancake.

00:24:26.314 --> 00:24:28.480
So I'm just going to put a
couple of drops in there,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.409
mix it up, add a
little salt. And you

00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:34.450
have to be careful, as
soon as you add that acid,

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.780
it'll start turning
the green brown.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.580
And so not adding
it too far ahead,

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.800
or just adding it to order, is
probably the best way to do it.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.770
So it'll sit here for maybe an
hour or two and it'll be fine,

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:52.350
but after that, it'll
start turning the green,

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.100
turning the arugula
and the parsley brown.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.040
Which you don't want, because
it'll just ruin the flavor.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.299
OK, so that's good,
that's ready to go.

00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:01.840
We'll just let that
marinate while we

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.060
take on the rest of the dish.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.004
So while Sarah's
finishing up the--

00:25:07.004 --> 00:25:09.170
SARAH RICH: I'm just going
to go right on the plate.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.510
EVAN RICH: OK.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:14.830
And so this is a dish
that speaks to right now.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:19.420
So right now, the season
is cold and rainy.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.130
So sweet potatoes-- vegetables
become sweet in the winter

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.420
because they protect
themselves from freezing

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:33.520
by creating glucose
in themselves,

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.990
which is sweet to us.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.730
So at night when it's super
cold, they don't freeze.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.240
And so the sweet potatoes
are great this time of year.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.950
And then also,
with all the rain,

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.110
all these green vegetables
are starting to come up.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.070
So this is part of a family
called brassica, which

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.450
is like my favorite vegetable.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:54.070
So cauliflower, broccoli,
cabbage, Brussels sprouts,

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.410
and they just have this
great sweet flavor.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.370
So I love sweet vegetables.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.020
And sprouting broccoli is--

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.560
I guess you kind of think
of this as a bitter green,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.550
but actually this time
of year it's super sweet,

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.750
and it is really great.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.110
So any type of sprouting
broccoli or sprouting vegetable

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:19.070
like this will really
work for this dish.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.910
So we just do this real simple.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.050
We take some boiling
water and some salt.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.454
And so when you're cooking
green vegetables, the key--

00:26:30.454 --> 00:26:31.870
so when you're in
culinary school,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.580
they teach you, large amounts
of salted boiling water.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.590
Large amounts of
salted boiling water.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.780
So with green vegetables,
the object of cooking them

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.050
is to make them tender
and get them ready to eat.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.380
But if you put too many in
a pot-- so when they cook,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.110
they admit some kind of acid.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.830
I forget the exact name of it.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.680
But if they're too
much in the pot,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.830
the acid drips back in and
that turns the vegetable brown.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.710
Or if you put a lid on
it, the acid drips back in

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.250
and it turns the
vegetable brown.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:06.080
So you want to cook them
as quick as possible,

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.757
so that's where the rolling
salted water comes in.

00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:10.840
So the salt brings the
temperature up a little bit

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.720
and it makes the water
a little bit hotter

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.750
than it would without the salt.
And just drop the vegetables in

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.560
and let them cook
really quickly.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.980
So normally, if you're not
going to use them right away,

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.290
you would have an ice
bath and cool them down.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.915
But we're going to
use them right away,

00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:30.730
and I'm going to take
it the next step that's

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.150
not in the cookbook.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.950
So in the cookbook, it tells
you to just blanch them and then

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.360
dress them with the
salsa verde and serve it.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.380
But today, we're going to take
it another step just to show

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.369
you how to step your game up.

00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:48.410
SARAH RICH: And I'm
seasoning a little extra salt

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.700
on top of the pancake when
it came out of the pan,

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.235
just so that it seasons
it a little bit more.

00:27:56.235 --> 00:27:57.110
EVAN RICH: All right.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.290
So you want to cook them tender.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.610
You don't want to cook them
too much, because they'll be--

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.215
a little texture
with your vegetable

00:28:05.215 --> 00:28:07.090
is actually delicious.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.850
So just a little bit
of olive oil in a pan.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.550
So what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to take them out of this

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.840
and put them right into this.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.552
And this is just going to
bring a little bit more flavor.

00:28:17.552 --> 00:28:18.260
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.700
EVAN RICH: So brassicas,
sprouting broccoli

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.130
or whatever it is, a little
caramelization on them

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.160
really brings out the sweetness
and it tastes really great.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.650
That's why if you eat
fried Brussels sprouts,

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:30.460
they're so amazing.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.770
Because they just have
that caramelized flavor

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.420
because all that
sweetness comes out

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.700
and it's just really amazing.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.790
So if you learn that
and you figure out

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.160
with brassicas you can just
caramelize them a little bit

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.340
and they elevate that
flavor to the next level,

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.180
it's super easy.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.610
So eating them
like this is great.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.640
They taste delicious
and they're fine.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:57.710
But I'm just going to take
them out of the water.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.920
You don't want to get too
much moisture in that pan,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.600
because it'll flame up or--

00:29:06.902 --> 00:29:08.860
SARAH RICH: And he's not
cooking it in the pan,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.910
he cooked it in here.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.446
He's just wanting to get
a little caramelization

00:29:11.446 --> 00:29:12.160
over there.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.076
EVAN RICH: That's why I
want to go pretty hot.

00:29:15.294 --> 00:29:17.252
SARAH RICH: He wants to
go as fast as possible.

00:29:17.252 --> 00:29:24.720
EVAN RICH: And I want
to go in a hot pan

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.170
and just help bring
it to the next level.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.830
Just caramelize it
just a touch just

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.770
to help bring out some of that
sweetness of the vegetable.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.100
Cook them a little
bit further and make

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.510
them even more delicious.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.840
Sorry.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.790
All right, so we're
going to start

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.960
creating this dish for you.

00:29:51.116 --> 00:29:52.092
Sour cream?

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.770
So for me, eating
the potato pancakes,

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.490
I always dreamt sour cream, and
applesauce, and tons of butter.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.199
And so we try and be
a little bit lighter,

00:30:07.199 --> 00:30:09.490
where there's olive oil, and
fresh vegetables and stuff

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.070
like that, and kind of
think about it a little bit

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.010
differently.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.040
So I put a little
bit of the sour cream

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.730
on it, just because that element
of creaminess and richness

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.450
really helps with the
way the dish eats.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.730
But if you want to
do a little butter

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.620
or if you want to omit
this all together,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.470
there's plenty of fat
from the olive oil.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.470
So right there, you
see there's just

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.200
a little bit of
caramelization on everything.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.790
And it almost looks
like it's burning,

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.060
but that's bringing a
lot of flavor to it, OK?

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.710
So I'm just going
to turn that down.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.890
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.740
I would say generally speaking,
when you're browning things,

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.674
you want to take it further than
you really think that you do.

00:30:48.674 --> 00:30:50.590
People tend to get really
nervous that they're

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.690
going to burn things.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.290
But that dark flavor is
what is really delicious.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.730
So be adventurous, take
it a little further.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:05.840
EVAN RICH: OK, so
with this broccoli,

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.800
the way we like to serve it is I
like to dress it with the salsa

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.310
verde, just because
it helps incorporate

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.210
that flavor of the salsa
verde with everything.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.080
And spread it out.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.700
And so just real simple,
right out of the pan, and I

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.440
just dress it up a little bit.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.500
It just kind of helps bring
everything to another place.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.710
SARAH RICH: And it helps the
whole dish come together.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.640
So instead of having a
pancake, and some broccoli,

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.750
and some salsa verde, you're
eating them all together.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.020
EVAN RICH: And so this, if
you also have a nice big pan,

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.290
this is a great dish to do
family style where you can just

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.950
make a bunch of small
pancakes or a big pancake

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.400
and put it on a big plate and
have a pile of green vegetables

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.060
on it.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.170
Sauce the salsa verde, and
it works out really well.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.964
But it's also great individual.

00:32:11.964 --> 00:32:13.880
And so I'm just going
to put a little bit more

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.280
of the salsa verde on there.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:21.740
And then this is the next
layer of texture in there.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.050
So if you think about what's
going on in this dish,

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.850
there's a ton of
texture, there's

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.220
a ton of flavor going on.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.991
But it's all very simple
and straightforward.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.915
And then I always like to
finish with some fresh greens.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.310
And it's all the same flavors.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:45.240
We're kind of just layering all
these flavors from this dish

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.880
onto the same kind of platform.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.970
But it's just different
layers of flavor,

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.152
different layers of texture.

00:32:52.152 --> 00:32:53.610
SARAH RICH: Sometimes
at the market

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.440
you can get the
flowering broccoli,

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.086
you can actually
get the flowers.

00:32:57.086 --> 00:32:59.460
And those are edible, and you
can put those on the plate,

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.090
and that's really pretty.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:00.660
They're really bright yellow.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.640
EVAN RICH: It's coming up
really soon when you can

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.930
get all that flowering stuff.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.800
Because in the
winter, the rain comes

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.590
and it makes all those
beautiful green vegetables,

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:11.430
and sprouting.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.470
And right at the end
of winter, that's

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:14.845
when everything
starts flowering.

00:33:14.845 --> 00:33:16.685
SARAH RICH: It's called spring.

00:33:16.685 --> 00:33:18.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:20.430
Sorry.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.930
EVAN RICH: But it's
coming up very soon.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.117
And actually, people get
a little nervous about it.

00:33:28.117 --> 00:33:29.700
At the market, you'll
go to the market

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.340
and see all these bunches
of like sprouting broccoli,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.300
but they'll have all
the flowers in it.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.049
It's one of my favorite
times of the year,

00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:38.610
because it's such a
sweet lovely flavor.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:42.360
And at the end you
can put a couple on,

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.860
but you can also saute it up.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.660
And it's just a really
beautiful thing to cook.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.796
And so then, just a
couple leaves of parsley.

00:33:52.796 --> 00:33:56.660
SARAH RICH: It's beautiful.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.020
EVAN RICH: And if you
really think about it,

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.540
this represents
winter right now.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.350
So it's like this
orange, this green.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.659
This to me is winter
in the Bay Area.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:11.780
This is something I
would love to eat,

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.170
and it's kind of a
soul warming thing.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.870
Where winter in the Bay
Area isn't this really heavy

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:22.130
overwhelming, but it's cold,
but it's green, it's wet,

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:23.179
it's fresh.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.820
And this is like, to
me, all the flavors

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.880
and the feeling of winter.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.119
SARAH RICH: And you know
what, it's totally vegetarian.

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:34.940
Not necessarily everybody
eats vegetarian,

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.040
but I think people
try to eat less meat,

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.199
or look for different
ways to eat vegetables.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:44.420
Not just a salad,
or some stir fry.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.670
This is another
really interesting way

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.719
to eat vegetables.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.909
SPEAKER 1: We have a lot
of chefs in our program

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:51.409
here that are really
trying to focus

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.630
on making vegetables as
craveable and desirable

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.277
as possible.

00:34:54.277 --> 00:34:56.360
And just to highlight some
of the things you said,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.735
you've got beautiful colors,
because we eat with our eyes

00:34:58.735 --> 00:34:59.510
first.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.602
You've got amazing
contrast in texture.

00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:02.435
Obviously the aroma.

00:35:02.435 --> 00:35:04.220
Can you smell this in the back?

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.110
You're going to
taste it a minute.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.730
The aroma, the
textures, the color,

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.590
all these different
attributes are just

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.170
amazing to be able to have
something, as you put it,

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.150
so desirable and
highlight the vegetable.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.330
And for people that
want to put meat

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.970
on top of it, of course
you probably could.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.560
Why would you?

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.710
But that's just beautiful.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.085
Huge round of
applause, everyone.

00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:22.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.270
So we are going to open this
up to a few minutes of Q&amp;A. I

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.350
have the first question.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.700
So if you have questions,
just raise your hand.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.022
And then I'll ask the chefs
to repeat the question out.

00:35:37.022 --> 00:35:38.480
So you mentioned
you have children,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.580
and I don't know
how old they are.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.270
But I'm interested in your
current or future approach

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.030
to how you're going to engage
your children with food.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:49.510
And the reason I answer
that is, probably

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.070
many mothers and
fathers in the room,

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.794
but we went through
a long time where

00:35:53.794 --> 00:35:55.960
parents had to go back to
work, and it was very hard

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.540
for them to be able to
cook with their kids.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.420
There's nothing harder than
being chefs, and restaurateurs,

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.710
and cookbook authors.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.552
How are you going to
factor that in to be

00:36:04.552 --> 00:36:05.760
able to expose your children?

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.780
Or are you going to be like,
kids, stay out of the kitchen,

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.821
find your own profession?

00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:09.940
EVAN RICH: No, no.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.664
They've got a job waiting
for them washing dishes, OK?

00:36:12.664 --> 00:36:13.830
SARAH RICH: They can't wait.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.050
EVAN RICH: They're
waiting, just waiting.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.190
I'll let her go into it.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.770
But from my view of it,
I mean, everyone always,

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.530
my kids will never cook, no way,
I'm going to push them away.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.530
I mean, I really love
what I do and I enjoy it.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.540
I'm not going to push
my kids to do what I do.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.300
But if they're
interested in it, I'm

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.070
definitely going to
be excited and help

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.670
them navigate through
and develop themselves

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:43.180
as people who have a great
career and push through it.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.020
SARAH RICH: So we have two
boys, they're seven and four.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.600
And everybody always says,
oh, you guys are chefs,

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.550
your kids must eat so well.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.511
They must be so adventurous
with their eating.

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:54.010
No.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.250
They are children, they are
picky just like all children.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.470
EVAN RICH: They are adventurous
with the dino nuggets.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.840
SARAH RICH: Yeah.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.440
So I guess the approach
has really been,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.050
there are times where I
cook more adventurous stuff

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.517
and I expect that
they at least try.

00:37:08.517 --> 00:37:10.225
And there are other
times where, yeah, we

00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:12.980
eat dino nuggets, or
soup, or whatever.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.520
But the thing that
we really have found

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.630
is that if you involve them
in the process of cooking,

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.820
they are much more
likely to eat it.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.900
They get excited about being a
part of doing that, of helping

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.760
you, of having a task.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.510
It makes them feel
confident and excited to be

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.710
helping mommy or daddy.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.687
And then they're much more
interested in eating the food.

00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:38.020
EVAN RICH: I have a tendency
to cook a lot of vegetables

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.228
when I'm home cooking, just
because at the restaurant

00:37:40.228 --> 00:37:41.830
I eat pastas and steak.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.380
You know, I'm tasting
all this stuff.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.921
And when I come home
for the weekend,

00:37:44.921 --> 00:37:46.379
I usually cook
really light stuff

00:37:46.379 --> 00:37:47.920
that we've just
gotten at the market.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.790
And one day I made this
cauliflower vegan salad, kind

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.370
of roasted, blah, blah, blah.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.110
And I had both of the kids
with me the whole time

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.380
cutting tomatoes, or cutting
the onions, and doing this.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.760
And it's a dish that
normal kids and my kids

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.400
included would like, [GROANS].

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.870
But incorporating them into
the cooking process of it,

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.609
they were so excited, and they
ate like, three bowls of it.

00:38:11.609 --> 00:38:12.400
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.350
Yeah, that's great.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.308
How many people here have
kids and involve them

00:38:15.308 --> 00:38:16.810
in the kitchen?

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:17.560
Awesome.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.960
So any questions
from the audience?

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.880
I can keep going, but
I want to open this up.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.474
Yes, in the back?

00:38:23.474 --> 00:38:25.890
AUDIENCE: You did the thing
with the [INAUDIBLE] broccoli.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:26.190
EVAN RICH: Uh-huh.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.690
AUDIENCE: I'm really
curious how you

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.240
do that with Brussels sprouts.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:29.990
It's hard to get--

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.850
I mean, do you get really
young Brussels sprouts then?

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.350
EVAN RICH: I mean, you can get
just regular Brussels sprouts

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.220
and do it the same way.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.750
There's a great farmer at the
market called [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.130
and they have Brussels sprouts.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.740
And they're big, they
seem almost bigger

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.290
than you would think
Brussels sprouts should be.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.020
And if you blanch them
real quick and just sear

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.360
them just like that,
maybe take the whole thing

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.924
and cut them in half and blanch
them and then sear them--

00:38:55.924 --> 00:38:57.340
actually in the
cookbook, there is

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.200
a recipe for a
Brussels sprout Caesar

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.460
that we do at the restaurant.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.190
And we just take Brussels
sprouts, cut them in half,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.830
and then put them in a
pan with the face down

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.120
and slow cook them.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.370
And we put a lid on it to
help get everything going,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.660
and the sweetness
comes out really well.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.170
SARAH RICH: Also to create a
lot of that caramelization,

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.980
getting a lot more surface area.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.940
So if you just take the Brussels
sprout and you can shave it,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.270
you can use a mandolin, just
like the mandolin like this

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.990
to shave it.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.490
Or you can cut it
up really thinly,

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.100
and then you have
a lot more that you

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.470
can get touching the pan
that you can caramelize it.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.970
I do that sometimes,
that works too.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:34.962
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:34.962 --> 00:39:36.624
SARAH RICH: Mm-hmm.

00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:37.790
SPEAKER 1: Again, fire away.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.180
So another quick question
till the next hand goes up.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.763
So in the book, you
mentioned that you

00:39:41.763 --> 00:39:44.290
wanted Rich Table to really
be an extension of your home.

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.020
A couple of questions would be,
why was that important to you?

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.880
And then, what elements
in the restaurant

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.670
have you done to actually
bring that to life?

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.079
EVAN RICH: Well, I think
Rich Table is our home.

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:56.620
SARAH RICH: We're
there all the time.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.550
SPEAKER 1: Fair.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.200
EVAN RICH: So we opened the
restaurant because this is what

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.850
we've-- we've done
this our whole life.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:08.776
I've never had any other
job other than cooking.

00:40:08.776 --> 00:40:12.220
In some form or another, cooking
or in a restaurant, that's all

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.220
I've ever done.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.430
So that's the only thing
that I know how to do.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.490
And in the restaurant
business, you work a lot.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.610
So we met working,
she was my boss.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.670
We've built this
world for ourselves,

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.700
that the restaurant is our home.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.610
Not only just an extension
of it, but it is our home.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.540
And we wanted you to come
in and feel the warmth,

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:39.700
and be able to communicate, be
able to interact, be able to--

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.900
we work the pass or work in the
kitchen, but we deliver food,

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.090
and we talked to guests,
and the kitchen's open.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.540
And it's extension of our
home because the people

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.510
we work with, we spend
a lot of time with.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.180
We have great relationships
with our whole team.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.550
And this is literally
part of our life.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.150
So we wanted that
feeling when you come in.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.820
And I think, it wasn't so much
building different elements,

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:09.159
it was more the people we work
with, the style of food we do,

00:41:09.159 --> 00:41:11.200
the style of service, and
the style of restaurant

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.420
is just you come in and you
feel like you're coming to it.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.250
A lot of the dishes we
do at the restaurant

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.350
are things we've cooked
at home for dinner

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.592
that we then develop into a dish
that we cook at the restaurant.

00:41:23.592 --> 00:41:24.550
SPEAKER 1: I love that.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.252
There's so many places
you can go to eat

00:41:26.252 --> 00:41:27.460
and choices you need to make.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.237
And the why behind what they
do I think is so important.

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:32.320
So thank you for sharing
that, it's very personal.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.487
We had a question in the
back and then in the front.

00:41:34.487 --> 00:41:35.111
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:35.111 --> 00:41:36.730
You talked about
going into the market

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.290
and seeing what
looks really fresh.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.500
Especially for those of us
we come home after a long day

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.830
or it's a busy weekend, what's
a good approach to walking

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:46.390
into a market and
saying, OK, I'm

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.890
going to make a new
recipe from what

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.306
I see here that
looks really good,

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:50.740
especially if we're in a rush?

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.590
EVAN RICH: Well, so
keeping it simple, right?

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.759
So I mean, it's easy
for me to be like,

00:41:56.759 --> 00:41:59.050
oh, just go to the market,
see what's good and cook it.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:02.890
But really, if you
went to a market

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.600
and saw a bunch of
greens, it's like,

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.890
cool, I'm going to steam
rice, blanch them, saute them,

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.860
season them with a little
shoyu and toasted sesame

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:12.940
and put it over rice.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.190
I mean to me, that's delicious.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:17.980
And the more experience you have
cooking those type of things

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.162
at home, and just
feeling comfortable,

00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:21.620
I know how to cook
beets, I'm going

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.860
to get a bunch of beets
and maybe just mess

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.180
around a little bit.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.720
The reason why we do what
we do is just experience,

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.130
like flavor building, technique
in cooking, memories we have.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:36.169
And we just build
these things together

00:42:36.169 --> 00:42:37.210
and what they experience.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:41.050
So going to the market, it
might be a little difficult

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.710
or daunting at first.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.790
But it's like, just
keep it simple.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:46.540
The food you're going
to get at the market

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.130
is delicious no matter what.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:52.570
So a baby cabbage that
you just sear and put

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.190
a little vinaigrette
on, that's great.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.690
SARAH RICH: I think
all of that goes

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.960
back to what he talked about
at the beginning in terms

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.110
of, we think a lot about
acid, and sweetness,

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:05.050
and bitterness, and texture.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.690
Like the example
of the rice dish,

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.150
the rice is sort of
a creamy nuttyness.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.650
You've got the
greens on top, you've

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.770
got the saltiness
from the soy sauce.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:17.920
You've got something a little
crunchy, the sesame is crunchy.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.170
So if you think in
those terms, what

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:22.300
is a texture that I
can bring to this?

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.800
It doesn't have
to be complicated.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.040
You're more building on these
basic flavors and ideas.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.710
EVAN RICH: Yeah.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.060
You build your equation
in your head of the things

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.260
you like to eat.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.450
And then it's like,
cool, instead of broccoli

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.420
I can get collard greens.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.520
Instead of this I can get that.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.162
And just think about
the different things.

00:43:41.162 --> 00:43:42.870
SARAH RICH: And it's
trial and error too.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:43.994
You will make things that--

00:43:43.994 --> 00:43:44.640
I mean, we do.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.690
We make things that
we're like, huh--

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.210
EVAN RICH: I've never made
anything that tasted bad.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.827
SARAH RICH: --that wasn't great.

00:43:47.827 --> 00:43:49.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.989
EVAN RICH: I've never
over-cooked anything.

00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:54.030
SARAH RICH: I do the same
thing with dessert too.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.040
I think about dessert
in the exact same terms.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.080
I think about texture,
I think about acidity,

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.660
I think about saltiness.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.020
All of those things
go into what make--

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.510
whether it be savory
or sweet, balanced,

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.277
and whole, and delicious.

00:44:09.277 --> 00:44:11.610
SPEAKER 1: I want to highlight
the approach that they're

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.200
using when they're
going to the market

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.210
and realizing what's out
there to build their menu.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.280
Very similar to your question,
because not all chefs

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:17.905
think that way.

00:44:17.905 --> 00:44:20.155
A lot of chefs say, I want
to put this, this, and that

00:44:20.155 --> 00:44:21.696
on the menu because
it would be good.

00:44:21.696 --> 00:44:24.113
But it may not be in the market,
may not be at its height.

00:44:24.113 --> 00:44:26.279
So I appreciate that question,
because you're really

00:44:26.279 --> 00:44:27.720
supporting all
those great farmers

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.340
and suppliers that are out there
with the best that's out there.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.250
I think chef made a great
point, keep it simple.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.300
Because you don't want to come
back with 16 bags of stuff

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.591
if you're only cooking for two.

00:44:35.591 --> 00:44:37.010
So good tip.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.510
Yes?

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:38.093
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:38.093 --> 00:44:39.592
So many of us have
heard how hard

00:44:39.592 --> 00:44:42.150
it is to be a chef in a
restaurant and in kitchens.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.692
What kind of culture do you like
to instill in your kitchen--

00:44:44.692 --> 00:44:45.524
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:45.524 --> 00:44:46.720
SPEAKER 1: Culture, love it.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.980
EVAN RICH: I scream at everyone
and demean them to the-- no.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.510
So that's an extension
of what I was

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.010
talking about about our home.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:57.820
So it's like, the
cooks, I probably

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.670
see the cooks more
than I see my kids.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:03.400
I mean, my kids just learned who
I was maybe a year and a half

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.180
ago.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.590
They thought I was the grumpy
guy who slept in the back room.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:13.489
So it's important to
have a culture that--

00:45:13.489 --> 00:45:14.530
so it's a balance, right?

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:17.740
So there is a level of
professionalism, drive,

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.660
motivation, and intensity.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.690
Because we take our
jobs very serious.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:25.540
Being a cook in our restaurant
is not a sustainable job.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.550
You don't take a cook job
and you're like, cool,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.841
I've got the best job and
this is what I'm going to do.

00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:33.430
It's, I've taken this job
so I can learn, grow, build,

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:37.480
move on, so that I can
find my path as a chef.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.310
And so there is a
level of intensity.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.530
I don't want to say
there's yelling,

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.480
but there is definitely
very straightforward

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.180
blunt conversations of like,
do it like this, I don't care,

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.620
don't talk, go.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.230
Because in the kitchen,
it moves very quickly.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:58.399
When we're cooking for the
guests who are there, it's not,

00:45:58.399 --> 00:45:59.440
cool, we have 20 minutes.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.120
Re-do that, let's
think about this.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.350
It's, hey, this dish is
up, there paying for it,

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.400
let's go, it needs to be right.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.520
There is a level of that where
demeaning someone, or talking

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.197
down, or being a
yeller is horrible.

00:46:13.197 --> 00:46:15.280
It's like, I don't want
that, I don't need someone

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.760
talking to me like that.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.750
I take the approach of,
I talk to people the way

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:20.950
I want to be talked to.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.370
And we have a great environment,
I have a great relationship

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:25.540
with all of our cooks.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.070
SARAH RICH: We've
also both worked

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:30.190
in those kitchens where
people are screaming,

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:34.150
people are mean to each other,
people sabotage each other.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:37.820
It's cutthroat, everybody's
out for everybody else's job.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:42.760
And that's not what we want
our kitchen to feel like.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.710
And like Evan says,
it's very fast paced,

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:47.530
sometimes you have to
be short with people,

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.360
there's not time to mess around.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.890
But I think that
aside, I think we have

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.310
created a really nice culture.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.160
We want our team to
feel like a team,

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.890
we want them to feel like
they're working together.

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:00.880
They're not working
against each other.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.629
EVAN RICH: We put a
lot of energy into it.

00:47:02.629 --> 00:47:07.060
Because the longer people
stay, the better you can build.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:10.990
I always say to every new cook
who comes in or new person,

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.920
this is the circle.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.830
If we live in here, we're
joking around, we're having fun,

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.350
we're doing what we need to
do, everyone's progressing--

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.810
SARAH RICH: And as a
diner, you can sense that,

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:22.330
and you can taste that,
and you can feel that.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.000
I'm sure you have been to
restaurants where you walk in--

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.160
I know I have--

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.910
and you see the kitchen
and they're like--

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.315
EVAN RICH: Just feel the stress.

00:47:29.315 --> 00:47:30.940
SARAH RICH: They're
scared that they're

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.981
going to get screamed at.

00:47:31.981 --> 00:47:35.740
You see the servers who look
like they hate their lives.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.960
A guest can feel
that and taste it.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.044
And you don't want to
create that for anyone.

00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:41.710
EVAN RICH: Yeah.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.720
I mean, I've actually
learned over the years

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.230
that the more you focus
on the inside culture

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.410
and the enjoyment of the
staff, the better that

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.510
translates to the guest.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.180
I guess in the beginning, I
was always like, the guest,

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.610
the guest, the guest,
and didn't really think

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.199
about the staff or the
culture and stuff like that.

00:48:00.199 --> 00:48:02.240
And then just over the
years with the experience,

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:09.070
the more we focus on the
employee culture and enjoyment

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.470
of everything, that
translates even more

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.740
into the guest experience, and
they have an even better time.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.650
Because at the end of the
day, the server, the cook,

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.110
the manager, the
hostess, the dishwasher,

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.050
everyone is representing us.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:26.800
So if they're not representing
us the proper way,

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.140
they're not translating
our vision to you.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.150
And we want them to be happy.

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:33.940
And this is our house.

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.910
And so everyone in it is
welcome and happy in it.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.000
But there definitely gets some
tension moments, you know?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.980
I mean, we're
married, so we always

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.552
make it awkward sometimes.

00:48:44.552 --> 00:48:46.510
SPEAKER 1: Well, I think
that's the perfect way

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.070
to end our time together.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.295
We have some food coming out.

00:48:49.295 --> 00:48:50.920
