MICHEL DEGRAFF: So if I were
to teach this course to a group

00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:12.520
that would be much more diverse
than what we have here at MIT--

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.200
because I think--

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.840
so when we taught this
course this past Spring,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.200
most students came
with a very open mind

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.630
trying to understand
the way, indeed,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.036
race and language create
these hierarchies that are not

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:27.910
good for the country,
not good for the world,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.670
and how to create more
inclusive societies.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.020
But if I were to
teach this course

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.630
with a more diverse ideological
set of students, what I think

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.160
I would do is to include
more texts from, say, a more

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.150
conservative perspective.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.970
In fact, some of the
students often they

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.210
would bring in clips
from, say, Breitbart

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.300
or from Rush Limbaugh, voices
that are very conservative

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.620
and some of them even
on the outright extreme.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.100
And we use that for
teaching moments.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.100
But if I were to
teach this class maybe

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.110
to a more diverse
group, what I would do

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.260
is to not take views so extreme,
but take some scholarly work

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.920
that could advocate,
say, for building walls

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.940
and then try to examine them
together in a respectful way.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.100
So that way even students
on the right and on the left

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.880
could have a respectful
dialogue and try

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.450
to look at the data that might
support a particular view

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.390
versus the other.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.640
And that would be a challenge.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.730
But I think eventually that
would be a good challenge,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.870
because one common motif
throughout the semester

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.930
was how do we take what we
learn here in this course

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.750
and make it available to
the wider public including

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.290
those who might want to
build walls and not bridges?

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.680
How do we translate all these
very important knowledge

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.140
of these important
findings about migration,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.406
about equality?

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:01.780
How do we translate
that in a way

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.740
that it can be discussed
in the wider sphere?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.910
And this remains a challenge
to the very end of the class.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.900
There was no clear
answer on how to do that.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.930
But I would hope that if we were
to teach to a broader audience,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.566
we would come up with
the right way to do it.
