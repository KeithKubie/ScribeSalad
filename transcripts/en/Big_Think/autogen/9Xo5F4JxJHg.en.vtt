We want you to use Big Think Edge to be a
better person, to build stronger relationships,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.070
communicate better, and positively impact
the lives of those around you.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.720
For instance, we all have difficult conversations
in our lives.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.800
They're never easy.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.410
But there are tools to help you deal with
them.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.640
And Big Think Edge provides those.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.770
