You may be thinking,
life cycles are really important.

00:00:04.718 --> 00:00:09.004
However this section, 
is on persisting and recovering data.

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.232
Trust me, I just want to get us
coding again. However,

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:16.493
these things are closely linked 
and they're easy to get wrong

00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:18.221
if you don't understand both.

00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:23.248
As Reito mentioned, Android saves 
the state of the application in bundles.

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:25.660
You might have had the idea 
that you would just save

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.824
all sorts of information in these bundles

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:31.079
and not have to worry about 
any other form of persistence.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.634
But, the thing is, these bundles go away
as soon as the user hits the Back key

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.034
in your main activity.

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:39.492
It's really important that they do this.

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:43.884
When the user chooses 
to close your activity with the Back key,

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:47.303
the expectation is that next time 
your activity is displayed,

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:49.270
it will be in the default state.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.290
If the user backgrounds your app 
using the Home key or the App Switcher,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.019
the next time your activity is created,
it should resume from the current state.
