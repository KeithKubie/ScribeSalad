1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,620
We have some space. That's
a good picture though. No,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,770
cause you know what it is is then if
you're sitting there then we have to

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:08,260
fucking be like that. It's
a consistent angle thing.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,470
It's definitely an angle thing.
All right, we're going, hey,

5
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:12,700
what's going on and spilled. Burn.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,690
It's time for a very special edition
of the Monday morning podcast.

7
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't even know when the fucking gonna
put this out probably before Monday

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,670
because a, my guest, um,

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,740
his series is already
three episodes in and uh,

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,790
he was supposed to be on two weeks ago
and I completely spaced big Hollywood

11
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:34,540
phony that I am at a very fitting that
he came back again in the name of his

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:38,140
show is the return of the Mack
as he's returning to the podcast.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,590
Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Attire.
Thank you too. Sorry man. Uh,

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,090
it's okay. I knowing you,
I know that you were, you,

15
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:49,370
you felt you felt bad about it, so it,

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,470
and you made me feel worse cause you
were a fucking sweetheart. [inaudible]

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,620
I was going like, Joe, can you at least
get mad at me? Like, oh, it's fine.

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,460
I needed. He goes, I needed to get out
of the house. Yeah, I'm says that. No,

19
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:04,420
I was, I was hanging. It was all good
dude. It was all good and thank you.

20
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:07,780
Thank you. And I know, I know that, uh,

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,800
you know that you don't have a
lot of cats, you know what I mean?

22
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:15,180
So it's special. So thank you for
[inaudible] just fucking guilt trip dude.

23
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,910
Do you know this to your wife? This
is brutal. Now I know, you know,

24
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:23,200
you're gonna be looking at people and
it's kind of the Boston thing too,

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,780
you know what I mean? Cause we're,
we're good with the guilt thing,

26
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:27,040
you know what I mean? So we can,

27
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,880
we can just let that thing hang over
your head forever. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,220
For years and years and years.
But I ended up putting on,

29
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:37,240
I don't do that because I wouldn't have
seen your show exactly. Cause I was,

30
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:39,460
you know, I was busy doing
a bunch of shit. Right.

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,210
And then I'm sitting there and I have
like a panic attack. I'm like, oh my God.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,150
Like, I fucking stood this guy up. I said
I was gonna be there. I wasn't there.

33
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,460
And I go, now I got to watch your
shows. Like what if I don't like it? Oh,

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,810
how fucking brutal is this? Like
half hour, 45 minutes can be.

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,460
Fortunately I watched it and
uh, it's fucking hilarious man.

36
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,640
Thank you man. Really Fun. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank, I know I, I've,

37
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,790
I've got a few friends that said
that like, Ooh, it ain't gonna save.

38
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,590
I don't like it, but uh, uh, it, it is
good. It is good. You know, when you,

39
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,483
you make something,

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,180
you kind of all in it and to get some
perspective and actually see it on a,

41
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,400
you know, a, a TV and it's, it's
nice. I, I feel certain, a lot of,

42
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,210
you know, it's a sense of
accomplishment and what I couldn't find.

43
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:26,080
What network is it on? Cause we record
the thing. So it's on, it's on pop TV.

44
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,900
It's not on the comfy channel.
And now the comfy channel,

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,790
that's the channel within the show.
Yeah. Um, yeah, it's on pop TV,

46
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,850
which is, it's a CBS lion's
gate partnership, but it's,

47
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:41,770
it's the channel's been up for
about two years. Um, it's on most,

48
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,690
I think every carrier has it. Sometimes
it's on like a, you know, a higher tier,

49
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:50,950
so it's not basic. Uh, which is kind
of a bummer sometimes. So, you know,

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,270
on one sense, you know, there's not a
ton of expectation, you know what I mean?

51
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,210
And you can build and
hopefully the networks like,

52
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,350
oh well wait know it's going to, you just
going to build it takes a second. Um,

53
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,930
what a crazy though.
How I'm like, you know,

54
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,740
when we were coming up there was just,
you could find shows and now it's like,

55
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,731
do you know my parents,

56
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,910
my parents have never seen my show cause
it's on Netflix and they don't know how

57
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:15,430
to get on it. It's just, I'm
like, you got to have a password.

58
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,430
You've got to like grab the
other remote control, do this.

59
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,630
It's like they have no idea. Um,
that's why when I take my specials,

60
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,390
they come to the special cause I know
they're not going to be able to find it

61
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:29,980
once it gets on Netflix, it just, you
know, that's the only way they see it. Um,

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,730
I do, I do tweet you. I,

63
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:35,440
I mean I do text you when I see
that beautiful Mug of you on, on,

64
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,990
on billboards across Los Angeles,

65
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,210
and then you treat me a picture of
me and like big bopper and in 1988,

66
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,320
you know what I mean? Just to get me
better. Give me shit though. Yeah. Well,

67
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:51,520
you know I gotta I know you go, we get
it. You got a special, what's that? Fuck.

68
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,670
That's the way you come at me,
which is why I was surprised when I,

69
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,560
when I didn't show up that
you were still, uh, oh yeah.

70
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,040
So He's going back. How
I originally met Joe was,

71
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,950
we worked on a movie called the
heat. Yes. Believe it or not,

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,580
that was up coming up on five years ago.

73
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,990
We filmed a five years ago and
we had a great time on that.

74
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:14,830
And it's another one of your cas men or
members? Jenny Denver was on that thing.

75
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,020
Yup. Return to the Mac.
Yes. Um, we, uh, that was,

76
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,830
that was sweet. I mean that Gig was
sweet Paul fake movie, big movie.

77
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,720
We were in our home town. Me and nick
met me in a, I sit the Nate Caudrey, uh,

78
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,330
who was, who was in it as well recently.

79
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:35,460
I said it's known as three
weeks in August. Like that said,

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,500
it has its own name. You know, for
me it was just a lot in my north end.

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,700
It was lovely. It was a lovely
experience. And obviously,

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,920
when did you leave Boston? Um, well I
was in New York for a while. You know,

83
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,190
I realized after new
kids broke up, you know,

84
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,100
I woke up when I was
like 21, and I was like,

85
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:58,450
the biggest decision I had to make was
where I was having lunch. And I was like,

86
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,060
okay, I gotta I gotta do something,
you know what I mean? Like,

87
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,060
and I'm wait [inaudible]
that whole thing broke up.

88
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,690
You took the whole Ryan and was done
by the time you were 21? Oh yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:10,170
I mean I was 15 when we
had our first hit records,

90
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:12,380
so that was like 88 and
then we had like, you know,

91
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,130
four or five years and then Kurt Cobain
came along and it was, what was it?

92
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,320
It was all, it was weird does then
it started back up again. Yeah.

93
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:24,040
In the late nineties thousand eight when
Kurt killed himself and he wasn't there

94
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,120
to stop those boy beds. Yeah, exactly. Um,

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,890
no, we, we, yeah,

96
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,100
we've been back together since
2008 but our fans have grown up.

97
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,130
You know what I mean? We, we look
back on that, but you know, with,

98
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,340
with an open heart and the nostalgia
and all that stuff, when we embrace it,

99
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,520
and right now we're just like a girls
night out for our fans. You know,

100
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:44,080
they get to get away from it. But yeah.

101
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,540
You kinda touch on that in the show
where I noticed that you have like,

102
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,120
you keep having these really
awkward moments where these,

103
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,040
like with the overly like, yeah, sex up
women, you know? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah,

104
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,290
yeah, yes. Yeah, that's true.

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,420
Does that happen to you along like they
want to give you a long little too long

106
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:03,620
of a hug. I don't want you to shit on
your fans and just say, oh, we have all,

107
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,690
you know, shapes and sizes. There's
a few, there's a few that I'm,

108
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,370
dude, you sound like
you're running for office,

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,250
then you're not going to get in
trouble in this city to me, you know,

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,430
can't blame me there. We're still playing
arenas. So like you say, I got it. No,

111
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,370
you gotta take care of my, my fans.
Absolutely. I've said the right thing,

112
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:24,750
but no, some, some are a
little too little too, uh,

113
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,080
you know, aggressive or, you know,
touchy feely. You know what I mean?

114
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:32,940
But that's okay. For the
most part, they're, they're
fine. But yes, but, but I,

115
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:34,320
so, so I left,

116
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,750
so I spent some time in New York and
then I've been out in la for 15 years and

117
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,710
kind of get nichey for the, to go back
to go back east to do, you know, it's,

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,880
it's the best here. But,
um, it's funny when I,

119
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,860
when I think of my friends who are
that, you know, have had babies,

120
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,610
you get, you know, you get how old
you? A little five, three months,

121
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,520
three months, little over three. And
it's hopeful, you know what I mean?

122
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:03,540
It's really funny is like in, you
know, not to get all, you know,

123
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,970
it's a tough time in the world
and it's crazy, whatever, but,

124
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,410
and it's so cliche,

125
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:12,411
but it's like really hopeful when someone
has a baby because for you it's all

126
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:16,200
about that kid, man. I mean, what's
more hopeful than a new kid? You know?

127
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,810
And you're just like, you know, and
it's, and it's really nice. I'm a mom.

128
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,370
My kids are almost six, seven and nine,

129
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:27,510
so it's a little bit of a different
vibe. But, um, anyways, I'm,

130
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,520
I don't feel like, you know what I feel
like weird about how uh, once I left,

131
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:35,970
all of a sudden they all to every team
starts winning championships and as much

132
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:40,260
as so much fun it is to be behind any
enemy lines. Like Celtics beat the Lakers.

133
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:44,220
I was out here and red sox beat the
Yankees. I was in New York but you know,

134
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,590
I recently did a show, uh,

135
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,290
and an acting gig actually
one day back in um,

136
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,400
Boston and I remember the Bruins were
just starting to play offs and was looking

137
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,990
at my hotel window and I just saw a sea
of Bruins jerseys and just to finally be

138
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:58,621
like, oh my God,

139
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:01,110
I could actually wear them cause I don't
wear any of my shit out here. It just,

140
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:05,150
people are nuts on the west coast. They
take it to a whole other level. It's,

141
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,490
it's violent, it's got it. It's not
fun. Like when I was in New York,

142
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,540
it was fun. It was ball breaking.
I even been in Philly and you know,

143
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,650
as much as they hiked those guys up, it's
like you got to go out of your way to,

144
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,260
to really get an ASCA, you're
definitely going to get shit.

145
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,020
You might get something dumped on
you, but that's as far as it goes.

146
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:25,820
But out here, yeah, it's just
like a, it's like Mad Max at,

147
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,180
you're a little scared for your life.
Yeah. I mean, I was at the 2010, uh,

148
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:32,760
when the, when the Lakers did
beat the Celtics and I was,

149
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,420
I when they called 58 fouls on the
Celtics and like 12 on the, that's great.

150
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,580
That's great. For a game
seven, it was fun to watch.

151
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,200
The Lakers beat us from
the foul line. That's,

152
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,680
that's always good for hoop
and they barely won. You're
right. Even without our,

153
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,860
our, our center. But um, I'm
not saying we would have one,

154
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:50,910
but I'm just saying it's like you
gotta like you gotta let them play,

155
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,700
let them fucking play. What's
the most anticlimactic that,

156
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,060
the one memorable moment, that game
that I can only remember was Ron,

157
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,870
our test hitting at three. That
was a fucking huge shot. Yeah. But,

158
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,830
and it was ugly. Other than
that, it was an ugly game sense.

159
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,120
There was no magic with the baby sky hook.

160
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,760
There was always like a moment bird
steals the ball or something like that.

161
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,630
It was like, Nah, they just, a Colby
didn't have a good game that, that game,

162
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:15,340
you know, I remember him saying
after the game, he was like, I can't,

163
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,730
I don't know how we won
that game. It's like, well,

164
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:22,290
fucking talk to the footlocker
guys because those are the MVPs.

165
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,990
They switched out the footlocker
guys and the, you know,

166
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,590
they're ready to happen. The
last, uh, Boston Cleveland game.

167
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,460
Not Cleveland game. Sorry. Who the fuck
are we playing? Uh, bulls. The Bulls,

168
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,600
the last, last bulls game,

169
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:37,320
like I thought the Fisher
gang was terrible and it
was in our favor and I loved

170
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:40,920
when Lopez did this. Like the
sarcastic, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,060
That was when you, then you saw it.

172
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,200
Then they went down the
court and then Dwayne,

173
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,910
Dwayne Wade got a ticky textile one and
he was like laughing going like no one,

174
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,560
it was like a makeup called, but it was
like too late at that point, so. Right,

175
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,100
right, right. All right. I'm good sir.

176
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:56,040
I mean we got the luck of the draw
there with Rondo getting hurt.

177
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,130
So it was the MVP of the series I
think easy because even still because,

178
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,200
because he's still the most
valuable cause he's first game.

179
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,510
It looked like they were going to sweep
us and all of a sudden he was gone.

180
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,870
I know, I know. He was asked. He
was in his house. You think he is?

181
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I think that he's going to make
six came sasters off. Okay.

182
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,500
He's got long sleeves on his sport
coat. Again, not tripping anybody.

183
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,210
You see him trip up a, what's his
name? Crowded crowd. I thank you.

184
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,670
I love when he tried to
act like he was stretching.

185
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,860
He was totally like looking right
at him. I thought it was funny.

186
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,350
And then he says in the press committee,
he's like, Oh yeah, I've got a ACO.

187
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:34,140
And I just, uh, like to stretch it.
Next question. And he was $25,000,

188
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,080
and then he goes, he was really way out
of bounds. He tried to put it on him.

189
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,190
Yeah. Yeah. Dad Dead Pan face. I actually,

190
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,560
I liked, I thought it
was funny. It was not,

191
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:44,930
I mean I don't give a shit about it.

192
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,320
God was going to break his fucking leg
over that he sort of stuck it out. He,

193
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,190
he's the kind of guy you want on your
team, but he's not on a team anymore.

194
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,420
Right. And then he tried to push, you
know, rail and out of the big, uh, did he,

195
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,300
did you see that story where
that they haven't like a reunion,

196
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,820
a 10 year reunion for the Celtics,

197
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,620
but like a year earlier
or something like that,

198
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,630
they're all going to The
Bahamas or something like that.

199
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,890
And they didn't invite Ray Allen
because he went to the Miami Heat.

200
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,340
You know something too.

201
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,710
I never understood that too because it
was like him going to Miami, Miami Heat.

202
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,710
That's how we got him. He was
a sonic. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

203
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,930
So if you sign a free agent like, and you,

204
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,140
it's like I've joked to my pockets that's
like falling in love with a stripper.

205
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,750
Yeah. There's no loyalty at that
point. It's just like, fuck it,

206
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:31,560
I'm going to get paid and try to
win rings. And he, he, what was he?

207
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,430
He was there three, four years. I mean,
it just, to me it's a personality thing.

208
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,140
That's what I love about sports the most.

209
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:39,900
Like you can talk about the
x's and o's and all that stuff,

210
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:44,250
but like the personalities man. I
mean, you look at Lebron like for me,

211
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,020
the way it is and how they sit and why
they sit and why they rest and should

212
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,610
they, you know, they getting paid

213
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,620
millions and millions of millions of
dollars in there sitting there resting.

214
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,280
It's like, oh well they're tired. Well,
the other team's tired too. Right.

215
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,110
You know, so it's a, and I just love
that. I just think he's like, the Bron is,

216
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,440
I call him the greatest player ever to
not want the ball at the end of the game.

217
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,400
No, that was him before. Before
they want it. When he's on the,

218
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,250
he doesn't want the ball
at the end. It's still,

219
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,990
I'm not saying he's not amazing.

220
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,800
He does not want the ball
at the end of the game.

221
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,390
I kind of re Irving does.

222
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,530
I thought he pushed through that when
he was with the heat. He Won. He Won.

223
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,780
If he can go, he won. He Won. Yeah. Um,

224
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,150
but he just, yeah, it's a, it's an eye,
you know, and I'm not hating on him.

225
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:41,890
I think he's an amazing, you know,
athlete and person and all that stuff.

226
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,820
I just think he's, he does it
all the greats. Larry Bird,

227
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:49,390
I say Thomas Colby at
the, all those Jordan,

228
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,660
of course they wanted the ball.
Everyone get out of my way.

229
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,040
That's not him and I, it's, it's,
it's intriguing to me. Yeah.

230
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,650
I thought he was that until like, uh,

231
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,170
once he won it with the heat and all of
a sudden I remember he was playing some

232
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:04,960
game was the end of the game and he
actually took the shot and missed.

233
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,750
But the fact that he did it, I've
thought that he pushed through.

234
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,471
You got him up too.

235
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,950
He came into the League at 18 I just
think there was all this expectation,

236
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:15,040
that type of thing, and I think it took
them a minute to kind of grow into it.

237
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,230
But I, I think, I think
he's, he's past that.

238
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:21,640
Then you take the last fricking shot to
win it last year. No, that wasn't him.

239
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:24,820
No, no. He ran down. He blocked
the ball. No, I meant exactly,

240
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,060
but that's what he'll do. Well, that was,

241
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,750
you're supposed to take
a whole court show. No,

242
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:33,751
but he overcompensates and these
superhuman ways with that block,

243
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,110
but it, he does not want the fall.
I've never seen a guy so good.

244
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,510
Gets so much fucking shit. I
don't know what it is. Well,

245
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,790
some people might think I'm hating on him.

246
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,870
I'm saying you just call him the greatest
defensive plays and won the biggest

247
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:50,610
moment of the biggest fucking game.
Yes. As underdogs. He turns it off.

248
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,920
You said it was overcompensating.
I'm not well heat.

249
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,260
That's hitting a little
bit. I'm going to say, oh,

250
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,250
he makes up for not wanting the ball
at the end of the game. I can't listen.

251
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,210
If he takes the ball and gets it on
the buzzer beater, I'll be thrilled.

252
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,900
I'll be thrilled. I'm not hating
him. I'm not saying he's not capable.

253
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,570
You won't be thrilled if he goes against
the Celtic. She wouldn't be. To me,

254
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:15,571
it's fascinating that someone
that talented still has
room to grow or stuff they

255
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:21,610
haven't done. All right. That's
fair enough. Hey Joe, fair enough.

256
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,700
Back to my TV show. Back to
you. No, I'm kidding. Kidding.

257
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,700
How much of that is Improv a not a
lot, actually. Not a writing's not. No,

258
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,000
thank you. Yeah, I co-created it
with, uh, my friend Paul Greenberg,

259
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:38,440
who I was introduced to by Donny Walberg
and Jenny McCarthy who are also on the

260
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,800
show. Oh yes. Hilarious. Yes, yes.
They're executive producers as well.

261
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,270
So Paul and I,

262
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:48,271
and then there was a Heather Rutman
and a Mike Glock or a writers.

263
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:51,350
And uh, so it was a small
writing team, but you know,

264
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,490
you have three days to shoot,

265
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,100
so you don't really have a
lot of for each episode. Wait,

266
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,240
you shoot that in three days.

267
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,600
Three days by how many can
we do two episodes at a time?

268
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:02,420
So it's over six days.

269
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:05,240
We do a two episodes.

270
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,470
So how can we have a [inaudible]
two? We have three. No,

271
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:13,310
we had two cameras. And tell
me how long have you days.

272
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,480
Not Super Long because
that gets into over time.

273
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:21,500
And that's a budget thing too with I
learned a lot who just started showing it,

274
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:25,430
right? Yeah. So how long did it
take you to shoot? Six. Ah, so us,

275
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,290
oh six you mean six episodes?
Well, we did eight episodes a day.

276
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,260
So it was a three. It was
24 days. It was 24 days.

277
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,180
And um, which is I, I love
it. I mean that's forced,

278
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,640
can grade you want more, you know, be
nice to have, you know, Mama, you say,

279
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,990
oh it's fine and I want more.

280
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,840
But like maybe if there was a second
season you want a little bit more dough to

281
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:49,100
do this or do that. But as far as
an actor and getting out there,

282
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,630
you don't need that much time. You
know, you have four or five to,

283
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,520
I never felt like we didn't have
enough time to get the takes,

284
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,540
but to your point about, uh, you know,
uh, at, you know, adlibbing or improving,

285
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,940
we, we didn't have a lot of time to
just go there. So the scripts were good.

286
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,540
I grade, I, I was really happy
with them and, and um, you know,

287
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,590
it is a little bit here and there, but
for the most part I was scripted. Yeah.

288
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,340
Yeah. That's the way to do a show.

289
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,430
I've worked with a few people that
knew like a, the always sunny guys,

290
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,430
those guys like you ever seen how
they, they'll shoot this season,

291
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:23,450
like they have it all mapped out, so
they'll like do for like the whole season,

292
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:26,660
like all the bar things and
then just their, yeah, shoot.

293
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,710
It all run out changed and they just
do like, it's genius how they do it.

294
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:34,730
And then there's other shows that you go
on and it's just like you're doing like

295
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:39,530
14, 16 hour days and like you literally
want to kill I, yeah, paint dry.

296
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,940
Yeah, exactly. And I was just like,

297
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:43,070
I don't think I ever want
another acting gig in my life.

298
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:47,030
This is fucking horrific. And uh, I
always call it like those types of shoots.

299
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:49,430
Like people say, what are those
things? Like I say, compared to,

300
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,620
it's like going to the DMV
with like famous people.

301
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,230
So he's just sitting
around the same thing,

302
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,290
just sitting there thinking you're
never, never going to get called.

303
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:02,150
And then when you finally do you fucking
elated. And uh, I, it's, I don't know,

304
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,120
I've heard like stories of like actors
like learning how to play instruments.

305
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,830
Just sitting around waiting
in there. Yeah, in the, yeah.

306
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:12,770
And I know it's like you hate to
complain about a Gig, but it's true.

307
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,940
You're in it, you're in a, you're in a
trailer and you're in your same thing.

308
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,120
It's like, this is what I worked for.
Like this is what I want. And, and,

309
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,410
and it's not a coincidence. It'll
work. Like I want to go there and work.

310
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,840
Exactly. Some fucking
reason sitting around. It's,

311
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,610
it's, I actually understood my dog better.

312
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,130
It's like I get why when my
dog is just laying there,

313
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:36,500
it goes to sleep because your
body's lily like, alright,

314
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,320
well we're not doing shit.
Let's save up this energy.

315
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,920
You start nodding off like an old man
and the second you start to sleep,

316
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:45,230
you're going to get that knock on
your door. Now you fell asleep.

317
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,610
You're not going to be fucking in it
and they bring you out. I were gone,

318
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,660
but we have a quick, we're
losing. Yes. I'm like, yes.

319
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,220
It's more like a mentally look.

320
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,880
It's way better than fucking
roofing in June and July. Exactly.

321
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,750
I lasted like three weeks doing that
shit. But I'm just saying like, um,

322
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,840
you know what it is to me
it's the frustration is when
you're there it's like it

323
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:07,200
doesn't have to take this fucking
long. Yeah, no it doesn't. But that's,

324
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:07,981
he know what you're doing.

325
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,700
It doesn't have to take this fucking
long sliding stuff and everything in it.

326
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,230
And I guess you can see the
difference in some, you know,

327
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,230
the production value and,
and that's fine. But I,

328
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:19,710
I agree and that's why it's,
it's in my nature to go,

329
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,420
you know what I mean?

330
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,900
I got lucky a lot of people trying to
make TV shows in this town and like I'm

331
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,200
super grateful, but like I, I was like,
I wanted to get active and do it and,

332
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,450
and we were able to get it done and yeah,
but when word gets out it, you know,

333
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:36,370
people see how funniest show is and
that you guys shoot it that quick.

334
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,900
Like I don't think you'll have a problem
getting people doing guest stars.

335
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:42,270
I think so. I think so. I'm going
to quote you a bell. There you go.

336
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,410
You just set yourself up and plus you

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,180
see your shrewd businessman.
You waited and Adam, the guilt.

338
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,390
Adam loves you by the way, out
of Marae, uh, as so many do.

339
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:56,520
But he was on the,

340
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,880
you guys just did a charity
Gig and he went on before you,

341
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,880
and I think you will
like this guy, you know,

342
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:06,320
you were very cupboard like this guy
should closed. What am I doing with them?

343
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,190
This guy set a, that was foolishness.
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

344
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:16,060
So, uh, yeah, he fucking murdered.
Yeah, he's, he's, he was, uh,

345
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,070
it's one of those things where you
say, I, I wrote for that person,

346
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,110
like when I wrote the, the first
pilot, like I was just writing for him,

347
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,500
you know what I mean? I was just
getting off on, on his whole vibe.

348
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,850
He's super charming. Guy
Loves, I mean works a ton. And,

349
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,570
and uh, and we had a blast
doing guest stars too.

350
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:41,010
I saw it like the third episode, Joey
Fatone joyful murder. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

351
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:45,120
man. He's, he's a funny bastard, so I,
yeah, and he's really silly doesn't,

352
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,600
he doesn't like he just
exactly. Self deprecating.

353
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,410
And then the Chris Kirkpatrick
who was also from INSYNC,

354
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,950
he comes in at the end of
episode three and, and he, uh,

355
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,040
he really throws himself
under the bus. You know,

356
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,740
normally you have a guest star
and you've got to let them win.

357
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:05,670
You know what I mean? Yeah. But he
comes up in episode five and he really,

358
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,640
you know, goes forward. So I said,

359
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,920
you have all these guys on here and it's
great cause that you let them do what

360
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,840
they're going to do. So
you get to see how talent,

361
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:15,860
like Joey Lawrence murdered it.
But yeah, no, he was great. Again,

362
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,020
he's sort of like America's sweetheart,
but I knew a different side of him.

363
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:22,770
A real ball buster. Like
acerbic super funny.

364
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,120
He's super talented, been around
forever. But I knew when we went at it,

365
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,350
you know, doing that thing, it
would be, you know, super funny.

366
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:34,110
And he was great. We had a blast
doing it too. So now is that true?

367
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:39,060
Did you guys both come in third
place? We did. We did. So I did.

368
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:41,520
The thing is I, I want people, most,

369
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,730
a lot of people forget cause I did the
first season of dancing with the stars

370
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,550
and I didn't want to do it. Man. I want
it to be totally through that. Okay.

371
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,140
You're sitting there, you need a Gig.

372
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,950
This is like an episode of your show
when your agent calls up. Joe. Totally.

373
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,050
I got to get, got it. Yeah. So it was
just out the pilot season. I actually,

374
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,450
I just did six months
on Broadway in wicked,

375
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,240
very early on with the
demons l like, you know,

376
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,470
x height of like what I,
what I love to be doing.

377
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,890
But I had it in my mind like a rookie.

378
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm going to go out to La
and book a pilot. Right.

379
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,210
Just to book a pilot just for
my ego, not because of the work,

380
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,160
not because of the right
project. You know what I mean?

381
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:25,330
So I was in it for the wrong
reasons. So people open to uh,

382
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,250
seeing you for stuff? Yeah. I mean,

383
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,410
about a year or so before that I was on
a David Kelly show as as a regular on

384
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:34,630
Boston public. That lasted
for about three years.

385
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:38,350
I was on it for a year and it changed my
life. I came out to La, I met my wife.

386
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:40,780
So things happen. You're
like, you needed, you needed,

387
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,620
you had to get one of those gigs to
separate you from all this guy's,

388
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,190
he's in a band, his little band, the
whole thing. And I just thought it would,

389
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,390
you know, change my life or whatever.
I, I'd be cool on my ego. It's just,

390
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:56,620
I thought that was it. It was
Christmas. And so I had a bad, you know,

391
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,460
pilot season as you know, so many
lives. Do you know what I mean?

392
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:03,310
Everybody does. Like now I
know. Now I know everybody,

393
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:07,480
no matter how good you are, you know what
I mean? Like it's a, it's a crapshoot.

394
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,550
So I get this call for tents with this
British guys. Like it's a beautiful,

395
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,230
it's unbelievable. It's,

396
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,330
it had some other name and the UK
and it's going to be great. And,

397
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,720
you know, don't worry, you
win and that whole thing and,

398
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,300
and we won't make you look bad. Yeah. I
was like, great for your Korea. Exactly.

399
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:30,970
And I was like, I said no a million times.

400
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,340
And then I said yes and no and yes and no.

401
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:36,760
And literally I'm up in my bed over
how long a period of time is all these

402
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:41,500
notes. And yesterday, maybe a week or
two, three agonizing over, hey, agonizing,

403
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,920
right. Cause this is not what I want to
do. I don't want to do a reality show.

404
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:47,620
We didn't know what dancy with
the stock and it's all relative.

405
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:50,890
Some people I talk about this and
they go, what's wrong with it?

406
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,210
It stands out with the stars. It's the
biggest show on TV, but to each his own,

407
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:59,310
you know what I mean? It's not what
I wanted to do. But anyways, I, I,

408
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,950
I was up in bed. I was like, after
I almost like signed the contract,

409
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:06,100
I was like, I can't do it
because I was in, you know,

410
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:08,320
the joke is like I get
up in bed and I'm like,

411
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,690
I'm in a dance contest with
their Vander Holyfield.

412
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,140
What the fuck am I doing?
What am I doing? And,

413
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,720
and I just couldn't say no. And
a house was on that season. Uh,

414
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,180
Rachel Hunter, um, or
whatever. John O'Hurley,

415
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:27,740
John O'Hurley from Jay
Peterman. We talk about that in,

416
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,090
in my show in episode two. And, um,

417
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,920
another girl from a general hospital
and um, I'm blanking. So they were all,

418
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,850
they were all a mess. I was a
dancer, so they had to take me down.

419
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:40,960
It's a produce show,

420
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,500
so they're gonna cut me out at the
knees from day one to get the storylines

421
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,260
going. You know what I
mean? So, wait, so when,

422
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,500
how did they take you out on the show?
So all these people can, the dance,

423
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,160
you can, this is what the fuck you
been doing your whole life, Joey.

424
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:55,840
That was all full. You look like and
scabbed me and said, riling rally,

425
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,900
dad's flock. They said, oh
yeah, yeah, they murdered me,

426
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,080
they murdered me and I kicked ass. Yeah.

427
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:06,830
So now how did you hold your
component? Like you're standing there.

428
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,530
They're filming. Go to the tape.
I mean right now, but yeah,

429
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,720
I need to sit in there
like these mother fuckers,

430
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,610
I don't want you to track but oh no, I
don't care. I don't care at this point.

431
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:18,250
I mean it's a joke now. I'm, I'm, I'm,

432
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,710
and that's why I was able
to use it in the show.

433
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,750
Like the guy who got Scott and miss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Literally said, he said.

434
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,850
And so, you know, I, I, I'm, I'm
attached from it now and, and,

435
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:33,170
and I'm able to use
that stuff for my show.

436
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:37,970
Like the guy I play on my show now
returning the Mac is, is, is that guy,

437
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:38,601
you know what I mean?

438
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:42,920
Who couldn't say no who didn't have
the patience or the integrity or the

439
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:46,010
discipline to ride it out
for the right part. Now.

440
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,190
That's why I like watching your
show because I see this other side,

441
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:52,100
like your home life and stuff.
Yeah. Even you getting like the uh,

442
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,940
the person to help with your kids.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

443
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,710
And that's shit that I do. I know
honey. Whoever you, whoever you want,

444
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:00,680
that's fine. That's fine. Fortunately,
no, that's worked out in my life.

445
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,650
But I mean, yeah, exactly.
Until, until you know,

446
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:06,620
you get some crazy guy and then
you weigh in definitely until,

447
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,330
till your wife gets it wrong.

448
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,440
Whatever you need until what the
hell were you thinking? You know? Um,

449
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,050
but I'm sorry, I interrupted
a great story. So you know,

450
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:15,771
so you're sitting there,

451
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:18,050
they're saying you go like a
Scud missile all over the place.

452
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,030
I just didn't want to do this show but
we, it was six episodes. People still go,

453
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,700
why don't you do dancing with
the stars? And I think to myself,

454
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,860
should I tell them I did
it? Whatever. Cause like it,

455
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,840
my ego says I like when people forget
that I did that show cause it's not really

456
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:36,020
what I wanted to do on the
other side. It's like, hey,

457
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:39,230
it's all Shope is in, in life.

458
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,130
Things happen and you learn from them.
How many, how many weeks did you do?

459
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,100
Well, it was only six weeks
back then. Cause it was the,

460
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,990
it was a summer program. They were
given a shot by six weeks. The finale,

461
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,120
that was like 15 million
people watching it.

462
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:57,980
So I'm at 50 million people. So
you come in third. Yeah, St Luke.

463
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:02,060
Did you lose two? Evander Holyfield
hate. No, I beat a Vander. Holy field.

464
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,380
Got a lot of people can say that.
That's a tough man. But, but, but, but,

465
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:10,010
but exactly. Exactly. But
John, John O'Hurley loved it.

466
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,240
Guys in his sixties he's doing
the walls, he's eating it up,

467
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,970
they're loving and he's eating
the scenery. You know what I mean?

468
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:21,410
Like God bless them. This was, I'm
sensing insight. Spark in your eyes.

469
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:25,460
I haven't seen any years. Exactly.
It was brilliant and good for him.

470
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:28,550
You know what I mean? He had a blast
and, and I learned a lot too. I mean,

471
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:29,750
I learned, you know,

472
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,350
how to do that kind of dancing and you
learned from the dancers and dancers in

473
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,880
this business, especially on Broadway,

474
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,050
are the hardest working people in show
business because they got a dance.

475
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,800
You know, most of them have to sing
on Broadway. They'd dance and sing.

476
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,450
Their egos are like totally in
check. They come to work everyday,

477
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,210
they don't complain and it's the
stars and the leads that, you know,

478
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:53,100
do all the complaining
when they really have,

479
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,820
it's so much better than everybody
else. Right. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

480
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,120
So what was the fallout of that?
So after that, uh, you come in,

481
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,670
how did you take, when you, we relieve
when you got kicked off the show?

482
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:06,390
At that point? We just, our well was
kind of, I think I got episode five,

483
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,910
I was gone and then they
had me back for the finale.

484
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:13,530
Everybody was there for the finale. Um,
you know, I, I felt like I went out,

485
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,500
you know, I, I, I was good with
my performances, but again,

486
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,050
they took me down cause they
needed a storyline. I mean,

487
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:23,640
that's kind of what that, that's my story
anyways. But, um, it was cool. I mean,

488
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,050
I actually did a, a standards
album after that and, um,

489
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,220
we went on tour and we, I feel like
I got a little something out of it,

490
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,570
you know what I mean? We went on like a,

491
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:37,900
an arena tour and funny enough that
actually, um, that's how I met, uh,

492
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,580
the new kids manager at the time we
were managing and I talked to Donny,

493
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:43,980
Donny and I were talking about
getting together and I said, well,

494
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,920
this might be the manager because
I've been working with this guy.

495
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:50,370
So it's that kind of thing. You'd do
things that you think aren't right,

496
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,690
but you're there,

497
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:55,380
you make the most of it and it could
lead to big that that led to you guys

498
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:59,220
getting back together. Well, a small
piece, a lot of things have to happen,

499
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:02,400
you know what I mean? Started putting
that thing back together, like going,

500
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,340
fuck a 40 people gonna
show up. Yeah. Well,

501
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,020
the cool thing was that we were, we were
in it together. I mean, we were, if,

502
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,000
if these other four guys were willing to
get in the foxhole and see what happens

503
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:18,090
because we have so much history
together and we're like family,

504
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:20,190
you know what I mean? So that was
the cool part, you know what I mean?

505
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:23,160
And I trusted those guys.
I mean, Donny, you know,

506
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,400
I felt like he always held our,

507
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,320
what we had very dear to women, like
when, when MTV or VH one would go,

508
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,280
come on our talent, come
on our awards show, they,

509
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,850
they wanted their big ratings hit,
they wanted their five minutes.

510
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,210
And we always like, hey man, we're,
we're bigger than five minutes.

511
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:44,010
You know what I mean? And sure enough,

512
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:48,210
the timing was right and we did it the
right way and our fans showed up for us

513
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:51,510
and you know, we back in
arenas have to, you know, jam.

514
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,120
You guys did like Fenway
or Clark too, right?

515
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,790
You'll be doing family park July 8th
again, man, don't it again. Yeah. Cool.

516
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,360
Yeah. So cool man. That's so
cool. That's great. So we got,

517
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,790
you've got five more
episodes coming out. Um,

518
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,570
so you're gonna get back to
Boston. Um, what's your deal man?

519
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:11,170
Are you going to like stay out
here? Um, I know. Well, uh,

520
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,120
we'll see. We'll see about the, you know,
second season, you know how that goes.

521
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,680
But, um, I dunno,

522
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,220
I don't know if I'm just
distracting myself by saying
I want to like get back to

523
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:25,050
New York or Boston. Uh, it's so nice
out here. You actually have like a yard,

524
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,840
you know what I mean? In New York
is just a totally different thing.

525
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:31,890
My wife's from New York, but it's high
class problems, but I'm just Kinda like,

526
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,970
I dunno if I'm just need something
to chew on, you know what I mean?

527
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,540
Or if I'm like to relax, you know what
I mean? Just your here be where you are,

528
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:42,460
you know, that kind of growth rather
than getting all fucking, yeah. Antsy.

529
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,790
Yeah, that's definitely a,

530
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,020
it's definitely a shoe I have like
my wife freaks out about that,

531
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,740
just going like, can you just
sit down and watch TV with me?

532
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,480
And then if I watch TV it becomes
interactive and I'm like talking to it.

533
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,500
And then she's just like, you're ruining
all of my show. And you have to like,

534
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,760
oh yeah, yeah. I mean that's,
yeah, I [inaudible] she's like,

535
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,690
shut up or leave the room
because I can get very, you know,

536
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,500
like parenthood. She loved
parenthood and I get it.

537
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:12,330
It was a very successful show. But
like, you know, I, I would, yeah,

538
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,110
I would tear it apart. Yeah. Like,
and what do you mean? That's all I do.

539
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:18,670
She goes, my wife, I met,

540
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,300
she's actually gonna come on the podcast
because she kind of went rogue on me.

541
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,510
You know, there's just, there's a
rule with like recording shows. Yeah.

542
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,440
Where this the a, Hey, I taped the
game. You don't give a shit. Hey,

543
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,390
you got the real housewives.
So who gives a fuck?

544
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:35,800
I don't care what the good shows.
The Fargo's the better call Saul's,

545
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,740
we got your shower nail. It's like,
you know, these are the odd the shows.

546
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:42,490
But what this is like with the kid, this
is like our shared family time, right.

547
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,290
Dude, she wants to better call Saul.
Fucking erase the thing. Ah, yeah.

548
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,490
And then tries to go all, you can
go onto a wherever. Wow. Yeah.

549
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,460
Wow. Yes. That's not,
we'll be discussing that.

550
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,820
It's not bringing her
in for that one. Yeah.

551
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,120
I was just sitting there going like way
down. Yeah, like a, what's going on?

552
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,870
Is Sarah, somebody else you
see in here? What's going,

553
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,640
I thought this was like a together
thing. That's how it starts.

554
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,330
That's how it starts.
Yay. Steady racing shows.

555
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,110
Your first hint that there's a problem
with your marriage is the shows you used

556
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,920
to watch together. All of
a sudden it's just like,

557
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,980
like did you just stop taping that?
Did you, wow. No, that was, I'm sorry,

558
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,560
was the Fargo one she,

559
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,020
she watched like the first episode of
the second episode and she just erased,

560
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:26,950
is it a mistake? Was it because it was
like the lowest priority thing? No, no,

561
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,500
no. It says she has gone rogue in TV.

562
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,920
Wow. Yeah,

563
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,590
and I love that you having that reaction
because this is prime in the pump for

564
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:40,430
the next, we might call the
next episode. Wow. Wow. Wow.

565
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,910
My wife. Wow. That's so that,
that's why I was looking at it like,

566
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,750
so that's how it is. Yeah. That's
how it is. I guess I'm on my own now.

567
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,980
I said the baby thing, is it the, like
she's, you know, kind of, you know,

568
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,340
she kinda said it was that she was just
like, look, you go out in the road,

569
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,760
you're doing your cakes. It's just
like, I'm a home here. I'm fried. Okay.

570
00:31:57,761 --> 00:31:59,050
I need to look at some adults.

571
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,210
I can only go Google goggles so long and
I am so sleep deprived when you're not

572
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:09,120
here. Oh my God. You know, I just,
you know, delete. Yes. You know,

573
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,820
robot mode and dead. Oh, did I do
that? That right. Fucking whatever.

574
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,230
Go on Netflix and find it.
Rotate. Getting eight hours sleep.

575
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,620
That's how she looks at it. So, anyways,
so let's, let's get the schedule here.

576
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,650
Okay. You got, you can, where
can they, people watch. Well,

577
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,060
but right now it's just, it's, I
wish, you know, we were on some other,

578
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:30,130
you know, uh, what do you call that?

579
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,350
The Netflix and the Hulu CSOs and
whatever you say that Amazon, yeah.

580
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,570
Right now cause it's a, it's,
it's, it's its own channel.

581
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:42,350
So we want to get people, you know, go
to pop, but it's, it's, it's pop TV.

582
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,240
I can go to pop tv.com and throw in your
zip code if you want to find out what

583
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:50,720
your channel is. But it's,
it's basic for a lot of them.

584
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:53,950
Sometimes it's a higher tier.
So unfortunately you got it.

585
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,890
You might have to dig a little bit, but
it's on pop TV. A lot of people have it.

586
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:02,720
It's on all the carriers and I what
nights and Wednesdays at eight 30,

587
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,110
uh, on pop TV and uh, for,

588
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,800
for another five episodes
and a tow to get caught up.

589
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,590
He's trying to make a move.
They pitched him a talk show.

590
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,550
You don't want to do it. Yes.
People get in your head. Yeah.

591
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,360
Now you're doing it. I have and I do.

592
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:22,330
And people will make no major decisions
without, without your oh scent.

593
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,040
That seems to be a running theme.
Hey, I'm glad I wasn't on that.

594
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:30,020
Pulling the rug out from
under me at every, every
moment. We got your side kick.

595
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:33,380
And now we're all caught
up and now they've decided
that it's not going to be a

596
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:36,860
comedy. No. Then now they're going to go
with this. I'm not funny. She tells me,

597
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,270
I love the reason why it's we
got it now. I figured it out.

598
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,190
You're not funny.

599
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,470
You like to stand up being like going on
stage and like deliberately bombing is

600
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:50,450
hard. Yeah. If you've been like,

601
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,720
cause you just automatically have
the saver like oh that didn't work.

602
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,640
Let's at least get a chuckle. I my pig,
I did that thing about pixie sticks.

603
00:33:58,641 --> 00:33:59,031
I don't know.

604
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:03,200
For some reason it was just that
thing like you know that that line,

605
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,700
you know people have an idea
of what standup is and go
to is and for some reason

606
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:10,620
mine was remember pixie sticks. Yeah.

607
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:13,700
What's up with the stupid like and you
think it's going to be funny and it's

608
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,220
not. So I just love, I'd never
had a pay off. I mean nothing.

609
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,840
Does anybody need that much sugar? Yeah.

610
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,120
It was just one set up after another
and he just kept fucking going with it.

611
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:26,090
I was this like, Oh my God, I've
literally been that calm. I'm that is,

612
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:28,400
that is people's ideas
to everybody has like,

613
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,650
they got the ideas of the boy
bands, they can know which this,

614
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,650
that and the other thing, the ACLU then
when they see the actual work of it. So.

615
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,510
Right. Joey, thanks. Great to have you
man. I really hope I get to work again.

616
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,700
It was great to get to know
you on the heat. Once again,

617
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,940
I apologize for the rug. I'm going to
use it for all it's worth building.

618
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:49,370
It worked out. This, this here, this
episode was the return of the Mech.

619
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,580
Thank you for coming in and continued
success with things right. Show you too.

620
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:52,910
Alright.
