00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.190
So, now we've looked at 2D
linear transformations.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.800
Let's look at that in a little
bit of an interesting way.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.710
Here's my equation.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.032
We know how to look at that.

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:11.637
Of course we basically talked that
now a simple way to do would be is,

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:14.312
in this case,
I can come up with four parameters.

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:18.310
And sometimes, for example,
a could be the scale and y, and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.729
d could be the scale.

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:24.715
The for example, the numbers
negative kind of give it a flip not.

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:28.600
And similarly, things like c and
b kind of give it the share information.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.577
And again, mixtures of this with sines
and cosines tell us how to do rotations.

00:00:32.577 --> 00:00:37.298
So one interesting to note is all
that this means is we are only

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:41.281
look at linear combinations
of these parameters to

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:45.465
generate a newer set of x and
ys, given an x and y.

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:49.976
So x and y, x prime, y prime
are computed knowing what x and y are,

00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:53.267
and again if I know the parameters a,
b, c, d.

00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:55.484
Let's look at some of the features or

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:59.010
the kind of the details of what
these types of things for y.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.950
They can be used to
generate scaling of images,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.410
rotation of images, shear and
of course also mirroring.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.450
We've looked at all of them so far.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.910
Now let's look at some properties
of these linear transformations.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.873
One thing to note is all of the time
the origin still remains where it is at

00:01:16.873 --> 00:01:17.780
0, 0.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.319
We haven't actually done so
far any translation, for example, right?

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.705
I gave you this example of looking at
these matrices where we just played

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:32.288
around with how to change them to
do scaling, rotation, shear, scale.

00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:36.930
We haven't actually done translation,
so origin remains where it is, always.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.760
Second thing to note in all of this
would be that lines would actually

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.750
generate lines again.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.040
So if the image had a line,
same straight line would actually be

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.830
generated in the new image,
even with scaling.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.190
Of course, it might look different
in terms of it might be stretched

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.720
because we may have stretched
the image more in y and less in x or

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.840
something like that, or it might
get flipped when I do the mirror.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.910
But, it still appear as a straight line.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.130
All parallel lines,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.760
because of the fact that everything
is straight line, will also appear.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.960
As a parallel in the new image.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.610
And all ratios would actually be
preserved, as much as possible,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.140
in that image.
