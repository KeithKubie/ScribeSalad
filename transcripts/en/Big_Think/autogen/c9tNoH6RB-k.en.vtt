I mean thinking most fascinating about

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650
I mean thinking most fascinating about
 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.650
I mean thinking most fascinating about
this whole subject is is something that

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660
this whole subject is is something that
 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.060
this whole subject is is something that
problems it quickly gets very technical

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070
problems it quickly gets very technical
 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.820
problems it quickly gets very technical
but but there's a there's some there's

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830
but but there's a there's some there's
 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.019
but but there's a there's some there's
there's an area of mathematics which is

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029
there's an area of mathematics which is
 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.800
there's an area of mathematics which is
known as representation theory and from

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810
known as representation theory and from
 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.730
known as representation theory and from
one way of thinking and it is thinking

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740
one way of thinking and it is thinking
 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.830
one way of thinking and it is thinking
about it is in terms of what are what

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840
about it is in terms of what are what
 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.140
about it is in terms of what are what
physicists often call symmetries so so

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150
physicists often call symmetries so so
 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.519
physicists often call symmetries so so
for instance one of the basic facts

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529
for instance one of the basic facts
 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.720
for instance one of the basic facts
about the laws of nature is that they're

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730
about the laws of nature is that they're
 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.799
about the laws of nature is that they're
they're they're symmetric laws of nature

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809
they're they're symmetric laws of nature
 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.040
they're they're symmetric laws of nature
are the same at you know if you move if

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050
are the same at you know if you move if
 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.630
are the same at you know if you move if
you move in any direction or you move in

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640
you move in any direction or you move in
 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.340
you move in any direction or you move in
time back and forth the laws of physics

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350
time back and forth the laws of physics
 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.069
time back and forth the laws of physics
don't change if you rotate things around

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079
don't change if you rotate things around
 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.990
don't change if you rotate things around
and three dimensions laws of physics

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000
and three dimensions laws of physics
 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.600
and three dimensions laws of physics
don't change and so so these so-called

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610
don't change and so so these so-called
 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.530
don't change and so so these so-called
symmetries and and these these

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540
symmetries and and these these
 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.400
symmetries and and these these
symmetries have very important physical

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410
symmetries have very important physical
 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.540
symmetries have very important physical
implications so friends the fact that

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550
implications so friends the fact that
 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.850
implications so friends the fact that
the laws of physics don't change as if

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860
the laws of physics don't change as if
 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.600
the laws of physics don't change as if
you change your if you move in time has

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610
you change your if you move in time has
 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.279
you change your if you move in time has
the physical implication that there's

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289
the physical implication that there's
 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.810
the physical implication that there's
this thing called energy and energy is

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820
this thing called energy and energy is
 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.180
this thing called energy and energy is
conserved and the same thing in the and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190
conserved and the same thing in the and
 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.070
conserved and the same thing in the and
that the fact that laws of physics don't

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080
that the fact that laws of physics don't
 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.170
that the fact that laws of physics don't
change if you move back and forth in

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180
change if you move back and forth in
 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.210
change if you move back and forth in
different directions in space implies

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220
different directions in space implies
 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.609
different directions in space implies
that there's a something called momentum

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619
that there's a something called momentum
 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.770
that there's a something called momentum
and momentum is conserved and doesn't

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780
and momentum is conserved and doesn't
 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.440
and momentum is conserved and doesn't
change in as you move as you evolve in

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450
change in as you move as you evolve in
 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.330
change in as you move as you evolve in
time and so so these very very

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340
time and so so these very very
 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.219
time and so so these very very
fundamental facts about physics are kind

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229
fundamental facts about physics are kind
 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.380
fundamental facts about physics are kind
of deeply grounded in the symmetries of

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390
of deeply grounded in the symmetries of
 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.420
of deeply grounded in the symmetries of
of nature and so to a mathematician this

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430
of nature and so to a mathematician this
 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.510
of nature and so to a mathematician this
this this question is is a question

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520
this this question is is a question
 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.249
this this question is is a question
about what we call about groups and

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259
about what we call about groups and
 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.319
about what we call about groups and
representations of these groups so if

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329
representations of these groups so if
 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.510
representations of these groups so if
you go into any math department and look

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520
you go into any math department and look
 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.800
you go into any math department and look
at what they're doing you'll see that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810
at what they're doing you'll see that
 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.120
at what they're doing you'll see that
you know that a lot of a lot of people

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130
you know that a lot of a lot of people
 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.920
you know that a lot of a lot of people
and different kinds of mathematics are

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930
and different kinds of mathematics are
 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.469
and different kinds of mathematics are
studying different structures which are

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479
studying different structures which are
 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.270
studying different structures which are
also called groups and they're often

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280
also called groups and they're often
 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.859
also called groups and they're often
studying later called representations of

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869
studying later called representations of
 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.990
studying later called representations of
these groups so even people studying num

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000
these groups so even people studying num
 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.850
these groups so even people studying num
number theory kind of abstract things

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
number theory kind of abstract things
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.010
number theory kind of abstract things
about about prime numbers or something

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
about about prime numbers or something
 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.530
about about prime numbers or something
they're also studying groups and certain

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540
they're also studying groups and certain
 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.510
they're also studying groups and certain
representations these groups so there's

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520
representations these groups so there's
 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.520
representations these groups so there's
kind of a to the extent that mathematics

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530
kind of a to the extent that mathematics
 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.060
kind of a to the extent that mathematics
has a kind of unifying theme and a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070
has a kind of unifying theme and a
 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.350
has a kind of unifying theme and a
unifying principle which shows up in

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
unifying principle which shows up in
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.520
unifying principle which shows up in
different areas of mathematics

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
different areas of mathematics
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.729
different areas of mathematics
it's about this retinas these

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739
it's about this retinas these
 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.470
it's about this retinas these
representations a representation theory

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
representations a representation theory
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.910
representations a representation theory
and the thing I most strike with most

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920
and the thing I most strike with most
 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.110
and the thing I most strike with most
anything as most tracks me about physics

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120
anything as most tracks me about physics
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.440
anything as most tracks me about physics
most

quantum mechanics quantum mechanics
initially looks like a very odd

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879
initially looks like a very odd
 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.900
initially looks like a very odd
structure it doesn't it's not something

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910
structure it doesn't it's not something
 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.369

you know like what the way we're used to

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110
you know like what the way we're used to
 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.449
you know like what the way we're used to
thinking about physics based on an

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459
thinking about physics based on an
 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.370
thinking about physics based on an
everyday experience but if you look at

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
everyday experience but if you look at
 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.839
everyday experience but if you look at
the mathematical structure and the basic

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849
the mathematical structure and the basic
 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.059
the mathematical structure and the basic
structures of quantum mechanics they're

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069
structures of quantum mechanics they're
 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.890
structures of quantum mechanics they're
exactly the structures that show up in

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900
exactly the structures that show up in

this theory in this theory of
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.820
this theory in this theory of
representations so there's a kind of a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830
representations so there's a kind of a
 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.210
representations so there's a kind of a
deep relation between math and physics

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220
deep relation between math and physics
 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.350
deep relation between math and physics
which is what it was

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360
which is what it was
 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.330

there's a lot that's been learned in
 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.199
there's a lot that's been learned in
mathematics over the years about how to

mathematics over the years about how to
 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.270
mathematics over the years about how to
think about representations and how to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280
think about representations and how to
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.449
think about representations and how to
construct them and how to work with them

people to understand how quantum

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569

mechanics worked and to understand the

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549
mechanics worked and to understand the
 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.660

anyway I think there's still a lot to be

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230
anyway I think there's still a lot to be
 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.629
anyway I think there's still a lot to be
learned in that way and raised

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.170
model has this group of symmetries which
is called a gauge symmetry and it's an

understanding of the representations of
 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.340
understanding of the representations of
this group is that there's is that that

should not be an interesting question

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389
should not be an interesting question
 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.220
should not be an interesting question
there should only be a trivial

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230
there should only be a trivial
 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.979
there should only be a trivial
representation of this group but anyway

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989
representation of this group but anyway
 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.140
representation of this group but anyway
my gesture is that there's there's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150
my gesture is that there's there's
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.120
my gesture is that there's there's
actually a much more interesting

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130
actually a much more interesting
 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.160
actually a much more interesting
question there and in pursuing that you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170
question there and in pursuing that you
 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.740
question there and in pursuing that you
can pursuing this question of how do you

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750
can pursuing this question of how do you
 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.529
can pursuing this question of how do you
deal with the with the gauge symmetry of

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539
deal with the with the gauge symmetry of
 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.350
deal with the with the gauge symmetry of
this theory and in terms of using ideas

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
this theory and in terms of using ideas
 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.200
this theory and in terms of using ideas
from representation theory that are um

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210
from representation theory that are um
 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.460
from representation theory that are um
that are more well-known in mathematics

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470
that are more well-known in mathematics
 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.540
that are more well-known in mathematics
that haven't been used in physics before

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550
that haven't been used in physics before
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.339
that haven't been used in physics before
that you can actually get somewhere so

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349
that you can actually get somewhere so
 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.589
that you can actually get somewhere so
that's maybe a bit too technical but

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599
that's maybe a bit too technical but
 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.979
that's maybe a bit too technical but
that's about as good as I can do with
