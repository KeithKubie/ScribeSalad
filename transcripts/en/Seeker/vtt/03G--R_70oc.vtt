00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.530
Ah yes, it’s that time of year again, and
nothing says holiday like freshly marked-down

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.530
merchandise!

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.240
The 40’s, the 50’s, the 60s PERCENT sales
on popguns, bicycles, roller skates, and kales!

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.620
Checkerboards, tricycles, popcorns, or pinwheels?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.480
Or... do you just love you some deals?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.460
I’m sure we’ve all been there, boasting
about how amazing that deal was and how much

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.710
money we saved on that 52 inch T.V. or pair
of shoes.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.090
It happens to the best of us.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.840
But is it the new gadget that makes you happy?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.070
Or the great deal… because Kit Yarrow, a
consultant and consumer psychologist says

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.320
it’s the latter.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.190
She says, customers are caring all too much
about the price of an item instead of valuing

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.659
the item itself.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.480
Before 2008, stores naturally put items on
sale at the end of a season, but now?

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.069
There are sales through every single part
of the year: 4th-of-July sales, semi-annual

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.499
sales, weekly sales.

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:49.499
You name it.

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:51.070
There’s a bargain to be hunted.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.670
Stores changed the psychology of shopping
when they appealed to the cheaper needs of

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.600
patrons during the recession.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.600
And one Nielsen survey shows, some people
like the “hunt” for a bargain

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.140
And researchers say shopping a sale can trigger
the same parts of the brain as love or drugs.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.229
The mere action of walking into a store can
get your dopamine levels going, but much like

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.551
a real addict, you go home with feelings of
guilt, because like maybe you didn’t need

00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:18.509
that game console, even tho it was $100 off
and you sort of wanted it…ish.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.460
Shopping increases activity in your nucleus
accumbens-- the reward circuit of your brain.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
You anticipate purchases, and get excited
about them, and (according to one study) “excessive

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.799
prices … activate circuits associated with
anticipated loss.”

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.220
But a sale?

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.759
That’s a whole different thing.And stores
know this.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.690
Yarrow suggests there’s a greater chance
of a person buying a product if they feel

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.259
like they’ve saved, and can walk away with
satisfaction at their bargain.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.659
Even if the product is marked-up and then
the price is cut; you’re still happy because

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.220
you believe you saved, Mom!

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.710
Basically, these sale prices are trying to
convince you you're spending less than you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.710
are.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.100
But that’s not actually so.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.219
Don’t let them fool you.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.770
Next time you go shopping, try paying attention
to your emotions about the PURCHASE not the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.009
DEAL.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.879
You know, check yourself, before you wreck
your credit card statement.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.781
Hey there deal seekers, why don’t you take
a moment and subscribe, doesn’t cost a thing.

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.650
I know I got fooled into it, but wanna know
how videos games trick you into spending real

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.650
money on fake stuff?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.110
Julian has that for you here, Funny thing,
bargain shopping can be passed down, so my

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.690
Mom’s love of a good deal probably corrupted
me too!

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.490
Just pay attention, you’ll be fine.
