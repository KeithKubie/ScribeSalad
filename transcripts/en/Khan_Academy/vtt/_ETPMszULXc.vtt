00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:03.634
- [Voiceover] The two-way
frequency table below

00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:06.386
shows data on type of vehicle driven.

00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:08.103
So, this is type of vehicle driven,

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:11.355
and whether there was an
accident the last year.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.445
So, whether there was an
accident in the last year,

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:17.020
for customers of All
American Auto Insurance.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.319
Complete the following two-way table of

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.455
column relative frequencies.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.616
So that's what they're talking here,

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:25.054
this is a two-way table of
column relative frequencies.

00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:28.792
If necessary, round your answers
to the nearest hundredth.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:30.209
So, let's see what they're saying.

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:31.741
They're saying, let's see...

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.841
Of the accidents within
the last year, 28 were

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:39.055
the people were driving an
SUV, a Sport Utility Vehicle

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:42.236
and 35 were in a Sports car.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:46.625
Of the No accidents in the
last year, 97 were in SUV

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.541
and a 104 were in sports cars.

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:49.832
Another way you could think of it,

00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:52.824
of the Sport utility
vehicles that were driven

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:56.400
and the total, let's see it's 28 plus 97

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.952
which is going to be 125.

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:03.458
Of that 125, 28 had an
accident within the last year

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:06.194
and 97 did not have an
accident within the last year.

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:11.177
Similarly, you could say
of the 139 Sports cars

00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:13.257
35 had an accident in the last year,

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:15.370
104 did not have an
accident in the last year.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.156
So what they want us to
do is put those relative

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:20.292
frequencies in here.

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:22.243
So the way we could think about it.

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:24.077
One right over here, this represents

00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:26.468
all the Sport utility vehicles.

00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:27.745
So one way you could think about,

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:30.346
that represents the whole
universe of the Sport Utility

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:35.022
Vehicles, at least the
universe that this table shows.

00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:38.356
So, that's really representative
of the 28 plus the 97.

00:01:38.356 --> 00:01:40.400
And so, in each of these we want to put

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.604
the relative frequencies.

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:43.342
So this right over here is going to be

00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:48.311
28 divided by the total.

00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:51.475
So over here is 28,
but we want this number

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:52.799
to be a fraction of the total.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.305
Well the fraction of
the total is gonna be,

00:01:56.305 --> 00:02:00.229
28 over 97 plus 28.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.642
Which of course is going to be 125.

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:06.173
Actually let me just write
them all like that first.

00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:11.173
This one right over here
is going to be 97 over 125.

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.115
And of course, when you
add this one and this one,

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:14.782
it should add up to one.

00:02:14.782 --> 00:02:19.570
Likewise, this one's
going to be 35 over 139.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.231
35 plus 104.

00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:23.550
So, 139.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.550
And this is going to be
104 over 104 plus 35.

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:30.692
Which is 139.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.293
So, let me just calculate
each of them using

00:02:33.293 --> 00:02:34.291
this calculator.

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.590
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.590
And so, if I do 28 divided by 125,

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.686
I get 0.224.

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:48.478
They said round your answers
to the nearest hundredth.

00:02:48.478 --> 00:02:51.450
So this is 0.22.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.065
No accident within the last
year, 97 divided by 125.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:03:00.065
So 97 divided by 125

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:02.966
is equal to, see here if I rounded

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:05.010
to the nearest hundredth
I'm gonna round up.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.010
0.78, so this is 0.78.

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:13.988
Then, 35 divided by 139.

00:03:13.988 --> 00:03:18.988
35 divided by 139,

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:23.566
is equal to, round to the
nearest hundredth, 0.25.

00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:25.866
0.25.

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:28.800
And then 104 divided by 139.

00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:34.086
104 divided by 139, gets me

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:39.600
if I round to the nearest hundredth, 0.75.

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:44.885
0.75, then I can check my answer.

00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.361
And I got it right.

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.824
But the key thing here is to make sure we

00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:50.078
understand what's going on here.

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:50.937
So, we could-

00:03:50.937 --> 00:03:53.027
One way to think about this is 22% of the

00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:55.929
Sport utility vehicles had an
accident within the last year.

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.273
Or you could say .22 of them.

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:02.546
And you could say 78% or 0.78 of the

00:04:02.546 --> 00:04:07.546
Sport utility vehicles had no accidents.

00:04:07.608 --> 00:04:10.186
Likewise, you could say
25% of the Sports cars

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:12.089
had an accident within the last year.

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:17.012
And 75% did not have
an accident last year.

00:04:17.012 --> 00:04:18.753
So, it allows you think more in terms of

00:04:18.753 --> 00:04:21.841
the relative frequencies,
the whole, the percentages,

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:23.374
however you want to think about it.

00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:27.052
While this gives you the actual numbers.
