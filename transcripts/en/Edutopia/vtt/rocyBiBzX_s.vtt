00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:02.800
(chattering)

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.880
- What we think about in
the examples that are...

00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:10.661
(cheering)

00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.792
- Very good job.

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:12.625
- Okay.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:13.660
- The power of the social brain

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.940
has been totally underestimated.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.930
It's a driving force in learning.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.070
It's the gateway to cognition.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.680
We have evidence that the social brain

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.150
is operating to assist learning
throughout the lifespan.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.300
So let's think about human babies.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.560
We know in the development of language

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.410
that there's a very important period

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.940
between six months and 12 months of age

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.690
where babies are mastering
the sounds of language.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.730
So we've done experiments
in which babies are exposed

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.283
to a foreign language right
at that critical moment.

00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:46.330
(speaking in Mandarin)

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.010
- They're listening to a Mandarin speaker

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.370
when they're growing up
in an English family.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.550
What we've demonstrated is
that if a baby at nine months

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.760
has 12 sessions of play
with a live human speaker,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.960
they learn so well that they're
statistically equivalent

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.540
to the babies in the foreign country

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.740
who've been listening for 10 months;

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.960
however, if the babies are
exposed to the same material

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.240
at the same time, same room, same dosage,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.800
but not exposed to a live human being

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.940
and instead on a beautiful
DVD, they stare at it,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.670
you think they're learning,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.770
but the brain tests following exposure

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.580
show that the kids in the
machine group learned nothing.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.690
The babies in the live
group learned so well

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.970
they matched the babies
in the foreign country.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.800
- Eli, when there was...

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.633
- To be 101.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.080
- So there's something
about being in the presence

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.550
of another human being

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.030
and watching the eyes and
watching the movements

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.290
and paying attention to
what that person is doing.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.463
That social context is
extremely important to learning.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.720
- Because, I mean...

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.510
- Get the chunks of candy.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.830
- We can see it in school-aged children

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.500
who use the social brain
when they're interacting

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.300
with one another to collaborate,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.880
when they're studying how
another person goes at it,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.000
when they're watching the
eyes even unconsciously

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.910
of their study partner to work
towards a solution together.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.850
In fact, I like to say the social brain

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.700
gates human learning.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.800
That without the
motivation and information

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.470
provided by the social brain,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.080
learning just doesn't
take off in the same way

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.423
that it does when the
social brain is engaged.
