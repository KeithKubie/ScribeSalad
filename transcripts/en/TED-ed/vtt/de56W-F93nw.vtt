00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.688
There are many stories
that can be told about World War II,

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:12.137
from the tragic to the inspring.

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.017
But perhaps one 
of the most heartrending experiences

00:00:15.017 --> 00:00:17.494
was that of the Akune family,

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:23.272
divided by the war against each other
and against their own identities.

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:25.880
Ichiro Akune and his wife Yukiye

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.473
immigrated to America
from Japan in 1918

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:31.108
in search of opportunity,

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:34.609
opening a small grocery store
in central California

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.634
and raising nine children.

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:39.591
But when Mrs. Akune died in 1933,

00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:42.224
the children were sent to live
with relatives in Japan,

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:45.342
their father following soon after.

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:47.366
Though the move was a difficult adjustment

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.539
after having been born 
and raised in America,

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.619
the oldest son, Harry, formed a close bond
with his grand uncle,

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.212
who taught him the Japanese language,
culture and values.

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:02.101
Nevertheless, as soon as Harry
and his brother Ken

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.966
were old enough to work,

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.692
they returned to the country
they considered home,

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:09.104
settling near Los Angeles.

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:15.344
But then, December 7, 1941,
the attack on Pearl Harbor.

00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:16.883
Now at war with Japan,

00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:19.636
the United States government
did not trust the loyalty

00:01:19.636 --> 00:01:25.548
of those citizens who had family
or ancestral ties to the enemy country.

00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:31.192
In 1942, about 120,000 Japanese Americans
living on the West Coast

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:32.863
were stripped of their civil rights

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:36.722
and forcibly relocated 
to internment camps,

00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:40.256
even though most of them, 
like Harry and Ken, were Nisei,

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:44.102
American or dual citizens 
who had been born in the US

00:01:44.102 --> 00:01:46.578
to Japanese immigrant parents.

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:50.982
The brothers not only had very limited
contact with their family in Japan,

00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:56.017
but found themselves confined
to a camp in a remote part of Colorado.

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:57.822
But their story took another twist

00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:01.448
when recruiters from the US Army's
military intelligence service

00:02:01.448 --> 00:02:06.174
arrived at the camp looking for
Japanese-speaking volunteers.

00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:09.126
Despite their treatment by the government,

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:12.179
Harry and Ken jumped 
at the chance to leave the camp

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.676
and prove their loyalty 
as American citizens.

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:17.341
Having been schooled in Japan,

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.923
they soon began their service,

00:02:18.923 --> 00:02:20.914
translating captured documents,

00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:23.279
interrogating Japanese soldiers,

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.107
and producing Japanese 
language propaganda

00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:29.869
aimed at persuading 
enemy forces to surrender.

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.763
The brothers' work was invaluable
to the war effort,

00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:35.238
providing vital strategic information

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:38.409
about the size 
and location of Japanese forces.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.972
But they still faced discrimination
and mistrust from their fellow soldiers.

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.233
Harry recalled an instance

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:47.403
where his combat gear 
was mysteriously misplaced

00:02:47.403 --> 00:02:50.999
just prior to parachuting 
into enemy territory,

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.503
with the white officer reluctant
to give him a weapon.

00:02:54.503 --> 00:02:57.780
Nevertheless, both brothers 
continued to serve loyally

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.222
through the end of the war.

00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:06.422
But Harry and Ken were not the only Akune
brothers fighting in the Pacific.

00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:08.820
Unbeknownst to them, two younger brothers,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.936
the third and fourth 
of the five Akune boys,

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:16.079
were serving dutifully 
in the Imperial Japanese Navy,

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.953
Saburo in the Naval Airforce,

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:23.757
and 15-year-old Shiro as
an orientation trainer for new recruits.

00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:28.961
When the war ended, Harry and Ken
served in the allied occupational forces

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.110
and were seen as traitors by the locals.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.839
When all the Akune brothers
gathered at a family reunion

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.240
in Kagoshima for 
the first time in a decade,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.420
it was revealed that the two pairs
had fought on opposing sides.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.021
Tempers flared 
and a fight almost broke out

00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:47.427
until their father stepped in.

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.568
The brothers managed to make peace

00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:53.686
and Saburo and Shiro joined
Harry and Ken in California,

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:57.224
and later fought for the US Army in Korea.

00:03:57.224 --> 00:03:59.953
It took until 1988 for the US government

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:03.130
to acknowledge the injustice 
of its internment camps

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.691
and approve reparations payments
to survivors.

00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:10.040
For Harry, though, his greatest regret
was not having the courage

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.273
to thank his Japanese grand uncle
who had taught him so much.

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:18.552
The story of the Akune brothers 
is many things:

00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:20.896
a family divided by circumstance,

00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:23.916
the unjust treatment 
of Japanese Americans,

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:28.506
and the personal struggle of reconciling
two national identities.

00:04:28.506 --> 00:04:32.645
But it also reveals a larger story
about American history:

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:37.749
the oppression faced by immigrant groups
and their perseverance in overcoming it.
