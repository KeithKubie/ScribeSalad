00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.480
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Hello.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.180
Welcome.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.480
&gt;&gt; Hi Maria.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.780
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Hi.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.080
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.680
I am Maria Russo.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.490
I am the Children's Books editor

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.380
at the New York Times
Book Review.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.630
Yes, I know, I have the
best job in the world.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.760
[applause] It's especially
exciting when I get to meet some

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.390
of the authors who
make such a difference

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.000
in our children's
lives, with their books.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.130
And the author we have
today is especially amazing.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.450
I think she's someone
parents, and children,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.880
will be excited to see.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.420
The parents, of course,
because Danica McKellar is also

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.520
an actress.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.930
Made a big difference in many of
our lives on "The Wonder Years".

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.400
Later on, "The West Wing",
on the Hallmark Channel;

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.790
we all have lots
of memories of her.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.800
But, I'm going to go
out on a limb and say,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.580
more important is
the work she's done

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.730
to help children feel
comfortable with math.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.930
And love math the way she does.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.000
Because of course, in addition

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.190
to all her other
accomplishments,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.450
she has a degree from UCLA
in math, she is a co-author

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.420
of a theorem in math;

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.540
she's really an overall
amazing person.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.280
So, let me just not
waste any more time.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.360
I just want to tell you
about her math book program

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.580
for parents, if you're
not aware.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.050
Her books cover birth to high
school geometry at this point.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.310
The program is called
McKellar Math.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.620
You can go on her
website, mckellarmath.com

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.350
and really see all the
books that she's done.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.890
Includes really, baby
books, books you can read

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.820
to your newborn, "Bath time,
math time" is the most recent,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.830
bringing numbers into bath time.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.430
Another very recent
book is for ages 6 to 8,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.540
it's called "Do Not
Open This Math Book".

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.410
So kids, do not open that book
if your parents bring it home.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.020
There it-- [laughter].

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.220
And many, many more for the--

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.390
I won't tell you the
titles of the teenage books

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.890
because they're very
appealing to teenagers.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.840
We have a young crowd here.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.020
And so, I am so happy to welcome
a really important person

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.290
in the world of children's
books, in the world

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.800
of math, Danica McKellar.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.080
[ Applause ]

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.380
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar:
Hello, everyone.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.680
How are you?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.980
[audience responding]
Oh, this is wonderful.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.760
I didn't know I was
going to have this.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.060
[laughter] That's great.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.360
I'm so glad to be here.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.550
This is my first time at
this particular festival.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.690
It's not my first time in
Washington, D.C. though.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.290
The first, actually I would
say the last time I was

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.900
in Washington, D.C.
speaking to a crowd,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.560
it was not at this festival,
but it was in the year 2000,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.190
in front of a sub-committee
of Congress.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.290
And in some ways, that visit

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.230
to Congress was the
beginning of McKellar Math.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.110
I'll tell you about
that in a minute.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.480
First, I want to back up.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.630
How many of you guys
remember "The Wonder Years"?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.930
[applause] Wow!

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.230
That's great.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.620
I forget, I actually don't
need this microphone.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.130
It's psychological; see?

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.500
Look, I can go like this and
you can hear me just as well.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.350
[laughter] So, how many of
you guys are afraid of math

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.750
or had ever been afraid of math?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.900
Hey, this is actually a crowd
that's not too math-phobic.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.360
That's amazing.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.750
I was afraid of math,
during the time when I was

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.050
on "The Wonder Years".

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.720
When I was in the 7th grade,
that's when the show started.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.580
And I still remember, and my
mom is here in the audience,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.570
she still remembers me
coming home and crying

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.080
because I was afraid
of my math homework.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.100
I'm sure most of us-- okay, I'm
actually thinking that a lot

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.880
of you guys didn't admit
to being afraid of math,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.690
at some point in your life.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.990
How-- okay, I'll rephrase it.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.860
How many people remember
ever taking a math test

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.980
and having fear?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.060
Like, that prickly feeling
in the back of your neck?

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.820
Yes, okay; that's more like it.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.360
Thank you for being honest.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.740
So, when I was in the 7th grade,
I had a really interesting time

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.850
because my teacher did not
explain the concepts very well.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.390
It was before I really
understood

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.860
that math is a language and
it needs to be translated,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.570
otherwise it remains
foreign and scary.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.150
Now, midway through the 7th
grade, through this year

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.980
of terror for me, our
teacher got switched out.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.360
We got a new teacher.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.660
And guess what happened?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.440
Do you think math got a
lot easier all of a sudden?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.820
Yes! The same exact
topics that had totally,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.270
totally scared me
suddenly made more sense.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.220
Like, so much more sense.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.440
And I'll never forget
this one quiz that I took.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.170
And it was that, we had
just gotten the new teacher

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.450
so I hadn't really
gotten her influence yet.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.980
And like I was just saying
with you guys, you remember

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.090
that feeling of being terrified
and just like, nauseous;

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.780
you're sitting there in front
of the test and you're like,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.600
"I don't know what's
going to happen."

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.240
That feeling of being
totally out of control.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.190
And it looked like
Chinese to me.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.240
And I had studied so hard.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.380
And the bell rang, and
it was still blank.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.720
And I couldn't understand; I
mean, I was like trying not

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.540
to cry and this new
teacher, Mrs. Jacobson,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.900
all the people were like getting
up and turning in their quizzes

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.620
and leaving and I couldn't move.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.810
I was just terrified and
horrified and embarrassed

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.540
and she let me stay,
for the entire recess

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.140
and just her having that
kind of faith in me,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.770
I started like writing
some stuff down.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.980
Like, I started like at least
getting some stuff on the page.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.170
And I ended up getting
a C on that quiz,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.430
which was some sort of miracle.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.310
But that was like a huge turning
point for me, where I realized

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.940
that my perception of my
experience and my perception

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.890
of the math and the way
math was being presented,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.730
was so much a part
of the equation;

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.390
not to like make a math pun.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.690
[laughter] But anyway,
that taught me

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.930
that the way you
present math was huge.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.210
So, that was a huge
turning point for me.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.270
I ended up loving the challenge
of math and going to UCLA

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.690
and getting a degree
in mathematics.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.460
Now, before I got my degree,
"The Wonder Years" ended right

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.760
at the end of high school.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.120
So, have you guys heard
about child stars?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.180
And some of the stuff that
happens to child stars?

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.860
Sometimes?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.940
And right, yeah, they
end up; I mean, it's sad.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.350
And it's not across
the board, by the way;

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.360
those are just the
stories that make the news.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.000
But sometimes, you know,
people fall on hard times

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.660
and I'll tell you why.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.850
It's a self-esteem issue.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.230
So, when you're done
with your big show,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.080
you start to wonder
what your value would be

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.170
if you didn't have that show,
because everywhere you go,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.560
that's what people talk about.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.120
Imagine if, when you were like
I don't know, 12 years old,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.500
you were on the soccer team and
you scored this amazing goal.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.940
And everybody talked about it
and it was the winning goal

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.240
and everybody was like, "Yay!

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.600
That soccer goal!

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.900
That was amazing.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.200
You scored!

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.500
You made the team win!"

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.160
And then the next year, people
are still talking about it

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.460
and it's like, "Okay,
that's cool."

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.850
And then like, five years later,
they're still talking about it.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.410
And 10 years later, they're
like, "Aren't you the one

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.980
who like scored that
soccer goal?"

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.870
You're like, "Yes.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.360
That was me.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.180
But I do other things now too."

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:51.260
Anyway, for me, mathematics
gave me this sense of self.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.110
Because it was hard, right?

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.250
Math can be challenging;
it can be really hard.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.530
But when you stick it through
and you just like keep trying,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.660
it gives you this
sort of confidence

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.830
that comes from feeling smart.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.340
And I got addicted to that.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.110
And it really helped
me get through those,

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.940
like "post-child star years"
at UCLA, where everybody,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.250
every day, said, "Hey, Winnie.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.620
Where's Kevin?"

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.770
You know? It's like,
"He's not here.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.070
And my name isn't 'Winnie'".

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.910
So, but let's face it, you don't
have to have been a child star

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.360
to struggle with your
self-esteem and your sense

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.900
of self as a teen girl.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.270
And that is also part of
what inspired the books.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.060
So let's fast forward now.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.790
I've gotten my degree in
mathematics and it became,

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.200
it became well known that I
had gotten this degree in math.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.090
People would-- it
like made headlines,

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.630
"Winnie is a math whiz".

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.460
But the cool thing that came
from that is that I was invited

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.870
to speak in front of a
sub-committee of Congress

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.600
about the importance of
women in mathematics.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.760
There-- how many of you guys
live here and work in politics

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.960
in any way, shape
or form whatsoever?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.370
Just curious.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.670
A little bit, okay.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.480
So there was a committee
who wanted to raise money,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.900
who wanted money from the
government for scholarships

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.450
for women in math, in college.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.870
And, they invited me to
come speak and testify

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.040
about the importance of women in
math, because I was sort of the

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.170
"celebrity math person",
math girl.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.350
And I read their 100-page
report, that they sent me.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.900
I read every detail and it
was clear, in their report,

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.200
and this was a lot of reading.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.500
It was pretty dense.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.390
I did research; I like, I
took this very seriously.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.060
I mean, I was like going to
"serve my country" or something.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.780
And, that's how I
thought of it anyway.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.800
I didn't think of it as a
commission that was using me

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.100
to try to get more money.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.450
I didn't think of
it like that at all.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.080
In fact, just the opposite.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.080
So, I read this report
and it was clear to me,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.810
that college is too late.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.110
It's too late by then.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.610
I was a girl in college,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.520
and I was a professional
mathematician for a summer.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.950
I helped to prove a new
theorem and I got a stipend

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.710
for that; I got money for that.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.610
And it wasn't hard,
because I was female.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.390
It would have been
easier if I'd have been

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.920
from a ethnic minority
group as well.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.560
So, I'm like, "You guys, this
is not where we need the money."

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.980
And I'm telling this to
Congress, not realizing

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.250
that the commission wanted
me to help them get money.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.500
Anyway, I said, "You
guys, it's in the report!"

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.820
I read the 100 pages and
my dad famously loves

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.970
to tell me the story that "You
looked at Congress and you said,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.160
'You probably didn't have a
chance to read all 100 pages,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.460
but I did.'" [laughter] Yes.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.440
And I said, "And it wasn't
in the executive summary."

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.030
And it's true, it wasn't
in their executive summary.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.650
Middle school is the
time when girls start

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.170
to lose competence in math.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.930
That's when it drops
off, it's middle school.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.230
It's too late by college.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.080
By college, they've
already dropped out of math.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.990
So I was-- and I really took
this seriously, and I mean,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.990
I took an oath and I was going
to tell the truth and I--

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.090
didn't occur to me that I
was going against the people

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.390
who had brought me out there.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.690
That's okay.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.990
And they didn't get the money.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.160
[laughter] But I told, I
said, I said, "I," I said,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.080
"math needs better P.R.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.380
; we need to help these girls.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.140
We also need stronger middle
school teachers because so many

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.960
of them are thrown
into a situation

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.260
that they're not ready for.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.000
You know, they're the
gym teacher or the such

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.160
and such teacher and because
we don't have enough money

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.550
for middle school math teachers,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.700
we're not attracting
enough good talent.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.540
So this is where we need
to put our emphasis."

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.680
And I pledged to Congress that
day, "I will do everything I can

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.050
to get math better P.R."

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.020
I said, "I feel like I'm in
a unique position to do so.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.320
And this is what
I pledge to you."

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.530
So yes, right here
in Washington, D.C.,

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.020
this is the beginning, this was
the genesis of McKellar Math,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.220
when I made that pledge
to Congress back in 2000.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.560
So, [applause] aw, thank you.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.300
It was right here, in this city.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.440
And then a few years later,
I wrote my first book.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.980
It was called, and
I think it's okay

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.580
to say this; can
I say this title?

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.800
I can say the title of my
book: "Math Doesn't Suck".

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.490
Maria didn't want to
say it in my intro.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.530
Look, I'm appealing to
middle school kids, okay?

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.470
Yeah, "Math Doesn't Suck: How
to Survive Middle School Math

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.620
Without Losing Your Mind
or Breaking a Nail."

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.110
And the whole point was, "Look.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.410
Math is not just for boys.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.380
Math can be for everyone.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.480
You can be smart and savvy and
yes, a fabulous, glamorous girl,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.020
if that's what you want.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.350
You don't have to
choose one or the other".

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.030
So that became my
platform for a while.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.120
It was my pledge to Congress,
"This is what I'm going to do;

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.600
give math better P.R. and I'm
going to focus mostly on girls"

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.080
and I did that for my
middle school books.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.030
So that's "Math Doesn't Suck,"
which teaches fractions,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.040
decimals, percents,
things like that.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.560
"Kiss My Math" which
is pre-algebra.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.000
And there's [laughter] I feel
bad, "Hot X: Algebra Exposed";

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.970
that is the algebra book.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:53.560
And then "Girls Get Curves:
Geometry Takes Shape"

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.730
for high school geometry.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.280
So those are those books,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.370
and they were New York
Times best sellers,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.240
they still sell really well.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.800
I'm super proud of them and
they are both math books

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.290
that teach math, using really
fun analogies and also,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.010
self-esteem building books.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.320
They're books where I say,
"Look, you can do this.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.410
You know, a diamond is
formed under pressure.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.280
You know, when math gets hard,
when you think you can't do it

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.200
and you struggle with it and
you stick with it anyway,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.590
and then you finally solve it,

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.420
this is what I call
a math high."

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.020
It's, you teach yourself
that you're stronger

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.940
and smarter than you thought.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.530
And that is a gift that
you'll give yourself

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.180
that nobody can give
you except for you,

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.520
and nobody can take away.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.320
[applause] Thank you.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.110
Building that kind
of self-confidence,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.270
that comes from feeling
smart, that doesn't come

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.720
from the outside
world, that doesn't come

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.370
from the clothes you're
wearing or the makeup

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.340
or how many selfies you take
or how many likes you have

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.970
on Instagram; all that stuff
is fun and it's superficial;

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.980
it's not going to give you that
feeling inside that you need

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.320
to survive in this world.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.340
Because life, is
challenging in so many ways.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.820
In so many ways that you
don't see on social media.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.990
So many-- the everyday
stuff is tough, right?

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.540
When you're a kid, I see a
lot of kids in the middle,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.470
in the front here, on
these lovely bean bags.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.630
Why don't I have a bean bag?

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.970
I want a bean bag.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.330
You have to be in math
class anyway, right?

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.320
You have to be in math class.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.510
Okay. So math happens
to be a great place

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.430
to sharpen your brain.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.730
It's just a great opportunity.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.030
And since you have
to be there anyway,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.540
why not use that opportunity
to sharpen your brain for real

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.330
and get stronger and smarter,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.970
because those tools will help
you no matter what you do

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.270
in your life.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.220
For real. Listen to what I say.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.160
[laughter] So, those
are the books for girls.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.720
Then I had parents, "Can
we write books for boys?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.020
Can you go younger?"

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.470
And I'm thinking, "Okay,
yeah maybe younger."

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.330
At the time, so I had my son,
he was one years old and I said,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.410
"You guys, I'm taking a break
from writing, because I want

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.950
to spend time with my
little guy" and I did.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.670
And then a few years later,

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.200
once he became a
little more independent,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.220
I started writing again and I
answered the call of the parents

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.060
which is, "Okay, we'll
do some co-ed books

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.930
and we'll go younger".

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.240
What I didn't realize was that
math was about to change and,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.630
for these like little kids.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:32.070
Okay, how many of you guys
are aware of common core math?

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.340
Yes. How many of
you guys are like,

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.370
"Why did they change math?"

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.730
Yeah, why?

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.180
It's not, like it's
not necessarily

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.550
that it's bad, it's just "Why?"

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.390
Well, I actually think
there are some good things

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.400
about common core math, I do.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.770
There are some good things.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.480
But it does make the math
itself look more complicated.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.400
So parents are saying to me,
"I don't know how to help my 6

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.780
and 7 year old with
their math homework.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.620
How did this happen?"

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.850
You know, and I agree.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.490
As parents, you figure,
"Okay, I want to help my kid

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.770
in any way I can, and someday
the math might get so hard

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.070
that I won't be able to do it."

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.720
Luckily, getting a degree
in math, I saved myself

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.160
from that one, but it's
very common, right?

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.460
Because math is the
kind of thing,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.970
if you don't practice
it, you'll forget it.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.340
So, how many of you guys have
kids that age, 6 and 7-ish,

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.620
and you've already
run into that issue?

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.180
Where like, "Why does
this look different?"

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.950
Yeah. So, I couldn't
believe that there isn't--

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.720
and common core started
I believe around 2011.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.490
And I think it was
implemented throughout states

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.790
at different rates.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.680
But I had-- so I couldn't
believe there wasn't a resource

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.650
that helps parents and kids
with the new way it's taught.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.940
So I did that.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.080
That's this book, "Do
Not Open This Math Book!"

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.900
This is for ages 6 to 8.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.250
It addresses the
addition and subtraction

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.560
and the new way they teach it.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.160
So, there's all sorts
of new vocabulary.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.670
In fact, at the end of the book,

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.570
I have the "new math"
translation guide for grownups.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.710
[applause] Because they
don't call it "borrowing"

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.010
and "carrying" anymore.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.290
Because you're not
technically borrowing it

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.540
because you're not going to
give it back; okay, fine.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.560
But the carrying, I
actually think is not bad;

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.320
I don't know why they
changed that one.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.030
But now it's regrouping and
ungrouping and some people call

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.910
"ungrouping" and regrouping;
there's not even uniform.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.610
But anyway, I break it down
and I make it super fun.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.890
And like all my books, the
point is, "Let's make this fun.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.840
Let's make it accessible
and doable."

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.380
And so there's all
sorts of cartoons

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.750
and Mr. Mouse is the guy.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.900
Mr. Mouse is the one
who's afraid of math.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.790
He's the one saying,
"Don't open this book!"

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.050
You got a copy; so
there are comics,

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.100
there's also a little
cartoons where a parent

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.900
and child can read it together.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.290
Draco, my son and I,
we like doing that.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.340
He likes reading the
Mr. Mouse character.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.080
Mr. Mouse is always
causing trouble.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.700
So why not teach
math in the context

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.550
that kids are going
to respond to?

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.990
Right? Why not?

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.630
We have choices and why
not make that choice.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.530
So that is, "Do Not
Open This Math Book".

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.240
I've also got kid,
like little kid books.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.320
"Good Night, Numbers" which
by the way, I was so excited,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.070
yesterday, I got to
read "Good Night,

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.260
Numbers" at the Library
of Congress.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.740
It was such a huge honor,

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:26.490
and they live streamed the
event; it was just awesome.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.790
I'm so grateful.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.180
It was really neat.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.480
You never know.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.680
Also, "Good Night, Numbers"
is, Sesame Street did a video.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.320
Elmo and Bob read
"Good Night, Numbers".

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.110
You can find it on YouTube.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.800
I was like so impressed.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.420
So, "Good Night, Numbers" is
having a nice time right now,

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:52.900
and I'm very proud of that book.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.100
That's for little kids; that's
you know, going from 1 to 10,

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.800
as you get ready for bed.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.610
And it shows different
families getting ready for bed

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.910
and counting along the way.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:10.030
So, and I know we're going
to open it to questions

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.110
in a few minutes, right?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.780
If you guys have any questions,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.950
I'll talk for just a few
more minutes and then

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.350
if you have questions, there
are two microphones here.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.000
I think I have somewhere
between 5 and 10 minutes left.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.550
Because I saw the 10
minute marker a bit ago.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.300
If you have any questions,
line up and let me see

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.860
if there's anything
else I wanted

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.340
to tell you guys
about specifically.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.360
Parents ask me, you know,
"What advice do you have?

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.970
What advice do you
have for my kids

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.270
to keep them interested in math?

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.570
To just help them in
general, besides the,

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.870
you know, the instruction?"

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.170
And there are a couple
things that I say to parents.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.470
One is, from the earliest
time you possibly can,

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.770
point out math, in
the real world.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.070
Just demonstrate.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.370
It can shopping at the grocery
store, and you're showing,

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.670
you know, if you buy three
pounds of turkey and it costs,

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.970
you know, $5 a pound, you know,

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.270
show the multiplication
in the real world.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.570
Show it around them.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.870
Or show them the same thing
in reverse, with division.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.170
If we've got this much money and
it costs this much, per pound,

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.470
how many pounds can we buy?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.770
Just show them how it's actually
all around us all the time,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.070
because it is amazing to
me how many people say,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.750
"When am I ever going to
use math in real life?"

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.050
What about money?

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.880
Money makes the world go round.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.020
[laughter] And math is
the language of money.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.050
I spoke to an inner city school
in Michigan, several years ago.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.720
And it was 50% below
the poverty line.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.740
And I remember this
audience looking at me like,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.640
"What are you going
to tell me, woman?"

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.710
And I won them over when
I said, "Hey, you guys;

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.010
the better you are at math,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.100
the less likely you
are to get ripped off."

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.660
And by the way, how many of you
guys want to start a business?

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.960
Ever thought of starting
your own business?"

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.280
Math-- you have?

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.660
Oh yeah; okay, well how many
of you guys ever thought

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.960
of starting your own business?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.540
Yeah, you have?

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.840
Yeah, it's great.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.140
Owning your own business
is empowering;

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.630
you're not working
for somebody else.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.930
But guess what?

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.200
Guess what's going to
keep the doors open?

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.560
Math. Yes.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.010
Because there are a lot
of really talented people

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.910
out there, who are artists
or they have great ideas

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.000
for businesses, but guess what?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.830
They don't know how to
manage their own money.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.890
Why? Maybe because they're--
they avoided math as a child.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.090
And if you're afraid of math
as a child, you're going

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.790
to avoid numbers as an adult.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.090
You're just going to avoid them.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.970
And that gets you in trouble.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.310
And now I have five
minutes; I've got more

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.610
than five minutes of questions.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.910
Oh no. Okay.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.210
One last little story.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:28.850
Well no, I'll tell a
story at the very end.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.150
Okay. Yes.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.450
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.750
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Uh oh.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.050
Mic's not on.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.350
&gt;&gt; There it is.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.650
&gt;&gt; Oh, hi.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.950
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Hi.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.250
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask about
your writing process.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.550
About how long does it take you
to write one, like one book?

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.200
And if you kind of have little
guinea pigs to test out,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.500
you know, to make sure

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.660
that people are understanding
what you're writing on the book?

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.960
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Yes.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.500
Well, the books take
a few years to write,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.940
because of the illustrator
and all that approval process.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.010
My son is seven; I homeschool
him, so I test stuff out on him.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.180
But, I also have
teachers read them.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.650
Because I, I'm not in
the classroom and I want

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:00.960
to make sure that
all the research

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.510
that I'm doing actually
is applying.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.210
And I get so much
wonderful information.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.040
I talk to teachers before I
even start writing the books.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.190
Then I write a draft, then
I send it out to a bunch

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.520
of teachers, we talk--
yeah, for sure.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.830
Yes, this side.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.130
&gt;&gt; Okay. [inaudible comment]

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.430
&gt;&gt; Um, wait.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.730
&gt;&gt; Tell her.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.720
That you love [inaudible]

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.590
&gt;&gt; I love you on "MC Squared".

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.750
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar:
Thank you, so much.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.050
Aw, thank you.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.390
[applause] There's a
show on Netflix called

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.560
"Project MC Squared" and I play
the mom of the main character,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.070
but I'm also the head
of the super secret

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.160
like spy organization,
comprised of only women.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.550
And I play the Quail and [deep
voice] I use a voice like this.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.500
I say, "Girls, your
next mission is..."

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.800
whatever it is.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.840
"Go find that guy who stole
the diamond" you know.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.140
It's really fun.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.550
&gt;&gt; She also wanted to tell you
that we do this kind of math

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.850
in her Montessori school.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.150
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Oh!

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.670
&gt;&gt; So, thank you for
bringing it to everybody.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.970
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: My pleasure.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.270
Thank you.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.570
Yes.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.870
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.170
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Hello.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.470
&gt;&gt; I also just wanted
to say thank you.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.860
Because I had a really horrible
middle school math experience.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.320
And you taught me geometry
and algebra and now I'm a TA

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.710
at my university in
the math department.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.010
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar:
Oh my goodness!

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.310
That's amazing!

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.610
Oh, I love that.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:14.910
I love those stories, you guys.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.210
That makes me so happy.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.510
Thank you.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.960
&gt;&gt; So hi. I'm actually
the opposite.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.370
I'm actually a mathophile, so--

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.670
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Love it.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.020
&gt;&gt; Love math, and science.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.480
I'm wondering more, when are
you going to go through and go

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.260
under your curves for calculus?

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.560
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Calculus.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.590
You know, I would really
enjoy writing a calculus book.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.880
If I go older, that's--
I'd probably jump to that.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.020
I probably wouldn't do the
trigonometry, pre-calc;

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.350
I'd probably jump to calculus.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:45.600
So maybe someday, because
that would be a lot of fun.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.900
Yes.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.000
&gt;&gt; Hi. What inspired
you to become the Quail

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.130
in "Project MC Squared"?

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.200
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: So,
before it was on Netflix,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.710
"Project MC Squared" was being
produced by a show called

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.810
"Awesomeness TV" and it
didn't have any money yet

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.790
and they were super,
like, little.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.090
They didn't know
what they were doing.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.400
And they actually reached
out to me and they said,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.550
"We think that you'd be
so great for this role,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.410
because it's a super
strong woman.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.620
The whole show is
about using STEM,

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.640
math and science,
to solve crimes."

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.130
And so, I was thrilled
that they chose me.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.430
So, I was like, "Yes, yes."

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.750
My manager was like, "They're
not paying you enough."

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.050
I'm like, "I don't care."

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.920
Once Netflix got
involved, they paid better.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.860
But, I was so happy to
be part of the project

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.090
from the beginning and to
help them get off the ground,

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.980
because I was like, "This
show is 'Charlie's Angels'

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.430
for teenage girls, but
they use math and science

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.080
and they're super
glamorous too."

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.380
It's so cute; you
guys should check it

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.520
out if you haven't seen it.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.820
Do we-- two minutes.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.120
Okay. Yes.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.180
&gt;&gt; How many pages did
it take you to read--

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.480
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: What?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.780
How many pages--

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:49.020
&gt;&gt; long did it take you
to the-- 100 page book?

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.320
report?

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.110
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: I can't
understand; I'm sorry, what?

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.790
&gt;&gt; She wanted to ask
how long did it take you

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.480
to read the 100 page report?

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.780
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: How
long does it take me

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.490
to read a 100 page book?

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.740
&gt;&gt; The 100 page--

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.040
&gt;&gt; The Congress--

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.480
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Oh gosh!

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.680
I mean, this was 18 years ago.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.980
18 years ago.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.280
But, I spent weeks with it.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.170
I don't know that it took
me that long to read it,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.740
but I spent weeks with
it and researching it.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.280
I just graduated from UCLA,
so I was in like, study mode.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.950
I was super all over it.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.690
Yeah, I don't remember but I
spent a lot of time with it.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.130
Probably way more time than
they thought I was going to.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.900
[laughter] One minute.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.030
Any other kids left that
wanted to ask a question?

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.330
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.240
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Yes, okay.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.930
Oh, shoot, there's-- okay.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.830
Super quick.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.130
&gt;&gt; What in--

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:41.040
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: Okay wait,
in the meantime, you have one?

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.250
&gt;&gt; What was the hardest
type of math?

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.550
&gt;&gt; Danica McKellar: The
hardest type of math

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:51.500
that I ever took was probably
real analysis, in college,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.510
where you prove the theorems
that you, the calculus theorems

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.810
that you learn in
your first two years.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.920
But it was also my favorite.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.060
But part of why I liked math is
because it was so challenging.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.110
Because I was like, "Oh,
there's no way I'm going

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.890
to be able to do this."

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.180
And I'd, "Oh, that
sounds like a challenge.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.230
I wonder if I-- oh, I can."

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:18.980
This is-- I approach a
lot of life like this.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:24.530
There was this song that
Tom Layer wrote called

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.660
"The Elements".

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.370
Does anybody know what
I'm talking about?

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.990
[applause] You do?

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:40.690
So I memorized this song when
I was 11 years old because I,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.860
my dad said this would be
impossible to learn this song.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.790
And I was like, "Yeah,
it really would be.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.280
Hmm." And sure enough,
he helped me.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:58.160
We wrote it all out, because
there was no internet back then.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:05.740
So you couldn't just
find the lyrics online.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.040
And I learned it.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.650
Challenges are great.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.150
They're great for you.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.920
When you see a challenge,
instead of being like,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.220
"Oh no," be like, "Yay!

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.430
I get to challenge myself now,"

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.610
because you got to
enjoy challenges.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.520
Learn to enjoy challenges.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.210
Learn to embrace them
because they're going

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:34.420
to keep happening your entire
life, in all categories of life.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.020
And one last thing I'm going
to say to wrap this up is

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:42.350
when people say, that math
can't help you in life, okay,

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.790
I just want to tell a story.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.090
You never know.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.110
Look, I'm leaning forward again.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.410
Psychological.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.710
So, have you guys ever heard

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.030
of a film festival called
the Sundance Film Festival?

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.960
It's in Utah; Robert Redford
started it a long time ago

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.340
and now it's this big thing.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.870
It used to be for
independent films,

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.810
now it's for like big films.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:17.150
Anyway, many years ago, shortly
after I graduated from UCLA;

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:22.020
and by the way, while I
was there, I was a tutor,

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.320
a calculus tutor in
the math department.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.620
I love calculus; I really do.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.920
It's a great, it's
a great course;

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.220
you guys should all take it.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.520
And, so I tutored many people
there, while I was there

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.820
and I graduated and I
went to this film festival

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.120
because I had a short film
that I produced and directed

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.420
and everything, and
that was a lot of fun.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.720
Its own kind of challenge.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.020
And they have these parties.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.320
These legendary parties
at Sundance,

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.620
where you can't get
in to these parties.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.920
Like, there are these lines;

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.220
I don't know how people
actually get into the parties,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.520
but I got in line for
one of these parties.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.820
And I had some friends with me

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.120
and I saw bigger name
celebrities than me,

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.420
in front of me and behind me in
line, and I'm thinking, "Okay,

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.720
we're not getting in."

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.020
The bouncer spotted me
and said, "Hey, Danica!"

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.320
I'm like-- he goes, "It's John!

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.620
Come here!"

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.920
I'm like, I'm like--
the queue were looking

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.220
at me like, "Who do you know?"

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.520
And I'm walking up there
and he goes, "It's John.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.820
You saved me in calculus at
UCLA in the tutoring department.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.120
Get your friends
and get in here!"

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.420
[laughter] It was so great.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.720
Anyway, the point
is, math is powerful.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.020
Math makes you powerful.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.320
People are in awe of
math and they are in awe

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.620
of people who are good at math.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.920
For some reason, why?

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.220
It's a foreign language
and it can be challenging.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.520
But if you are the kind of
person who embraces challenges,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.820
that will serve you for
the rest of your life.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.120
So embrace those challenges.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.420
Doing math is like
sharpening your brain.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.720
It will get you better at math

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.020
and all kinds of
other challenges.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.320
So please, don't shy
away from math, you guys.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.620
It's going to be great for you.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.920
You're going to chisel
your brain,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.220
like an artist would a sculpture
and that will serve you

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.520
and be there for you for
the rest of your life.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.820
Thank you so much.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.120
I look forward to signing
books for you at 11 o'clock.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.920
Thank you.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.920
[applause]
