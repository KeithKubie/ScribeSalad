00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.280
Just recording data isn't sufficient.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.450
Certified EHRs must provide
tools to use that data

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.970
to improve care quality
through functions like these.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.440
We earlier discussed the key
role medications play

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.530
in managing chronic disease and
the many problems they currently create.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.570
So note that the first four of these all
relate to improve medication management.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.230
Also note that the EMR must
be able to calculate and

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.200
submit clinical quality measures.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.320
Remember that as we discuss the key
role that quality measures play

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.060
in determining meaningful use.
