00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
NARRATOR: Hampi, India.

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:10.543
Here lie the ancient
ruins of Vijayanagara

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:13.079
believed to have been
constructed between

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:17.683
the 14th and 16th centuries AD.

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:21.521
At its center stands the
Vittala temple complex,

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.357
a masterpiece of
Indian architecture

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.095
and the largest and most
revered temple in the city.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.563
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA:
Vittala temple was

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:34.500
built with the mind of creating
a celestial palace here

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.803
on earth.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:43.309
With that in mind, the king
assembled the great architects,

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:46.579
and great engineers,
and then great craftsmen

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.581
to create this
wonderful building

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:54.420
that can also have a wonderful
sound that will please God.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.322
LAYNE LITTLE: Attached
directly to the temple

00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:02.195
is what is called the Ranga
Mantapa, or the stage pavilion.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.565
Here there are many
pillars, some reaching

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.601
to a height of nearly 12 feet.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.404
There's a series of what are
called compound pillars, where

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:14.607
you have a central pillar
surrounded on all sides

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.610
with smaller colonnettes.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.579
These colonettes are
famous because when

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:23.316
they're struck they emit
beautiful and haunting sounds.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.585
[music playing]

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.756
NARRATOR: According to the
local guides at the temple,

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.328
the 56 pillars are individually
tuned to one of the seven notes

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:39.732
of the Sarigama, an ancient
Sanskrit musical scale dating

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.336
back thousands of years that
is still predominant in Hindi

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.771
music today.

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.907
LAYNE LITTLE: Certain
groups of these pillars

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.577
have been crafted to
represent the tonal

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.516
vibrations of the scale
for different instruments.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.850
[music playing]

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:02.255
Some being crafted to
represent Woodwinds,

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.358
some being crafted to
represent percussion

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.392
instruments, et cetera.

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.197
JONATHAN YOUNG: The British,
when they were in charge

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.534
of India, were mystified
by this amazing quality,

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.538
and actually cut one of the
pillars to see how it was done.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.773
But it was just
granite and it was

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.676
just very careful workmanship.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.678
NARRATOR: While the
stone pillars themselves

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:29.215
seem like simple
technology, recent analyzes

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.350
have revealed they
may be comprised

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:34.420
of an advanced geopolymer
blend of granite

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:38.658
with silicate particles
and metallic alloys.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.427
But what continues
to puzzle scientists

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.564
is that the first basic
geopolymers were invented

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:48.434
in the Soviet Union
during the 1950s,

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:52.438
hundreds of years after
these pillars were crafted.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.308
ROBERT SCHOCH: As a
geologist, how this was done

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:59.245
is really baffling and amazing.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:02.448
I've heard reports of
people trying to mimic it

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:06.452
in modern times to try to just
do a little section of it,

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:07.653
even one pillar.

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:08.854
[music playing]

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:11.290
And people just haven't
been successful.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:13.459
So what were they
doing back then?

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:14.360
We just don't know.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:21.400
According to Hindu priests,
each of these pillars

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:24.937
was specifically tuned
harmonically in order

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.340
to communicate with the gods.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.342
[music playing]

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:32.411
So you have to wonder, did
extraterrestrial beings

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:35.481
come down and give
instructions on creating

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:38.518
these specific frequencies?
