A read me file can technically
be written in any file format.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.570
You can make your read me web page,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.390
a simple text file or
even a made up format if you wanted to.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.380
For this lesson,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.165
you'll be generating your read me
using language known as markdown.

00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:16.710
Markdown let's you generate
well formatted read mes

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.240
by translating them into HTML.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.260
Sites that you may use often as
a developer, such as GitHub,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.950
Stack Overflow, Slack, and even Reddit,
all use versions of markdown for

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.565
quick and
easy formating of your content.

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:32.945
One of the main advantages to using
markdown is that we can make read-mes

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.585
that are easy to skim through.

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:36.255
Take a look at these two recipes.

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:38.355
Both of these have the same information.

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.135
But without even needing to
read the contents of each,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:42.965
which one would you rather follow?

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:45.805
The recipe on the right is
formatted in a way that makes it

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:47.053
easy to skim through.

00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:51.850
When writing read-mes, take advantage of
the awesome features markdown gives you

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.310
to make sure they are easily readable.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.140
You'll practice writing markdown
in the next few nodes, but

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.850
first I'll be giving you a quick
guide to markdown syntax.
