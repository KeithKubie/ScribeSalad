00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.690
Sally is an
architect who creates

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.320
a blueprint of a
rectangular dining room.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.640
The area of the
actual dining room

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.470
is 1,600 times
larger than the area

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.690
of the dining room
on the blueprint.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.070
The length of the dining room
on the blueprint is 3 inches.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.160
What is the length of the
actual dining room in feet?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.760
So there's a couple of really
interesting things going on

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.260
here.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.660
They give us the dimensions
of the blueprint in inches.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.130
We want the actual
length in feet.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.010
And then they tell us that the
area of the actual dining room

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.120
is 1,600 times larger.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.590
So they're not saying that
the scale of the blueprint

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.540
is at 1/1600.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.290
It's going to be
something less than that,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.956
and let's think about what
that scale is going to be.

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:50.830
Let's just think about
some different scales.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.670
Let's say that this
is my blueprint,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.480
and this is the actual
reality of the dining room

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.069
that we're thinking about.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.500
And my blueprint
is let's just say 1

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.320
by 1, just for the
sake of argument.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.740
Now, if this was a 1 by 1 square
and we increased the dimensions

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.170
by a factor of 2, so
it's a 2 by 2 square,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.370
what's the area going to be?

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.690
Well, this area
is going to be 4.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.080
This area is 1, this area is 4.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.265
So you notice that if we
increase by a factor of 2,

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.960
it increase our area
by a factor of 4.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.722
Or another way of saying, if we
increase each of our dimensions

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:46.430
by a factor of 2,
we're going to increase

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.510
our area by a factor of 4.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.530
If instead we increased
each of our dimensions

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.180
by a factor of 3, this
would be a 3 by 3 square,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.670
and we would increase our
area by a factor of 9.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.539
So notice, whatever factor
we're increasing the area by,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.250
it's going to be the
factor that we're

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.740
increasing the
dimensions by squared.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.700
So let's just think
about it that way.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.670
So they're telling us
that we're increasing

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.450
the area by 1,600 times.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.610
Actually, let me just clean
this thing up a little bit.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:32.810
So one way we could imagine
it, if our drawing did

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.100
have an area of 1,
which we can't assume,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.260
but we could for the
sake of just figuring out

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.870
what the scale of
the drawing is.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.640
Let me clear all of this here.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.100
So the area of the actual dining
room is 1,600 times larger,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.220
and so if the drawing
had an area of 1,

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.010
then the area of the
actual dining room

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.850
would be 1,600 So
what would I have

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.420
to multiply each of
the dimensions by

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.160
to get an area factor of 1,600?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.180
Well, if I multiply
this dimension

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.350
by 40 and this dimension by 40,
we see 40 times 40 is 1,600.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.010
You might say, hey, Sal,
how did you figure out 40?

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.160
Well, the 16 is a big clue.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.870
We know that 4 times
4 is equal to 16,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.020
and so if you gave a 0 to each
of these 4's, if you made it

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.500
40 times 40, then that
is going to be 1,600.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.790
So this information
right over here

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:47.170
tells us that the scale
factor of the lengths is 40.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.400
That would result in an scale
factor for the area of 1,600.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.030
So that's a good starting point.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.820
Now let's go to the actual
dining room on the blueprint.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.570
So the actual dining
room on the blueprint

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.819
doesn't have these dimensions.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.530
We just used that to figure
out the scaling factor.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.430
The actual dining
room on the blueprint

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.217
has a length of 3 inches.

00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:08.800
So maybe it looks
something like this.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.758
They don't give us any
of the other dimensions,

00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:15.870
so we can even imagine a 3 inch
by 2 inch, 1 inch, whatever

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.390
we want.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.649
We could even imagine a
3 inch by 3 inch square.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.520
They only care about the length.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.865
Now let's multiply both of
these by a factor of 40.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.490
And we only care
about the length here.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.823
They actually say what's the
length of the actual dining

00:04:29.823 --> 00:04:30.390
room.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.200
So let's multiply it,
and obviously, this

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.460
is not drawn to scale.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.960
Let's multiply this
times a factor of 40.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.860
So 3 times 40 is 120,
and this, of course,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.270
is what we're referring
to as the length.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.270
Now, you might be tempted
to say OK, we're done.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.500
This will be 120.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.125
But remember, this
is 120 inches.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.190
So what is 120 inches
in terms of feet?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.440
Well, 1 foot is
equal to 12 inches.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.110
If we were to multiply
both of these times 10,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.612
we know that 10 feet
is equal to 120 inches.

00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:19.570
Or another way you could
have thought about it,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:28.270
you have 120 inches divided
by 12 inches per foot

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.690
is going to give you 10.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.555
So 120 divided by-- 120 inches--
let me write it this way.

00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:42.645
120 inches divided
by 12 inches per foot

00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:46.980
is going to give you 10 feet.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.010
So that's the actual length
of the dining room in feet.
