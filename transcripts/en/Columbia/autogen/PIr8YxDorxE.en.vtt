all stuff I just invented you know or

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410
all stuff I just invented you know or
 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.839

stuff that other people have just
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.330
stuff that other people have just
discovered it is brand-new science but

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
discovered it is brand-new science but
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340
discovered it is brand-new science but
you know the what they're actually

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
you know the what they're actually
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.140
you know the what they're actually
supposed to take away from it i think is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
supposed to take away from it i think is
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.279

sometimes daunting what are they

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
sometimes daunting what are they

supposed to get out of it they're

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
supposed to get out of it they're
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.700
supposed to get out of it they're
supposed to get again the tools of how

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
supposed to get again the tools of how
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.429

you do science so how you estimate

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
you do science so how you estimate
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.650
you do science so how you estimate
things how you post hypotheses how you

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660
things how you post hypotheses how you
 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.209
things how you post hypotheses how you
develop proxies to study things that you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
develop proxies to study things that you

can't actually put your fingers on like

you know how hot is a magma we can't

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
you know how hot is a magma we can't
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.160
you know how hot is a magma we can't
really stick a thermometer in a magma

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
really stick a thermometer in a magma
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.150

but there's various tools we have

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160
but there's various tools we have
 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.780

it's teaching those kind of steps to the

it's teaching those kind of steps to the
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340
it's teaching those kind of steps to the
students which is a little challenging I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
students which is a little challenging I
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.440
students which is a little challenging I
don't actually care if they know how hot

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450
don't actually care if they know how hot
 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.090

magma czar but I want them to understand

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
magma czar but I want them to understand
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.110
magma czar but I want them to understand
that what the concept of a proxy is go

about developing their science tool you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
about developing their science tool you
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.730
about developing their science tool you
need I think that's it I think it's a
