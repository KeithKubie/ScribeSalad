00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.500
So, my name is Nikolas Blanchet, I'm 31 years

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.930
old, I currently live in San Francisco, California though

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.850
I have lived all over the United States and

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.540
I am, have been diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.920
&gt;&gt; And what is Bipolar II Disorder?

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.990
&gt;&gt; Bipolar II Disorder is characterized

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.410
by long periods of depression-like symptoms.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.160
some, lethargy, lack of motivation, lack

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.620
of ambition. periods periods of hopelessness,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.240
periods of sadness. Although not everyone experiences

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.870
it in the same way. in addition to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.180
that, bipolar 2 had a fundamental twist where

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.610
you've also got periods of what's called hypomania.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.331
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:41.550
&gt;&gt; hypomania is like a less extreme form

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.530
of mania, mania being where you have a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.360
complete break from reality. And you are hyper

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.630
energetic, hyper optimistic. you usually take a lot of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.590
risky behavior. For example sort of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.530
the characteristics that my doctor always tells

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.590
me to watch out for is give me a call if you decided that

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.240
you're going to Vegas and going to buy a yacht for the weekend because

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.600
it might seem a lot of fun so bring me in on the fun.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.420
[LAUGH].

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.360
&gt;&gt; I see and so you, then you've experienced these symptoms yourself.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.440
&gt;&gt; I have have hypomania. So, what I described was mania. Hypomania

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.870
is a less extreme form. And that's one of the reason why bipolar

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.160
2 disorder is actually mis characterized and misdiagnosed, which was the case

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.360
with me. hypomania, in my case,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.020
manifested as periods of extreme sociability. hypersexuality.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.930
extreme productivity at work. And less sleep than normal. Also

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.310
with bipolar II disorder the hypomanic periods are rare, so one

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.740
to two times a year, and fairly brief. somewhere between

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.100
three and seven days, which is very different than standard mania.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.960
&gt;&gt; I see. And when were you diagnosed?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.160
&gt;&gt; I was diagnosed bipolar II disorder in November of 2012.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.440
&gt;&gt; Ok so you've only known then

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.271
for a low little time.

00:01:59.271 --> 00:01:59.895
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:02.423
&gt;&gt; And how, how has that affected you.

00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:04.789
How how did how how did that come about.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.209
&gt;&gt; So I am I have diagnosed with depression for and this

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.397
is apparently by the way a very typical story. I had been diagnosed

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:16.237
with depression for about five years. I was going to psychiatrist and a

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:18.905
psychologist regularly and they would prescribe

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:22.140
various antidepressants, none of which would work.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.160
And, in fact, my symptoms, over time, gradually,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.820
but, but noticeably, trended worse and worse and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.820
worse. after I moved to the Bay Area.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.060
my psychiatrist that I got out here, pointed out

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.030
that I might actually not be responding well

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.050
to the medication, because it was treating something that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.350
I didn't have. And, instead, he sw-, suggested

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.500
that I switch to mood stabilizers. Well, the confirming

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.540
fact came after I was taking a very high dosage of an

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.820
antidepressant. And through the end of November, and through most of December,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.350
I had a very very bad period of depression. I had no

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.520
motivation to do anything. I was very sorry I looked at the camera.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.100
&gt;&gt; No problem.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.130
&gt;&gt; I had a very, very bad period of depression. I had no motivation to do

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.090
anything. I stopped going to work. It was

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.730
pretty bad. And, then, when I went back and

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.210
saw him again. He prescribed a, what's called a

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.750
mood stabilizer. Which is different than an anti-depressant. A mood

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.620
stabilizer, the most famous of which is, Lithium. They

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.722
are also, they're actually the class of drug is, anti-epileptic.

00:03:26.722 --> 00:03:26.934
&gt;&gt;

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:29.700
&gt;&gt; And they, they basically cut off the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.150
peaks of bipolar II disorder, which is helpful.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.800
&gt;&gt; Great, so after you started this regimen of

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.640
of, of, of drugs then you didn't experience the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.330
depression and the hypomania that you've been experiencing previously.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.940
&gt;&gt; Right. And another thing I want to point

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.140
out about bipolar II disorder that makes it so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.450
difficult to to diagnose. Is you don't go to

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.500
your, if you think about it, you don't go to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.110
your doctor. And you don't tell your doctor by

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.010
the way my arm is not broken, right? You don't

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.270
tell him when you're not having a problem. And

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.140
when you spend such a long period of your life

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.080
in a dark place, in a, in a depressed state. Which is the way bipolar II works.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.240
when you have these brief periods of hypomania, you

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.470
feel like that's how your life should always be.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.861
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:14.820
&gt;&gt; Because it doesn't seem alarming, when it's going

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.290
on, and people aren't alarmed by you, because it's

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.410
not that complete snap from reality. So, when I

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.170
would go to my doctor I never mentioned these periods.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.771
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:25.930
&gt;&gt; now I don't have them anymore, but

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.380
I'm a lot more stable in my day-to-day life.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.520
&gt;&gt; Nice, well that leads me to another question sort of about

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.030
advantages and disadvantage here. You've touched on them briefly but from your

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.710
own perspective, I mean are there any advantages to being or have

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.560
you shown symptoms of bipolar and, and. I'm also curious on the disadvantages.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.550
&gt;&gt; So the advantages I've never really thought of it that

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.185
way. one thing they don't tell you is that hypomania is awesome.

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:51.450
[LAUGH]

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.730
It feels really good. you're an animal in bed, you are hyper productive

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.508
at work. You have a lot of energy, you are really social, you're really

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:04.315
charming, you're really dynamic. you can be a little bit more risky with

00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:07.660
your behavior but not so much so the people are like scared for you.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.992
&gt;&gt; mm. So the people just think bad

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:10.658
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:13.914
you basically feel like you're king of the world for

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:17.221
a period of time. and so I guess that's an advantage.

00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:18.007
&gt;&gt; mm.

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:21.411
&gt;&gt; I guess you can also say there's this philosophical

00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:25.692
advantage of knowing what pain is but lets that's just crazy.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:26.488
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:28.110
&gt;&gt; Which is what I am, so that's okay.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.590
&gt;&gt; the the disadvantages are obviously work disruption,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.270
right? So that's the biggest one. With me

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.730
these long, drawn out periods of silence. And you know

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.560
as a friend of mine like I would go through

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.570
periods where no one would hear from Nick. Where's Nick?

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.540
I would just disappear. Because keeping up appearances and making sure

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.530
the people around me are comfortable, having a good time,

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.850
is important to me. Ans so when I was in a

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.160
bad place I, instead of like being the negative guy

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.730
around everyone all the time, I just sort of removed myself

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.850
from the situation. And of course, there is social stigma and stuff attached

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.720
with it too, which makes it complicated.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.480
Makes it difficult to have relationships. Makes

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.010
it difficult to stick to tasks. I stopped and started college a number

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.840
of times and looking back it probably had a lot to do with this.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.460
&gt;&gt; mm. I don't want to blame this for all of my problems, right? I still

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.020
have good days and bad days. I'm still

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.790
mortal. I still make mistakes. But I suppose

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.290
now that I think about it, another advantage of bi-polar disorder and having had

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.160
it diagnosed is I get insight. I know a little bit more about why things

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.380
happen why am I this way. Why, why it gives context. It doesn't excuse

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.990
things I still have things I need to work on.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.810
But it gives a little context about what my struggles might

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.410
be about the things that I need to watch out for.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.770
It also makes sure that I exercise because that's very helpful.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.890
&gt;&gt; In your mind based on the

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.520
advantages and disadvantages you've shared with us, if

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.190
you could not be bipolar II, would you choose that for yourself at this point.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.390
&gt;&gt; Definitely. this isn't something, this isn't something like being

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.470
gay or being or, I don't know, being artistic, or something

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.810
Where it might seem like a disadvantage at a period

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.860
of time in your life, but then contextually, it, it gets,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.580
you know, better over time, or you're able to socialize it,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.480
or come to peace with it. Even if you come to

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.500
peace with being bipolar, which, I'd like to think I have,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.720
but it's pretty quick. It's still early on, I've only, I haven't

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.530
even been diagnosed for a year yet. even after coming to

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.350
peace with it though, it's not, it's not really something that

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.680
is a good thing. I mean, if I have kids, I'm,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.070
I'm a carrier for this, potentially, from what I understand? You're the

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.740
geneticist, so you tell me. but, I've got a

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.940
huge family history of it. It, it creates, it's

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.390
something that you have to disclose when you date,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.740
which is not fun. see, I'd rather not be.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.110
&gt;&gt; Well, so you touched on two points that are really interesting. How do

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.930
other people perceive you as someone who

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.920
is bipolar? What's the general reaction? How,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.520
how is it perceived by others, just strangers, say the general public, but

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.900
also your friends, have they responded,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.010
and what's your reaction to their reactions.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.970
&gt;&gt; When people who I know, and have known for a period of time,

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.050
find out that I'm bipolar, I tend to get one of two reactions. One is

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.150
generally supportive, in saying oh, well, I'm

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.990
glad you're getting this managed, I'm glad you've

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.980
got some stuff. And the other one's sort of like Duh, I could have told

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.605
you that!

00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:35.230
[LAUGH]

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.890
Not because it manifested. Because, but because, you know? They're,

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.970
because they have noticed these trends that I have. And they

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.919
knew that there was something up, but they never knew

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.990
what it was. And so, okay, this makes sense that you've

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:52.820
got this. I have, I have been. Let me start

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.120
that over. I have also, sort of taken it upon myself

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.900
to sort of raise awareness, it's one of the reasons

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.350
why I was willing to do this interview. So, I do

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.900
actually tell people who I don't know well, and I

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.090
admit it earlier on. Admit it sounds like the wrong

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.050
word. and I disclose this earlier on rather than later,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.740
because it's not my fault, it's nothing I did, it's

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.980
just a trait that I've got! I've got blue eyes,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.830
I've got a slightly crooked nose, I've got a red

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.790
beard and red hair. I'm also bipolar. And so it's

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.630
just something that I've inherited. And most people that I've noticed

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.400
when I tell them

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.261
they sort of.

00:09:29.261 --> 00:09:29.942
[LAUGH]

00:09:29.942 --> 00:09:32.030
The number one reaction I get is that they name

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.860
someone else that they know and are close to that is,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:40.840
that is bipolar 1 or 2. and they immediately look for

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.830
some sort of connection. And so my reaction to that, when

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.610
people look to try and humanize it and make a

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.970
connection with me as I, I don't know, I, I want to

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.060
go into detail. It makes me, it makes me feel like

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.900
I'm not doing this on my own, if that makes sense.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.237
&gt;&gt; Sure. Are

00:09:55.237 --> 00:09:58.580
they really negative reactions? Do people ever, I mean, I

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.750
heard you make a joke earlier about, you know, oh,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.400
I'm crazy. do people, are there any misperceptions out there

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.518
that you've found about bi-polar, and, and what are this misperceptions?

00:10:09.518 --> 00:10:13.890
&gt;&gt; There's, bi-polar II specifically, I've noticed,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.200
also sort of has a. Other people

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.840
who have Bipolar II disorder, a lot

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.360
of times they've been living with depression or

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.130
bipolar II for a very long time undiagnosed. And they've set

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.550
a lot of habits in place. And they've come to a

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.460
lot of, I feel like not good self image. And a

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.810
lot of people that I have met who are bipolarII actually

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.640
want to blame everything on the illness. Like they'll say you

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.320
know, why would I you know I I told my boss

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.010
the other day, well, I"m bipolar so I shouldn't have to

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.530
deal with this. And so that it becomes this tug of war

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:51.240
between integration with society, becoming a productive member, and actually

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.460
doing what you need to do to, to handle your disability.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.330
&gt;&gt; you mentioned previously too that, you said you

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.350
have a family history of this. Now, from a genetics

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.810
prospective elucidating the genetic component of bipolar disorder along with

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:10.920
many other mental sort health conditions, anything from schizophrenia

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.320
to autism has been very difficult to

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.950
identify single genetic cause, even several genetic

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.010
causes, and most of the findings have

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.430
indicated smaller contributions of individual genes here

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.070
and there. The search continues with gelomyrtol

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.660
association studies. Now people are trying to

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.040
move into whole genom sequencing of people

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.830
who have been diagnosed. we're curious to know,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.260
what is your family history of bipolar and any

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.140
other mental health condition that you think might be related?

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.200
&gt;&gt; My family on my mom's side were crazy.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200
&gt;&gt;

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.360
[LAUGH]

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.650
&gt;&gt; Like it's just for real, real. so my

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.800
mom, my mom was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. And

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.610
she's, she was actually on the same medication that

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.280
I am on now for a while. But she never

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.680
told me this. Growing up with a sort, and,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.530
and, and you can read up on this more if

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.100
you're interested, but growing up with sort of a, like

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.410
a, a, a mentally ill parent causes a lot of,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.370
like you'd react to things slightly differently. Like I keep

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.450
my mom at an arm's distance and she sort of felt

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.390
embarrassed by stuff, and so there wasn't a lot of

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.680
disclosure about the health situations and the, and the traits that

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.880
we've got. So I'm only recently finding out a lot

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.950
of this stuff that my mom's got. She's also been diagnosed

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.540
well, I'm going to caveat this by saying that this is

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.070
all reported by my mother. So I actually, obviously, I don't,

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.490
I'm not privy to her medical records. But, according to my mother, there are

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.630
also depression, and ADD, and And

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.520
sometimes, depending on the doctor she sees, a personality disorder like

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.378
borderline or something. my sister, one of my younger sisters, suffers

00:12:54.378 --> 00:13:00.500
from depression. my dad is the actually,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.160
on that side of the family. He is the most ADD person I

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.120
have every met in my entire life. Like, you know, the Wikipedia hole.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.900
Where you just keep clicking on

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.740
hyperlink after hyperlink after hyperlink, until you've

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.910
got a million tabs open. Yeah, like,

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.440
he can't use Wikipedia, because it's paralyzing.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
&gt;&gt;

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:14.852
[LAUGH].

00:13:14.852 --> 00:13:16.710
&gt;&gt; His, his weekend will be gone.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.800
&gt;&gt; So, it sounds like you have, you

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.030
know. Immediate and extended family that have also demonstrated

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.050
similar symptoms of depression and possibly even mania

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.180
like you say in your, in your mom hypomania.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.650
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.100
&gt;&gt; and how does that make you feel

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.400
about a connection with other people genetically speaking

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.230
and otherwise. Do you feel a kinship with

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.030
other people that have been diagnosed with bipolar?

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.880
or do you think of these people, as in,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.700
they're just other people, and, happens to be a

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.910
trait as well, or is this part of a

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.200
broader thread that you think ties you to other people?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.924
&gt;&gt; Well, I definitely think there's shared experience. but the social

00:13:53.924 --> 00:13:58.346
stigma against a lot of mental illness, particularly bipolar, too, because

00:13:58.346 --> 00:14:00.854
it just sort of looks like laziness a lot of the

00:14:00.854 --> 00:14:04.990
time. the social stigma there actually even affects the people who

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.960
have it. Right? So, I find myself, when

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.380
I'm not, you know, thinking this through, behaving logically,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.410
I find myself not wanting to associate with other

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.970
bipolar people, wanting to hold them at arms' distance,

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.480
not wanting to find some sort of community.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.150
because what do we have in common? What? We're

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.620
all crazy. Why should we celebrate that? This is

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:30.530
a problem, and, yet, that shared experience is helpful.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.840
sometimes you can get insights from very interesting and different

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.200
places that you would never think about. So, and about

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.060
areas in your life, and managing areas in your life,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.210
like the exercise thing. Exercise has been a huge impact on

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.730
my life. And that, I mean, my doctor mentioned it

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.930
but it didn't really sink in until I saw the high

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:52.320
functioning people who are bipolar, too, all exercised. But then,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.800
again, maybe I thought they were high functioning because they exercised,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:54.920
&gt;&gt; sure

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.340
&gt;&gt; and I like,

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.690
that's what it is for me. I don't know.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.240
&gt;&gt; So when you, you, when you bring that up just the sort of give all of

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.910
our students a generally well rounded perspective here.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.220
Are you telling us that bipolar II is manageable?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.710
&gt;&gt; Very manageable. Bipolar II is unlike some other mental

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:20.241
illnesses. bipolar II is it's incredibly manageable with medication alone,

00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:23.850
actually. it, it responds extremely well.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.950
Some of the, more modern, psychological

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.530
treatments, like cognitive behavioral therapy, they

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.970
have had some success as well

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.470
but not nearly as much as they've had in other areas. This

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:39.240
is very easily fixed and managed with, just taking a pill everyday.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.650
&gt;&gt; do you know of any specific genetic risk that you have

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.680
for bipolar? Have you, has your doctor told you about a specific

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.000
genetic risk you might have? Or you discovered any

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.730
particular gene or genetic risk you might have for bipolar?

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.840
&gt;&gt; I've been told, and, I've been told

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.380
that it is heritable. That it was likely

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.590
in my family, but that doesn't necessarily mean

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:04.010
genetic. So, I wasn't told specifically about genetics.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.990
&gt;&gt; What do you think about the portrayal of

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.850
mental health in general, both in media and in

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.250
society at large, how we deal with it as a population.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.700
Do you think we take mental health seriously, do you think? It's

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.040
portrayed in a meaningful way that gets the right kind of

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.790
attention, or do you think we still have some work to do?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.280
&gt;&gt; I definitely believe that in the area of portrayal of mental health, well,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.940
in the area of how the average person thinks of mental health, we have some work

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:41.850
to do, because It's one thing, it's easy to look at someone and say you have

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:47.120
a broken leg, you have a scratch, you've been burned. But when it permeates

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.640
the mind, when it permeates the thing

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.030
that sitting behind the eyes looking back at

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.720
you it's hard to say well, you're an

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.540
asshole versus you have an issue. And because

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.540
it's so difficult to recognize in the first

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:10.050
place, we tend to, overlook it, minimize it and,

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.400
and not give it the type of treatment that we

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.950
should. I went through a period actually where insurance was

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.270
not quite clear for me, and so I ended up

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.550
going to a public clinic to try and get some

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.670
assistance with this not long after my diagnosis. And it

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.160
was I'm glad the public clinic existed. It was, it

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.520
was nice that San, the city of San Francisco who

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.390
funded it has decided to make this type of program available.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.540
But it was dehumanizing. I, it was, there're six

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.600
slots available on a Saturday. And the doors open

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.370
at 9. And you're allowed to, you're allowed to

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.860
start lining up at 7 a.m. If you're the seventh

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:54.170
person in line, you will not be seen. And so I got up at 6am and I made my

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:59.450
way down to Soma, which is quasi-sketchy area of

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.460
San Francisco. And I wanted in line with other people

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.870
who were potentially, violently, mentally ill. And I knew

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.170
nothing about it. And for, you know, the first hour

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.580
and a half it was completely unsupervised. there was

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.010
no one there, there was no guard, there was no

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.460
nothing. It was just a bunch of people who

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.160
were there. Several people who had had a chronic mental

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.370
illness came up and, had gotten into line and then

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.720
when the security guard finally came, she recognized a lot

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.570
of these individuals as people who apparently came very

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.580
frequently. And told them that we already had the correct

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.040
number of people online. So basically returning them away.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.860
Even though they were in the correct order online. And

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:44.330
that whole period, it made me recognize that a

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.070
lot of these people who were online, I mean, a

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.650
lot have been addicted, they now had, were missing their

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:53.800
teeth, they were now And possibly weren't even very educated

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.190
to begin with. And these are people who,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.030
certain people, certain areas in America, they consider people

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.560
like that to just be leeches on society. To

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.330
be people who should be not assisted because they

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:12.240
should just fix their own lives. And i look at them, and I see how lucky I

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.090
am to be privileged in many ways, to actually

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.522
have been educated, to have a, to have a,

00:19:18.522 --> 00:19:23.520
better-than-average mind that sounds really conceited to, to have

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.870
sort of some of these self-perceptions and tools and

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.780
that I'm able to get help. And I wonder when I see them if they were able to get

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.840
help earlier, how different would their lives be. Would

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.800
their lives actually have been very productive? Would they have

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.020
been able to get back like I've been able

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.590
to do? So yeah, I think there are major challenges.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.740
&gt;&gt; If you could say

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:49.448
one thing or one message, generally speaking, to other people who have bipolar

00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:54.980
I or II. Or people who may wonder if they do. Maybe haven't been diagnosed.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.100
But have been going through issues themselves. If you could give them a message,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.390
or tell them something. Is there anything, in particular, you would want to say.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.750
&gt;&gt; If I had have a message for somebody who is bipolar II I would

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.710
definitely say seek medical assistance. this

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.525
is something that responds very well to

00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:18.120
treatment. And once you've gotten that

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.700
proper treatment, once you've been able to

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:25.060
help yourself out, then you can live a very, very satisfying and happy life.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:30.600
If you can't afford medical treatment, exercise. It actually goes a long way.
