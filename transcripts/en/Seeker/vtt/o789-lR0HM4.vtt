00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.280
Walking on the Moon is harder than it looks, and the early astronauts proved that over and over.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.980
If crews were going to work on the lunar surface
for more than a couple of hours, they needed

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.299
a better way to get around.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.910
So NASA and its contractors developed a revolutionary space vehicle, and the Apollo

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.360
15 astronauts would be the first to drive
it on the Moon.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.740
The concept of a cosmic car predated the Apollo
Program.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.809
Futuristic lunar vehicles were featured on
the pages of science fiction books dating

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.700
all the way back to the early 1900s.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.620
But when NASA was ready to actually develop
a lunar vehicle, reality set in.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.460
Designing and building a vehicle capable of
operating in the Moon’s extreme environment

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.800
was not going to be easy.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.899
Nothing like this had ever been done before,
and because of that, every major manufacturing

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.879
company wanted in on the job.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.970
Throughout the 1960s, NASA conducted studies
with various contractors to determine the

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.560
best design for the lunar vehicle.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.160
Some of the ideas were pretty outrageous.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.320
There was the Lunar Worm, a vehicle
that would inch its way across the lunar surface.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.320
And the Lunar Leaper which would use "pogo
sticks" to hop across craters.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.520
But of all the designs, a massive mobile laboratory,
dubbed MOLAB,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.340
was one of the first under serious consideration.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.540
At the beginning of the Apollo Program, the
space agency planned for a dual launch scenario

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.400
in which the lunar vehicle would be sent into
orbit on its own rocket.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.600
This was the only way a &nbsp;mammoth vehicle
like MOLAB could get to the Moon.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.600
But by the mid-1960s, the cost of launching
two rockets became unsustainable.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.340
Scientists then shifted gears to developing smaller
lunar vehicle concepts.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.800
At the time, we hadn’t landed on the Moon
yet so the surface composition was still uncertain.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.180
Engineers experimented with different materials
and tested prototypes in the Arizona desert

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.599
where the terrain was believed to be similar
to the Moon.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.049
At the Marshall Space Flight Center, the newly
established Lunar Roving Task Team used the

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.780
test data to determine the specifications
for the final design.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.320
In 1969, NASA announced that Boeing would
be the contractor to bring its

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.720
Lunar Roving Vehicle to life.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.060
The manufacturer built several mock-ups and
tested them in specialized chambers that mimicked

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.630
the extreme low-gravity vacuum of the
Moon.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.440
In just 17 months, Boeing delivered flight
ready Lunar Roving Vehicles

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.900
for the final Apollo missions.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.579
The LRV was powered by two 36-volt silver-zinc
potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.760
that would last up to 78 hours during the
lunar day.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.299
Its tires were made of a woven mesh of zinc-coated
piano wire, and titanium treads riveted

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.360
in a chevron pattern prevented the wheels from
sinking into the lunar soil.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.540
Each wheel was equipped with an electric motor,
propelling the vehicle to a top speed

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.999
of 13 kilometers per hour.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:25.439
Its frame was made of welded 2219 aluminum-alloy
tubing, keeping the vehicle light yet strong

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.249
enough to carry over twice its weight.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:34.359
The LRV frame hinged in the center enabling
the entire car to fold into a compact package

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.359
small enough to stow in the Lunar Module.

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.109
The Apollo astronauts practiced deploying
the new vehicle from the spacecraft and tested

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.780
out the rover’s T-shaped hand controller

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.160
which allowed them to navigate in their bulky spacesuits.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.240
LRV training was crucial as the upcoming missions
would spend more time on the lunar surface

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.200
than any mission before, traversing large
portions of the Moon’s mountainous regions.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.950
In order for this to happen, the Lunar Roving
Vehicle needed to work as planned and the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.859
astronauts only had a few months to master
its maneuvers.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.420
Apollo 15 was the first mission to launch
with the LRV onboard.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.199
Mission Commander Dave Scott was on his second
Apollo mission while Lunar Module Pilot Jim

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.260
Irwin and Command Module Pilot Al Worden were
on their maiden space voyages.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.720
Once in lunar orbit, Scott and Irwin flew
the LM to the Moon with the LRV in tow.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.280
They pulled off a difficult landing in the
Hadley Rille region,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.300
chosen for its diverse geological landscape.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.080
The crew's first test drive was rocky.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.540
[Astronauts] I don't have any front steering, Joe.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.020
The front-wheel-drive wasn’t working so
Scott had to manage

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.680
with just the rear-wheel-drive system.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.400
But the LRV was still able to adequately
transport the astronauts as they searched

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.150
for anorthosites which are believed to be
the Moon’s oldest rocks.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.960
The Lunar Roving Vehicle traveled nearly 28
kilometers across the lunar surface over a

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.220
period of almost three days.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.640
The crew’s only major complaint had to do
with the restricting seatbelts - a major success

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.460
considering all that could have gone wrong.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.780
When the astronauts wrapped their work on
the Moon, they headed back to the Command

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.040
Service Module, leaving the LRV behind.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.060
The next astronauts to drive on the Moon had
a few extra months of training with a new rover.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.759
Aside from lengthening the seatbelts, no major
changes were made to the vehicle.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:43.000
On April 16th, 1972, Apollo 16 and its LRV
launched into space.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.870
Four days later, astronauts John Young and
Charles Duke landed in the Moon’s Descartes

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.849
highlands while Ken Mattingly stayed back
in the Command Module.

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.759
Young and Duke successfully deployed the LRV
and spent the next three days traversing nearly

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.040
27 kilometers in search of volcanic rock - which
they never found.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.620
But the astronauts did unveil a new understanding
of a previously unknown part of the Moon,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.340
which wouldn’t have been possible without
the Lunar Roving Vehicle.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.699
While it was only used for a small portion
of the Apollo Program, the Lunar Roving Vehicle

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.690
revolutionized space exploration.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.520
It gave astronauts the ability to do three
times the amount of work

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.620
that would be done on foot.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.840
And after Apollo, engineers used the LRV to
help design rovers for the Mars Pathfinder

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.160
project which paved the way for the Spirit
and Opportunity rovers.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.380
The LRV’s stint on the Moon was cut short,
but the vehicle played a big part in NASA’s

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.200
original plans for life on the lunar landscape.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.090
Dreams of lunar colonization, however,
came to a close with the end of the Apollo

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.900
Program which went to the Moon for a final
time with Apollo 17.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.080
Seeker’s Apollo series explores each Apollo
mission and

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.340
explains how the program revolutionized space travel.
