00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.620
Talking about this certain percentage of the word beings.
Half of Brazil has the,

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.560
he has the brain worm that makes you basically psychotic.
Well,

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.190
it doesn't make you psychotic and risk taking crazy.
It affects your judgment.

4
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:14.700
This is toxic programs.
You'd want to have more catch Mel Piss.
Yes.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.160
Well it definitely does that to,
to rats.

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.050
It actually reprograms rat's brains makes them sexually attracted as much

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.560
parasites.
Yes.

8
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.540
There's a bunch of them and there's some that probably haven't even been

9
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.660
identified.
That's where the whole crazy cat lady thing comes from.
Yes,

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.560
that's exactly what it is.

11
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.720
It's one of the reasons why they tell women when they're pregnant to stay the

12
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.640
fuck away from cat litter.
Don't touch cat litter.

13
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:35.160
Don't get on with your baby cats.
Yes,
you,
I mean it's,

14
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.410
it can be actually fatal for babies,

15
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.550
but what I'm trying to get yelled at him cash.

16
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.500
Well I'm sure there's a lot of factors there,
right?

17
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.790
She old wives tales were like,
you get demon possessed by that cat and it really,

18
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:48.870
it's a damn brain worm.
Well.

19
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:50.710
That's probably also why they told you not to eat pork.

20
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.820
And that's a real brain worm programming you,
like you were saying earlier,

21
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:54.660
it's true.
I looked,
it's true.

22
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.410
I didn't know that at the top soccer teams have the highest level of brain worm

23
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.430
infestation.
Well,
it's,

24
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:03.660
there's a disproportionate amount of con people that live in countries where the

25
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:06.900
high toxoplasmosis infection would say it's successful soccer teams.

26
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.220
There was some study that was done on that where we had a doctor,

27
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.760
Robertson women that more sexually promiscuous.
They just,
yes,

28
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.750
it's recklessness.
Yes.

29
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.910
And they think that men are more reckless and that's why there's a

30
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.360
disproportionate amount of motorcycle victims that test positive for

31
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:22.380
toxoplasmosis.

32
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.930
This is where the Robert Sapolsky at Stanford University was telling us,

33
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:28.380
is there a way to remove,
I don't think they're right.
Warm.
Yeah.

34
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.030
I don't think there is.
Well,
you know,

35
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.940
there's like snails that get a brain one that programs that go to the top of a

36
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:36.450
tree shall birds eat it.
Yeah.
And then,
and then it's crapped out in the snails.

37
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:39.420
Eat that and then go and then just food cycle.
Yes.
Yes.
Show how,

38
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.530
don't tell me and classic evolution.
And I'm also believe the interpretation by,

39
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:47.740
by right wingers of the Bible,
that's not what it says.
But obviously evolution.

40
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.440
There's a big quick jumps,
but we know what's going on.
But the idea that just,

41
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.490
there's worms and there's all these different,

42
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.770
talking about the one that gets into a grasshopper,

43
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.290
the aquatic worm gets inside of a grasshopper's body and gets the grasshopper to

44
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.160
commit suicide,

45
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.120
gets a grasshopper to jump into water and drown and then it comes out of its

46
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:08.820
body.
And that's where it lives.
It lives in the water.

47
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.420
So it literally gets its host to commit.
So that chain of events,

48
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.610
how does that evolve where suddenly a worm gets in the grasshopper and does

49
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:20.070
something,
a super computer,
couldn't do it.
Programs to drowned itself?
Well,

50
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:22.350
this is a matter of complex biology.
I mean,

51
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:27.330
so I think it's insanely complex and it's something that scientists are studying

52
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.740
on a daily basis.
You're going to get through that and coming up,
cause I'm gonna,

53
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.410
I don't want you to talk about me all day.
