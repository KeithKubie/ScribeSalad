Gregory: Three times a week,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.480
I wake up really early
and leave Paris.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.920
I kept it secret,
because people might

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.240
think I'm crazy.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.880
Even my family didn't know.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.360
It's like leading
a double life.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.800
We are going to an island,
where I have a farm.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.400
[gentle music]

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.360
I started with nothing.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.280
It was really difficult to make
the field harvestable.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.360
You just have to be humble

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.200
in front of natural 
elements.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400
When I grew
my first organic potatoes,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.480
I was so happy.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.240
I was worried
about the world

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.000
we're going
to leave to children.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.360
If they want to be healthy,
if they want to grow,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.640
they need to have healthy food.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.560
And after seven years,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.960
we provide more than 500
schools and daycares in Paris.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.680
This is my contribution,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.480
to prepare the future
generation to change the world.
