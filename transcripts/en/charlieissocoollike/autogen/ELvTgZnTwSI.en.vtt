happy Valentine's Day let's talk about

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
happy Valentine's Day let's talk about
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.610
happy Valentine's Day let's talk about
making babies shall we figures about

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
making babies shall we figures about
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.369
making babies shall we figures about
time then science fun science fun

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379
time then science fun science fun
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.589
time then science fun science fun
science is a science of fun yeah so

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
science is a science of fun yeah so
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.080
science is a science of fun yeah so
personally I find reproduction to be one

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
personally I find reproduction to be one
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.060
personally I find reproduction to be one
of the most irresistible topics to learn

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
of the most irresistible topics to learn
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.650
of the most irresistible topics to learn
about in science I think this is for a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
about in science I think this is for a
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.300
about in science I think this is for a
couple of reasons one because I'm a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
couple of reasons one because I'm a
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.670
couple of reasons one because I'm a
human and humans like to reproduce we're

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
human and humans like to reproduce we're
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.769
human and humans like to reproduce we're
pretty good at it too but also because

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
pretty good at it too but also because
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.830
pretty good at it too but also because
so much of reproduction it's just so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
so much of reproduction it's just so
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.050
so much of reproduction it's just so
incredibly weird it's a variation of mad

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
incredibly weird it's a variation of mad
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.990
incredibly weird it's a variation of mad
and wonderful and disgusting methods

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
and wonderful and disgusting methods
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700
and wonderful and disgusting methods
that organisms on this planet used to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
that organisms on this planet used to
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.610
that organisms on this planet used to
reproduce is so vast but every single

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
reproduce is so vast but every single
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.889
reproduce is so vast but every single
different possible type of reproduction

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
different possible type of reproduction
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.869
different possible type of reproduction
that exists on this planet fits into

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
that exists on this planet fits into
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.520
that exists on this planet fits into
just two different groups asexual

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
just two different groups asexual
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.959
just two different groups asexual
reproduction and sexual reproduction

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
reproduction and sexual reproduction
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.880
reproduction and sexual reproduction
asexual reproduction is the method

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
asexual reproduction is the method
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740
asexual reproduction is the method
whereby the offspring is an exact

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
whereby the offspring is an exact
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.470
whereby the offspring is an exact
genetic copy of its parent a clone

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
genetic copy of its parent a clone
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.119
genetic copy of its parent a clone
basically and this can happen in a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
basically and this can happen in a
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.439
basically and this can happen in a
number of different ways as fission

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
number of different ways as fission
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.389
number of different ways as fission
where the original organism grows and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
where the original organism grows and
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.979
where the original organism grows and
splits itself into two separate

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
splits itself into two separate
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110
splits itself into two separate
organisms this is what bacteria used to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
organisms this is what bacteria used to
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.580
organisms this is what bacteria used to
reproduce there's budding where a large

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
reproduce there's budding where a large
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.470
reproduce there's budding where a large
organism creates a little bud on its

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
organism creates a little bud on its
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.760
organism creates a little bud on its
surface with the correct genetic

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
surface with the correct genetic
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.529
surface with the correct genetic
material in it that then breaks off and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
material in it that then breaks off and
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420
material in it that then breaks off and
grows on its own it's how yeast

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
grows on its own it's how yeast
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.710
grows on its own it's how yeast
reproduces and then there's also

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
reproduces and then there's also
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420
reproduces and then there's also
vegetative reproduction where you take a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
vegetative reproduction where you take a
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520
vegetative reproduction where you take a
cutting from a plant plant that cutting

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
cutting from a plant plant that cutting
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.260
cutting from a plant plant that cutting
in the ground and let it grow into its

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
in the ground and let it grow into its
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.300
in the ground and let it grow into its
own organism sexual reproduction on the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
own organism sexual reproduction on the
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.260
own organism sexual reproduction on the
other hand the one that you're probably

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
other hand the one that you're probably
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.030
other hand the one that you're probably
more familiar with is where two cells

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
more familiar with is where two cells
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.219
more familiar with is where two cells
from two separate organisms a male cell

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
from two separate organisms a male cell
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.170
from two separate organisms a male cell
and a female cell combine and grow to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
and a female cell combine and grow to
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789
and a female cell combine and grow to
form an offspring that has a mix of

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
form an offspring that has a mix of
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.649
form an offspring that has a mix of
genetic material from both of its

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
genetic material from both of its
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.289
genetic material from both of its
parents man sex oh yeah for most people

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
parents man sex oh yeah for most people
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.520
parents man sex oh yeah for most people
though the interesting bit doesn't seem

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
though the interesting bit doesn't seem
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.200
though the interesting bit doesn't seem
to be the cells and their genetic code

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
to be the cells and their genetic code
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.080
to be the cells and their genetic code
but it's the method by which these two

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
but it's the method by which these two
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149
but it's the method by which these two
cells are allowed to meet each other in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
cells are allowed to meet each other in
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800
cells are allowed to meet each other in
humans just as it is in many other

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
humans just as it is in many other
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630
humans just as it is in many other
animals a male makes a bunch of male

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
animals a male makes a bunch of male
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.670
animals a male makes a bunch of male
cells inserts them into the female using

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
cells inserts them into the female using
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590
cells inserts them into the female using
the pair's sexual organs a single male

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
the pair's sexual organs a single male
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840
the pair's sexual organs a single male
cell fertilizes a single female cell and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
cell fertilizes a single female cell and
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.149
cell fertilizes a single female cell and
a baby grows inside the female until

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
a baby grows inside the female until
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920
a baby grows inside the female until
it's ready to pop out however in no way

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
it's ready to pop out however in no way
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960
it's ready to pop out however in no way
is this the normal method that nature

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
is this the normal method that nature
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.550
is this the normal method that nature
uses when it comes to sexual

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
uses when it comes to sexual
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.499
uses when it comes to sexual
reproduction it's just the one that we

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
reproduction it's just the one that we
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.520
reproduction it's just the one that we
are most familiar with

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
are most familiar with
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709
are most familiar with
for obvious reasons take the ciothes for

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
for obvious reasons take the ciothes for
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260
for obvious reasons take the ciothes for
example in this case the female inserts

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
example in this case the female inserts
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300
example in this case the female inserts
her eggs into the male and then the male

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
her eggs into the male and then the male
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.819
her eggs into the male and then the male
fertilizes them and incubates them and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
fertilizes them and incubates them and
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.429
fertilizes them and incubates them and
eventually gives birth to them all by

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
eventually gives birth to them all by
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.660
eventually gives birth to them all by
himself and then there's the mountain

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
himself and then there's the mountain
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490
himself and then there's the mountain
slug which there aren't any males or

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
slug which there aren't any males or
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.410
slug which there aren't any males or
females just Tamara Deitz which means

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
females just Tamara Deitz which means
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.200
females just Tamara Deitz which means
that every

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
that every
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.750
that every
you'll has both male and female sexual

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
you'll has both male and female sexual
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.880
you'll has both male and female sexual
organs in this instance two slugs hang

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890
organs in this instance two slugs hang
 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.620
organs in this instance two slugs hang
off a tree branch together by a string

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
off a tree branch together by a string
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.750
off a tree branch together by a string
of their own slime release their sexual

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760
of their own slime release their sexual
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.240
of their own slime release their sexual
organs from behind their heads and then

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250
organs from behind their heads and then
 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.650
organs from behind their heads and then
fertilize each other for about an hour

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660
fertilize each other for about an hour
 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.900
fertilize each other for about an hour
or so before biting each other's sexual

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910
or so before biting each other's sexual
 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.880
or so before biting each other's sexual
organs off and actually even though some

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890
organs off and actually even though some
 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.010
organs off and actually even though some
plants reproduce asexually some of them

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020
plants reproduce asexually some of them
 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.900
plants reproduce asexually some of them
reproduce sexually as well in fact the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910
reproduce sexually as well in fact the
 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.420
reproduce sexually as well in fact the
flower is actually a plant's sexual

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
flower is actually a plant's sexual
 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.950
flower is actually a plant's sexual
organ with both the male and the female

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960
organ with both the male and the female
 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.570
organ with both the male and the female
parts inside of it but the variation

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
parts inside of it but the variation
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.830
parts inside of it but the variation
doesn't stop there because there are

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840
doesn't stop there because there are
 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.750
doesn't stop there because there are
actually some animals that have decided

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760
actually some animals that have decided
 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.240
actually some animals that have decided
to start reproducing asexually as well

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
to start reproducing asexually as well
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.680
to start reproducing asexually as well
like there are certain types of shark

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690
like there are certain types of shark
 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.110
like there are certain types of shark
and lizard that have just given up on

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120
and lizard that have just given up on
 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.480
and lizard that have just given up on
men entirely and just have babies anyway

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490
men entirely and just have babies anyway
 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.940
men entirely and just have babies anyway
and yes those babies are exact genetic

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
and yes those babies are exact genetic
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.230
and yes those babies are exact genetic
clones of their mothers it actually

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240
clones of their mothers it actually
 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.340
clones of their mothers it actually
raises quite an interesting question

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350
raises quite an interesting question
 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.560
raises quite an interesting question
which is that if there are animals in

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570
which is that if there are animals in
 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.840
which is that if there are animals in
the world that can reproduce asexually

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850
the world that can reproduce asexually
 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.840
the world that can reproduce asexually
why do men exist why are you required

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850
why do men exist why are you required

why do men exist why are you required
and with that why the sexual

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950
and with that why the sexual
 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.620
and with that why the sexual
reproduction exists what what is the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
reproduction exists what what is the
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.970

point of it unfortunately the answer is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980
point of it unfortunately the answer is
 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.830
point of it unfortunately the answer is
relatively simple when it's this sexual

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840
relatively simple when it's this sexual
 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.290

turn means a higher chance of survival

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460
turn means a higher chance of survival
 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.340
