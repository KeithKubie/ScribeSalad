MARCIA GAGLIARDI: So
it is no small honor

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.830
to be here today in conversation
with Jacques Pepin-- or as I

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.289
like to say, the man,
the myth, the legend.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.830
Many of us have felt like we've
grown up on his cooking shows

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.840
on public television,
and I hope we all

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.375
have at least a couple of his
25 books on our kitchen shelves.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.800
I see quite a few in here today.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.570
Jacques has been in the
kitchen for more than 60 years,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.000
beginning with his formal
apprenticeship at 13 years

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.610
old-- they start
them young in France.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.290
And he left his home
for Paris, cooking

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.440
in some of the most
revered establishments,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.696
like [? Norise ?]
and Plaza Athenee,

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.820
and eventually cooking for
French president Charles

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.340
de Gaulle.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.220
He made his way to New York,
and ended up at Howard Johnson's

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.430
as the director of research.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.240
What follows is
his career in food

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.600
that we all benefit from-- as
a chef on public television,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
an instructor, an author,
a columnist, and an artist.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.420
And let's not forget his
many awards, including

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.720
France's ultimate
civilian recognition,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.064
the Legion of Honor.

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:10.980
Right now, we're lucky
to have Jacques with us

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.690
in the Bay Area,
as he's currently

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.180
shooting "Jacques Pepin:
Heart and Soul," with PBS.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.890
The 26-episode series is set
to broadcast on PBS stations

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.630
in fall of 2015, and
will show Jacques

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.320
at home, tending his
garden, or in the studio,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870
cooking everything
from veal chops

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.560
dijonnaise to fast fougasse,
and showing you the techniques

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080
that he's known for.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.220
Expect many stories
from his past, including

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.554
tales of Julia Child, of course.

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:39.720
And some guest chefs will
be making some appearances

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.009
as well.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.300
And there will also be a
companion cookbook, coming out

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.270
in October 2015-- "Jacques
Pepin: Heart and Soul

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.090
in the Kitchen," with
over 200 recipes,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.330
including the secret to
his great burger recipe.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.030
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
So before we dive

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.060
in to what you're doing
now, I have a few questions

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.370
about your earlier years.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.930
So let's take a little
trip down memory lane.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.640
We'll go in the
way-back machine.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.717
When you came to
the US, it was 1959?

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:08.551
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah.

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:10.425
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Were
the cooking techniques

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:11.660
different to those in France?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.270
What did you see here?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.700
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, it was
another world altogether.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.360
I mean, to tell you
the truth, when I first

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.150
came here, it was the middle
of the September, I believe,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.640
the day after I started at
the Pavillon in New York.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.902
And the Pavillon was the
quintessential French

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:32.110
restaurant, considered the
greatest French restaurant

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.160
in America.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.710
So relatively the
techniques were not

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.900
much different than
what I did in France.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.950
Product were different.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.360
We lived-- my friend Jean-Claude
and I-- joined me pretty soon.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.620
We had an apartment on
50th and First Avenue.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.200
And on First
Avenue, that's where

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.656
I met my first supermarket.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:55.280
I'd never been in a
supermarket before.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.007
And it was kind of
the beginning here.

00:02:58.007 --> 00:02:59.590
So a lot of package,
a lot of package,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.750
a lot of package-- but
no mushroom, no parsley.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.370
But the meat was great.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.740
I mean, the beef,
lamb-- inexpensive.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.700
Lobster, too.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.560
But the products were different.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.890
I mean, certainly, when you cook
as a chef, you cook by taste.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.950
You don't cook by recipe.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.517
I mean, the recipe is
purely a typewritten page

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:25.870
that doesn't really mean much.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.330
So you go behind this.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.540
And doing a lobster souffle
in Paris at the Plaza Athenee

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.870
and doing it in
New York, in order

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.040
to achieve the same
taste, ingredients

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.030
have to be different.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.826
You keep testing.

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.450
I mean, the tarragon or the type
of thing have much less taste,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.610
so you put more.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.190
Ultimately, fine-- you reach
the taste that you want.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.005
But what was your question?

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:49.005
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: So it
was about the techniques

00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:49.400
that you found here.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.820
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh, techniques.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.650
Right, right.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.870
No, otherwise, the
technique with this,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.280
of course when I left
Howard Johnson-- when

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.690
I left the Pavillon and
went to Howard Johnson, that

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.290
was a different world, a world
that I knew nothing about.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.140
Mass production, the
chemistry of food--

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.840
I'd never heard word like
coliform or bacteria.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.060
So anyway, I learn about
mass marketing and so forth.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.709
So that was very useful
for me later on in life,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.190
when I opened restaurant
and did other things.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.080
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Very
different experience.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.163
And when you were the
personal chef for Charles De

00:04:26.163 --> 00:04:29.484
Gaulle, what was one
of his favorite dishes?

00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:31.900
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, someone
introduced me a few weeks ago

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.000
and said, that man was chef
to three French presidents.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.350
The three of them are dead.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.890
It's true, they are dead.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.310
Well, when you deal with
a president, of course--

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.800
I dealt with Madame De Gaulle
for the menu of the week.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.820
Maybe secretary of
state, whatever.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.560
The family and certainly
the Sunday meal

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.940
all were very important.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.590
They were very devout Catholic.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.140
And after church
on Sunday, there

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.610
would be the whole family--
10, 12 people, children,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.080
grandchildren, and so forth.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.860
And for that it was the
menu that she wanted,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.250
cooked the way she wanted.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.710
She wanted a leg of
lamb-- not too rare, no

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.200
good for the blood of
the president, whatever.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.990
It was the way she wanted.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.410
And I have to add,
even, that every week,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.570
I did my accounting-- whatever
we spent during the week--

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.920
to pay the supplier
and so forth.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.840
And that Sunday meal had to
come from their own pocket.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.480
They wanted to pay
for it themselves,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.105
even though they were
not very wealthy.

00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:37.820
So it was a question of,
I think, ethical or moral.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.690
That was the president.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.200
When you deal with a
state dinner-- you know,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.260
I served people like Eisenhower
at the time, Macmillan, Nehru,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.800
Tito.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.766
Those were head of
state at the time.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.140
Then you deal with
the protocol--

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.150
that is, someone
comes to you and say,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.522
OK-- like for
President Eisenhower--

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.230
they say, OK, the
president already, they

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.270
have two or three meal together,
either at the American embassy,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.770
whatever.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.960
They already served
that fish, this, that.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.290
You don't want to
duplicate those things.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.610
Or it's show.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.540
Lunch has to be 45 minutes,
or it's a complicated dinner--

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.180
it has to be 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.170
You know, different
courses and so forth.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.130
And in addition to this,
there is other requirements.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.354
For example, you're not going
to serve a roast of pork

00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:23.270
to the King of Monaco.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.050
So they tell you--
this, this, this.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.920
And within that
frame lines, then you

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.890
show the menu, duplicate too.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.700
So at that point, it's
much less the taste

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.730
of the president than the--

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.230
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
What the event is.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.566
JACQUES PEPIN: The
affair itself, yeah.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.940
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: So how did
you make the segue from chef

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.640
for the president of
France to TV star,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.890
and how did you make your
way to public television?

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.932
Could you share
that story with us?

00:06:48.932 --> 00:06:50.390
JACQUES PEPIN: I
guess it was luck.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.170
I don't know.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:59.055
When I came to America, still,
50 years ago, the cook-- chef--

00:06:59.055 --> 00:07:01.780
was really at the bottom
of the social scale.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.330
And any good mother would
have wanted her child

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.020
to marry the lawyer or doctor,
but certainly not a cook.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.340
Now we are genius.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.182
I don't know what
happened exactly.

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.470
So things changed a great deal.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.390
I have to say that
after nouvelle cuisine

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.870
in the '70s, late
'60s, maybe late '60s,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.920
started to shine-- women
liberation, organic food,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.250
health food store.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.530
It was a social charge, which
maybe react against the TV

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.950
dinner of the '50s and so forth.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.510
So things started to change.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:43.060
Prior to that time, I didn't
know any white American chefs.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.200
The only chefs that
I knew cooked with me

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.680
were the kids I worked with
at Howard Johnson, which

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.331
were very often
African American.

00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:54.830
And all the chefs that I knew
in New York in big restaurants

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.560
were German, Swiss,
Italian, French.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.710
There was no kid who'd
get into that business.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.060
And then the thing
exploded and changed.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.070
There are extraordinary
chefs in this country now.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.990
So it was very, very different.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.660
And for me, I worked
at Howard Johnson.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.302
I learned a great deal
in terms of production.

00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:17.510
That's why I could open the
World Trade Center after,

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.830
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.930
Then I was a consultant for the
Russian Tea Room in New York.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.500
I opened a restaurant
on Fifth Avenue

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.890
called La Potagerie in 1970.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.530
Again, mass
production-- I could not

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.520
have done that if I hadn't had
the training at Howard Johnson.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.740
And I don't know,
I started writing.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.350
I was friends
with-- three months,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.600
six months maybe
after I was here,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.436
I met Craig Claiborne, who
started at the New York Times.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:46.935
He came to the Pavillon-- yeah,
it was here at the Pavillon.

00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:49.420
So maybe three, four
months after I was here.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.880
And I became friends with Craig.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.450
He introduced me
to Helen McCully.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.660
She was a foodie, [INAUDIBLE],
"House Beautiful."

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.420
And she was never married,
never had any kids,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.190
so she kind of became
my surrogate mother.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.232
Don't wear those stupid
socks you wear in France.

00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:04.731
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:05.990
Don't do this, don't do that.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.165
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: She gave
you American training.

00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:10.540
JACQUES PEPIN: And through
Helen-- Helen told me one day,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.590
oh, I have that manuscript
I just received here

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.490
from someone who
wrote that cookbook.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.496
You want to take a look at it?

00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:20.620
I said, that's pretty good.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.890
She said, well, the woman,
she lives in California.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.810
She's coming next week.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.095
You want to cook for her?

00:09:26.095 --> 00:09:26.720
I said, sure.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.090
And she says, she's a very tall
woman with a terrible voice.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.811
Of course, that was Julia.

00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:32.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.150
So that's how I met Julia.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.780
And Helen spoke with James
Beard like twice a day,

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.650
about anything going
on in the food world.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.130
My point is that less than
six months after I was here,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.520
I knew kind of the
trinity of cooking, which

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.140
was Craig Claiborne,
James Beard, Julia Child.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.350
So you can see that the
food world was very, very

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.700
small at the time.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.120
It was totally different.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.420
So I started writing
because Helen

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.290
was writing for "House
Beautiful," and so forth.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.720
And I started doing a column.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.360
She pushed me into
writing a little more,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.232
and that led one
thing to another.

00:10:09.232 --> 00:10:13.270
And I don't even know how
I came on to do television.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.880
But doing one show
or another, I was

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.560
asked to go one
place or another.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.120
Actually, I did a series
in 1982, I believe,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.730
in Jacksonville, Florida,
called "Everyday Cooking."

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.070
And then after that,
even WGBH in New York,

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.770
WGBH in Boston, WADT in
New York-- they were big--

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.700
asked me, will you be
interested in doing it?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.824
I said, great, I'd love to.

00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:39.200
But it never went anywhere.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.910
They never raised the money.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.710
And then I came here.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.870
It was '88, maybe '87.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.740
And I gave classes all
the '70s and the '80s

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.520
after I did-- I was
traveling like 30,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.060
40 weeks out of the year, giving
classes all over the country.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.440
It was the time when
cooking school opened,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.250
cookware shop, all
that type of thing

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.020
which didn't exist before.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.475
So I went to give classes.

00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:04.850
They say, can you
come next year?

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.099
We'll put you on the calendar.

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:07.710
So I was kind of booked ahead.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.000
So I end up giving
class in Foster City

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.724
here, at Martin Yan, who just
opened a cooking school there.

00:11:13.724 --> 00:11:14.640
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Yep.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.914
JACQUES PEPIN: So he asked me,
I have to do a show on KQED.

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:21.080
Do you want to come with me?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.190
And I said, sure, I'd love to.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.620
So I came there, did
that show with him, too.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.270
And Marjorie Poore, who was the
executive producer at the time,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.957
told me-- maybe a week
later, called to say,

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:33.040
would you be interested
in doing a series with us?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.910
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
You were a natural.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.040
JACQUES PEPIN: I said,
sure, I'd love to.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.920
I didn't really expect it to
fly, but they raised the money.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.121
I did it and I've been
there over 25 years.

00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:44.430
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Incredible.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.100
So tell us a little
bit about a day

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.200
in the life of filming
right now at KQED.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.480
I understand you are
on quite a schedule.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.340
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.780
We do two or three shows a day.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.890
Yesterday we did three.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.890
Day before, two.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.230
Day before, three.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.270
So yes, it's pretty intense.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.290
The point is that it's
very well organized.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.810
Fantastic team-- Tina Salter,
the producer, Paul Swensen,

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.960
the director.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.480
We have a big, big team.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.480
I don't go in the control
room so I don't really

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.630
know what's going on there.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.100
So I can't really
see what they see

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.350
or what it looks like because
from my point of view--

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.080
but to a certain extent,
nothing is script.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.140
I'm not an actor.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.650
If I had to read, I'd be
totally messed up in my cooking.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.240
So for me, I have
a recipe to do.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.800
I know what I'm going to do.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.016
More or less, I
tell the cameraman,

00:12:38.016 --> 00:12:40.390
OK, I'm going to start with
that and I'll continue there.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.140
Then while this is cooking,
maybe I'll do this, too.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.830
And it works more
or less this way.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.130
And so there is nothing
script-- at least

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.260
we have the recipe here.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.820
Maybe I don't
follow them exactly,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.510
but that gives an idea to
the back kitchen and all

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.910
that, what we're going to do.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.100
When I did the series with
Julia, we had no recipes,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.404
so that was quite different.

00:13:01.404 --> 00:13:02.320
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Wow.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.010
That was very ad hoc.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.259
And do you plan the themes?

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:07.050
You work together--

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.300
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.160
Yes.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.243
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: How does
that all work together?

00:13:10.243 --> 00:13:13.890
JACQUES PEPIN: It can't
really be anyone else but me

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.020
who do the recipes.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.550
I've been working on that
book for a couple of years,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.430
and then the book of
about 200-some recipes.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.020
So we choose 26 show, about
four recipes-- three, four,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.830
five recipes-- per show, so
it's about 140 recipes, maybe,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.860
that we extrapolated from those.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.410
We tried to get them into theme.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.560
So I did actually two shows
with Jean Claude-- one

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.920
cooking in the country with him.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.290
The stuff that he likes--
like, he killed deer every year

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.350
with his bow and
arrow, so we did deer.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.780
We did stuff like this.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.930
And another one actually,
cooking for the president.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.790
We were in France, so it was
a more elaborate type of meal.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.770
Then my daughter and
granddaughter were here.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.530
They just went back last
week, to Rhode Island.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.200
And I did six shows with
Shorey, my granddaughter,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.420
who is 10 years old,
and my daughter.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.490
So that was fun.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.550
Different theme.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.940
We did a show on the economy.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.440
I want to show people to
cook for very little money.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.370
We did even a show on offal,
you know, the variety meat,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.092
because now the young
chefs are into pig's feet--

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:21.550
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Tongue and heart.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.710
JACQUES PEPIN: --brain and
kidney, on and so forth,

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.800
which people did not
a number of years ago.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.690
We did a couple of shows on the
Mexican influence, if you want,

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.290
because I have an apartment
in Playa del Carmen.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.290
We go during the winter.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.330
So cooking there,
going to the market.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.799
So you know, it
was a little bit--

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:40.840
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Varied.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.280
JACQUES PEPIN:
Themed, yes, right.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.030
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: And I would
love to talk a little bit more

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.160
about Mexico.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.800
So how long have you
been going there?

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.690
JACQUES PEPIN: Well,
with that apartment,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.520
it's about 12 years old.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.650
We went there a couple of years
prior to this, and we liked it.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.820
And we decided to escape
the winter of Connecticut.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.070
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Yeah,
because you're in Connecticut.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.319
Yeah, that's not an easy time.

00:15:05.319 --> 00:15:07.665
JACQUES PEPIN: So usually
my wife and Claude's wife

00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:10.360
and I-- the four of us, we go.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.370
And we have some
friends coming, too.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.680
So yeah, we have great fun.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.080
We go to the [INAUDIBLE],
struggle with our Spanish.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.960
You go buy fish directly
from the fishmonger,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.690
or rather, the fishermen.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.290
We go there and it's fun.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.240
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: And so are you
really excited about exploring

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.642
more about Mexican cuisine
or some of the regions?

00:15:30.642 --> 00:15:31.975
Has that, over the years, grown?

00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:34.370
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes, well I've
worked with Rick Bayless,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.290
with the great
specialist of that.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.830
Actually, two weeks ago--
two or three weeks ago,

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.290
right-- we did, when I
first came, at Farallon

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.550
in San Francisco, one of the
greatest restaurants there.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.420
The chef, Mark Franz,
is really fantastic.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.880
And anyway, they were hosting
us for a special for PBS,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.830
which will come out next
December-- not this one,

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.110
the one after.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.760
And a special for the pledge of
PBS, so it's an hour or an hour

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.410
and a half special which will
be used all over the country.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.910
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: It's kind of
a big occasion, that episode,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.810
I understand.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:11.685
JACQUES PEPIN: Right.

00:16:11.685 --> 00:16:14.990
It was Lydia Bastianich,
Rick Bayless--

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.276
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: It's
for his 80th birthday, so.

00:16:18.276 --> 00:16:19.650
JACQUES PEPIN:
Yeah, that will be

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.211
to celebrate my 80th
birthday next year.

00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:24.460
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: You made it.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.950
JACQUES PEPIN:
Nothing to celebrate.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.110
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: What are
some of the dishes they're

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.830
cooking for you in the show?

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.020
Can you give us a little--

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.650
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, Lydia
cooked a roast of pork stuffed

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.930
with prunes and some
spaetzle and all that.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.870
Ming Tsai, more in
the Chinese style.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.480
A red chicken-- that is a
chicken poached into a broth

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.360
with a great deal of hot
pepper and different type

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.790
of hot sauce.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.850
And actually, Rick Bayless
did three different types

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.810
of ceviche.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.000
Because we cooked together
in my apartment in Playa,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.100
he came to tape a series
on the Yucatan peninsula,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.845
and we cooked a couple
of shows together.

00:17:05.845 --> 00:17:07.970
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: And when
you're in San Francisco,

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.446
are you hitting any taquerias?

00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:13.930
Have you had any Mexican
food since you've been here?

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.880
JACQUES PEPIN: Any Mexican food?

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.463
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: I don't think
you find a lot in Connecticut.

00:17:17.463 --> 00:17:20.430
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes, we
had tacos the other day,

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.545
I think from a truck.

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:25.180
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: The best.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.560
JACQUES PEPIN: But
no, otherwise, we

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.570
work usually until
7 o'clock at night.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.450
And we've done a
fair amount of dinner

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.640
which were already
staged or planned

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.926
for one reason or another.

00:17:35.926 --> 00:17:38.300
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: And while
you've been in San Francisco,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.280
I'm sure everybody
is thrilled to have

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.790
you come to their restaurant.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.780
I know you've been
on the town a bit.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.740
Are there some
places you've really

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.180
enjoyed during your visit?

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.750
JACQUES PEPIN:
Well, I went to see

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.160
Roland Passot a couple of
times at La Folie and all that.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.810
He's from my hometown in France.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:18:00.310
And certainly, we went to
a good Yunnan restaurant.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.770
And at Farallon, we ate
there twice, otherwise.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.790
We had a fantastic meal.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:09.020
Otherwise, we ate at Le
Colonial, the two of us

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:09.830
the other night.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:14.000
And we ate in a Korean
restaurant around the corner

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.570
also.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.880
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Nice.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.980
A little international.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.436
So let's hear some fun
stories about being

00:18:20.436 --> 00:18:21.560
back in the studio for you.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.650
How's that been?

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.340
Good times with the crew?

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.340
JACQUES PEPIN: It's fun.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.600
I mean, it's a lot of pressure.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:36.420
But as I said, we don't really
have anything structured,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.580
or no script or
anything like that.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.180
So I know that I'm going
to talk about chicken

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.800
or about broccoli,
but I don't really

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.030
know what I'm going
to say until we start

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.980
and I'm trying to explain.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.460
Still, when I cook, I still try
to show the process of cooking.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.120
I still try to
explain the technique.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.064
I was told-- I went to
a place a few weeks ago

00:19:03.064 --> 00:19:04.480
and there was a
food historian who

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.646
said that there are 407 cookery
shows on television now.

00:19:08.646 --> 00:19:09.920
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Amazing.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.003
JACQUES PEPIN: I don't
know whether it's accurate,

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:14.140
but if it's not-- maybe 350.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.570
In any case, a great
deal of those are reality

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.669
shows, fighting--

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:20.960
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Competitions.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.540
JACQUES PEPIN: And it's fine.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.240
It's different.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.950
But this is not what I do.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.970
I still try to
teach a little bit.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.560
And I'm sure a lot of
people look at it, say,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.120
that guy is really boring, too.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.780
Fine.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.200
Doesn't really matter.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.540
You cannot please everybody.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.087
When I go to the Food and
Wine Festival in Aspen--

00:19:40.087 --> 00:19:41.670
and I will be there
in June-- and that

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.090
will be number 32
for me, for 32 years.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.350
I think the festival
is 33 or 34.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.220
You go there, everyone is
there, from Bobby Flay,

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.790
to Mario Batali, to Thomas
Keller, to Lydia Bastianich,

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.290
me.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.462
So people will
come and tell me, I

00:19:59.462 --> 00:20:00.920
look at all the
show on television.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.420
You're the best.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.716
And why do they tell me that?

00:20:03.716 --> 00:20:05.090
Because the people
who don't like

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.731
me don't come and talk to me.

00:20:06.731 --> 00:20:07.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.280
Only the people who like
me come and talk to me.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.792
They go to Bobby Flay and
say, I look at all the show.

00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:13.250
You are the greatest,
and so forth.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.010
And that's fine.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.260
That's the way it should be.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.112
Everyone can relate to someone
and it works well on that.

00:20:21.112 --> 00:20:22.070
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Yeah.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.300
And is there anyone
you've ever wanted

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.902
to film with that either you
asked and they couldn't or is

00:20:28.902 --> 00:20:31.111
there someone you would love
as a guest on your show?

00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:31.902
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:20:31.902 --> 00:20:33.460
I mean, there is
many, many people

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.230
that I like to cook with.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.220
But ultimately, my friend
Jean-Claude, my daughter,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.560
granddaughter, my wife--
if I asked her to film,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.350
I would get a divorce
after 48 years of marriage.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.840
She hates to go
on the television.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.310
So we did a couple
of shows together,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.180
but she wasn't crazy about it.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.180
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Oh no?

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.910
JACQUES PEPIN:
Usually, you go back

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.550
to doing it with your
friend, your family,

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.115
and that's where
you enjoy the most.

00:21:00.115 --> 00:21:02.740
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: And if you and
Julia could cook one more meal

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.830
together on TV, what would
you love to make with her?

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.730
JACQUES PEPIN: Actually,
we did two shows last week

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.882
in memory of Julia,
inspired by her.

00:21:13.882 --> 00:21:14.840
I don't know, you know.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.210
She was a pretty good
[INAUDIBLE] woman.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:25.160
We also shared a great
many bottle of wine.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.510
The point is that if I
had to have a last meal,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.150
we would have things that
we like to eat from hot dog

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:37.290
to caviar, from foie
gras to roast chicken.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.404
And it will be a very,
very, very, very long meal.

00:21:42.404 --> 00:21:43.320
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Yes.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.486
JACQUES PEPIN: The last one.

00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:46.050
It would have to be.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.759
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Why
just have one meal?

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:49.799
JACQUES PEPIN: If I know
that I'm dying tomorrow,

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.770
going to the
guillotine or whatever,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.250
probably won't
have much appetite.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.452
So my last meal
would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:55.452 --> 00:21:57.736
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.736 --> 00:21:59.110
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
So I understand

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.080
that you're quite the forager.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.870
And I'd love to hear
what you forage,

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.480
and who taught you which
mushrooms you can eat.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.740
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, we
pick up about, I would say,

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.260
20 different type of mushroom.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.220
There is over 4,000 type
of mushroom in the world.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.190
And if you don't know it,
especially in the Amanita

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.830
family, there is a lot
of deadly mushroom.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.230
So you have to be careful.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.874
For me, I have my wife
taste it, so it's fine.

00:22:27.874 --> 00:22:30.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:32.230
Just kidding.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.240
Yeah, we get from wild leek to,
I don't know, a lot of stuff.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.360
We go fishing.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.637
And I did, when Claudine,
my daughter, was a kid.

00:22:41.637 --> 00:22:43.220
And now I do it with
my granddaughter.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:48.745
We go net fishing and
get those tiny white bait

00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:51.990
at the end of the summer
that usually the fishermen

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.550
use for bait.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.800
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Fry them up.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.320
JACQUES PEPIN: And you press on
the belly to extract the center

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.120
and wash them,
roll them in flour,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.687
deep fry them like French fries.

00:23:01.687 --> 00:23:04.020
And in France, if you go
there, in England and all that,

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.200
they're expensive.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.150
But are very good.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.670
We do a lot of things like
that, go for mussels, clams.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.580
And, of course, in
the wood, we get even

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.890
at Hammonasset Beach,
where I go in Connecticut,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.220
like last summer I picked
up a lot of the wild

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.800
rose coming out in summer.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.510
They are not
sprayed or anything.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.140
They are incredibly fragrant.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.160
So I take petal to crystallize
with sugar, and all that to-do.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.590
Then we take the bulb at
the end of this summer to do

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.490
rose hip jelly.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.000
And then there is plum beach.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.350
They're a tiny wild plum.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:42.830
So I pick them up to put them
in alcohol with either a grain

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.677
alcohol or vodka
and a bit of honey.

00:23:44.677 --> 00:23:45.760
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Perfect.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.669
JACQUES PEPIN: So
things like that.

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:49.710
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: You can
raise a glass to Julia.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.743
And you're also a
gardener as well.

00:23:52.743 --> 00:23:54.760
JACQUES PEPIN: Well,
not as good as Claude.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.810
I mean, he's got leek that big.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.101
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: That's crazy.

00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:00.510
JACQUES PEPIN: My leek
are about that big.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.310
Yeah, we do always some
salad and of course I

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.070
have a lot of different
type of herbs.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:11.070
In the summer, some tomato
and a few eggplant, zucchini.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.560
It's not a big garden.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.170
You know, what happens is that
when your tomato are ready,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.480
well, they're already
in the farms around,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.520
and I can get a
bushel for like $4.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.900
But no, it's great to get
it just out of the garden.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.860
There is nothing
better than that.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.490
When I was a young chef, I see
food like many young chefs.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.100
You keep adding to the plate.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.610
You put one herb and
more, and this and that,

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.880
and this and that.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.110
And now that I'm old, I take
away, take away from the plate,

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.385
to be left with one tomato.

00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:41.760
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Perfect tomato.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.980
JACQUES PEPIN: Right out
of the garden, lukewarm.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.055
Perfect olive oil, coarse salt.

00:24:46.055 --> 00:24:46.870
That's it.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.330
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Alice
Waters would approve.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.151
So I understand that
you are from Lyon.

00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:55.650
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes, actually,
I was born in Bourg-en-Bresse.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:56.400
Next to Lyon, yes.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.305
But my mother had a
restaurant in Lyon.

00:24:58.305 --> 00:25:00.680
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: One of the
most amazing culinary places

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.474
in the world.

00:25:02.474 --> 00:25:03.640
JACQUES PEPIN: I don't know.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:03.920
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Well.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.660
JACQUES PEPIN: I don't say that.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.440
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: So what are
some of your favorite recipes

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.380
and dishes from that
area and from home?

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.860
Do you make anything?

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.650
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, you know,
memories-- food memories--

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.070
are very, very powerful
and very strong.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:25.385
I think it was a Chinese
philosopher, name

00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:31.010
of Lin Yutang, I believe,
who said, what is patriotism?

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.192
Patriotism is the taste of
the dishes you had as a kid.

00:25:34.192 --> 00:25:35.900
And there is a great
deal of truth there.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.530
I mean, I'm paraphrasing,
maybe not exactly.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.580
But it's true.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.430
Those dishes that
you had as a kid

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.540
will stay with you
the rest of your life.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.440
And those tastes will
haunt you, and there

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.480
will be nothing
better than that.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.690
I remember, my wife was
born in New York City.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:58.000
And her little brother
was a farmer in New York.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.310
And I remember him coming
one time at the house.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.040
I had fresh asparagus.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.680
I did.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.040
He doesn't like fresh asparagus.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.510
He liked canned asparagus,
and he'd drink the juice.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.310
It's horrible, but that's
what he had as a kid.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.570
So for him, he
remembered that taste.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.320
And I will, too.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.540
So I did a couple of show there,
in food memory of my mother,

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.550
and so forth, so
chicken in cream

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.830
sauce my mother used to do.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.240
The canard, the pike
dumpling that she would do.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.030
A gratin of cauliflower stew.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.010
The simple soup with
vermicelli and leek in it.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.390
All of those dishes.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.570
I did the same thing with
Claudine, my daughter.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.350
She had the dish in her head.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.525
And for her, this is
what the great food is,

00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:43.620
and we are all like this.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.930
So when you look
at different people

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.570
and different ethnic
groups, different cuisines,

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.630
you have to understand
that even a cuisine--

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.000
I did a fair amount of time
in West Africa, for example.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.910
Then you have a thieboudienne
or different type of broken rice

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.680
and you say it's pretty-- not
very good, pretty dry, too.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.160
But if you had that
as a child, this

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.090
is a very essential
dish for you.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.020
And those memories
are there to stay.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.760
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Forever.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.200
And on that note, what are
some of your favorite smells

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.024
in the kitchen?

00:27:16.024 --> 00:27:17.440
JACQUES PEPIN: My
favorite smells?

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.820
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Smells
in the kitchen, yes.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820
JACQUES PEPIN: Red wine.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:20.642 --> 00:27:22.100
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Beef bourguignon?

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.670
JACQUES PEPIN: No.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.820
Leek and potato
soup, when it cooked,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.400
it's very, very special.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.810
A chicken, when it's really
roasting in the oven.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.910
As a chef, you use your
senses-- not only your eyes,

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.810
even your ear can go in front
of the oven and tell you

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.280
the chicken is cooked.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.820
Just hearing it.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.160
At some point, you know, the
fat of the chicken come out

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.650
and it start frying
a little bit,

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.630
and there's another
sound that it's roasting.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.610
So, by habit, you use all
of those kind of senses.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:56.690
Yes, so those smells tell you
the quality of the chicken

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.080
or a squab or a duck.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.810
When it comes from a farm,
really organic and good,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:05.360
it smells quite different than
the square thing with plastic

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.567
on top that is called a
chicken in the supermarket.

00:28:07.567 --> 00:28:08.900
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: In a body bag.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.566
JACQUES PEPIN: It
doesn't have any feet,

00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:13.390
it doesn't have any head
or anything like this.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.890
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
And so what do you

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.650
think are five dishes
that every good home

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.010
cook should know how to do well?

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.620
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, you should
know how to cook an egg well.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.779
I mean, eggs-- for me, I
couldn't live with eggs.

00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:24.820
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Cheers.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.361
JACQUES PEPIN: And
when we were kids,

00:28:26.361 --> 00:28:29.390
we get our protein much more
from eggs than with meat,

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.090
because it was less expensive.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.140
So a gratin of eggs-- you
know, I did some on the show,

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.820
in fact-- gratin of egg
with Swiss chard underneath,

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.830
cheese on the top.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.470
The hard-cooked eggs,
different type of omelette

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.360
and all that are very important.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.200
So eggs, yes, certainly.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.750
Potato.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:45.810
I love potatoes.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.160
So potato and chicken.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.095
I roast potato.

00:28:48.095 --> 00:28:49.160
I roast chicken.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.450
You know, for me, it's
still an essential dish.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.010
For dessert, maybe
an apple tart.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.437
I go back to my mother
and just the dough,

00:29:00.437 --> 00:29:02.440
the apple, sugar,
and butter on top.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:02.940
That's it.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.480
You know, things like that.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.350
A good salad, a good
vinaigrette is very important.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.300
A salad which is
washed properly,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.800
which is drained properly, which
is with the proper percentage

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.870
of vinegar to oil, dash of
mustard, bit of garlic in it.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.890
A salad is really a thing
that you go back to.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.230
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Again and again.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.670
And what are some dishes
that your friends and family

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.880
ask for you to make
for them at home?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.090
A couple of favorites?

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.394
JACQUES PEPIN: Well
again, it's so different.

00:29:34.394 --> 00:29:35.810
Claudine will come
home and she'll

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.690
want me to do a cheese fondue or
something like that, or a soup,

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.840
because that's what
she'd like me to do.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.850
My granddaughter will ask
me for something else.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.710
She'll ask me not for
eggs, too, but usually

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:51.160
for maybe chocolate
truffle or usually dessert.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.100
My wife loves offal.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:58.520
So my wife asks me to saute
some kidney or calf's liver

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.510
or whatever.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:04.190
And then when I am with
Jean-Claude, it's different.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.170
We'll do also, very often,
a variety of meat or things

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.060
like that.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.026
But otherwise, big
roasts and so forth.

00:30:12.026 --> 00:30:13.690
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Perfect.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.780
So let's talk a little
bit about wine-- one

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.790
of my favorite topics.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.380
I almost brought us
some champagne earlier.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.463
I was like, that would
be-- is 11:00 AM too early?

00:30:20.463 --> 00:30:21.014
No?

00:30:21.014 --> 00:30:21.579
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:22.870
JACQUES PEPIN: Are you kidding?

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.142
You know what time
it is in France?

00:30:25.142 --> 00:30:26.789
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:27.830
JACQUES PEPIN: 5 o'clock.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.330
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
My watch is always

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.414
set to champagne
o'clock, always.

00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:34.830
I would love to hear some of
your favorite wines to drink,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.080
maybe just some of your
everyday drinking wines,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.780
maybe a few special
occasion wines.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.144
What's your palate with wine?

00:30:40.144 --> 00:30:41.310
JACQUES PEPIN: We are lucky.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.520
In New York, Connecticut, we
get wine at a really good price.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.250
And I rarely pay more than
$12, $15 for a bottle of wine.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.020
And I can [INAUDIBLE]
some great wine.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.570
For me, I go back to--
I'm from Beaujolais,

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:58.760
so I'm going back to that type
of wine, maybe Cotes du Rhone.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:04.600
I like a wine which-- I
don't like the wine too oaky.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.740
In the whites, certainly,
I like something crisp.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.546
Relatively low in the
12, 12.5% alcohol.

00:31:12.546 --> 00:31:15.480
I like a great
wine occasionally.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.360
A great [INAUDIBLE] wine
from California, as well as

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.790
a great French
Bordeaux or whatever.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:25.200
But unfortunately--
or fortunately, I

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.880
guess-- because of
who I am, I'm invited

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.470
and people are going
to give me five

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.200
of those great wine in a row.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.640
After the second one, I want
a Beaujolais or something

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.860
like this.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.985
One great one to remember.

00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:41.030
If I have too many, I don't
remember, and likewise

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.550
with the food.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:48.050
I'm not crazy about menu
degustastions, where

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.860
you have nine different
dish, big like this.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.600
Each time you have that much
wine that you have to analyze,

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.099
too.

00:31:55.099 --> 00:31:56.120
It's like going to work.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:03.310
I want to go out, have a taco
and a beer somewhere and relax.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.670
But I would love a glass
of champagne, of course.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.230
And then after, a white wine.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.150
And then, a red wine.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:10.270
And that's about it in a meal.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.610
Not nine in a row.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:12.990
I think it's too much.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:19.120
And my tastes are pretty
simple, not complicated.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.320
I'm not difficult to please.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.706
I'm satisfied with the best.

00:32:22.706 --> 00:32:24.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.960
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: One
of my favorite quotes.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.001
JACQUES PEPIN: Oscar Wilde,
who said that, right?

00:32:29.001 --> 00:32:29.540
Wasn't it?

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:29.795
I think.

00:32:29.795 --> 00:32:30.711
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Yes.

00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:32.490
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.070
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: So we also
had some Google Moderator

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.010
questions.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.180
Some people online wanted
to ask you some questions.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.025
So I have one here that says,
"I love cooking and have

00:32:43.025 --> 00:32:45.710
had great success with a
variety of recipes, including

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.960
complex ones.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.130
However, I don't have
confidence not using a recipe.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.860
How would you suggest
venturing out without a recipe,

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.659
how to develop a sense
of seasoning to taste?"

00:32:55.659 --> 00:32:57.700
JACQUES PEPIN: First thing
you do in the kitchen,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.123
you have a glass of wine.

00:32:59.123 --> 00:33:00.164
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Cheers.

00:33:00.164 --> 00:33:00.815
Yes.

00:33:00.815 --> 00:33:01.315
Good answer.

00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:03.814
JACQUES PEPIN: Second thing you
do is another glass of wine.

00:33:03.814 --> 00:33:06.146
After, the recipe, it
works out very easily.

00:33:06.146 --> 00:33:08.080
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Everything tastes great.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.579
JACQUES PEPIN: Don't
worry too much.

00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:12.160
This is not brain surgery.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.560
And it's not because
you forget, I

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.580
don't know, to put in
the vanilla in your cake

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.380
or something like that.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.296
You're not going to the
guillotine or anything

00:33:20.296 --> 00:33:22.030
like this.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:22.890
Fine.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.380
And if the chicken
is a bit burned,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.671
you have a third glass of wine.

00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:26.963
By then, you don't really care.

00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:28.671
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Then
you have take out.

00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:29.650
No.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:31.400
I remember, I was
making Christmas cookies

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.790
and the dough was sticking
and it was just a nightmare.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:39.390
And I called my dad and he said,
honey, first things first--

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.398
did you pour yourself
some bourbon?

00:33:41.398 --> 00:33:43.356
He's like, why don't you
drink that and call me

00:33:43.356 --> 00:33:44.390
in five minutes?

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.530
You're too upset.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.571
JACQUES PEPIN: It's true.

00:33:46.571 --> 00:33:48.380
People say, how do I start?

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.040
I said, do you have
a friend who cooks?

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.820
I mean, everyone has
a friend who cooks.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.319
Say, OK.

00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:56.644
Next time you're invited
to her house or his house,

00:33:56.644 --> 00:33:58.060
you say, can I
come an hour ahead?

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.059
I want to cook with you.

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:00.740
I'll bring a bottle of wine.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.600
And then you cook.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.260
You do something simple.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.740
And boost your
confidence a little bit.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.045
Then you do it a
few time and then,

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.860
hmm, better try on my own.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.805
And, of course, if you have my
recipe, you have no problem.

00:34:12.805 --> 00:34:14.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:14.355 --> 00:34:15.980
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Another person wanted

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.770
to find out, "what are your
favorite or most important food

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.962
items to have on hand?"

00:34:20.962 --> 00:34:21.920
JACQUES PEPIN: On hand?

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.937
I mean, in refrigeration?

00:34:23.937 --> 00:34:25.020
You're going to have eggs.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.320
I mean, of course.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:33.010
You are going to have certainly
onion, leek, scallion--

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.090
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Cheese.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.870
JACQUES PEPIN: I'm trying
to look in my refrigerator.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.300
Sriracha-- I mean,
some hot sauce.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.371
And truffle.

00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:44.329
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Good.

00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:45.780
JACQUES PEPIN: No, no.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.690
You know, again, of
truffle, you use it.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.520
I tell Claude, if you
have some left over,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.929
you put it in the
refrigerator next to the beer.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.929
Because when one person
say, do you have a beer?

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:59.220
I say, next to the truffle
in the refrigerator.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.240
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Very high low.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.110
Another person wrote-- you
get a compliment in this, too.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.510
"You are a consummate
chef, a talented artist,

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.630
a prolific writer,
but I believe you're

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.736
the best culinary teacher
ever--" all in caps.

00:35:13.736 --> 00:35:14.660
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh boy.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.701
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: I know.

00:35:15.701 --> 00:35:17.540
Pat C in Oceanside.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.720
Which of your talents
came the easiest to you

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.342
and which do you enjoy the most?

00:35:22.342 --> 00:35:23.260
It's interesting.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.301
You do have many talents.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.790
JACQUES PEPIN: I
paint for 50 years.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.100
And that kind of
gratifies, satisfies me

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.030
in one way, which
compliments maybe my cooking.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:41.290
But on the whole, I am a cook.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.920
That's basically what I am.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.190
Even after I went to college and
studied, I could have taught.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.840
And I taught literature
a little bit.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.450
At some point, I taught skiing.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:51.515
That's how I met my wife.

00:35:51.515 --> 00:35:53.015
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
You taught skiing?

00:35:53.015 --> 00:35:54.440
Where were you teaching skiing?

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.480
JACQUES PEPIN: Upstate New York.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.100
The Catskills.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.280
That's when I was
working in New York.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.190
But what I'm saying
is that, ultimately, I

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.270
go back to cooking.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:05.320
That's what I love the best and
that's what I'm the best at.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.930
But the rest of it can
complement your life

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.862
in a different way too.

00:36:11.862 --> 00:36:15.910
But as long as I'm hungry,
then I will keep cooking.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.750
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Yes.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.510
And as long as you
have your good friend

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.070
here bringing you venison.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.700
"What is one of the most
important life lessons

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.280
that a life in food
has taught you?"

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.240
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, I think the
cooks are very generous people.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.500
They are giving people.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.260
I see all of those chefs.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.460
I go to the office of
any chef that I know.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.900
I will ask five or six
requests every week

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.720
to give your time to cook
for cystic fibrosis, heart,

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.260
battered woman, this.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.300
All of those organizations,
you want to raise money.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:57.750
And someone want to talk
about the state of your heart.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.580
If you have to pay $200 for
that, people won't come.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.730
But if you have 10 chefs
coming, cooking, five wineries

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.730
and so forth, then people
will pay for those.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.770
So a lot of those fundraising
are done through food.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.430
And the chefs give a great
deal of their time for that.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:17.890
The chefs are usually
very generous with time.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.630
And this is part of who we are
because you cannot really cook

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.480
differently.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.700
For me, you have to
be a technician first.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.700
You have to know how to add--
that is, a professional chef,

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.900
particularly.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.710
And if you happen
to have talent,

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:37.450
like someone like Thomas Keller
or Mark Franz at Farallon,

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:39.760
then you take that knowledge
you have in your hand,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.089
you take it farther.

00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:42.630
And if you put a
bit of love into it,

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:47.160
then you can really get
to extraordinary food.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.360
I paint for, as I
say, many years.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.060
But I'm not a good technician.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.950
I didn't spend years and
years and years of my life

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.540
learning the
technique of painting.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.050
So I may start something,
it come out halfway good.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.280
I'm happy with myself.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.540
Sometimes I paint over.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.400
But I don't have as
much control that I

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.840
would have in the kitchen.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.800
Yet however, if you spent
four, five years in art school

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.140
and learned the
law of perspective

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.720
and learn how to mix yellow
and blue to make green,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.210
learn you do that
with your thumb,

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.050
you do that with a spatula.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.530
Then you learn all the trick
of the trade, if you want.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:28.520
And you can sit outside now and
do one painting after another.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.550
Does that make you an artist?

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:31.319
Not really.

00:38:31.319 --> 00:38:32.985
At that level, you're
a good technician.

00:38:32.985 --> 00:38:34.590
You're a craftsmen.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.810
And likewise, in the kitchen.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.980
You can spend a few
years and really--

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.092
and I know many chefs
like that, working

00:38:40.092 --> 00:38:41.300
pretty fast, good technician.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.160
They can run a kitchen.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:48.140
And they are relatively
lousy cook, the food is not.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.670
You can still run a place.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.637
Now, if you happen to
have talent, however,

00:38:51.637 --> 00:38:53.220
and you're a good
technician, then you

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.780
can really take it higher.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.560
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Another person
online wanted to find out,

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.890
"plesae tell us what you like
the least and the most of how

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:08.200
the internet has changed the
world of cooking, the kitchen,

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.480
and how we eat."

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.880
JACQUES PEPIN: Well,
I have an iPod.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.990
No, iPhone I mean.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.800
Claude doesn't have a computer,
doesn't have a iPhone,

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.020
doesn't have any of this.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:30.970
So the computer has changed,
of course, a great deal of life

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.970
in the last 20 years,
but for us, probably

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.230
minimally in many ways.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.130
I send email, I do
that type of thing,

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:44.170
but otherwise I can rely on my
wife to do that type of thing.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:49.050
I don't really look at
the computer very much.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.310
I look at TV.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:51.930
I like TV.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:56.960
Usually I look at either
PBS or CNN or thing

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.690
like this, or some old movie.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.450
But I am not very
savvy with, I have

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.940
to say, unfortunately
with the computer.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.040
I haven't really
learned much about it

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.150
and spent much time with it.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:17.500
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Well, you
were on "Top Chef" as a judge.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.430
Are there any TV
shows that you like

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.960
to watch, like with
Anthony Bourdain, or--

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.090
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah,
I was on "The Chew"

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.750
a couple of weeks ago and I'm
supposed to go again soon.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.980
I was on "The Taste," that
show with Anthony Bourdain,

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.090
not too long ago, and I
did "Top Chef" a few times.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.740
But if I happen to know what
it is, if I don't miss it,

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.530
I will look at it.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:42.070
But most of the time, I miss
it because you do it ahead

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.930
and I don't know when it comes.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.430
And even my show.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:50.910
Occasionally, my wife says,
Saturday, usually your PBS show

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.237
will show over the weekend.

00:40:52.237 --> 00:40:54.570
My wife says, oh, you're on
at 4 o'clock this afternoon.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:55.420
So I may look at it.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.640
But very often we miss
it, because not there.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.270
It's very exciting when you do
a book or a television show,

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:08.380
what I'm doing, so you have all
of them to get them excited.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.360
But by the time
the book comes out,

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.900
after all of it and
the editing, you

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.200
don't even want to look at it.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.330
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Yeah, you're done.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:15.780
JACQUES PEPIN: And the
television, the excitement,

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.530
it's kind of gone.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.420
And yeah, it's coming out now.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.920
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: You're already
moved onto your next thing.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.878
JACQUES PEPIN: What
happened with PBS, too too,

00:41:23.878 --> 00:41:28.030
I am lucky enough to be in
probably 90% of the market.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:32.630
And there is about
470 stations or so.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.220
But we don't really
keep track of it.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.280
I don't, because it's
different in each town.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.860
So I'll be in Des Moines,
Iowa, and they say,

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.250
how come you're not there on
Wednesday afternoon anymore?

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.980
I don't even know I'm there
on Wednesday afternoon.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.950
The programmer take it in the
different city and program

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:52.830
the way they want.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.929
I'll go somewhere, they
show me twice a week,

00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:55.720
three times a week.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.190
I go another place, they
don't show my show at all.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.970
So it's hard to track it down.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:04.030
Usually in Connecticut, it's
on Saturday and in New York

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:06.740
it's on Sunday.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.660
And Long Island, it's on
Monday, for some reason.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.130
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
And what do you

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.910
think is one of the
most exciting cities

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.510
or cuisines to watch right now?

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.660
JACQUES PEPIN: This
is a leading question.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.480
Well, frankly, I
don't think there's

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.530
any place like New York.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.460
There is 24,000
restaurants in New York.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.395
And the amount of ethnicity,
different type of group,

00:42:31.395 --> 00:42:32.965
is just amazing.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.810
And even not only in Manhattan.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.630
You go into, well, Brooklyn
now, but in Queens.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.920
In Queens, especially
Asian food around Flushing.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.000
I went there on a little
sentimental journey

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.990
a few months ago for a magazine.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.140
The magazine of Queens
wanted to feature me on that

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.810
because I worked for
Howard Johnson ten years.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.030
It was in Queens Village.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.810
At that point we
live in Flushing.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.300
So we went back to
revisit those place.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.400
And I was amazed at the
diversity, quality food,

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.680
and how cheap it was.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.242
I have to say that San Francisco
is pretty close behind, too.

00:43:12.242 --> 00:43:14.700
I don't know how many restaurant
there is in San Francisco.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:20.350
But frankly, 20,
25 years ago, when

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.980
food started erupting
and so forth,

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.830
it was East Coast, West Coast--
New York, San Francisco.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.780
And then the center of the city,
from Chicago to Philadelphia,

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.140
to Dallas started going.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.040
And now you go to
very small town

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.030
and the chef-- there
has been so many

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.030
cooking school-- the
CIA, Culinary Institute

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.654
of America, Johnson &amp; Wales.

00:43:38.654 --> 00:43:40.820
And now there are thousand
and thousand and thousand

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.340
new chefs, which is
different than it used to be.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.022
And those young chefs often
go back to a small town,

00:43:47.022 --> 00:43:49.480
somewhere in the middle, and
open a small restaurant there,

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:55.480
which was not done
even 15, 20 years ago.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.800
So it's very
exciting in that way.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.660
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: So in terms
of some questions from the room,

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.080
are we outfitted
with a microphone?

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.940
JACQUES PEPIN: Yeah, I have one.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.190
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: They can
come up and ask your yours.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.825
So if anyone has some
questions for Jacques,

00:44:14.825 --> 00:44:16.859
please come on up to the mic.

00:44:30.329 --> 00:44:32.412
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to ask, what dish have you

00:44:32.412 --> 00:44:34.530
made the most?

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.760
JACQUES PEPIN: What dish
have I done the most?

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.710
Probably soup.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:44.020
We always have soup at home
during the winter, too.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.920
Often, what my wife
calls French soup--

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.890
open the refrigerator,
what's there

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.700
from salad leftover, a
carrot, this, that too.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.459
In fact, I remember, the
first series that I did

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:56.500
called "Today's Gourmet."

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.540
It was in 1989, I
believe, at KQED.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:03.776
And Claudine, my daughter, at
that time was in college at BU.

00:45:03.776 --> 00:45:06.830
I teach at BU also
for 32 years now.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:11.110
So Claudine was at BU, and
she came to the show with me.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:14.030
And Peter Stein was the
producer at the time.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.010
And we finished.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:15.980
We went fast.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.970
He say, you have
three minutes left.

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:19.570
What can you do?

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:22.220
I say, well let's do
a soup, or whatever.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.130
So I went into the
refrigerator, pick up

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.590
the wilted carrot, a
piece of [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.120
I tell Claudine, what do you
have in your refrigerator

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.220
at school?

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.144
So she brought me
all that stuff.

00:45:33.144 --> 00:45:34.560
She said, well,
we throw that out.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.320
I said, uh-uh.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.930
So I did a soup or
whatever I did with her,

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:41.280
and it was one of the segments
people loved the most.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.647
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:42.647 --> 00:45:43.730
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: Love it.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.790
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.635
AUDIENCE: The relationships
with people around me

00:45:49.635 --> 00:45:51.760
have a profound
influence on my cooking.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.530
I tend to try to perfect dishes
that the people who I love

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:57.490
love.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.330
And if I want to go home and
do something nice for my wife,

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.120
I've got a bouquet of flowers
and a bag of buckwheat flour

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.610
to make her blini.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:07.075
I'm curious if the
relationships you have

00:46:07.075 --> 00:46:09.340
have had a similar
influence on your cooking,

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.090
and is there a particular
dish that you've

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.710
tried to perfect to
make somebody happy?

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:17.340
JACQUES PEPIN: Well, you always
cook for the people love,

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.190
without any question-- for the
family, the most important.

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:24.740
But after 48 years
of marriage, my wife

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.800
may have asked my
advice years ago.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.674
Now, usually, when I go into
the kitchen, she's cooking.

00:46:31.674 --> 00:46:33.590
She don't tell me,
darling, what do you think?

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:37.120
She tells me, don't
touch anything.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.960
So yes, being born in New
York from a Puerto Rican

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.260
mother and a Cuban father.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:47.740
So there is some
Caribbean influence

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.230
in it, too, and taste.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:53.980
And she loves Japanese cooking
as well as Vietnamese, too.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.900
So she cooks some of that, we
cook some of that together.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.110
But we do cook together.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.660
But after those
years, so many years,

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.870
we don't even have
to talk too much.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:07.420
We have our area, which have
been pretty much divided

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:08.344
throughout the years.

00:47:08.344 --> 00:47:09.760
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Like the closet.

00:47:13.489 --> 00:47:14.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.946
It's great to be here.

00:47:14.946 --> 00:47:16.540
Thank you.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:20.130
I'm reading the book, "The Third
Plate" by Dan Barber right now,

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.181
the future of our plate.

00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:23.180
And I was wondering what
you thought about that.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.770
What would be-- what does our
plate look like in the future?

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.000
JACQUES PEPIN: I'm sorry,
I couldn't-- I'm old.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.850
AUDIENCE: So that's the
future of our plate.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.030
What does our plate look
like in our future--

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.500
near future, far future.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.210
What does our plate look like?

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:41.110
JACQUES PEPIN: What our food
will look like in general?

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.840
What I hope that--
actually, there is hope.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.410
We are going back, it
seems to me, more the way

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.320
we cooked many years ago.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.090
Maybe not the way.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.150
I talk about my mother--
my mother died a month

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.370
and a half ago.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.770
She was 99 and 1/2, too.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:03.960
And I went to see her
in July this summer.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.640
I talk about my
mother and my father.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.530
I said, my mother was
an organic farmer.

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:08.770
My father, too.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:12.060
Well, the word organic
did not exist anyway.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.380
But since chemical
fertilizer did not

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.130
exist either and
fungicide, insecticide,

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.260
pesticide did not exist
either, everyone was organic.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.180
That was the way it was.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:27.430
In addition to this, my mother
had a small restaurant there,

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:30.580
which may sound
pretty romantic now,

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.080
which we didn't think it
was romantic at the time.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.952
My brother and I,
before going to school

00:48:35.952 --> 00:48:38.660
in the morning at 8
o'clock, at 6:30, 7 o'clock,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.940
we followed her to the market.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.410
There was no car at the time.

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:44.420
Market was about a
mile, half a mile long.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.800
She walked one way, look at
the ingredient, buy on the way

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.840
back.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.900
Everyone knew her.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.435
So she going to buy a case
of mushroom, which you know

00:48:52.435 --> 00:48:53.330
is dark.

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.829
She know the guy's
got to sell it.

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:55.870
He cannot give it to her.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.790
And she want to argue
the price and so forth.

00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:59.550
Get back to her
restaurant, start cooking

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.460
for her lunch and dinner.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.750
Remember, there was no
refrigeration at the time.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.250
There was an icebox.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.140
So she bought a block
of ice every day

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.629
to put her fish and her meat.

00:49:08.629 --> 00:49:11.170
It would have to be finished by
the day, her vegetables, too.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.560
So the day after,
everything was new again.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.000
So all the product were organic
because nothing else existed.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.310
It was not a big deal.

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:20.990
And everything was
fresh, and too,

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.110
because you didn't have
refrigeration or freezer.

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:28.040
So it was a different
type of thing,

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.130
which was very menial and
very ordinary at the time,

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.610
is coming back now, in
a sense-- the vengeance

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:35.390
of something very fancy.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:39.160
Organic food, local food,
and stuff like this.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:44.630
But we come to
exaggerate in America

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:47.286
going one end to the
other end of the spectrum.

00:49:47.286 --> 00:49:48.660
And now you have
an organic food.

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.118
I've been in a restaurant where
they bring the carrot to me

00:49:51.118 --> 00:49:53.260
and said, that carrot
is called Nella.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.660
She was born on the
7th of December.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.860
That's my carrot?

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:01.690
So it can go a little
too far this way too.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:05.030
I hope we get away
from processed food.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.270
Processed food is the
worst thing you can eat.

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.240
If you start looking
at what's in it,

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.930
first you don't know what it is.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.380
And according to my grandmother,
you should never eat anything

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.900
you cannot recognize
to start with.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.770
And on those things,
not only it becomes

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:22.030
dangerous the kids
are eating this.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.610
And now I have seen young
kids not only recognizing

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:28.610
the product, but recognizing
the color of the box.

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.670
I want the red box, or
I want the blue box.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:34.130
And by the time we get away
from food, that much-- I mean,

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.300
that kid should know that a
chicken's got a head and feet.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.340
It's not a square thing
with plastic on top.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.040
So we try to teach the kids,
take them to the garden,

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.770
get stuff out of the ground
to make them test it,

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:46.980
and so forth.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.030
And it's not that complicated.

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:54.485
My granddaughter, she doesn't
like to weed the garden,

00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:57.630
but she does a great job anyway.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:02.190
Anyway, so I hope the future is
more than the food of the past.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.510
And it seems that it's
coming back, certainly, here

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:06.460
at Google.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.510
I have been here before
at your restaurant.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.550
I was very impressed by
the quality of the food

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:14.435
that you serve,
the employees too.

00:51:14.435 --> 00:51:16.060
I was even more
impressed by the price.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:16.935
No one paid anything.

00:51:16.935 --> 00:51:18.776
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:18.776 --> 00:51:20.747
That's amazing.

00:51:20.747 --> 00:51:21.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.621
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.

00:51:25.815 --> 00:51:27.190
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
So we are going

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:31.010
to be looking forward to "Heart
and Soul," launching in fall

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:35.954
of 2015, and take this wonderful
trip through your memories

00:51:35.954 --> 00:51:37.370
and all these
people in your life,

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.830
and to see some of the places
that are part of your home.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.288
JACQUES PEPIN:
Thank you very much.

00:51:40.288 --> 00:51:42.770
I'm looking forward to it, too.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:47.490
And I hope I continue to do
some show with my granddaughter

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:51.040
and with my daughter
and with my friend.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.430
If not, it's OK.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:56.760
The world of chef has
changed tremendously.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.530
And as I said, when we
get into that business,

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.540
we didn't want into
that business, quote,

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.260
"to become famous,"
because at that time when

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.456
we work in Paris, we go
out dancing somewhere.

00:52:07.456 --> 00:52:09.580
And you invite a girl and
she says, what do you do?

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:10.620
You say, I'm a cook.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:13.050
Even at the Plaza Athenee
or the great place in Paris,

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.680
it was pretty low
on the social scale.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.250
Now it's very, very different.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:23.970
And the chefs are recognized
in many ways, maybe too much.

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:26.680
And I know that at the French
Culinary Institute in New York

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.350
or at BU, when
I'm there teaching

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.610
and you have a student coming
to talk to me for an exit

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:33.330
interview.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:36.350
And they say, Chef, I have a
great idea for a cooking show.

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.305
I have a great
idea to do a book.

00:52:38.305 --> 00:52:40.550
They don't even know how
to peel a carrot yet.

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:44.000
And so this is not
the right reason

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.630
to go into that business,
because it's very likely

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.530
that it will never happen.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.080
And you still work
12 hours a day.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.880
You still get varicose veins by
the time you're 40 years old.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.430
And you sweat a lot, and you
work Saturday and Sunday.

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:01.600
And you're not paid
that much, unless you

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.360
get at the last echelon.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.470
Don't get into that business
to, quote, "become famous."

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:10.380
But if you do it for
the right reason--

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.950
that it gratifies
you, that you're

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:15.696
happy to cook for someone, it
pleases you, makes you happy,

00:53:15.696 --> 00:53:18.070
the type of life that you want
to do-- then, well, you'll

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:18.570
be happy.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:20.360
And maybe you'll
become famous, too.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.080
It may happen.

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.060
But even if it doesn't,
you'll have a happy life.

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.310
I mean, I've been cooking
for over 60 years.

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:29.780
When people see me,
usually they smile.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.800
I bring pleasure to
the life of people.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.190
If I were a doctor,
they'd kind of

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:37.310
look at me with not
too much anticipation.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:44.310
So it's a good life to be in if
you go in for the right reason,

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:45.462
I think.

00:53:45.462 --> 00:53:46.920
MARCIA GAGLIARDI:
Wonderful advice.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.040
It's been such an honor
to speak with you today.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.200
JACQUES PEPIN: Thank you.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:49.535
Thank you very much.

00:53:49.535 --> 00:53:51.250
MARCIA GAGLIARDI: And
to hear your stories.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.583
Thank you so much for your time.

00:53:52.583 --> 00:53:54.900
[APPLAUSE]
