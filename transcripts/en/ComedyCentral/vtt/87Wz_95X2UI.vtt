00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.659
- SO TUNA IN TO SEE WHO'S
GONNA GET PRANKED.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.463
HOW ODD, IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US
SITTING HERE

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.164

- YEAH, WITH NOBODY...

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.068
GETTING PRANKED.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:12.872

OH, HO, HO!

IN FRONT OF HIM.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.785
- WHAT IS THIS?
NO, I DON'T WANT--

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:26.986

THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.588
'CAUSE THIS IS SUPPOSED

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.556
- NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK...

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.959
- THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
OVER HERE.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:36.462
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIS

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:47.406

THE OTHER WAY AROUND HERE?

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.875
- NOTHING'S HAPPENING.
I GOT A POTATO BUN.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.376
THERE'S SOMETHING UNDER IT.
I'M NOT EVEN LOOKING.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.644
I DON'T EVEN CARE.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.279

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.014

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.263
- YOU'RE BORN A SCHMUCK
AND YOU'LL DIE A SCHMUCK.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.564
WELCOME TO HELL, IDIOT.

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.300
