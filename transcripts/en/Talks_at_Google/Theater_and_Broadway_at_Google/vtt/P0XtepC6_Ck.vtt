00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.808
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:06.750
ALAN SEALES: Please
welcome to the stage

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.220
the entire cast of
Broadway's "Come From Away."

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:28.100
[MUSIC - COME FROM AWAY
ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.630
"WELCOME TO THE ROCK"]

00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:27.319
ALAN SEALES: All right,
that was amazing.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.610
Give another round of applause.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.030
That was awesome.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.420
So full disclosure,
this is the largest cast

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.580
we've ever had on this stage,
so excuse all the chairs.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.500
It's quite impressive, and
thanks to the tech crew.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.050
So "Welcome to the Rock" was
the opening for that song.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.730
What is the rock?

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.272
DAVID HEIN: The rock
is Newfoundland.

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:50.063
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:52.115
DAVID HEIN: Newfoundland
is an island province

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:55.660
on the Northeast tip of
North America, in Canada.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.840
And in 2001, they welcomed a
number of planes and passengers

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.790
because all the planes
were diverted when

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.050
the US airspace was closed.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.620
ALAN SEALES: Right, OK.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.786
So I want to get into the
timeline about this first.

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:08.384
But the four of you
who just joined us

00:05:08.384 --> 00:05:10.800
after the performance, go down
the line here and introduce

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.850
yourselves and what you do.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.100
DAVID HEIN: So I'm David Hein.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.200
I'm one of the writers.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.574
IRENE SANKOFF:
I'm Irene Sankoff.

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:16.782
I am the other writer.

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:18.240
IAN EISENDRATH:
I'm Ian Eisendrath.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.699
I'm the music supervisor,
arranger, and conductor.

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.990
KELLY DEVINE: I'm Kelly Devine.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.372
I'm the choreographer.

00:05:23.372 --> 00:05:24.330
ALAN SEALES: Wonderful.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.880
OK, so the timeline of
September 11th, 9:26,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.090
FAA closes airspace.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.760
12:00 PM, 18 planes--

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.030
Gander, the city
that this happens in,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.710
was told 18 planes will land.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.486
And then by 12:15, 13
additional planes had landed.

00:05:42.486 --> 00:05:43.860
And then at the
end of it all, it

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.260
was 38 planes total, carrying
almost 7,000 people into--

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.960
came into a town that only
had 10,000 people in it

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.852
to begin with.

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:56.310
And they weren't even allowed
to leave the plane for hours,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.550
right?

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.360
DAVID HEIN: Yeah.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.540
ALAN SEALES: So
getting into that--

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.580
as the writers, I think this
all begins with the two of you.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.350
Why?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.710
Where did you find this story,
and why did you write it?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.680
IRENE SANKOFF: It was a
story that was suggested

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.580
to us by a friend of ours.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.920
And we applied to
get a grant to go out

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.732
to see what was happening on the
10th anniversary of September

00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:20.190
11, because a lot of the people
who had been stranded there

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.790
10 years before were going
to return because 10 years

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.297
later, they still felt so
much gratitude and so much

00:06:27.297 --> 00:06:29.130
respect for the people
who had taken them in

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.360
and had become lifelong friends.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.943
So we thought, OK,
there's going to be

00:06:31.943 --> 00:06:33.390
all these ceremonies happening.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.330
We need to be there
and just find out

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.780
why this place means
so much to these people

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.210
that they would come
back 10 years later.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.890
DAVID HEIN: So we
traveled out there.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.860
We, like Irene said,
we had a grant,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.432
but we actually got to stay a
little bit longer to extend it

00:06:48.432 --> 00:06:49.890
because the people
were there like,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.390
uh, don't spend
money on a hotel.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.140
Come stay with us.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.640
Here's the keys,
just feed the cats.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.010
ALAN SEALES: So they still
extended the hospitality

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.552
all the time.

00:06:56.552 --> 00:06:58.843
DAVID HEIN: Yeah, we saw the
same generosity out there.

00:06:58.843 --> 00:07:00.390
And we ended up
interviewing everyone

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.550
we possibly could
for hours at a time,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.900
and we just came back with--

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.650
you mentioned 7,000
people on the plane,

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.320
there was around
9,000 people in town.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.080
And we came back with
like 16,000 stories,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.490
and we wanted to
tell all of them

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.159
and tried to do that in 100
minute musical with 12 actors.

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:17.700
ALAN SEALES: Well, OK, so I want
to take a step back, though.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.280
The title, "Come From Away,"
what is a come from away?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.946
IRENE SANKOFF: Come
from away is someone

00:07:21.946 --> 00:07:24.010
who is not from Newfoundland.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.890
So if you're not
born on the rock,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.082
then you're considered
a come from away.

00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:29.790
ALAN SEALES: And is
it like a New Yorker,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.830
where after 10 years
and you get angry enough

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.627
you become a New Yorker?

00:07:33.627 --> 00:07:34.960
IRENE SANKOFF: I don't think so.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.400
I don't think so.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.020
I think you could
have lived on a rock

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.369
longer than if
you had actually--

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:40.910
like than you've
lived anywhere else,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.140
and you're still come from away.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.092
Although apparently, David
and I are now honorary--

00:07:46.092 --> 00:07:47.550
DAVID HEIN: There's
a ceremony that

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.216
happens in the show
called a screech in,

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:52.590
where you ostensibly become
an honorary Newfoundlander,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.400
and that's happened
to us three times.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.300
You have to kiss a fish, you
have to drink some drinks.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.930
ALAN SEALES: But that's real?

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.440
DAVID HEIN: It's real.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.790
IRENE SANKOFF: Oh yeah.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.280
ALAN SEALES: Oh wow.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.360
DAVID HEIN: So it's happened
to us three times and--

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.818
ALAN SEALES: You
kissed three fish.

00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:02.670
DAVID HEIN: Yes.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.170
Yep.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.680
I mean, in the ceremony.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.600
But at the end of
that, we were talking

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.933
to one of the Newfoundlanders
that we based the show on.

00:08:11.933 --> 00:08:14.370
And I would saying, so, we've
been screeched in already.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.420
We've been screeched
in three times.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.336
We're Newfoundlanders.

00:08:16.336 --> 00:08:19.080
He's like, no, you're
a mainlander still.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.080
I was like, we wrote
a show about you.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.710
ALAN SEALES: So
did the skeptics,

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.147
I guess-- when you were
trying to put this together,

00:08:28.147 --> 00:08:29.730
were there are people
who were saying,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.760
like, you guys are
insane to make a musical,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.799
to write music or write
a story about this

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.150
and try to get it on stage.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.405
I mean, was there
any adversity there?

00:08:38.405 --> 00:08:39.530
DAVID HEIN: Yeah, I think--

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.360
IRENE SANKOFF: Oh, yeah.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.460
Yeah, I mean, like starting
writing Newfoundland

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.001
and we were getting a tour of
the airport and the guy's like,

00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:46.590
so you're going
to write a musical

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.200
about making people sandwiches?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.592
Good luck with that.

00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:52.050
DAVID HEIN: And
then beyond that, I

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.380
mean obviously, it's set against
the backdrop of what happened

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.680
here in New York on 9/11.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.300
And we've been very clear
that it's not a 9/11 story,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.390
it's a 9/12 story.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.234
It's about the way this
community responded to it.

00:09:04.234 --> 00:09:06.150
But also, we had a lot
of sensitivity to that.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.600
We were living here on 9/11.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.980
My cousin was in the towers,
but fortunately he got out.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.770
But there was a lot of what
happened in Newfoundland that

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.170
resonated with us
in terms of-- we

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.180
lived up at around
122nd and Broadway,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.501
at this residence for
international graduate

00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:21.000
students.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.970
So people from 110 countries
from around the world all

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.610
waiting for news, all
waiting for them to return

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.037
and supporting each
other as a community.

00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:31.620
So there's something about this
international community coming

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.020
together to each other
that was familiar to us.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.040
But also in the time
after 9/11 in New York,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.660
it felt like there was--

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.550
the boundaries broke
down between people.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.520
You could reach out to
anyone and say, you OK?

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.280
How are you doing?

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.530
And that's what happened
in Newfoundland.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.500
I think that's what happened
internationally in many cities.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.739
And it's something that--

00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:54.030
what happened in Newfoundland
reminded us of that time.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.071
It reminded us of how kind
we were to each other.

00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:58.344
And so there's something
that really resonated with us

00:09:58.344 --> 00:09:59.010
about the story.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.390
ALAN SEALES: It's interesting
that what you just said

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.830
resonates with me, that
the boundaries went down.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.710
Again, like your
morning commute,

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.150
going to and from work,
whatever, you're just like,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.620
don't touch me,
get out of my way,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.537
tourists pointing their
fingers in your faces.

00:10:09.537 --> 00:10:12.120
And then you've got a whole town
of people here that just say,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.860
screw it, let's let
all these people in.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.550
They have nowhere to go.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.050
They've been in
a plane for hours

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.230
and don't know
when they will ever

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.270
get back on, if they
will anytime soon.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.850
So yeah, it was a
nice story to tell.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.840
And then it went to--

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.942
you did a run in Toronto, right?

00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:27.650
DAVID HEIN: Yeah.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.930
So it was originally
workshopped in Toronto.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.846
And then we took
it to Connecticut.

00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:34.970
We did a presentation here.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.860
ALAN SEALES:
Connecticut, really?

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.620
DAVID HEIN: Yeah, at
Goodspeed festivals.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.440
And then we did the first
production with these guys,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.050
with almost all these
guys in San Diego, which

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.810
was a co-production with
Seattle Rep, La Jolla

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.100
Playhouse and Seattle Rep.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.380
We took it to Washington,
D.C. We took it back

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.360
to Gander for two
benefit concerts,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.690
where all the proceeds went
back to local charities, which

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.240
was our way of giving back
to the community there.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.910
And then took it to Toronto
for a full production,

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.230
and now we're here on Broadway.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.900
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.870
KELLY DEVINE: We've been
on tour for a long time.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.286
ALAN SEALES: So I
was going to ask

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:07.640
Kelly and Ian, the two of
you, how did you get attached

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.610
to the show in the first place?

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.065
KELLY DEVINE: Uh,
musical genius.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.370
IAN EISENDRATH: I was working at
the Fifth Avenue Theater, which

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.420
is a theater in Seattle that
does a lot of development

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.470
of new musicals.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.010
And at that point, I
met David and Irene.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.087
And we had a waffle
breakfast that

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.670
was the beginning
of our relationship.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.490
It was fantastic.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.281
We decided we could
eat breakfast together,

00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:34.410
we could certainly
make music together.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.440
And that was in advance
of the workshop.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.050
That was when Kelly first worked
on the material, and Chris

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.120
Ashley, our director.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.150
And they've been stuck
with me ever since.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.120
KELLY DEVINE: I actually
saw their workshop

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.474
that they did in Goodspeed,
is when we first met.

00:11:50.474 --> 00:11:52.640
I was working on another
show and we were neighbors.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.306
Our houses were next
door to each other,

00:11:54.306 --> 00:11:56.310
because you all sort of
live, all the writers

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.264
and collaborators
who live in a home

00:11:58.264 --> 00:12:00.430
together for two weeks,
which is really interesting.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.061
And so we'd see each other--

00:12:03.061 --> 00:12:05.560
well, all of a sudden, you feel
like you're at camp together

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.410
with people you don't
know that well, but you're

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.420
like waking up in your
pajamas and you're like,

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.586
I'm going to brush my teeth.

00:12:10.586 --> 00:12:12.110
It's just-- it's all-inclusive.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.400
Yeah.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.230
But yeah, so I saw
the show there.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.730
And then I knew--

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.230
I thought the show
was very special,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.560
and I particularly think these
two are really, really special.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.160
We had a lot of fun.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.975
And then Chris Ashley
called me, and I

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:27.329
had worked with him prior.

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:29.370
And he said, hey, I'm
working on this show called

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.078
"Come From Away."

00:12:30.078 --> 00:12:32.040
And I was like, I
know "Come From Away."

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.660
I was so thrilled.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.190
So yeah, that's
how that happened.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:39.540
ALAN SEALES: So you're
the musical staging,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.240
which isn't-- is that
different from choreographer?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.900
KELLY DEVINE: You
know, it's funny.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.330
That question comes up a lot.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.840
It is and it isn't.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.320
I mean, any sort of
musical staging to music

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.940
has choreography in it.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.790
And I think the misconception
is that choreography is just

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.090
dance, like real dance,
like classical dance

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.120
that we're used to seeing in
like "West Side Story" would

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.160
feel like a big dance show.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.030
And I think choreography
over the last 10 years

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.040
has changed into something else.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.860
And a lot of time,
moving furniture

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.880
can be just as much choreography
as it is doing a triple turn.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.930
And I think there's
a little bit of both.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.700
They're really stoked
about the furniture.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.020
They're really happy about it.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.645
SPEAKER 1: None of
us can really dance.

00:13:23.645 --> 00:13:24.614
That's why we laugh.

00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:26.280
KELLY DEVINE: Now,
but you just blew it,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.530
because everybody thinks you
dance beautifully in the show.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:28.980
SPEAKER 1: That's you.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.790
KELLY DEVINE: I get that a lot.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.873
SPEAKER 1: That's all you.

00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:33.270
KELLY DEVINE: Well, listen,
we worked on it together.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.830
But yeah, there is
dance in the show,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.370
and then there's also lots
of-- there's big transitions

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.680
that happen in the show
that are choreographed

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.940
within an inch of their life.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.247
So that's sort of--

00:13:43.247 --> 00:13:43.830
if that helps.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.440
ALAN SEALES: Great.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.856
No, I was going
to ask about that.

00:13:45.856 --> 00:13:51.280
The cast here is we'll
say an experienced cast.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.959
It is not a bunch
of college grad

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.500
stay up all night
whatever, you know,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.610
burning the candle on both ends.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.651
You guys are responsible.

00:14:00.651 --> 00:14:02.670
You've honed your craft.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.813
Have you had--

00:14:03.813 --> 00:14:04.854
IRENE SANKOFF: Well done.

00:14:04.854 --> 00:14:06.030
DAVID HEIN: Wow.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.896
ALAN SEALES: Have you
had to tailor or--

00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:09.270
I guess, how was
the choreography

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.580
influenced for this
particular set of individuals

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.256
for this particular show?

00:14:13.256 --> 00:14:14.880
KELLY DEVINE: They're
laughing already.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.380
I haven't even said anything
and they're cracking up.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.120
Well, let's go the professional
route first, shall we?

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.619
OK.

00:14:23.619 --> 00:14:24.330
So--

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:24.670
ALAN SEALES: First.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.580
KELLY DEVINE: I would
say in all honesty,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.070
it was really important that
this story feel very true

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.410
to Newfoundland
and to these people

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.810
that we are representing.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.170
So that was the basis.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.530
And they are real people.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.320
You know, Newfoundland
is not filled

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.767
with professional ballet dancers
or classically trained dancers.

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:45.350
So it was finding
that movement first,

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.180
and then it was
working with these guys

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.030
to find what they do best,
highlight that, and then expand

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.710
on it.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.924
And hours and hours
and hours of rehearsal,

00:14:52.924 --> 00:14:53.840
and lots of hard work.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.070
I mean, that's truly--

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.270
right?

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.200
That's what we did.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.755
DAVID HEIN: It's really just--

00:14:57.755 --> 00:14:58.760
KELLY DEVINE: You don't want to
know about the trial and error

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.260
part.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.530
That was a long time ago.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.979
That was ages ago.

00:15:01.979 --> 00:15:03.770
DAVID HEIN: What Kelly
and Chris have done,

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.040
for anyone who hasn't seen the
show, for Irene and I seeing it

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.170
come to life is really amazing.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.570
Because we wanted to tell
so many stories, what

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.870
these guys do on stage is switch
from character to character

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.120
on a dime, switch from
place to place using

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.800
only 12 chairs and two tables.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.440
And so there's a lot
of moving furniture

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.970
that is choreographed there.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.070
And it's this magic trick
that we never get tired of.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.070
It's immediately a bus,
immediately an airplane,

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.990
immediately a legion hall.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.310
And characters are
switching on a dime.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.370
It's really-- it's
fun for us to watch,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.930
and we've seen it
a million times.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.627
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I enjoyed it.

00:15:37.627 --> 00:15:39.710
Now that you mention it
again, it's very seamless.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.050
And you go cut back
and you're creating--

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.790
you're creating individual
scenes without ever changing

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.290
the set.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.950
I mean, the set itself is fixed.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:52.400
It's a one act set on
Broadway, which is very rare.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.960
But I want to get Ian.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.180
I'm confused about
musical supervisor,

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.440
or musical arrangements,
but then David and Irene,

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.060
you both are credited
with the music, as well.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.600
So how did the music
collaboration happen,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.219
and how did these credits work?

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.510
IAN EISENDRATH: You know,
it's confusing for every show

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.060
and every music department,
but Dave and Irene definitely,

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.590
they wrote the show.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.420
They created the story.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.350
They decided who would sing
when and what they would sing.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.900
And I always think of my
job as the arranger or music

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.910
supervisor to get in
the trenches with them,

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:33.410
help to flesh out
specific moments based

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.570
on the work that
Kelly's doing, based

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.840
on what Chris is doing,
taking the words and the music

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.020
that they wrote, adding
even more texture,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.470
putting things in the right
keys for various singers,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.660
various moments, sometimes
extending things,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.030
shortening things.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:53.060
We have a group of 12
phenomenal actor-singers,

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.990
it's not your traditional
group of even spread of voices.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.480
It's very much a unique
group of singers,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.120
and I think we had a great
time in the room figuring out

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.280
what the vocal arrangements
are, like which

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.040
notes each person sings,
and really creating

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.839
a score that lives on them.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.690
So I'd say Dave and Irene came
to us with like the ground

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.040
plans, the foundation.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.740
And then our job, sort of
alongside with Chris and Kelly,

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.810
just like they
put it on stage, I

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.900
focused on coloring
in and filling out

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.510
what was already there, which
was just a great baseline

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.464
to build from.

00:17:24.464 --> 00:17:26.630
And working really closely
with this group of people

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.970
and figuring out where did
they live, what notes do they

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.140
sing the best?

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.289
Stylistically, what
do they do the best?

00:17:32.289 --> 00:17:34.580
I think something that's
really special about that show

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.530
and I'll be forever
grateful to-- these

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.820
are like 12 principal actors
who should all be singing solos

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.680
nonstop on a Broadway stage.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.890
What makes this show unique is
you have these 12 people coming

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.790
together to form an ensemble,
very representative of what

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.940
happened in Newfoundland on that
day, all these people coming

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.390
from all over the world.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.030
And they are singing
together and we

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.890
are feeling that power of
12 really strong performers

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.430
becoming one and sometimes
representing 15,000.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.390
DAVID HEIN: And then and
then beyond just the vocals,

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.480
the music of the
show, the band--

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.060
Ian leads our
amazing band onstage,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.760
which represents
Newfoundland music.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.330
I grew up on that, and--

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.415
IAN EISENDRATH: you can
get a bodhran in there.

00:18:18.415 --> 00:18:19.030
Yeah, we do.

00:18:20.095 --> 00:18:23.790
Bodhran, fiddles,
accordions, bouzouki--

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.590
IAN EISENDRATH: A guy that plays
over 22 different tin whistles,

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.639
Irish flute, and pipes.

00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:30.680
DAVID HEIN: It's really--

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.720
it's this traditional
authentic music,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.450
but you put it on
a Broadway stage

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:40.190
and it feels unique and new,
and we've seen a lot of shows

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.830
and we've never seen
something like this before.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.370
And then we layer on top of
that world music on top of it,

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.190
to sort of create this
musical metaphor of people

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.000
coming from all over the place
and contrasting, you know,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.280
fiddles from Newfoundland
versus fiddles from Texas

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.640
or hand drums, bodhrans from
Newfoundland versus hand drums

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.920
from Africa, and
creating something that's

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.850
this layered metaphor for being
stronger together and coming

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.350
together.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.180
And Ian's been responsible
for the arrangements of that

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.491
and leading it and learning how
to play button accordion, as

00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:11.990
well.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.320
IAN EISENDRATH: That's--

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.730
KELLY DEVINE: Those
were fun days.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.140
IAN EISENDRATH:
Those were fun days.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.250
KELLY DEVINE: When he was
learn in the accordion.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.242
It was all the time.

00:19:17.242 --> 00:19:19.450
IAN EISENDRATH: Kelly would
come up to me, Ian, stop.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.520
I'm trying to stage a number.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.525
But I'm trying to
learn this accordion.

00:19:23.525 --> 00:19:25.400
ALAN SEALES: I like at
the end of the curtain

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.149
call the drummer runs
on stage, he's like,

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:28.934
hey, how is it going?

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:32.050
So the people, all
12, the cast members,

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.280
you are all phenomenal.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.000
I want you to take a moment
and introduce yourselves.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.333
And Kendra, why don't you start.

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:38.995
KENDRA KASSEBAUM: Hi, my
name is Kendra Kassebaum.

00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:40.649
RODNEY HICKS: I am Rodney Hicks.

00:19:40.649 --> 00:19:42.190
SHARON WHEATLEY:
I'm Sharon Wheatley.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.380
LEE MCDOUGALL:
I'm Lee McDougall.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.710
JENN COLELLA: I'm Jenn Colella.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.090
JOEL HATCH: I am Joel Hatch.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.340
CAESAR SAMAYOA Caesar Samayoa.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.060
ASTRID VAN WIEREN:
Hi, Astrid Van Wieren.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.960
Q SMITH: Q Smith.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.160
CHAD KIMBALL: Chad Kimball.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.970
PETRIN BROMLEY: Petrina Bromley.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.260
GENO CARR: Hi, thank you.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.382
Geno Carr.

00:19:54.382 --> 00:19:55.840
ALAN SEALES: Geno's
Broadway debut.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.250
Thank you guys.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.130
IAN EISENDRATH: A
couple Broadway debuts.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.604
KELLY DEVINE: Yeah,
we got a bunch.

00:20:00.604 --> 00:20:01.645
ALAN SEALES: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:01.645 --> 00:20:03.160
SPEAKER 1: There's a
few Broadway debuts.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.300
ALAN SEALES: Oh,
raise your hand.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:04.716
Whose debut?

00:20:04.716 --> 00:20:05.072
Raise your hand.

00:20:05.072 --> 00:20:06.500
DAVID HEIN: All the Canadians.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.791
ALAN SEALES: All the Canadians.

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.300
IRENE SANKOFF:
All the Canadians.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.280
ALAN SEALES: OK, so we should
have you guys using the mics.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.632
SPEAKER 2: The Canucks.

00:20:13.632 --> 00:20:16.150
ALAN SEALES: Canucks.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.749
The cast, Ian, you kept
mentioning like you had all

00:20:18.749 --> 00:20:21.040
this cast and then you were
figuring out who sang where

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.498
and what was best, and who can
move and who can do a triple

00:20:23.498 --> 00:20:25.620
pirouette and who can't.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.150
IAN EISENDRATH: They all
can is what we learned.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.483
ALAN SEALES: Raise your hand
if it's your Broadway debut

00:20:30.483 --> 00:20:33.580
and you can do a
triple pirouette.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.110
It sounded to me like as you
were telling the story a second

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.650
ago that the story, along
with the music and the books

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.380
and everything-- and
whatever that was--

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.230
and the cast was--

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.420
the cast came with the show.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.729
How did the casting work?

00:20:47.729 --> 00:20:49.270
I mean, how did you
find these people

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.940
and then say, oh, let's figure
out what we can sing with them?

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.950
Usually it's the reverse, right?

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:54.820
IAN EISENDRATH: I always
think it's interesting

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.944
the first time you cast a
new musical, because that

00:20:56.944 --> 00:20:59.080
was really the first time
we were all in the room

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.680
together to even have
conversations about how are we

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.210
going to do this with 12 people?

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.680
What do they need to do?

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.360
Kelly has a specific
list of needs.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.310
ALAN SEALES: Why did
you decide on 12?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.520
DAVID HEIN: We started
out at I think--

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.390
IRENE SANKOFF: It
didn't start out at 12.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.570
It went back and
forth a couple times

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.750
and we ended on 12, right?

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.000
DAVID HEIN: It was 14 initially
when we first started,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.750
and I think partly we're
trying to tell so many stories

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.650
and we're Canadian, and there's
a very Canadian ethos of like,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.230
well, I got a truck and I have
a church, let's put on a show.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.563
So we figured we could probably
afford 12 people, maybe.

00:21:32.734 --> 00:21:34.150
But also, there's
something really

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.170
wonderful about 12 people
portraying all of these people.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.600
Every one of them plays a
local and a come from away.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.826
There's something
that's sort of--

00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:44.450
there's this great
metaphor underneath,

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.629
which is we're all the
same underneath it all.

00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:49.420
And so there's something
about just casting

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.670
it and having people
play multiple parts that

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.480
underlines that.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.896
ALAN SEALES: So
did you cast based

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:59.440
on overall look and pirouette
and singing ability?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.720
I mean--

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.397
KELLY DEVINE: It all
started with the dancing.

00:22:03.397 --> 00:22:05.230
ALAN SEALES: Everybody
bring your tap shoes.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.030
IAN EISENDRATH: Dancing first,
anything else is a bonus.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.130
KELLY DEVINE: Everything
else is secondary, I'm sorry.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.480
IRENE SANKOFF: You know,
I think for me a lot of it

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.489
came out immediately the first
song that they would sing

00:22:13.489 --> 00:22:14.530
is "Welcome to the Rock."

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.070
And Ian would say, so
you can count us in?

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:21.072
And then just seeing how
easy we're with counting in,

00:22:21.072 --> 00:22:23.530
or if they were like, oh me,
or what, you know what I mean?

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.189
Like, it just--
that told me a lot.

00:22:26.189 --> 00:22:27.980
I don't know about you
guys, but because we

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.320
were kind of like in
the dark a little bit,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.150
being like we don't
really know what we need,

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.441
we kind of know how many we
need, we kind of know ages,

00:22:33.441 --> 00:22:35.730
but that can switch.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.630
So there was nothing
really solid,

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.110
except for a sense of
being willing to play

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:50.900
and a sense of sort of a
selflessness, like an openness.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.400
I mean--

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.630
IAN EISENDRATH: We knew we
were forming an ensemble.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.690
It's important to find a
group of really strong actors

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.610
that we knew would be willing
to play well together.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.026
KELLY DEVINE: And
then the essence

00:23:00.026 --> 00:23:02.140
of some of the characters,
of the real life people

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.587
that would find the
story too, I think--

00:23:04.587 --> 00:23:06.670
not that they had to be a
doppelganger or anything

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.790
like that, but just the
essence of who that person is

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.615
and be able to sort of
embrace that and embody it.

00:23:12.615 --> 00:23:14.740
DAVID HEIN: And that's and
that's tricky sometimes,

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.570
because all of the
characters on stage

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.460
are amalgamations
and composites.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.710
To tell that many stories
in such a short a time,

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.287
we've had to sort of
compress these stories,

00:23:23.287 --> 00:23:24.370
compress these characters.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.369
So often, we're
seeing these friends

00:23:26.369 --> 00:23:27.910
that we made out a
new film and we're

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.720
trying to represent three
of them through one person.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.950
And while we're not
doing a documentary,

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.186
we're still trying
to find who's going

00:23:36.186 --> 00:23:37.310
to represent them properly.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.018
ALAN SEALES: The most
compelling stories.

00:23:39.018 --> 00:23:41.660
Yeah, there's one that
really stands out for me.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.470
Jenn plays this character,
Captain Beverley Bass, right,

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.350
who is the first female
pilot to ever make captain

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.020
at American Airlines,
just happened

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.290
to be piloting one of these 38
planes that landed in Gander.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.900
And one of my favorite
songs in the show

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.940
is actually her song
singing about this.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.590
So Jenn, would you
mind spontaneously--

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.467
we didn't rehearse this at all--

00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:03.300
singing this for us?

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.249
JENN COLELLA: Oh, exactly.

00:24:05.249 --> 00:24:05.790
Very welcome.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.782
ALAN SEALES: Thank you.

00:24:06.782 --> 00:24:07.782
JENN COLELLA: Thank you.

[MUSIC - COME FROM AWAY ORIGINAL

00:24:17.244 --> 00:25:03.232
BROADWAY CAST, "ME AND THE SKY"]

00:29:04.874 --> 00:29:06.290
ALAN SEALES: So
I've been on stage

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.839
with Broadway performances now.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:08.630
That's pretty cool.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.850
Yay, me.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.730
The characters that you
guys found and discovered,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.020
I mean, Beverly,
Captain Beverly, right,

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.911
Captain Bass, just one
of many amazing things.

00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:24.410
There was also-- I
mean, she's from,

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.030
I guess her home
base is from Texas,

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.940
and then there's also
the Texan woman who

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.754
fell in love with
the British man

00:29:30.754 --> 00:29:32.670
because they happened
to be on the same plane.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.870
And then there was another
person who actually had--

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.680
played by Q, who has a
son that was a volunteer

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.930
firefighter, or actually a--

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:41.660
IRENE SANKOFF: Firefighter.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.970
ALAN SEALES: --straight
actual firefighter that--

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.720
can we give that--

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.520
I guess lost his life in 9/11.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.710
So like you were spending
the whole show wondering

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.100
what happened to your son.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.200
All these characters
that you found,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.840
is there anybody that
you have left out

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.097
that you wish you could
have told their story?

00:30:00.097 --> 00:30:01.430
IRENE SANKOFF: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:03.888
You know, as much as possible
we amalgamated as many things

00:30:03.888 --> 00:30:04.400
as we could.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.930
I mean David always talks about
how the pharmacist for instance

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.100
at the Shoppers
Drug Mart was just

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.700
all night trying to
figure out how to refill

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.850
people's prescriptions.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.433
And we had a whole
scene at one point,

00:30:15.433 --> 00:30:18.560
but now it's just down to
one line in the town scene

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.984
where they say Martin O'Brien,
or no, it's not Martin--

00:30:20.984 --> 00:30:22.400
DAVID HEIN: Dr.
O'Brien is filling

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.440
pharmacies' prescriptions
from around the world.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.690
We tried to keep every single
story we could in there.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.170
There was a story about
the air traffic controllers

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.540
who had nothing to do, so
they just made chili nonstop.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.120
And that used to be
more fleshed out,

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.536
and now it's just one of our
characters coming out saying,

00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:38.990
Bonnie, I made some chili.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.076
But what's amazing is when
the people actually come--

00:30:42.076 --> 00:30:43.700
we've had air traffic
controllers come,

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.450
and they're like,
you've gotten the chili!

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.670
IRENE SANKOFF: Yes, we did.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:47.910
DAVID HEIN: And
so we tried to get

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.910
every single story we
possibly could in there, even

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.035
if it's just a little line.

00:30:51.035 --> 00:30:55.460
ALAN SEALES: The one
character that I guess the--

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.790
talking about her human
children and her real children

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:02.790
at the beginning, obviously like
against security orders, right?

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.915
Like she was technically
not allowed to by the FAA,

00:31:04.915 --> 00:31:07.123
went into the cargo hold
and found all these animals,

00:31:07.123 --> 00:31:10.010
got the cats and dogs and
even bonobo chimps that

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.020
were stuck in the cargo
hold and weren't allowed

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.730
to come off the plane, because
people when they got off

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.100
were only allowed to take
their carry ons, that was it.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.520
IRENE SANKOFF: Yep.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.353
ALAN SEALES: So their
cargo, including pets,

00:31:18.353 --> 00:31:20.500
were stuck on the planes.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.050
And other than-- is there
anything along those lines that

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:27.154
just didn't make it in,
or that you wish you

00:31:27.154 --> 00:31:28.320
could have fleshed out more?

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.700
Like, why cut it down to 100
minutes in the first place?

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.380
DAVID HEIN: Well, so it
was originally longer.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.790
The first draft that we wrote
was about five hours long

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.290
and they still hadn't
gotten off the plane.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.980
So we had a lot to do.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.480
But--

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.040
ALAN SEALES: After
all the movies.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.300
"Titanic" five times.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:44.800
Right.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.190
Right.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.260
I think-- and
there were stories.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.330
Like, there's this wonderful
story about a local

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:56.240
who was sitting down
by the water and one

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.920
of the-- not a local,
a come from away--

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.170
who was sitting down there.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.294
And one of the locals came
up and said, are you OK?

00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:03.360
And they said, I could
use a cup of coffee.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.700
I just really miss my dog.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.622
And the local went
away and came back

00:32:07.622 --> 00:32:09.830
with a cup of coffee and
their dog and was like here,

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.280
if you need some dog time.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.500
And just amazing stories, and we
just couldn't fit them all in.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.257
Part of the reason we kept
it compact so much we,

00:32:18.257 --> 00:32:20.840
originally had an intermission
and then one of our producers--

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.110
we've got this amazing producing
team, Junkyard Dog productions.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:27.680
And they actually
said to us that there

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.710
was no chance during it for
anyone from the town, anyone

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.151
from away to like step out of
the moment and have a drink

00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:36.650
and go to the bathroom and say,
how do you think it's going?

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:36.980
I don't know.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.438
How do you think
it's going, right?

00:32:38.438 --> 00:32:40.580
So we wanted to really
take the audience

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.789
into that experience with us.

00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:44.204
And it's something that you
start at the beginning and you

00:32:44.204 --> 00:32:44.840
don't--

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.180
it doesn't let up until
the until the end.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.701
And so we just had to fit
every story we could in there.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.950
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I commented
on that with the friend

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.514
that I went with
to see the show.

00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:55.430
Because as soon as the
lights go down, usually

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.320
with your traditional show,
you've got the overture

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.701
and then the curtain stays
down and you're like getting

00:32:59.701 --> 00:33:00.200
settled.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.908
Everyone is pulling
out their cell phones

00:33:01.908 --> 00:33:04.580
and switching them to
Airplane mode and everything--

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.710
no pun Intended .

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.270
But in this show, like lights go
down and it's like three beats,

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.860
and then boom,
everyone's on stage

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.170
and they kick off
"Welcome to the Rock."

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.220
And I'm just like,
OK, here I go.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.750
And you're right,
it was just nonstop.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.150
Even the dialogue is
kept up the same pace

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.130
that the songs keep
up, and it's very

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.870
touching to-- so kudos to them.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.400
No question there, just making
a very, very great statement.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.760
So throwing it into the cast a
little bit, of the characters

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.710
that you portray,
have any of you

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.460
met your actual
people that you do?

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.620
You all have?

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.122
Who's?

00:33:41.122 --> 00:33:43.580
JENN COLELLA: Captain Beverley
Bass and I are good friends.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.160
She's seen the show
just over 60 times.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.040
She's been to all
of those cities.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.490
She brought 90 female
pilots to our opening

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.510
in Toronto, 50 female
pilots in Seattle.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.280
And she and Tom,
her husband, have

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.834
been very present throughout
the whole experience,

00:34:00.834 --> 00:34:02.375
so it's been cool
to get to know her.

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:02.630
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.590
Well anybody else?

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.600
Did you guys keep in touch?

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.546
SHARON WHEATLEY:
Nick and Diane, who

00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:11.670
Lee McDougall and I
portray, is the British oil

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.370
executive in the Texas--

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.710
they call her a housewife,
but she's elevated.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.896
She was actually a buyer.

00:34:18.896 --> 00:34:20.699
She had like a real career.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:22.139
But they are the ones who met.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.136
And Nick and Diane actually
really did marry in real life.

00:34:25.136 --> 00:34:26.219
And they've seen the show.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:28.040
They're in competition
with Beverly.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.080
They're behind,
they'll tell you.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.520
But Beverly also gets free
airfare, so there's that.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.928
They've come.

00:34:37.928 --> 00:34:38.969
They've come quite a bit.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:39.989
They are very lovely.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:44.690
We caught them the other
day out signing autographs.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.580
It's a full experience for them.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.620
For all the characters,
it's really wonderful.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.722
I was like, hey,
get out of here!

00:34:52.722 --> 00:34:53.805
ALAN SEALES: This is mine.

00:34:53.805 --> 00:34:56.304
ASTRID VAN WIEREN: My character
is a composite of two women,

00:34:56.304 --> 00:34:58.110
and representing a lot
of women in Gander.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.760
My main character
is Beulah Davis,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.970
who is a combination of
Beulah Cooper and Diane Davis.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.090
And I got to meet them when we
went to Gander, to do our two

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:10.080
concerts there at the world's
largest walk in refrigerator.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.930
And we had a
reception beforehand,

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.240
before they even saw
the show we met them.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.300
And Beulah and I were wearing
almost the exact same outfit

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.360
That was a nice
confirmation that we were--

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.060
and Diane was actually wearing
exactly the same red that

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.520
was in both of our
outfits, so the three of us

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.230
had a good giggle about that.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.990
And they're incredible
women and Facebook friends,

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.884
and they've been now to New
York and they were there

00:35:34.884 --> 00:35:35.550
for our opening.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.640
We got to bring all our
people, or our doppelgangers,

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.030
or partners on the
stage with us and, they

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.740
got to experience
that bow and all that

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.730
love that we get every night
after the show coming at us.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.290
W got to share that with them,
so that was pretty incredible.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.130
ALAN SEALES: Interesting.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.213
CAESAR SAMAYOA: Jenn and
I both the play a couple.

00:35:53.213 --> 00:35:55.590
We're a couple that are both
named Kevin in the show.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.660
And Right after
the La Jolla run,

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.040
I'm sitting and
checking my email

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.290
and I see one of the emails pop
up that says, my name's Kevin,

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.911
and I hear you're
playing me in a musical.

00:36:04.911 --> 00:36:07.050
And we've become
amazing friends.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.240
We've all met.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.430
This is something.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:13.030
CHAD KIMBALL: My Kevin was
more involved in the process.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:19.890
They did breakup, but he was
there for the La Jolla opening.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.796
I don't think Kevin J was,
but-- well, he wasn't.

00:36:23.796 --> 00:36:25.420
But they came to
Seattle, both of them.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:25.930
SPEAKER 3: It's just the facts.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.960
CHAD KIMBALL: Yeah,
just the facts, buys.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.860
I'm giving you a timeline here.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:36.270
And But Kevin T, my Kevin--

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.890
I have nothing against you--

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:46.170
I wrote a book called
Channel of Your Peace.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.510
And so he was just
here, actually.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.650
He just left the other day.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.860
We had dinner, and he's hoping
to get his book out there,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.600
called Channel of Your Peace

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.850
ALAN SEALES: Channel of Peace.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.430
CHAD KIMBALL: Channel of Peace?

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.356
Obviously I've read it.

00:37:00.356 --> 00:37:03.543
Jeez, I'm just going
to not say anything.

00:37:03.543 --> 00:37:05.792
CAESAR SAMAYOA: My Kevin's
book will be out soon, too.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.410
And Robin, his new
assistant, his book

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.762
will be out after theirs.

00:37:13.762 --> 00:37:15.470
ALAN SEALES: Can we
pause for one second?

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.920
If anybody has
audience questions,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.887
we only have one mic
this time unfortunately,

00:37:18.887 --> 00:37:19.970
because of all these mics.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.895
So everyone line up over here
while we continue our stories.

00:37:22.895 --> 00:37:23.550
All right.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.580
Rodney, are you going
to say something?

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.300
Oh, you good?

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:30.250
JOEL HATCH: I met Claude
Elliott, the mayor of Gander,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.450
in Seattle.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.630
And I was a little nervous
the first time I met him.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:40.340
And I said, I don't think I'm a
very precise duplicate of you.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.300
He said, well, you
don't have hair.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.890
But he said, just so
you tell the story

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.010
right, that's all I care.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:47.750
And he was great.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.970
He was just wonderful,
and he's been

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.420
a big supporter of the show.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.170
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.560
Q, I'm curious about
your connection,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.040
because for someone who actually
lost somebody during all this,

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.760
is it hard for her
or do you know,

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:06.710
it is more of in memoriam
of what she went through,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.800
or does she prefer to see
it or not see it, or do you

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.300
know at all?

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.674
Q SMITH: Well, our writers
have actually more experience.

00:38:12.674 --> 00:38:15.410
They've actually been to her
home and met her entire family.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.760
I've met her twice, and
we all met her, actually.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.980
And she loved the show.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.800
She loved the show.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.370
And on opening night, she gave
me a replicate of Kevin's badge

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.980
with his face on
it, and a relic.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.990
And it was so special.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.740
And she and we, you know, we're
both pretty spiritual people.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:38.690
We have a strong faith and
we know that there's always

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.160
a sunnier side to things.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.970
Unfortunately, she went
through this tragic situation.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:47.750
She found so Much hope
and peace in the show.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:49.760
And she's thankful.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.210
She's thankful for it.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.020
ALAN SEALES: OK.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.520
Question?

00:38:53.491 --> 00:38:55.366
AUDIENCE: My name's
Ashley, and I've actually

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:56.060
already seen the show.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.663
Loved it, can't stop
talking about it.

00:38:57.663 --> 00:38:59.550
I already have tickets
to see it again.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.020
I think you're all fabulous.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.690
So I was sitting here trying to
think of what I would ask you,

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.940
and I keep going back to exactly
how much toilet paper did

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.992
they bring to the Lion's Club?

00:39:09.992 --> 00:39:11.450
IRENE SANKOFF: I
think the quote we

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.901
got was enough to last a
year for Gander Academy.

00:39:14.901 --> 00:39:16.400
It was actually, I
want to say-- no,

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.690
where did they drop
it off in real life?

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.160
Because I know we
switch things around,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.060
because it's not a documentary,
it's a piece of theater.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.230
So we tried to
amalgamate, think about--

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.090
DAVID HEIN: This
is the Lion's Club.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:23.970
IRENE SANKOFF: This
is the Lion's club.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:24.830
Yes.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.320
KELLY DEVINE: So Janice, you
should explain that line,

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.550
just so you get a
little background.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.550
KENDRA KASSEBAUM: Right.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.150
So I play a reporter whose it's
the first day on the job when

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.540
all of this is happening.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.170
And so her job was to kind of
get the information out there,

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.650
what people need and everything.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:41.270
And she just put out there that
I we just need a little toilet

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.685
paper over at the Lions
Club, if you got any extra.

00:39:43.685 --> 00:39:46.610
And so she's back on the air
saying for the love of God,

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:49.520
stop bringing toilet
paper to the Lions Club.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.160
So that's where that comes from.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.072
DAVID HEIN: And it
really happened.

00:39:55.072 --> 00:39:55.988
Yes.

00:39:55.988 --> 00:39:58.760
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm
Joanna, and I'm Canadian,

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.985
so I'm so excited to see
a story about Canada,

00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:04.130
but also curious about
how you opened in Toronto

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.038
and how you got your
start in Toronto

00:40:06.038 --> 00:40:08.659
and then came to New York,
because that feels almost

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:10.950
like the opposite of shows
usually opening broadly here

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.490
and then going on the road.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.365
IRENE SANKOFF: It is.

00:40:13.365 --> 00:40:14.690
It is, actually, yeah.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.700
DAVID HEIN: So we started
at Sheridan College,

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.440
with something called the
Canadian Music Theater Project.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.260
So all of these
experienced actors

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.840
are having to play characters
that were originally

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.220
based on students.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.970
We worked with students there,
and also at Goodspeed Musicals.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:33.614
And students have
a lot of energy,

00:40:33.614 --> 00:40:35.030
and they jump from
thing to thing,

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.160
and they're happy
to move chairs.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.240
And so these guys have to
put up with a show that

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.370
was based on that.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:42.590
I think what we've
learned along the way

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:49.170
is that as Canadians
ourselves, it's definitely

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:52.010
this wonderful Canadian story
that we feel a lot of pride in.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.770
There was 200 planes
diverted across the country,

00:40:54.770 --> 00:41:00.725
not only to Gander but also
out on the west coast and all

00:41:00.725 --> 00:41:01.350
over the place.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.700
But it's also, as
New Yorkers, it's

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.590
people who are here
in New York, there's

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.650
this sense that it's an
American story, as well.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:14.280
It's an additional memory
to what happened on 9/11.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.050
And everyone we've talked
to, Hannah's family,

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.480
but also when we're
in Washington, D.C.,

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.914
we spoke to a lot
of the survivors

00:41:21.914 --> 00:41:23.330
and the survivors'
families there.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:26.120
We've talked to--
our first preview was

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.060
for the FDNY Foundation here.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.100
And what they told us was
that what happened in Gander

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.160
was a tribute to the people
that they lost, that it was not

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.130
a replacement memory, but an
additional memory and a glimmer

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.460
of hope on such a tragic day.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.260
So I think it's
important for them.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.090
And beyond that,
what we've realized

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.940
is that it's really an
international story.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.210
It was something that happened
to the world at the same time,

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.390
and that we all had reactions
to it, wherever you were from.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:57.487
And that sort of coalesced
for us in the story of Gander,

00:41:57.487 --> 00:41:59.570
because so many people
were from around the world.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.000
So it expanded beyond there.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.050
We've also had an
amazing team who's

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.330
supported the show, this
little Canadian show

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.262
and has brought it to the world.

00:42:10.262 --> 00:42:11.720
And we've been
really blessed to be

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.860
able to share this with as
many people as possible.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.696
We have a team that
I think originally

00:42:16.696 --> 00:42:18.320
wasn't sure whether
this was a Broadway

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.840
show but knew that it was
an important story to tell

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.610
and has supported it
all along the way.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.110
IAN EISENDRATH: And
one of the gifts

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:26.660
that I think our producers
gave us, often shows

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.170
are go as quickly as
possible to get to New York.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.950
They gave us the gift of time
and multiple productions,

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.960
and we didn't just
rush to New York.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.600
The goal was not just
to have a Broadway show,

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.660
but to really explore
the story and tell it

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.570
in the most truthful,
honoring, and effective way.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.450
And I think playing
Canada, playing La Jolla,

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.780
playing Seattle, playing
D.C., which was directly

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.450
impacted by 9/11, all
these different cities

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:57.830
and listening to those
audiences helped all of us

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.410
hone everything, from the
writing to the staging

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.510
to the music to the production.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.910
RODNEY HICKS: And it
gave us a real journey,

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:10.360
a familial journey of coming
together amongst ourselves

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.700
and this bond that we have.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.390
ALAN SEALES: So
other than the rent,

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.806
did anything change
about the show

00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:21.429
going from Toronto to New York?

00:43:21.429 --> 00:43:22.220
IRENE SANKOFF: Yes.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:22.820
KELLY DEVINE: Yeah.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:23.380
Yeah, a lot.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.860
IRENE SANKOFF: We
added a new song.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.230
ALAN SEALES: Did you?

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.510
IRENE SANKOFF: Yes.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:26.593
ALAN SEALES: What was new?

00:43:26.593 --> 00:43:27.910
IRENE SANKOFF: Hannah's song.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:28.340
ALAN SEALES: Oh, nice.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:28.610
Yeah.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:29.000
That song is new.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.960
IRENE SANKOFF: Expanded.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.209
DAVID HEIN: We continued to
tweak and tighten and cut.

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:34.460
You know, it's funny.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.790
Working with the same
team over so many cities

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.820
within the theater,
it felt very safe.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.410
We were all just
doing what we do.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.200
We were just making the show
as good as we possibly could.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.450
It was only when you go out
the door that you're like,

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:48.491
oh my god, it's Broadway.

00:43:48.491 --> 00:43:49.465
What's--

00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:51.590
IAN EISENDRATH: Well, I
feel like one of the things

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.617
that changed with the
show is that you guys kept

00:43:53.617 --> 00:43:55.700
interviewing people, and
they kept meeting people.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.930
That's why we got a new song.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.750
And it's such a credit
to them as writers.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.784
They could have made
up phenomenal stories.

00:44:01.784 --> 00:44:03.700
They were so committed
to capturing the truth.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.400
And once they spent a good
amount of time with Hannah,

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.195
suddenly a song flowed out
of them and we have that.

00:44:10.195 --> 00:44:12.110
So it's been an
interesting process.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:13.485
KELLY DEVINE: I
have to add, too,

00:44:13.485 --> 00:44:16.070
that our director, Chris
Ashley pushed all of us

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.279
at every moment relentlessly.

00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:18.445
IRENE SANKOFF: Relentlessly.

00:44:18.445 --> 00:44:19.700
KELLY DEVINE: Never stopped.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.149
To the very last second
before we opened.

00:44:22.149 --> 00:44:24.732
DAVID HEIN: I think last night
I actually got a note via text.

00:44:24.732 --> 00:44:26.523
IRENE SANKOFF: I blocked
his email address.

00:44:30.582 --> 00:44:32.540
KELLY DEVINE: He really
had such a good insight

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.164
to what you guys
wanted, and he sort of

00:44:34.164 --> 00:44:35.280
set us on the right path.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.240
And then he just wouldn't
accept anything that

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.860
was just slightly undercooked.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.550
Sometimes when you're
really on a tight schedule

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.710
and you got to open
something, it's easy to go,

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:47.180
you know what, that's fine.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.040
Let's keep going, it's working.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.870
But that wasn't ever acceptable.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.910
We always had to
go deeper, which

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:58.190
I think is why we are
up here, because I think

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.470
we've done something
that we're proud of,

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:03.784
that we took a long,
long time to cultivate.

00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:05.450
ALAN SEALES: All
right, to wrap up here,

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:07.492
after people see
the show, what's

00:45:07.492 --> 00:45:09.950
the one thing that you hope
people take away with them when

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.400
they leave?

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.720
DAVID HEIN: There's
a Mr. Rogers quote

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.460
that we like to
talk about, which

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.780
is that when his mom said when
he saw something scary on TV,

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.870
his mother used to tell him,
if you see something scary,

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:25.700
always look for the helpers.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.070
There's always
goodness in the world.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.830
There's always-- and
that doesn't often

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:31.770
doesn't get the focus.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.070
And it feels
particularly right now

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:39.970
when we're often feeling
divided against each other,

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.650
it's important to look for
stories that bring us together,

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.332
to focus on the people
who are helping.

00:45:45.332 --> 00:45:47.540
There's always more helpers
than there are people who

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.760
are perpetrating these acts.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:56.390
And it feels important to stick
it in your search bar every day

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.780
and find those things that
remind us that there's

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.120
goodness in the world.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.615
That's what I keep
coming back to.

00:46:03.615 --> 00:46:04.770
ALAN SEALES: Nice.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.860
IRENE SANKOFF: Yeah, I
think about at the end

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.870
of the year, last
year, 2016, there

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.020
was that video that was put
together because everyone

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.580
was like, see you later, 2016.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.780
But there was like oh, but--

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.821
like you go through this
thing where it was like,

00:46:16.821 --> 00:46:21.150
PS, but this happened in 2016,
and we accomplished this.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.127
And it just sort of--

00:46:22.127 --> 00:46:24.710
I mean, it sounds really trite
to say look on the bright side,

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:25.340
but it's not.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.720
It's more where you choose to
put your energy and your focus,

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.370
and I think that
does affect what

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:32.540
you put out into the world.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.260
I do.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.400
And so it's much the same thing.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.890
DAVID HEIN: Yeah, it's been
good for us to tell the story

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.265
and be able to
live in the story.

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:45.410
I think it's been good for
all of us to be celebrating

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.617
these people out of
Newfoundland, to be celebrating

00:46:47.617 --> 00:46:49.700
the goodness that they
created and the friendships

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.450
that they created.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.210
It feels like every
day we're living

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.730
in the shadow of
something terrible,

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:01.077
and it feels important to
find the pockets of good.

00:47:01.077 --> 00:47:02.160
IAN EISENDRATH: Well said.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:03.950
PETRINA BROMLEY: I
just want to add,

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.960
I'm actually from
Newfoundland myself.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.340
And as a member of the cast
on a very personal level

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.665
to be involved with this show,
people come to me all the time

00:47:11.665 --> 00:47:14.040
after the show who have come
from Newfoundland to see it.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.410
And the kind of
pride that happens

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.990
and the smiles and the
pleasure on people's faces

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:22.470
just gives me an extra
added bonus of joy

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:26.040
in this show, because
we don't toot our horns

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.210
enough in Canada, and
especially in Newfoundland.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.970
So for me, I get
that extra joy on top

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:34.385
of what they're talking about.

00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:35.760
ALAN SEALES: Well,
the soundtrack

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.756
came out yesterday, yeah?

00:47:37.756 --> 00:47:38.880
DAVID HEIN: Today, I think.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.750
Today is our day.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.350
ALAN SEALES: Physically today.

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:41.805
I think it was a digital
download yesterday.

00:47:41.805 --> 00:47:43.013
DAVID HEIN: Cast album, yeah.

00:47:43.013 --> 00:47:46.362
ALAN SEALES: I was looking
for it on Google Play Music.

00:47:46.362 --> 00:47:47.402
All right.

00:47:47.402 --> 00:47:48.110
DAVID HEIN: Dude.

00:47:50.817 --> 00:47:52.400
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
Gerald Schoenfeld--

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.775
Schoenfeld, did
I say that right?

00:47:53.775 --> 00:47:56.430
The Gerald Schoenfeld
Theater, 236 West 45th.
