00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.070
Let's do a few examples
multiplying fractions.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.045
So let's multiply
negative 7 times 3/49.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.400
So you might say, I don't
see a fraction here.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.840
This looks like an integer.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.850
But you just to remind yourself
that the negative 7 can

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.610
be rewritten as
negative 7/1 times 3/49.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.710
Now we can multiply
the numerators.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.950
So the numerator is going
to be negative 7 times 3.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.700
And the denominator is
going to be 1 times 49.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.590
1 times 49.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.650
And this is going to be
equal to-- 7 times 3 is 21.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.975
And one of their
signs is negative,

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.350
so a negative times a positive
is going to be a negative.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.030
So this is going
to be negative 21.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.090
You could view this as
negative 7 plus negative 7

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.460
plus negative 7.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.470
And that's going to be over 49.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.320
And this is the correct
value, but we can simplify it

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.150
more because 21 and 49
both share 7 as a factor.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.793
That's their greatest
common factor.

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.209
So let's divide
both the numerator

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.400
and the denominator by 7.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.810
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 7.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.470
And so this gets us
negative 3 in the numerator.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.120
And in the
denominator, we have 7.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.960
So we could view it
as negative 3 over 7.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.070
Or, you could even do
it as negative 3/7.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.720
Let's do another one.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.040
Let's take 5/9 times-- I'll
switch colors more in this one.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.280
That one's a little monotonous
going all red there.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.790
5/9 times 3/15.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.220
So this is going
to be equal to-- we

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.970
multiply the numerators.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.340
So it's going to be 5 times 3.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.170
5 times 3 in the numerator.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.123
And the denominator is
going to be 9 times 15.

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:58.530
9 times 15.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.700
We could multiply them out,
but just leaving it like this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.760
you see that there is
already common factors

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.500
in the numerator
and the denominator.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.220
Both the numerator
and the denominator,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.440
they're both divisible
by 5 and they're

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.700
both divisible by 3,
which essentially tells us

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.600
that they're divisible by 15.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.920
So we can divide the numerator
and denominator by 15.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.270
So divide the
numerator by 15, which

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.020
is just like dividing by
5 and then dividing by 3.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.090
So we'll just divide by 15.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.510
Divide by 15.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.910
And this is going to be equal
to-- well, 5 times 3 is 15.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.480
Divided by 15 you get
1 in the numerator.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.700
And in the denominator,
9 times 15 divided by 15.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.160
Well, that's just going to be 9.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.090
So it's equal to 1/9.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.150
Let's do another one.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.860
What would negative 5/9
times negative 3/15 be?

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.360
Well, we've already
figured out what

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.309
positive 5/9 times
positive 3/15 would be.

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.100
So now we just have to
care about the sign.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.090
If we were just multiplying the
two positives, it would be 1/9.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.110
But now we have to
think about the fact

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.409
that we're multiplying by a
negative times a negative.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.825
Now, we remember
when you multiply

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:14.120
a negative times a
negative, it's a positive.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.690
The only way that
you get a negative

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690
is if one of those two
numbers that you're

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.290
taking the product of
is negative, not two.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.090
If both are positive,
it's positive.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.912
If both are negative,
it's positive.

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:25.995
Let's do one more example.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.620
Let's take 5-- I'm using
the number 5 a lot.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.100
So let's do 3/2, just
to show that this

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.450
would work with
improper fractions.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.270
3/2 times negative 7/10.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.940
I'm arbitrarily picking colors.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.910
And so our numerator is going
to be 3 times negative 7.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.500
3 times negative 7.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.790
And our denominator is
going to be 2 times 10.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.890
2 times 10.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.150
So this is going to
be the numerator.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.480
Positive times a
negative is a negative.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.010
3 times negative
7 is negative 21.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.660
Negative 21.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.550
And the denominator, 2 times 10.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.120
Well, that is just 20.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.710
So this is negative 21/20.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.110
And you really can't
simplify this any further.
