00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.070
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well honestly Andy, I'm not sure. You said it had to do with how fast the waves

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.162
are shaking. But the only difference I see here, is how spread out the waves

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:08.305
are.

00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:12.590
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's a really great point Lauren. This is what's hard about drawing waves.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.392
Waves are moving all the time. And when we draw them we have to draw them

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:21.225
still. But your putting out when you say the wave is stretched out, maybe from

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:27.056
here to here. This is called the wavelength of the wave. But for now, I think

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:31.730
Susan actually brought her slinky with her today, so maybe we can go to Susan.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.638
Susan, are you there with your slinky by any chance?

00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:38.005
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Way ahead of you Andy. Once you started talking about waves, I got a contestant

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.286
here to help out.

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:41.717
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's great Susan.

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:45.056
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And Susan, do you think you could actually shake your hand up and down really

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:48.522
slowly and make a nice low frequency wave for us?

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:52.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure thing, Andy. Here is a large stretched out wave.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.101
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is. Now what happens if you shake your hand a little faster?

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:01.298
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here, it gets much more compact.

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:05.842
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, high frequency waves are squished together, and low frequency waves are

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:07.688
spread apart?

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:13.160
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right, exactly. So, high frequency waves have a short wavelength.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.148
Whereas, low frequency has a long wavelength. thanks a lot Susan. It looks like

00:01:18.148 --> 00:01:19.865
we're actually getting ready for the next event.

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:22.907
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yep, we'll be ready soon.
