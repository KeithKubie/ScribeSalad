00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.350
- [Narrator] What we have depicted here is

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.620
a signal transduction pathway

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.720
that gets started with the cholera toxin.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.330
And we've talked about
signal transduction pathways

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.390
in other videos, but it's really this idea

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.240
that you would have molecules
outside of the cell that would

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.260
interact with receptors
on the surface of the cell

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.120
that would then create a
whole chain reaction of events

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.520
that would cause that
cell to do something.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.270
And so what's happening here is,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.500
if you were in the unfortunate situation,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.130
and this is not something
that you would wish on anyone,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.350
if they were to have the
cholera bacteria in their gut,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.110
so let's say that this
is the cholera bacteria,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.060
that cholera bacteria in your
intestines will release the,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.150
what we can call the cholera toxin.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.680
And here it's depicted
in very abstract fashion

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.240
by a circle on top of a triangle.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.010
That's not what it actually looks like.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.530
It's a protein complex with
various protein subunits.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.110
It's just drawn this way

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.580
so that we can think
about this triangle part

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.090
interacting with this receptor
on the epithelial cell.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.440
And so what happens is this cholera toxin,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.120
it will interact with
this ganglioside receptor.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.670
You don't have to know the details here,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240
really just the idea of what's going on.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.560
And then once it does that,
when you see these arrows

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.260
on these transduction
pathways, you could view it as

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.290
that is going to activate the next step,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.900
or sometimes you might say
might promote the next step

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.730
or make it more likely to happen.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.660
But what then happens is, is
once this thing has interacted,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.920
the A part of the subunit goes in,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.230
interacts with a G-protein.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.780
You don't have to know
all the details here,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.810
but G-proteins are
something that you'll see

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.360
in a lot of signal transduction pathways.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.180
There's not just one G-protein.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.800
There's a whole family of
proteins called G-proteins.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.390
And you can view them
as molecular switches.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.140
They can get turned on and off

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.260
based on how they're interacting
with other molecules.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.350
Their conformation, their shape changes,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.050
and so that might activate
or deactivate them.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.150
But you can see, you
can follow these arrows,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.120
and you can see what eventually happens.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.760
And you don't have to
know every detail here.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.500
Eventually, it leads to adenylate
cyclase, then cyclic AMP,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.370
then the protein kinase gets involved.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.500
But the end result from this
pathway is that you have

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.770
these ions being released
from this epithelial cell.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.590
And with that, that causes
the water to leave the cell,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.100
and that's what causes diarrhea.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.270
So the toxin gets your gut cells,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.060
gets your intestinal cells
to start releasing water,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.050
so then you're going to have
very, very, very bad diarrhea.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.960
So that's the big picture,
but now we can think about

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.750
what might happen in certain situations.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.390
So if I were to ask you,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.020
let's say this epithelial
cell somehow had a mutation,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.030
so its ganglioside receptor
does not interact well

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.920
with the B subunit here,
with the cholera toxin.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.310
What would happen then?

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.763
Pause this video, and
try to think about that.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.540
All right, so for whatever reason,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.810
this epithelial cell had
a ganglioside receptor

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.370
that was a little bit different,
and it couldn't interact

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.850
as efficiently with the cholera toxin.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.300
Well, in that situation, this,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.570
this activation would not be happening

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.940
or at least would not be
happening as efficiently.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.120
And so someone with that type
of a ganglioside receptor,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.170
there might be some other
negative side effects,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.330
but they actually would
not get as bad diarrhea

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.610
from the cholera toxin

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.570
because this whole signals
transduction pathway

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.310
would not be happening or would
not be happening as strong.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.760
Now on the other hand, it turns
out that there's molecules

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.200
that can disrupt this
signal transduction pathway.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.710
So what we have right over here,
this is an opioid receptor.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.330
And if it gets activated,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.630
then it will activate another G-protein.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.130
This one is different than the one here,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.620
but it's part of that same family.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.530
And when you see this type of thing,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.370
when you see a line with this
flat head instead of an arrow,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.860
that means it's inhibiting that process.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.970
So for example, this opioid
receptor is receptive

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.250
to a molecule known as enkephalin.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.380
Once again, you don't have to know that.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.310
But what you should know is that, okay,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.370
you have this molecule outside of the cell

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.710
that can interact with
the opioid receptor,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.840
which will then activate a G-protein,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.320
and what's interesting
is that this G-protein

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.960
is actually an inhibitor of
this step right over here.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.990
And so if you have cholera

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.930
and the cholera toxins in your gut,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.710
but you also expose those
epithelial cells to enkephalin,

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.820
well, that might make the
diarrhea a little bit less bad.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.520
Because if this gets disrupted

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.090
or at least if it gets inhibited,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.750
then the rest of this
pathway will not happen,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.130
or it will not happen quite as strong.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.990
So that leaves another question.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.550
If there was some mutation
in the opioid receptor here,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.920
so it wasn't as good at
binding to enkephalin,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.430
what would be the end result?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.390
So if your opioid receptor is somehow

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.710
not as receptive to enkephalin,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.340
well, then enkephalin
will not be as effective

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.530
at being able to stop this
signal transduction pathway

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.120
because the enkephalin
will not be able to bind

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.350
with that opioid receptor.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.330
And so this inhibition will not occur,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.530
and so you would just have the
regular transduction pathway

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.370
from the cholera toxin occurring,
which results in diarrhea.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.330
So I'll leave you there.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.810
The big thing to appreciate is
when you see these pathways,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.450
arrows you can view as activation,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.260
or they're leading to the next step.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.350
And these lines with these flat heads,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.780
this is about inhibition.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.710
And it's pretty typical to see questions,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.970
and, especially if you're a scientist,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.550
you might construct these pathways.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.100
But you'll also get questions on,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.250
hey, if there's a mutation on something

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.227
that is activating part of
the pathway, what will happen?

00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:41.100
And then the pathway won't
happen as much or maybe at all.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.400
And if there's a mutation in something

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.010
that inhibits the pathway,
what would happen?

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.810
Well, if there's a mutation
that makes something

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.820
that would regularly inhibit
a pathway less functional,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.970
then it won't be able to
inhibit the pathway as much,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.123
and so the pathway will be less inhibited.
