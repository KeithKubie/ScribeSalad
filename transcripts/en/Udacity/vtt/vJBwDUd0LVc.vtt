Congratulations.

00:00:01.753 --> 00:00:04.226
You now know how to build
an app that runs beautifuly

00:00:04.226 --> 00:00:06.820
in the foreground, 
and efficiently in the background.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.570
In this lesson, you learned how 
to use services and SyncAdapters,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.220
as well as creating rich notifications, 
all ways to provide a great user experience

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.670
even when your app isn't visible.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.720
Join me now for the final story time,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.780
as I take you into a possible 
future for Android.
