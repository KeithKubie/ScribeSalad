1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,420
Okay.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,210
All right. Youtube. We're live.
We're going old school today.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,270
I'm doing something that I've only done
I think one time before an interview via

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,170
Google hangouts.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,590
We've only done this once before we did
it right when I moved into this house

6
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:21,290
when we were building out the
studio and we didn't have a studio.

7
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,960
My first ever interview
with Jordan Peterson,

8
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,850
which was the first time
that I ever talked to Jordan.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,310
We did via Google hangout sitting in
my living room over there yesterday.

10
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:36,140
I was supposed to have Avi Yemeni who
is in that box right there who I'll

11
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:37,220
introduce to you in a second.

12
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:41,630
I was supposed to have him right here in
studio for a normal show and he was on

13
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:45,620
his way a couple of days ago from
Australia to the United States,

14
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:50,150
which is a freaking long,
and I took a,

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,570
I took a 15 hour flight from a,

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,410
I guess it was from Sydney to uh,

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,470
to Texas a couple of weeks ago after a
five hour flight I think from Perth to

18
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:01,430
Sydney or something like that.

19
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:04,430
I mean it was like 30 something
hours of total travel. Anyway,

20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,510
it's a long ass flight.

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,800
He tried to enter the United
States and he was denied entry.

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,030
Now why did it all this happen? While I'm
going to kick it to Abi Right now, Abi,

23
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,530
first off,
before we do anything else here,

24
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,650
for any of my audience that
does not know who you are,

25
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,390
what's the best way to describe you?

26
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:24,170
Consider yourself a youtuber or you are
provocative tour or your, your sort of,

27
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:28,340
uh, a quasi 20, 19 journalists.
What do you consider yourself?

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,610
I'm actually a journalist,
a freelance journalist.

29
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,960
I work mostly with Dr News.
Um,

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,300
I started on a, I wasn't getting sign
up and uh, the guy bought the uh,

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,250
Eh tag audit Riley's on
Australian Israeli, uh,

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,820
proud of Bo love, the three
western way of life. Um,

33
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,430
I kind of fell into this.
I was,

34
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:57,060
I was a gym owner that ran Krav Maga
gyms if you know what they are. Yeah.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,700
Optimize Riley army service.
And to be honest,

36
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,170
it was a really,

37
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:06,950
when one of the operations
in Gaza kind of kicked off,

38
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:10,760
then I was watching like the mainstream
media report on it and I was getting

39
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:15,260
started frustrated with their reporting
and I'd really popular gyms at the time.

40
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,710
I just started kind of commenting and
writing what I experienced myself and what

41
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,120
I knew to be true from the ground,

42
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,030
from someone who actually
served on the front line then.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,270
And I guess it kind of
started a conversation.

44
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:32,720
I lost a lot of members at the time.
I also gained a few, but, uh, um,

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,750
I guess after that I kind of found a
voice and I continue kind of commenting on

46
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:43,610
all sorts of political issues and
people kind of gave me some constructive

47
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:45,680
criticism. People that are
alive, people that I trust,

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,930
so maybe don't use your business page
for that. So I opened a Facebook page,

49
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:54,070
I just started speaking. And, um,

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,270
now youtube is a new
thing for me to be honest,

51
00:02:56,271 --> 00:03:00,280
because before that I was
100% on until they, uh,

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,240
they kicked me off and,
uh, apparently hate speech,

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,420
which I don't believe I ever engage in,
you know,

54
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,520
but obviously, uh, it's very broad,
those terms. So that's where I am today.

55
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,960
I work mainly put Tommy
Robinson who, uh, is,

56
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,800
he's very well known obviously in the UK.

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,630
Yeah. And I think Tommy, we were trying
to get him in here and uh, you know,

58
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,380
I interviewed him once years ago on Skype
and I don't even think he's allowed to

59
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,570
come to the United States either.
So you're,

60
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:32,710
you're in company with people that can
or can't get into the good old United

61
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,390
States. Okay. So, uh,

62
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:38,740
I want you to tell exactly what happened
with Jim Jefferies and comedy central.

63
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:43,510
I should preface this by saying that
until, uh, the clip that I saw of you,

64
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:46,660
which now has millions and millions,
I think over 3 million views on youtube.

65
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,050
I have never seen Jim Jeffrey show.
I don't really know who he is.

66
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:53,830
I know he's a comedian, but I don't
really know who he is, so I have no, um,

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,660
you know,
dog in this fight one way or another.

68
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,330
It's not like I'm a fan of
his or a hater of his. Um,

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
I don't really watch comedy central.

70
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,130
I don't think anyone really watches comedy
central anymore. I think pretty much,

71
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,320
pretty much. I, I think, I know the last
time I watch comedy central, um, was when,

72
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,050
uh, when Jon Stewart was
still hosting the daily show.

73
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,870
He had ion Hirsi Ali on and he
threw her under the bus in Wa.

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,760
I don't know if you've seen it.

75
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:19,450
It was one of the most disgusting
interviews I've ever seen. It's really,

76
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:23,650
really awful. Um, and I pretty much
just tuned out a comedy central than,

77
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:27,070
and you know, uh, I
think since then, well,

78
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,930
I guess maybe it's
Futurama still on there.

79
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,490
I've no idea. I didn't even watch
it to be honest, to be honest.

80
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,330
Jim Jeffries is an Aussie who,
um,

81
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,980
who got famous in America. It
wasn't, he was kind of crappy.

82
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,840
Yeah. He just, he likes to drop the
C bomb a lot, I guess in America.

83
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:50,230
You folks go in and find that
fascinating and funny. Um,

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,910
well one thing I did,

85
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:55,540
like I was a fan of these ones because
he wa he would push the boundaries.

86
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,070
He wasn't, he wasn't
politically correct. Um,

87
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,390
he would make jokes about
kind of anything. Uh, but, uh,

88
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,650
I think over the last few
years, especially when it
comes to the gun debate, uh,

89
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,140
he's found he's,
he's a little place in Hollywood.

90
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,840
And even in some of the clips
that I released after that,

91
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,720
or if you watch the whole clip, you can
see, I challenge him on it. I call him,

92
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,790
I'll tell him he's a,

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,500
he's a sellout and he admits he
admitted the life in Hollywood is nice.

94
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,760
So you can't really like, I don't
blame him for that part of it. Like I,

95
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,680
I can understand it.
Yeah.

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,200
Okay. So, yeah. So before we
get too, too far ahead though,

97
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:33,700
and I have no doubt that at the Viacom
building in New York City and in La Right

98
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,820
now, there are plenty of executives
watching this. So you can talk,

99
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,670
you can talk directly to them and
you can talk directly to Jim. Uh,

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,710
I suspect Jim is not going to retweet
this, although I did tag him in it.

101
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,910
But anyway, I preface it that way just
to say I brought in, you're not blocked.

102
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,800
Yeah, I know. I'm sure
I'll be boxing it up.

103
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,830
But I preface it that way just to
say I have nothing against the guys

104
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:58,100
specifically until I saw what happened.
And now it's like,

105
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:59,120
this is just such,

106
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,890
the reason I wanted to have you on was
that it's such a perfect example of fake

107
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,900
news of media manipulation,

108
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,110
the way that these people often these
media personalities privately do one thing

109
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,520
and publicly do another.
I mean it's just,

110
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,140
and then really to your credit that you
were smart enough to videotape the whole

111
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,520
thing.
So just start at the beginning.

112
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,050
How did you even get on the
Jim Jeffrey show? [inaudible]

113
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,320
traditionally did call me
out into is a December time.

114
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,190
I'm always in Israel at the time,
if I remember correctly. Well,

115
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:33,610
maybe I was in Europe, but it
gave me a call and said, listen,

116
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,140
Jim is the traveling Australia
at the moment. He's uh,

117
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,480
he's organizing,
he's doing a tour in Australia,

118
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:44,190
but he was running a special
for a Netflix or one of them,

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,730
one of these comedy central
specials. Um, and he was wondering,

120
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:52,780
you probably would be willing to
come on to discuss immigration,

121
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:56,730
to discuss the border wall.
And I,

122
00:06:56,731 --> 00:07:01,720
I know who Jim Jeffries is and I know
where he stands or at least publicly where

123
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,880
he stands these days on
issues. And I'm not, I'm like,

124
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,790
I'm somebody that's confident in my
beliefs. I have no problem, you know,

125
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,070
discussing anything with anyone.

126
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,610
But I also know he's on trustworthy and
I've been involved in the media for long

127
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:22,210
enough to know that I need to set out
some conditions and I set out to basic

128
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,080
conditions.
One,

129
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,410
don't put me with neo Nazis or anyone who
believes he had learned he wouldn't do.

130
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,540
And two is just put my answers to
the questions that you asked me.

131
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:36,140
Don't cut it up. And with a technique
that they love doing. And you know, I,

132
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:40,750
I do a lot of street interviews myself
and I would never do that to somebody

133
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,230
because there's no point.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,960
The whole idea is if somebody is
stupid or if somebody answers something

135
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:50,290
ridiculous ridiculously, you
don't need to cut it. Yeah.

136
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,140
You can actually just put
it out there and everybody,

137
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,610
the world is there to judge.

138
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,110
Yeah. But that's kind of the game these
guys have been playing for a long time.

139
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,640
Right.
Like I interned,

140
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:04,380
I interned at the daily show back in
1999 it's a long freaking time ago and I

141
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:07,980
remember, you know, I don't know that
they were doing what he did with you,

142
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:11,520
which is taking an answer to one
question in placing it to another.

143
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,270
But I always remember thinking when
they'd get these local Republicans on and

144
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:18,270
then mock them the whole time, it's like,
what, what were these idiots thinking?

145
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,720
Like, you know, you're
walking into the daily show,

146
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,970
like you know you're going
to be selectively edited
or they're going to put a

147
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,930
pause on you in a weird way
for a laugh or, or just some,

148
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,920
some level of manipulation.
So you went out your way.

149
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,460
Just don't expect it to be
so bad like it to be honest.

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,770
The last one I'd seen of Jim Jefferies,

151
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:42,940
he's what he did to Jordan Peterson
and I thought to myself, you know,

152
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,280
I look at someone like Jordan,
Jordan Peterson,

153
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,810
and I look at him and he's an academic.

154
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:51,811
He's far smarter than me
and if Jim Jefferies could
make him kind of look like a

155
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,374
dumb ass,

156
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,900
then obviously he's out to get me.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,670
So they agree to those terms.
And I went to,

158
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,010
they flew me to Singapore.
I,

159
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,470
I told him that the third issue is that
I'm just not in Australia at the moment,

160
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,670
so I'm happy to do it. If you, if
you agree to those two conditions,

161
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,310
I'm happy to do it. But obviously
it has to be the term that I can,

162
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,700
it worked at that,
that flew me to Singapore.

163
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,110
Pay For my hotel and paid all my expenses.
It was great little trip.

164
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,490
I walk in there and I knew, I also
spoke to my good friend Tommy Robinson,

165
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:31,470
who's had a lot of experience with fake
news and great straightaway. He said,

166
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,900
make sure you've got footage on it.

167
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,410
So I went in there and I
thought I had two phones.

168
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,300
I don't want them to phones.

169
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,580
I went in there because I wanted
to make sure in case one collapse,

170
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,530
which it actually did.
That's why if you look at the footage,

171
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,180
some of it's blurry because the very one
actually recorded the whole thing and I

172
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:52,920
walk in and I was thinking if they stop
me and I started recording from the

173
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,200
moment I walked in because
I said if they stopped me,

174
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,970
I didn't care at that point.

175
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,840
If they kicked me out while I'm
setting up my cameras to film myself,

176
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,340
then that's not video show that they're
not even willing to engage me without

177
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:09,840
trying to screw me. But nobody noticed,
nobody noticed anything and I set it up.

178
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,130
It was like it was couches and
I put these pillows. There was,

179
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,630
it took me a good minute and I went
even went back and reset it. It was,

180
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,950
that was so self absorbed
on their,

181
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,700
on their egos or their importance
or something. Absolutely.

182
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,520
And I just filmed the whole thing.
It was,

183
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,060
it was a couple of months I think
too. I just held onto it. I didn't,

184
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,510
I could've put that Mohammed stuff
out straight away, but I thought,

185
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,120
you know what, I'm going to wait.
I want to see how this plays out.

186
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,710
And I was actually at a Purim event,
so what is it, a couple of weeks ago,

187
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,540
and I didn't even know the,
the segment at Baym released and some,

188
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,710
you know Habad rabbi walks
up to me, he goes, Oh,

189
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,990
I saw your Jim Jefferies thing last night.
They totally,

190
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,120
he screwed you or he, I think his
wording was more like he wrecked you.

191
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,590
Lucky it was as if he even,

192
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,540
he believed the context of the,

193
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,840
of the interview and that all
the cuts were actually true.

194
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,190
I'm sitting there like after a
few, you know, poor him drinks,

195
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,030
I'm just open up my phone and
I'm just watching. And I'm going,

196
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,590
I can't believe this.

197
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,780
He's literally put me in the context
of Christ's Church of the Cross church

198
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:32,430
massacre with some crazy
white supremacists who hate
my guts a hundred percent.

199
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:34,380
He believes that you should be in Israel.

200
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,410
He doesn't think of
Israeli is a good thing.

201
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,020
Just to be very clear, you taped
the interview, what a good two,

202
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:44,480
three months before.

203
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,930
And I'm looking at it and I'm in shock.
I'm saying that cut up.

204
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,860
My aunt is in 20 seconds of the clip.

205
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:59,470
They have the most prominent
neo Nazi in Australia. Um, they,

206
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:02,830
they've, uh, cut up even
not even just my aunties,

207
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,490
even my facial reaction,
my expressions,

208
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:10,250
I took expressions when he would
say something bizarre and I would,

209
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,830
I would like cringe up my face. He,
he's taken that and cut it with,

210
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,693
you know,

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,590
reasonable questions that he's asked
and he's even saying the best part was I

212
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:25,210
got him saying he will, um, he can cut
it up to make himself look perfect. So I,

213
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,800
I honestly, I went home and, and,
and I just myself, I went and I said,

214
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,580
I told her how bad guy there, the
rabbi, I said, wait till tomorrow,

215
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,410
you'll see you'll see the tree.

216
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,470
Then I went back and now what's odd to
me is I expected that once they see that

217
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,240
that will will retract
immediately that you apologize,

218
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,190
they will remove the defamatory content.
No,

219
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,430
they didn't do any of that and they
still haven't done any of that. In fact,

220
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,260
I managed to get banned on Youtube.
It picked him up.

221
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:03,130
I managed to get band within 24
hours from posting that on Facebook.

222
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,710
Facebook denies it has
anything to do with that,

223
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:10,530
but they won't give me any proof on
any other posts. Um, that has, uh,

224
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,510
that, that bridge their terms
and conditions. In fact,

225
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,790
I didn't post anything for a good period
besides for the Jim Jeffrey stuff.

226
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:22,300
So I don't know what it possibly
can be. Um, okay. So for the,

227
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,860
for the people that haven't seen it,

228
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:28,861
so he splices answers that you give to
other questions to make it seem like

229
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:33,760
you're, you're racist basically. I'm
a radical, I'm crazy. And the fact is,

230
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:38,700
if I watched that, if I watched
that, I don't like that guy. Oh,

231
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,000
that guy.

232
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And that was what it was designed to
do was to make me look like a bad job,

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,990
you know? And he tried to, he tried to
make it like he literally says, Gee,

234
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,640
the only thing that could bring Jews
and white supremacists together is there

235
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:01,000
shared height from was
absolutely outrageous.

236
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,670
Disgusting. The fact is, I don't,

237
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:08,040
I've never shown hate from Muslims ever
in my life because I think hating on a

238
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,190
people is wrong. As a Jew, I find
that offensive to hate on us,

239
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,740
to target a people to criticize Islam.

240
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:18,490
I always do it because I think
any idea should be tested,

241
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,090
tried and tested and discuss.
But um,

242
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,150
it wasn't just though that
he manipulated what you said,

243
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:31,030
what you also caught him saying
off camera and this really to me,

244
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,600
this is the beauty of it because I think
even if beforehand you said to them,

245
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,210
guys, don't sandbagged me,
you know, don't edit my stuff.

246
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,360
And they promised to do all
that. Like, I live in Hollywood,

247
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:41,680
I know how this business works.

248
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,740
They're all liars and frauds and
they'll say anything and do any of that.

249
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,400
The real,

250
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,410
the real meat of this is what you caught
him saying because that really shows

251
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:57,740
the one 80 on reality. So could
you lay out some of that is, look,

252
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,900
Jim Jefferies used to say a lot of that
stuff publicly in a lot of his original

253
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,350
shows, um, lightly. Obviously he's, uh,

254
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,210
he's become a very good liberal
lovie dovie. It's all about, uh,

255
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,790
you know,
and the thing is that segment,

256
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,770
that specific segment was about pointing
at people like me and blaming us for

257
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:23,100
radicalizing people like that
crazy Christchurch killer. Um,

258
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,950
he's gone in there, he's drawn
Mohammad, you know, he's um,

259
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,380
he even went as far as making it,

260
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,040
he made a few jokes and said how much
you hate Islamic fallen. Fair enough.

261
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,820
I actually have no
problem with what he said.

262
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,770
And especially in the context of comedy,
I think it's fine.

263
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,180
I just don't think you have the right
then to turn around and point fingers at

264
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:48,410
someone like me. You would never even
say anything close to what he said.

265
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:49,880
Even as a joke.
In fact,

266
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,910
I had to pull him up at one point where
he was joking about dingoes killing

267
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:59,780
little Muslim babies and vomiting,
which is just not even funny.

268
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,610
And now for those who are out there who
were claiming that he only said it to

269
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:08,570
bait me,
well no actually originally he used to,

270
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,770
he used to be like that.

271
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:13,700
He used to say that publicly is changed
because now that's where you know he's

272
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:17,630
following the money. He obviously
doesn't believe anything he preaches.

273
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,760
He's two faced is exactly the
definition of two faced and fake.

274
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,090
But also if he was trying to beat you to
do the baiting off camera and then your

275
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,560
answers aren't coming. I mean
that in and of itself, again,

276
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:33,080
this is not surprising
how these guys operate,

277
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,500
but that would show you a little
bit of the motivations there.

278
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,750
Absolutely it,

279
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:43,070
he came in with certain intentions
and the thing is he couldn't,

280
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,140
he didn't get the outcome he wanted.

281
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,210
So the only way to produce it was
literally to reproduce it, to cut it up.

282
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,500
And anyone can look stupid when you do
that and anyone can look bad and you can

283
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:58,790
literally ruin someone's life.
If I didn't capture that,

284
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,930
my life would be ruined.

285
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,030
There's no way for me to be able to
defend against any of what he's put out

286
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,310
there.

287
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,310
I still find it crazy that till
today they've not only not responded,

288
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,420
they blocked and banned any,
you know a lot of people and you can look,

289
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,880
you know, some people aren't getting
banned, you or may so far not.

290
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,480
But if you look at my Twitter,

291
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,760
there's posts up that I keep
re tweeting of people just bad.

292
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,110
And for what they're saying is literally,

293
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,700
can you at least faced what you've done?
Jim Can,

294
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:37,880
can comedy central make a statement?
Can you do something? But nothing,

295
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:40,850
they just blocking their vaccine
restricted comments on Instagram.

296
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,530
So that's what I think is so interesting
here because it's such a perfect storm

297
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,040
of all of the crap that I'm always
talking about. Hearing what's wrong,

298
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,070
the media and then,

299
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,540
and then how people,
individuals online are able to fight back.

300
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,480
Because right now if you look at comedy
central's a Twitter feed or the Jim

301
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,850
Jeffrey show,
typically if you look at your mentions,

302
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,280
it is no matter what he tweets,
it's real people,

303
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,940
decent human beings saying, are you
going to address this and all that.

304
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:12,620
So before we get to what happened when
you tried to get to the United States to

305
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,370
be in the studio yesterday, um, if,

306
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,300
if comedy central today or Jim
Jefferies personally issued an apology,

307
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:25,290
admitted the whole thing, which app,
which now everyone knows to be true.

308
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,230
So it's not much of a mia
culpa because it's like, yeah,

309
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:30,660
you're just admitting
what blatantly is obvious.

310
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,630
Would you accept that and then
just move on from this situation?

311
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,010
Well,
what we'll everyday that passes,

312
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,790
the bigger the apology is going
to have to be, the more, the more,

313
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,840
the louder it's going to have
to be because it now on their,

314
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,460
all their social media platforms, that
defamatory video has been up, what is it,

315
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,600
two weeks now? Um, they'd
been running it on cable TV.

316
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,410
It's been everywhere.
So you,

317
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,190
they've kind of got to reach everyone
reached to in and out. Having said that,

318
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,250
I think my video has
reached more than this,

319
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,260
but I don't know if
it's the same audience.

320
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,030
They need to really show that they finally
accept what they did and that it was

321
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,720
wrong and it is not, you know, I've heard
a lot of people turn around and go, oh,

322
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:17,440
but how can you type comedy
central series after all,

323
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,850
it's called comedy central,

324
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,660
but I don't accept that because one,

325
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,810
it wasn't a joke what
they were discussing.

326
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,290
It wasn't a joke the time
that they were discussing,

327
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,350
it wasn't a joke that
they were pointing at me.

328
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,280
For someone who was partly
responsible in making that happen,

329
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,690
it's not a joke to cut somebody up.
I don't mind.

330
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,100
I make fun of myself all day every
day. If you watch my youtube, I like,

331
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,810
I have no problem doing that.

332
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,490
But there were certain
lines that even I like,

333
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,380
I don't get offended easily,

334
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,900
but I am freaking offended by the
content that they produce. So yes,

335
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,820
in theory it would accept an apology
and then taking responsibility.

336
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,080
But it has to match the amount.
They pushed the fight news till now.

337
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,280
Yeah. And I don't even know how they
could do that at this point. I mean I,

338
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,280
you know, it's so interesting also because
that's why I decided to do a long form

339
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,160
interview show in the first place
years ago. Cause I was like,

340
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,030
I'll do these things. We won't edit
for content. I liked doing them live.

341
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,190
You can say whatever you want.
I can edit you.

342
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,300
And ironically when I do I'll get
10 his camera off man. I know.

343
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,870
Yeah, exactly what? Like
when I, when I do television,

344
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:35,330
it's so funny because Fox News is
the only one that'll put me on.

345
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,990
I was on Tucker last night, but it's live.
There's no chance that they're getting,

346
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,620
they could sandbag me, you know, ask me
something intentionally inflammatory.

347
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,680
It's all live and absolutely. I know, I
just wouldn't go on the shows anymore.

348
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,870
That wouldn't be a problem. I know people
were criticizing me for going. Why,

349
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,140
why would you even, why would you
even do it? Well, there's two things.

350
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,470
One is I knew I was going to record it,
so it was a win win.

351
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,240
I was going to either get a good
segment where I actually got to, uh,

352
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,700
reach an audience that I
wouldn't typically be able
to reach and have my say and

353
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,930
present my opinions, um, and maybe
change a few minds, maybe not,

354
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:16,360
whatever,
um,

355
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,260
but at least be presented properly or
I'm going to get to expose the fake news.

356
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,640
And that's exactly what I did.

357
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:26,660
And I'm gonna call on fake
news even though they are
comedy central because that

358
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:31,250
is what they did. And people come to
those shows to get the newsies. It's sad.

359
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,331
It is sad.

360
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:36,980
But people come to those shows to get
their news and the fact is if they

361
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:41,210
presented as real news than it is just
the same meetings all the time and they

362
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,700
have that platform that I
have that responsibility.

363
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,890
Yeah. Well I, I completely agree with
that because you know, remember when,

364
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,810
when Jon Stewart was hosting
the daily show, I mean,

365
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:52,470
I know no one watches it anymore.
It's completely irrelevant. But when,

366
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:55,050
when Stewart was hosting the daily
show and Obama was president,

367
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,390
the meme out there on
all of mainstream media,

368
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:02,040
every article that was written about
daily show was more young people get their

369
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,980
news from the daily show.
Then from CNN, New York Times

370
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,770
to have it both ways.

371
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,900
But it's true. Like even here in
Australia, we have a, I don't know,

372
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,150
I don't know if you were
experienced in the project.

373
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:17,730
I don't know if Jordan was he,
when you guys were here on the project,

374
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,420
the project is assigned knees.
It's meant to be, you know,

375
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,410
a lot harder to comment and it does
reach the younger people and it's,

376
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,000
it's just not funny to take people
out of context to ruin people's lives.

377
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,893
It's wrong.

378
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,780
Okay, so now you get on a plane,
you, so the video goes viral.

379
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,320
Everybody seeing this, you're getting,
you're getting retweeted I think by,

380
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,130
by all the people that I know really
try to push back against this.

381
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,510
This means media nonsense. And you know,
I, I didn't know who you were before.

382
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:51,380
So I watched it and I was like, all right,
this, this is legit. Like I'm watching.

383
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,861
I didn't know.

384
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:54,440
I didn't know you're going to make
hurtful statements in this interview.

385
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:58,640
And you didn't know him, even
from Jay's says, Hey, I know
you now. I know, you know,

386
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:02,480
you know. Um, but you know, I'd
seen this game before, so I was,

387
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,840
I was more than happy to just spread
awareness about this. Okay. Yep.

388
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,540
So then you reach out
and you say, uh, well,

389
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,490
I think maybe I reached out to
you first. And I said, you know,

390
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,760
if you want to come in studio,
let, let's make this happen. Yeah.

391
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,490
Within a day you were like, all right,
I'm coming to the states. Uh, so what,

392
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:17,500
say it was

393
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,180
actually, it was you that, uh,
that, that inspired me to come.

394
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,390
Um, when, when you said, when we
had, we started the conversation,

395
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:28,810
I can't remember exactly how it
started, but, um, I said, you know what?

396
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:32,630
And I spoke to Sydney Watson, who's a
good friend here, who is very publisher,

397
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:36,020
you know, she's a Sky News
contributor. She has her own uh,

398
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,160
following and she was like, yeah, let's
do it. She's hot. She's a jewel citizen,

399
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:42,340
American, Australian. And we said,
let's do this. Let's go, you know,

400
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:45,490
we already had sapling. We have something
in place. We're going to go Reuben,

401
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,530
and then we're going to go, you know,
my idea was to go to comedy central,

402
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,210
just walk in the door,
you know,

403
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,370
talk to somebody with the comedy
central logo on a moment. You know,

404
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,830
anyone can watch any of my content.
I, when I'm asked to leave, I leave.

405
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,080
But that, that, that's good enough for me.

406
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:03,650
I'll walk into comedy central and if I
bring up some content that you've got and

407
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,560
you asked me to leave, that's
telling, that's enough visual.

408
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,450
Let somebody come in the central ledger,
you know,

409
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:11,360
right now that's been my problem
is no one even wants to respond.

410
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,830
The same producer that was so open to
talking to me before is not responding to

411
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,780
my whatsapp messages anymore.
That's it.

412
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,950
What's,
what's so interesting to me,

413
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,890
it's like they don't even understand
the Internet game that they think that

414
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:22,521
they're a part of.

415
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,940
Like they think that if you just ignore
this long enough that it's going to go

416
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:28,520
away. But I mean they're,
they're messing with the wrong.

417
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,410
I can't, I keep telling me there's
two people they need to talk to.

418
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,130
I can talk to my mom,

419
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,170
ask her how persistent on am I'm a pain
in her eyes to speak to my officer in

420
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:39,651
the army.

421
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:44,540
Like I flew halfway around the world
just to join the IDF to be on the front

422
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,190
line in a specific unit.
And I got there,

423
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,740
I'm going to go till they respond
and they, they need to know that. Um,

424
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,000
so we decided to do this, we call it
the American tour against fake news.

425
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,080
We're going to come to you on your show.
A few other shows that are organized. Um,

426
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,310
and it was just growing. It was you
in the beginning. And we just don't,

427
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:05,380
we're built around that. Well,
I was going to go do his, uh,

428
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,980
Jim Jefferies show in Maryland,
see if I can actually engage him.

429
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,400
Oh Man. Um, and I was
going to talk to just,

430
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,230
even the people lining up in the audience.

431
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,080
Now I want to make it
clear I was going to do it.

432
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,250
I'm not in a threatening manner on tiny,

433
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,070
like I'm, I'm, I'm a little guy.

434
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:29,120
I'd never end and you can say are going
to supplies in the, you know, online.

435
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:31,190
You see that brand is a lot
bigger than me. Generally,

436
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:32,600
I'm the smallest guy in the room.

437
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:37,310
I'm not very threatening and I'm willing
to talk to anybody and only talk.

438
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:41,990
I only ever talk. So there's
no basis for any, um,

439
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,140
perceived real threat. But, uh,

440
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,530
when we got to the states,
it was myself and Sydney.

441
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,330
Sydney's even Sydney is bigger than me,

442
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:55,020
but it'd be a tall girl and we
get there and they've, Abi, you,

443
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,450
she's with her. She's got an American
thing, was always split up straight away.

444
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,810
Um,
I've gone into the line now,

445
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,550
as soon as I've come to the, uh,
to the immigration desk, the,

446
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,380
something's obviously
popped up on your screen.

447
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,800
As soon as he's a swat my
passport and he goes, are,

448
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:16,850
you just need to come with me. We need
to update some details about your, uh,

449
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,520
about your,
I think it's called STV,

450
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:23,230
like the visa waiver program that
we had here with Australia. So I'm,

451
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:26,390
I'm fine at this point. I still think
it's okay. The acting quite normal.

452
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,160
Take me to a back room.

453
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:33,161
His superior officer is there and I
found that interesting because he kind of

454
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:37,010
seemed like he knew my name
already and he was expecting me,

455
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,040
but I went with the flow and taking me
around and lax to an area where it's more

456
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,600
secluded. Put your bags on a thing.
He's been going through my bag,

457
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,550
checking if I've got over $10,000, I'll
wish I did. Not, nothing close to it.

458
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,390
Um,

459
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,390
they're asking me more questions about
what I'm doing here and it's all still,

460
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,330
um, reasonable. I'm starting to
get a little bit more suspicious.

461
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,610
They've written down a bunch of stuff
and then I got, okay, we just got,

462
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,760
we've got a few more questions.

463
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,000
We'll go sit in this room and
talk because I knew it's on,

464
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,240
that opened the door to this back
room. There's two FBI agents, you know,

465
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,690
there's one man in a suit and then
a woman behind a computer and a,

466
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:21,270
they shined. Their idea
got everywhere. I looked,

467
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,900
I saw that and I just cracked up laughing.

468
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,510
I looked at him and I'll just
go to comedy central and the,

469
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,280
the,
the agent tends to be guys,

470
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,880
we are actually a separate
entity to comedy central.

471
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:40,680
Blackie had to say that like he had
to tell me now. And um, I've got,

472
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,380
I've said, I've responded going, we'll uh,

473
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,140
but comedy central is the informant.
Yeah.

474
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,010
And he just responded straight away.
And this is when people ask me,

475
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:53,550
how do you not comedy says, well,
he's gone. He said to me, literally,

476
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,220
we've received a number of complaints
from comedy central about certain things

477
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,570
that we just want to clarify.

478
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,680
Okay.
So we got to really drill this one home.

479
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:08,681
That means that comedy central contacted
either the FBI or the Tsa or whatever

480
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:14,390
else is going on there. The three
I's, what are and as hell man,

481
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,830
maybe that called law enforcement who
decided it's in the jurisdiction of FBI

482
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,550
because they knew that you were
coming to the United States,

483
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,430
I guess to do a couple of
shows including this one.

484
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,470
And you are going to just talk.

485
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,920
I know, I don't know if you saw my
description on the, it was on my website,

486
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,140
the description of what we were doing
there. So we're coming on your show.

487
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,250
We're going on Steven Crowder. We're
going to move, we're going to go confront.

488
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:39,920
Exactly.

489
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,380
So they've called and they
literally given screenshots.

490
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:48,960
I've taken screenshots of different posts
I've made, including one from Eylea,

491
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,990
a British, uh, Eh, uh, conservative,

492
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:54,910
the news site,
which,

493
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,550
how did I use an image of me
as an IDF soldier with my,

494
00:29:00,551 --> 00:29:02,140
uh,
with my rifle.

495
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,500
And they've basically taken everything
and gone through it as in are they 20?

496
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:11,140
Am I trying to obtain
weapons? I turned him, I go,

497
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:16,141
the only weapons I have that I need in
this tool is my microphone and my camera.

498
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,700
That's all. And look, by the end
of it, the FBI had cleared me,

499
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,390
the FBI were laughing with me about it.
They actually said to me,

500
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:28,780
I understand why you want to come and
clear your name. Yeah, that's fine.

501
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,510
They got they, they got it.
They were actually really nice.

502
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:34,960
Like I have no problem with them. I
have no problem with that. With the uh,

503
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,670
the border protection either.

504
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,150
My problem here is that comedy central
who have been ignoring all these had the

505
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:45,940
time to go to the FBI.
You know,

506
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:50,290
they've gone out of their way to just
silence at first online when all these

507
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,680
people are uh, you know, responding back,

508
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,450
asking him just to make a statement.

509
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,770
They blocking people by the
hundreds and then on top of that,

510
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,270
when they hear them coming to the states,

511
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,690
they literally contacted the FBI to try
get them to stop me from coming on the,

512
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,440
on the premise that I am coming
there to violently assault somebody.

513
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,551
Okay.

514
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:16,540
So going on the assumption you we're
not here to violently assaulted and that

515
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:21,400
the FBI was on board that and that
they accepted what you were laying out,

516
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,650
that you were just here to do
interviews and that sort of thing.

517
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,490
Obviously all true and Co and
the fact that comedy central,

518
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,510
I mean it really like,

519
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:33,511
it shows some other layer
of really perverse collusion
between networks and the

520
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:37,690
FBI. I mean, how insane is
that? But they did catch you on,

521
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,320
on a technicality related from years ago.
So it's important.

522
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:44,200
I think it's important to talk about.
Otherwise people are going to think, Whoa,

523
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:46,150
the FBI's in on some real conspiracy.

524
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,770
Right?
So once that happened,

525
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:54,690
it obviously triggered whatever
process, the, uh, border protection hat,

526
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,280
which is to go through
everything within your visa,

527
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,350
visa or visa waiver, whatever it is that
you're coming in on. And what they found,

528
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,080
we had a few, you know, it was over.

529
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,960
The interrogation with the
FBI was for about an hour.

530
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,510
Then there was a couple of other,
you know,

531
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,570
interviews with the different
border protection, um,

532
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,520
with the highest levels in lax.
And actually I'm not going to,

533
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,370
boy won't hurt their, their jobs, but
they were actually really good papers.

534
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,880
I have no problem with them.

535
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:29,610
And I believe in border protection
and if somebody makes a mistake,

536
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,260
like what I found.

537
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,810
So what it turned out is two years
ago when I filled out this visa waiver

538
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:41,130
application on online,
which I want to point out,

539
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,640
I had come even seven months
ago, the New York, um, I was, I,

540
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:49,500
I'd been in the states, only sign
these up from that same application.

541
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,310
So there was no problem and it
was an absolute technicality.

542
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,680
So what they found is when you fill
out these visa waiver forms online,

543
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,710
there's a bunch of crazy questions
and you know, you just like, um,

544
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,930
I rate him out. No, no, no, I'm
not a terrorist. I'm not this,

545
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:11,230
I'm not a neo Nazi or not there to create
balance. I've never been to just do, no,

546
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,920
no, no, no. One of them
happened to say, um,

547
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,840
have you ever been
denied a visa to the US?

548
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,860
Now is about 15 years ago.
Um,

549
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,930
I came on a visa waiver and right
after I got back to Australia,

550
00:32:24,931 --> 00:32:26,030
I applied for a visa.

551
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,930
They thought that implied that I
was trying to come there to live.

552
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,850
So I was trying to immigrate to the
u s and I got denied a visa. Now,

553
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,550
I don't know, I don't even remember
filling in the phone, so I don't know.

554
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,150
But that happened. Um, and I said
that openly to the uh, the, uh,

555
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
the border protection officer.

556
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,040
That technicality means that it makes the,

557
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,150
the application void and now it
means, so that was saying to me, look,

558
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,540
you're not getting banned. There's nothing
wrong. It's an accident. In fact, they,

559
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,870
they said to me, if we, um,

560
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,950
basically investigate the same way
we did your scrutinize, every app,

561
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,870
every person that comes
here on a visa waiver,

562
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,000
probably half of them will end up
doing a mistake on that upper gudgeon.

563
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,150
There'll be thrown out as well.

564
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,350
Or are you going to do is go back
to Australia and apply for a visa?

565
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:20,480
He can't use the visa
waiver program anymore.

566
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:22,790
You've got to actually have a
visa because you have been denied.

567
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,800
Now just to remember that
this is a technicality on a
technicality because irony

568
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,160
got refused the visa back then
because I was trying to immigrate.

569
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,970
Well in their minds it was the risk that
I was trying to immigrate to the US.

570
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,280
Now obviously when I was
there seven months ago,

571
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,900
I didn't immigrate to the u
s so even that was wrong. Um,

572
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,980
but I accept that this, listen, I have
no, I have no problem with that. I'm here.

573
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,100
I'm going to reapply and
everything you're saying is true.

574
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,860
I'm going to get in because I
have no criminal record. I'm not,

575
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,180
there's no reason for me
not to get the visa. Um,

576
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:01,190
my problem with it all is that
practically on a practical level,

577
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,020
comedy central got me kicked out even in
the short term. Even in the short term,

578
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,380
they managed to get me kicked out because
the fact that they were able to go to

579
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:13,190
the FBI and complain,
they triggered this investigation.

580
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:17,120
They got me out on a technicality
that in their own words, most people,

581
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,290
or at least half the people that come
into the US would, um, would file as well.

582
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,780
Right.
So the point here is,

583
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:27,460
the point here is that seven months
ago you got in with no problem and that

584
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:32,461
comedy central then triggers this by
contacting the FBI shows that they have

585
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:37,240
some level of power even if the agents
are going, yeah, this is nonsense.

586
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,570
It was 15 years ago. And everyone
knows when you're, when you're going,

587
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,360
you know when you're landing in another
country or you're filling out these

588
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:43,690
things,

589
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,160
sometimes they're written
in very confusing ways where
you almost think know me.

590
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,133
Yeah.

591
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,080
Um, I'm not even going to take that
experience cause I've got a nice shirt.

592
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,330
They printed it out for me.
It was very clean.

593
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,570
But there are so many questions
that most of them are crazy.

594
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,860
So you just kind of do, no, no,
no, no, no, no. In the time,

595
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,110
I wouldn't have lied about
it for nothing because I,

596
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,980
I would have thought if I'd seen that
one that obviously they'll know if about

597
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,910
being denied or not. It's
there. It's their immigration.

598
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,430
I can't believe that in pick
it up automatically. Yeah. Yes.

599
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,350
So that's exactly what's happened.

600
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,260
So have you, um, you know,

601
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:22,880
this is a weird thing that I think the
free speech crew is now confronted with

602
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,080
where,
you know,

603
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,020
when we're the ones that are getting
liable than slandered all the time and

604
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:31,870
having reputations destroyed and
having a media manipulated and,

605
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:34,850
and video editing and all of these things,
uh,

606
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,580
it's a weird place for us to be the ones
having to talk about legal remedies.

607
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,380
But have you thought about this at all?

608
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,300
We are at the moment,
yes.

609
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:45,230
We've got a few things down on
and a that we're working with.

610
00:35:45,231 --> 00:35:46,650
We're going to pop these
from a few friends.

611
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:51,651
Then my main objective more than anything
is to get them to face up to what

612
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:57,111
they've done and to respond
and take responsibility
over it because it is wrong.

613
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:00,060
I don't care if you're from the left,
if you from the right,

614
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,870
I don't care to do that,
to do what they've done.

615
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,960
And further to add insult to injury to
at every point that you have a chance to

616
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,590
stand up and take that responsibility.
Take and,

617
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,540
and apologize not only to me
apologize to your, to your fans.

618
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,420
I've seen so many people on Jim Jeffrey,
things that have actually said,

619
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,060
I don't even like avi,
I'm even like what he stands for.

620
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:27,240
I don't agree with anything,
but what you did is wrong.

621
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,920
At least give those, you know,
do the right thing. And you know,

622
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,540
when I was in the airport at the time,

623
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,760
I was there always the
time for about 15 hours.

624
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,410
And the hardest part
for me in that time is,

625
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,480
besides being treated like a criminal,

626
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,310
was the fact that it Sydney walks
and we're sitting in, in the airport,

627
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,650
lost in, you know, waiting for,

628
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,920
we had a flat together to New York
that she just sitting there not knowing

629
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:57,480
what's going on. I kept asking a border
protection if they were informing her.

630
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,780
They said, yes, I've got one phone
call. In fact, they were good.

631
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:05,490
I actually got me two phone calls and,
and, and he let me tweet and you said,

632
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:09,160
don't tweet anything about me brother.
Uh, but that, that, that will,

633
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,080
that will nicely. But the fact is that,
you know, I was sitting there going,

634
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:18,110
is she all right? You know,
it's a, it's a foreign country.

635
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,410
Might have American citizenship,

636
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:23,790
but she's an Ozzie put friends from he
here and we went into trouble together.

637
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,570
We're not creamy. I'm suddenly being,
the time she got questioned as well.

638
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,770
She was also investigated, but they
couldn't do anything. She's American.

639
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,550
Um, so it was for her, since
I've seen on her, you know,

640
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,930
I didn't even really know everything.
She went through tool.

641
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:44,820
I watched her youtube summary of what Ha,
what she gone through on that day.

642
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,720
And it's,

643
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,720
it's horrible and it's painful for me to
watch it because it's all comes down to

644
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:56,061
comedy central doing literally
trying to silence us.

645
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,710
What's also crazy to me is the,

646
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,940
the way that they don't know
how this game will play out.

647
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:04,430
It's like if they would've done,
well first I'm doing the right thing,

648
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:07,130
would've been not selectively editing,
but okay, let's say they can't,

649
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,470
they can't do it that way cause
they're playing a certain game.

650
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,920
Well then once you call them out on
it, you just immediately, you know,

651
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:14,030
we messed this one up,

652
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,840
especially after the Christchurch thing
where we're emotions were so high.

653
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:20,520
It's coming off a horrific,
horrific,

654
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:23,780
horrific tragedy that you had
taped this thing way before.

655
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:26,150
I mean there was a way they could
have gotten out. You know, we just,

656
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,830
we just botched this one.
That's it.

657
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,520
But now they've got it to the point and
that's why I wanted to do this with you.

658
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,890
Where are the longer they let this stew?
It's not just that at this point,

659
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,490
you know, in a way, Jim Jeffrey
should be fired or at least his,

660
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,150
and I don't like calling for this kind
of stuff. This is so not how I do this,

661
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:46,600
but it's like his executive producer or
whoever made those decisions should be

662
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,190
fired.
But the longer they go on,

663
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,860
you're getting this to the place
where you're gonna have to take out.

664
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,600
Major executives are going to have to
be fired because somebody is now making

665
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,270
these decisions and the way
these corporations work,

666
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:01,630
it's going to be pretty obvious
through emails and meetings.

667
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,300
Who made the decisions to
to throw you under the bus?

668
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:07,830
Who made the decision to contact
the FBI and I'm looking up,

669
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,450
we're going to get there.

670
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,220
We're going to get to
the bottom of all that.

671
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:13,740
We are going to point out at the end of
it, because I am persistent. Like I say,

672
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,710
what's bothering me is that the mainstream
media are not talking about and that

673
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:18,231
he's obviously,

674
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:22,820
like I said to you before we came on
is that I believe they think it's a

675
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:23,570
nonsteroidal.

676
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,960
They're scared to report on it because
suddenly the camera's going to be on them

677
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:31,190
because they all do it. And that's
why so important. I've been like,

678
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:34,520
I feel grateful that people like you
and there's been a few of them, phew.

679
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,750
You know, alternative online media,
people who actually have integrity,

680
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,880
who have reported on it. And they're
as outraged about it as I am. Look,

681
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,430
I'm watching it from the slide,
like not even in my,

682
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,360
if I just saw that from the side,

683
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,270
I would be disgusted because
it is so wrong. And I like,

684
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,550
even if it was somebody I
absolutely disagree with,

685
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,710
I would be in his room.

686
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,090
Well that's what I was saying
to you before. It's like,

687
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,420
it's the perfect storm of craziness.
It's media manipulation.

688
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,020
It's leftist insanity.
It's dishonest hosts.

689
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:13,030
It's all of these things at
once. Do you remember, uh,

690
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:17,710
about two months ago a alley Stucky who
was actually on my show last week who's

691
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,490
a conservative,
a podcast here.

692
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,540
She did a fake interview with,
uh,

693
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,380
Alexandria ocozzio Cortez where they
just sliced alleys, questions with,

694
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,840
you know, uh, I say shipping here.

695
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:35,870
I did one lot that is similar and it's
like Allie posted and it was so obvious

696
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:41,610
that it was fake and it was so obvious
that this is exactly what comedy central

697
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:44,700
does all the time. And this is
exactly what comes, you know,

698
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,370
daily show and all these
things do all have.

699
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,590
But the media went bananas that it
was the Conservatives spreading a fake

700
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:54,150
interview to make AOC look ridiculous.
And it's like,

701
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,660
you guys do this to people on the right
every single day that your number one

702
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,620
motivation. I think that's
pretty much the only person.

703
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:09,150
You don't need a cut in meeting up to me.
Yeah,

704
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:12,520
exactly. She's doing a,
she's doing a fine job. Yeah,

705
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't have it. And they're all
hypocrites. And look, I have,

706
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,560
I'm telling you,
I'll watch it.

707
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:22,340
I actually thought within a day there
would be mainstream media and there's been

708
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:24,750
a couple that are going to
Australia. There's a, uh,

709
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,220
a for the Daily Telegraph
and man called Tim Blake.

710
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:31,790
He's written a few times about it, but
you know, channel 10 years in Australia.

711
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,980
They,
they only wrote it in the

712
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,060
context of bum me being
deported. In fact, it was,

713
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,160
it was disgusting story at first.

714
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:43,880
Then I called her out on Twitter and
within two minutes she called me back and

715
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,630
you know, she, she in her
report, she actually wrote,

716
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,760
we reached out to RB for comment
with no response and it was like, um,

717
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,620
I was in the tension. How the hell
did you want me to respond? You know,

718
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,090
they're just so full of it.
Everything they do, they,

719
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,280
this is one of the
hallmarks of what they do.

720
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:06,540
I've had this happened to me many times.
They'll,

721
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:10,670
they'll reach out for you to comment
about a half hour before the article goes

722
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:14,120
up. You can be at the freaking
dentist, you could be walking your dog.

723
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:18,740
But in our own, in our own report, she
was reporting that I was in detention.

724
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,250
How dumb do you think everyone is?

725
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,240
They think people are pretty
dumb and I hate to tell you,

726
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,220
but I can already predict
what's going to happen here.

727
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,430
There'll be a couple of weeks, there'll
be a couple of hit pieces about this.

728
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:35,580
You'll be said, oh, they put you
on all right, Ruben show. And, uh,

729
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,080
but I mean the Jewish non
Jewish Nazi in Australia.

730
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:43,940
So I think you might be the one in
for approval. That's fine. Listen,

731
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,190
I've, I've taken the, uh,

732
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:52,610
what do you think this says about the
way this nonsense is spreading across

733
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,800
borders? Because, uh,
you know, as you know,

734
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:58,220
I was on tour with Peterson for the last
year and we went to a ton of countries,

735
00:42:58,221 --> 00:42:59,420
including about 10 stops.

736
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,010
And the Australian shows were
absolutely phenomenal. I mean,

737
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:06,800
just the audiences were incredible.
I just love you guys.

738
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,960
Well, there was just such
a zest for life and fun.

739
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:15,020
I went out with audience members almost
every night after the show. I just,

740
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:18,470
I seriously just had a, had
an absolute blast. Um, but,

741
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,330
but what I'm amazed by right now,

742
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,170
after the last year is that I've seen
the way the world operates online and on

743
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:25,190
Twitter and on Youtube.

744
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,820
But then I've traveled the world and I've
been to Sweden and to Denmark and you

745
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:32,390
know, Canada and us and, and all
and Ireland and all over the place.

746
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,460
And the fact that there are people in
all of these places that are, you know,

747
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,420
thousands of miles away from each
other thinking the same exact things.

748
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,070
It's pretty powerful.
And I think,

749
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,480
I think that right there is what these
guys fear more than anything else.

750
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:52,481
That there actually is a worldwide
push back against their nonsense.

751
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,400
Are you feeling that?
Absolutely.

752
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:59,960
And that's why they're shutting people
down or they're trying to, you see, um,

753
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,220
you know, personally I've been shot off
Facebook for things that they can't even,

754
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,860
they can't even back at they,

755
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,880
you ask them for any evidence and they
can't show you what it is exactly.

756
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,790
And that's the way that they are trying
to solve once you all these different

757
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,870
organizations in the fact that the fact
again that that within 24 hours a month,

758
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,640
my video with my whole page,

759
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:23,660
which again shows me that
there is a collision there
between comedy central and,

760
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:28,580
and that's not some crazy conspiracy
theory that that is just common sense

761
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:32,890
though isn't easy. Um, dots to connect
day. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think?

762
00:44:32,891 --> 00:44:37,180
Why do you think youtube left the video
up? If a, if Facebook took it down,

763
00:44:37,181 --> 00:44:39,450
cause I'm sure we'll
try it on youtube too.

764
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,290
I Dunno. Maybe it's earning
of money. I don't know. I
don't know. I don't know why,

765
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:48,680
but you know, Youtube I've found over
the last year has been better. Um,

766
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,750
then Facebook or they, you know, until
they get pressured. W for example,

767
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:56,560
my good friend Tommy Robinson,
they proved his page on Facebook.

768
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,860
Youtube actually defended keeping his
channel up until a number of labor mps

769
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:09,100
really bullied Facebook into, into, they
will, they didn't want to backtrack.

770
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:12,550
They defended this, this, as I said, he
never breached their terms and conditions.

771
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,470
So,
um,

772
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,370
then they backtrack once there
was about two months of lobbying,

773
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:23,170
I'll call it bullying,
bullying by Labor MPs in the UK.

774
00:45:23,171 --> 00:45:26,320
And then suddenly they didn't want to
say that Berlin. So they restricted,

775
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:31,330
heavily restricted his
channel. Um, youtube, I don't,

776
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:35,650
I think unless there is some
political been done so far, they see,

777
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,920
I think they're starting to
recognize that, um, you're gonna,

778
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,100
you're running your
business into the ground.

779
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,170
Facebook is running their business into
the ground and you can see it even just

780
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:50,860
in a shed, but it is a dying
thing. We've all gone to telegram.

781
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,220
We've gone to a lucky basically the
whatsapp that's protected not by Facebook

782
00:45:57,191 --> 00:46:01,570
but by a Russian to Russian brothers
and we're finding it fantastic.

783
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,450
You know the, the, you get the
response, you so much ready,

784
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:07,210
you see the click throughs.
It is absolutely unbelievable,

785
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:12,310
but it is crazy that we're being forced
to the other platforms that are meant to

786
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:17,311
be messaging apps instead of using actual
social media because these different

787
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,030
organizations in different
institutions have hold so much power.

788
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,730
Yeah. Wait, did you mean that you're,

789
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:26,550
you're actually spreading your videos
through telegram? I mean I know,

790
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,380
I know it's a messaging APP,

791
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:30,150
but you're saying you're building
an actual audience there.

792
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:31,220
I didn't even know that was a great

793
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,040
got, we've got, we've got a
group, Tommy, Tommy Robinson use,

794
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:40,041
we call it Tommy Robinson news and your
members join like any page and you can,

795
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,640
you can even embed likes and things
that people can actually interact.

796
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:48,420
It's a one way wall and you can link out,
you can do it.

797
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,660
It's so much better than,
so you can put,

798
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,870
we can literally upload
videos there and say, okay,

799
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:56,730
they're not letting us
put videos on Facebook,

800
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,890
but we'll upload it here with
a little download button.

801
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,640
We don't need our one page.
You guys all have your own pages.

802
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:05,640
You go upload and flood their,
their um,

803
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,320
different platforms with these content
and it is so much more effective and I

804
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:13,160
think that that is going to be
the future, to be honest. It is.

805
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,890
That is the future of social media.
If they continue down this park,

806
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,750
all of them are going to crash from
the Twitter, youtube, Facebook,

807
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:26,280
they're all going to crash unless they
allow people to actually have a fake gun.

808
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,620
Is the perverse part of this? I
always say that it's, you know,

809
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:32,200
if they would just not
be totally horrible,

810
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,210
we would all have nothing to talk about.

811
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:38,170
It's like if they were 30%
horrible or like 50% horrible,

812
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,710
we'd kind of complain every now and
again and people would be like, ah,

813
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:45,550
they're always complaining.
But then they do these sorts of things.

814
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,700
It's like you guys are, it's not that
you're just going all the way horrible.

815
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:52,720
It's not just that you selectively edit
and you manipulate and you throw people

816
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:56,320
under the bus and you try to just
spread this chill effect so that,

817
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,740
cause it's not about destroying you.
Right. It's like they know, well,

818
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:00,850
if we can destroy a hobby,

819
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:04,150
it's like we can take out thousands of
other people that will never speak up

820
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,350
again. And it's like, man,

821
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:09,610
if you guys would just not
be all in on the bullshit,

822
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,510
then we'd probably have other
things to be talking about.

823
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,220
Yeah,
look it.

824
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,920
It absolutely is that the fact is I
think they thought I was an easy target.

825
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:23,590
They'll probably be like you. They
didn't really know who I was. Um,

826
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,050
they just knew,
you know,

827
00:48:25,051 --> 00:48:30,051
if you look in Australia on probably
the biggest name for alternative media

828
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:33,600
here, none. That's not because
I'm that great. You know,

829
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:38,601
I think I am just that we don't have
a big alternative media thing here.

830
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:42,990
So I think they, they, they
thought I'd be an easy target.

831
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:45,270
And I totally underestimated the practice.

832
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:50,300
I am not an idiot.
And you know that,

833
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,990
that today to fight back, he's not that
hard because I think science needs to be,

834
00:48:54,991 --> 00:48:57,870
boy is actually,
I think people are looking for the truth.

835
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,610
It's kind of the Trump effect and the
whole idea of fake news, you know, they,

836
00:49:01,611 --> 00:49:02,580
they said Trump,

837
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:06,420
it's so nuts and he keeps going on about
fake news and it's like they literally

838
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:09,360
create fake news that is actually a thing.

839
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,660
And anyone that's had anything to do
with media will know that fake news is a

840
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:16,530
real problem.

841
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,740
And that's not to say Trump is the best
guy in the world or on the most innocent

842
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,850
person in the world.
I've done my fair share of things.

843
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:28,851
But the fact is that these in
these organizations are corrupt,

844
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:33,770
so corrupt, and they act like
they are so much better than us.

845
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:37,980
They hold the moral high ground when
they are the biggest scam in the world.

846
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,660
They are literally worse than
the worst people. You know,

847
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:46,290
it's so strange.
Guy tweeted something the other day about,

848
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:51,180
it's like Trump for his orange skin
and his hair plugs and the crazy way he

849
00:49:51,181 --> 00:49:54,180
speaks.
It's like somehow despite all of that,

850
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,230
he's more authentic than them. I mean
that tells it right there. It's right.

851
00:49:58,231 --> 00:49:59,640
Like this guy looks fake.

852
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,060
He doesn't look like a what a what
a regular human being looks like.

853
00:50:03,061 --> 00:50:06,570
Like that's how fake he looks and
the way he speaks the whole thing.

854
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:11,010
And yet he can actually come off more
authentic than these people because

855
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:14,430
they're so polished and they got away
with it for so long they don't even know

856
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:17,470
how to, how to do it right
anymore. I think it's the, yeah,

857
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,250
I imagine on the Internet
where, you know, look for that.

858
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,030
When we saw something on TV, it
was polished. It was perfect,

859
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:26,680
and that's what we got.
You know,

860
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,770
if we seen something that was a little
bit unpolished, it was kind of odd.

861
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:35,090
That's rubbish. That's fine. Now we're in
an age where, you know, Google hangouts,

862
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:36,980
you can do a conversation
from across the world.

863
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:41,900
Even if they deport someone and you
know, it's the content. It's the words,

864
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:45,840
it's the, it's the substance.
People are listening to, um,

865
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,210
that nobody cares what Trump looks like.
Nobody cares.

866
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:54,620
Even though he's rough around the edges
and he's not that articulate and either

867
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,150
nobody cared because people are like,
what's he saying? What's he telling me?

868
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,510
What's he depending? What's he
standing up for? What is Danny against?

869
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,230
And I think that's what shines really.
Like I'll personally, I see it in myself,

870
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:10,220
I'll look at him and I go, I
like that. And it's just a bonus.

871
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:13,880
He triggers the people I don't like a lot.

872
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,860
Just so I have an idea here because
there's no doubt that there are dozens.

873
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:19,700
I have no doubt,

874
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,230
dozens of comedy central employees
and executives watching this right now

875
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,440
sitting in their cubicles
with their headphones,

876
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,430
cause they don't want anyone
to know that they're watching.

877
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,490
But what I find is that over
the course of this show,

878
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:35,450
I have found people over the years,
James Damore, Lindsay Shepherd,

879
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:40,370
Bret Weinstein, people who have, you
know, taken unpopular positions or,

880
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,220
or basically stood up to the mob,
I would say more than anything else.

881
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:46,220
And they've survived. And you're
obviously going to survive this,

882
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,690
so why don't you talk directly to the
comedy central employees right now,

883
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:54,320
the executives who are going to have to
make some decisions on that are we are,

884
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,990
we are, we got about eight minutes left.
I mean, let's tell them what to do.

885
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:00,350
We got it that you want the
apology, but, but if they're there,

886
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:03,860
if they're in the belly of the beast,
what do you think they should do?

887
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,370
Good. Hi Guys, my name's Avi.

888
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:12,150
Can you probably recognize me from the
last two weeks of headaches and sleepless

889
00:52:12,151 --> 00:52:16,950
nights? Um, do the right thing. You know,
it'd be a person for once, you know,

890
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:19,890
step back a second. I'm thinking
about it because almost up person,

891
00:52:19,891 --> 00:52:22,470
you might not agree with my positions.
You might not like what I have to say.

892
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,480
You might, you might really this
Walkman, but what you did was wrong.

893
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:32,050
What you did was like, and you know, it's,

894
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,630
if anything,

895
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:38,190
hopefully you've learned something that
hopefully you just turned around and

896
00:52:38,191 --> 00:52:43,191
looked in the mirror for a second and
gone that that makes me a bad person.

897
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:47,250
Like, if that was my idea or if
I'm the editor, whoever it is.

898
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:50,720
And now also Jim Jefferies, I've
heard people say, um, you know,

899
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,500
excusing in Jeffries, he's not the
one that cuts it. You know what he's,

900
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,110
he's certainly seen the final cut is also,
you know,

901
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:02,910
had had to do the pieces to camera where
he knew he was throwing me under the

902
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:07,000
bus. Look at yourself for a second night.
You were sitting there at the log in,

903
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,400
you're my best, my, we did a photo op. Uh,
you would show, you know, and there was,

904
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:16,820
I walked out of that that day going maybe
this is not going to end up the way I

905
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,850
expected it to.
Maybe you're actually going to be decent.

906
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,840
And when I say decent by
just representing the,

907
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,910
you interviewed the person who blew half
way around the freaking world to be a

908
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:33,570
part of your little show just represented.
You didn't do that.

909
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,840
So now is your chance to do the right
thing and don't even do it because you're

910
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:43,680
scared of what's to come.
And I promise you there's a lot to come,

911
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,460
but do it because it is actually your
chance to recognize what you did and there

912
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:52,260
are millions around the
world who are watching.

913
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,160
If that's your incentive,
then so be it.

914
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,440
But if it makes you actually recognize
an and become a bigger person out of it,

915
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,090
then my job here is done.

916
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:07,530
Not Bad man. Some somebody
heard that, I guarantee you.

917
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:10,220
And that's all it takes is a little
spark with some of these people to,

918
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,850
to get the inertia going,
you know?

919
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,920
Well they, you know, they,
they often claim to be,

920
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,720
to work from an emotional place.

921
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,570
I'm speaking to them right now on an
emotional level because, you know,

922
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:30,120
I'm grateful I caught it. I could not
imagine where I would be emotionally.

923
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:35,270
Where would I be as a person emotionally
if what was put out was just their

924
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:39,390
version of the veins. No, well your
career would be over basically.

925
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,310
Not even in my career,
my mental,

926
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,950
I don't think there's anything
worse then, um, you know,

927
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:52,770
being blamed for something you
didn't do. Um, knowing like,

928
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,060
seeing what they produced
and knowing the truth,

929
00:54:57,061 --> 00:55:01,140
me knowing only may not, I mean not
being able to prove it to anyone.

930
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,810
I couldn't imagine not just, I not
consider myself a pretty strong person,

931
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,130
uh, like mentally strong and I'd
been through a lot in my lab.

932
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,030
I don't know if I would have survived
that and that, you know, they talk about,

933
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,290
they often talk about people,
you know,

934
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,140
pushing people over the edge because
how dare you criticize their religion or

935
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:23,430
criticize ideas though,

936
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:27,900
did say something against transgender
or gay marriage because you're going to

937
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,020
ruin people's psychology,
you know?

938
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,500
Yeah.

939
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,850
What were you going to do to me?

940
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,920
What were you going to do
to another human being?

941
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:37,410
Okay.

942
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,780
How long is it going to take
you to get back into the states?

943
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:41,880
Did they tell you once you
fill out all this stuff,

944
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:48,430
the bad visa thing? And I've had a few
great people reach out to me already. Uh,

945
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,150
you know, from, I don't want
to, um, highlighting are,

946
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,050
but people who wield power in the US.

947
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,490
So I don't think it's going to
be too much of an issue and uh,

948
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:01,880
as Ani would say,
I'll be back.

949
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:08,310
Um, I think, I think we hit
the main points here. Uh,

950
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,720
hopefully. Yeah, hopefully this does
a little something. I mean, just this,

951
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:18,230
I will ask you one other thing actually
before we wrap up. So I find that

952
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,470
I, am he just a, anyone knows
anyone are you judging? May Not.

953
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:25,990
Only for my action will for the way I'm
stringing my sentences together now.

954
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:26,824
It's 2:00 AM

955
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,360
all right. We got all right.
You got to get to bed.

956
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:32,200
So I'll just ask you one other thing
then, which is where do you think, uh,

957
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:32,890
you know,

958
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,260
I know you're not going to view it this
way because I asked this question to a

959
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:37,030
lot of people and they
never accept the premise,

960
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,630
but where do you think the bravery comes
from within you that you're willing to

961
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:41,464
fight this?

962
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,400
He could because everyone that I know
that it stood up to the mob has survived

963
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:49,990
and not only has survived has actually
thrive, thrive yet. When I go out,

964
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:52,420
when I go out to colleges,
when I do speak in gigs,

965
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:56,800
the number one thing I get from people
is I'm afraid they're afraid to lose

966
00:56:56,801 --> 00:57:00,130
their job. They're afraid to lose family
members, they afraid to lose friends,

967
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,460
etc. Etc. So, so where do you
think it comes from within you?

968
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,880
Uh, I honestly, I do not. I don't
think of it as bravery running.

969
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,820
Think of it as stupidity. Yep. I'll,

970
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,970
I'll leave you with one story that pretty
much sums it up for me. It actually,

971
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,980
um, it's, it's kind of how I feel every
day. We're not served in the Israeli army.

972
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,150
I was in a, we, we were,
um, we were ambushed.

973
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,090
I had an Arab, it really good
friend of mine, he's an Arab office,

974
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:32,550
I Christian officer, and
this just described exactly
how I feel every single day.

975
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,350
Um,
and he says,

976
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,700
so we were ambushed from in front and
we were actually leaving the Gaza Strip

977
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:39,671
from him from,

978
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:43,650
from about five meters and treated as
a pod terrorists and from behind where

979
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,420
they were in long range artillery
that were firing from two site. Now,

980
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,770
there was about 18,
probably in the class my gun,

981
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,940
and it was an American and for um,
I'm not gonna swear on these shows.

982
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:57,774
I'm not gonna say

983
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,450
you can swear all you want

984
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,190
it jammed.

985
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,660
So I was basically standing
on the sea on these June,

986
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:10,660
jumping from side to side, just dodging
bullets. Now at the end of the, uh,

987
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:14,590
the, the chocolate had come and I thought
that was the game, that night logo.

988
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,620
I don't really believe in God really.
I'm a proud Jew,

989
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:20,450
but that's a separate story.

990
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,350
That's a whole other show

991
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,010
that not,
I was praying to God.

992
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,710
And then when I heard
that helicopter come in,

993
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,720
the United started firing and finally
things had settled and two of my friends

994
00:58:33,531 --> 00:58:36,680
had been hit. Um, the, I was a marksman.

995
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:39,380
Now there's two marks means in
every class when you go into combat,

996
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:43,160
the monument at the front, there's one at
the front and one in the, in the middle.

997
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,770
The management at the front was hit.

998
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,860
So my officer who didn't
know my gun had jammed,

999
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,800
had called me, said Avi, because
you've got to go around to the,

1000
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,250
to the bodies to make sure,
because obviously a,

1001
00:58:55,251 --> 00:58:58,220
a lot of time they detonate as
you will buy or whatever it is.

1002
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:02,210
So just to make sure the buddies
and that they're actually dead. Um,

1003
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,640
and he calls me over and this
is my answer to you as you,

1004
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,610
as we're walking around to the body,

1005
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:12,410
it due to the body as I've
said to the officer, um,

1006
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:17,020
the Mike, just so you know, I
have no gun. I had the scopes.

1007
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:20,750
The reason why they take the margin is
because I had the night vision and all

1008
00:59:20,751 --> 00:59:24,170
that. I, um, I come Ron and I,

1009
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:26,840
and coming around and it's just
me and him is I said to him,

1010
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,170
I have no gun cause what do you
mean you have no gun? I said to him,

1011
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,080
my gun is jammed and he's an Arab.

1012
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:37,130
Say he starts cursing me in Arabic and
telling me to get back to the line of

1013
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:41,540
what now, after all that, and
we got out, he tilled today.

1014
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:46,570
Thinks I deserve a medal for that
stupidity and I can't convince him.

1015
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,210
I've said to him,
and I'm telling you genuinely,

1016
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,900
I have never been more
shit scared in my life.

1017
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,120
I think I actually
crapped myself that night,

1018
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:00,950
but he was the aura and it was just not,
the job needs to be done.

1019
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:02,780
And that's what I feel like. Um, you know,

1020
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,860
so often now I don't know what I'm
going into. I don't know if, you know,

1021
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,900
if you tell me to go back to the days
where I just own gyms and just focused on,

1022
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:17,240
you know, my life, then would I
go back? It's a tough question.

1023
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:18,890
I don't want to think
about it because some days,

1024
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,850
some days you're in battles
that you feel are overwhelming,

1025
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,670
but if I don't do it,
who will?

1026
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,390
I think the moral of the story is everyone
should have an Arab Christian yelling

1027
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:32,224
at them.

1028
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,860
Uh, he, he was, he's a legend.

1029
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:38,080
Yes. Listen, I hope,

1030
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:40,240
I hope we've moved the dial
for you a little bit here.

1031
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,720
I look forward to getting into the state
so that you can sit in the seat right

1032
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:47,560
across from me and I can shake your hand
and good luck with everything. And A,

1033
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:51,430
and Jeffery's, you're welcome here
too. I'll gladly be a peacemaker.

1034
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:54,070
We got an extra chair,
so let's see if we can do that.

1035
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,450
I reckon we should sit together, have a
coffee and talk this one out. Hey Jimmy.

1036
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:01,950
Boy,
we'll have a foresters.

1037
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:07,260
Have a good night. [inaudible] you
been seeing those names, but uh,

1038
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,390
I've seen him.
I've seen him yet.

1039
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,930
All right.
