00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.210
The circle x squared plus y
squared minus 8x equals 0,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.720
and the hyperbola x squared
over 9 minus y squared

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.400
over 4 equal 1
intersect at the points

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.820
A and B. Equation of a common
tangent with positive slope

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.650
to the circle as well so
the hyperbola is-- so let's

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.550
just visualize what
they're asking first.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.970
And this is going to
take us multiple videos,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.730
I have a feeling.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.080
But let's just
visualize it just so we

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.690
can get our head
around the problem.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.900
So this circle, let me complete
the square in terms of x.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.970
So this circle, as they wrote
it, is x squared minus 8x.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.370
And then we have
a plus y squared--

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.210
I left some space here
so we can complete

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.360
the square-- is equal to 0.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.860
And then let me add half of this
8 term squared to both sides.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.930
So half of negative
8 is negative 4,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.980
and negative 4 squared is 16.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.670
So add 16 to both sides.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.950
And that allowed me to turn the
x-term into a perfect square.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.800
This is the same thing
as x minus 4 squared.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.540
And then we have plus y squared.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.700
Plus y squared is equal to 16.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.140
So this is a circle.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.320
This right here is a circle
with center at x equals 4.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.290
At x equals 4, y is equal to 0.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.830
And it has a radius
of 4 as well.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.190
So let me graph
this circle here.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.330
So let me draw the
horizontal axis, my x-axis.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.500
Let me draw the y-axis.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.220
That is my y-axis over here.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.051
And let me draw its
center, so 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.246
4 comma 0.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:52.120
That's it's center, and
it has a radius of 4.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.578
So it's going to
come out, and it's

00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:57.832
going to look something--
I could draw a better

00:01:57.832 --> 00:01:58.540
circle than that.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.210
It's going to look something
like-- that's the top half,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.860
and then the bottom
half is going

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.680
to look something like that.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.980
So that's our circle.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.460
Now let's think
about the hyperbola.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.671
So if we just look at it, the
x squared term is positive,

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.170
so it's going to
be a hyperbola that

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.503
opens to the right and the left.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.550
We do this a bunch in
the conic sections videos

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.090
if you want to review of that.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.910
And we could just figure out
where it intersects the x-axis.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.320
So then when y is equal to
0, we have x squared over 9

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.620
must be equal to 1.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.600
Or x would be plus or minus 3.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.630
So the hyperbola is
going to look like this.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.360
So this is at plus 3 comma 0.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.150
The hyperbola will
open up like that.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.840
And then at 1, 2, 3,
negative 3 comma 0,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.680
the hyperbola is going
to open up to the left.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.180
And so in the problem when they
describe the points A and B,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.450
they're probably talking about
that point A and that point B.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.130
Now, let's think about what
this question is asking us.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.290
Equation of a common tangent
with positive slope--

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.600
so it has to have a positive
slope-- to the circle

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.380
as well as to the
hyperbola-- a common tangent.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.490
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.110
So it's going to have
a positive slope,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.072
so it won't be
tangent to the circle

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:18.030
anywhere where the circle
has a negative slope.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.170
So it can't be
tangent over here.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.884
It can't be tangent over there.

00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:26.300
And then we could
say, well, if it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.591
was tangent to the circle
over here, what would happen?

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:32.880
Well , it wouldn't be able to
be tangent to the hyperbola.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.430
So it has to be
tangent to the circle

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.260
someplace in this blue
region right over here.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.300
And then how can it be
tangent to the hyperbola?

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.130
It might be tempting
to say that it would

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.980
be tangent to the hyperbola
in this way somehow,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.360
but what you need to
realize is the hyperbola

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.920
is asymptoting
towards some line.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.320
And we could figure
out what that line is.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.590
Its asymptoting
towards some line.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.785
So let me draw that line.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.950
The hyperbola is always
going to have a higher

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.330
slope than that line, a
very slightly higher slope.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.980
It's slowly
approaching that line.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.930
So if you go out
here, the hyperbola

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.490
is going to have a higher
slope than the asymptote line.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.529
And so if you had
to be tangent to it,

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.932
you would have to
have a higher slope.

00:04:23.932 --> 00:04:25.640
And anything that's
coming from this part

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.520
of the circle towards anything
out here on the hyperbola

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.181
is going to have to have a lower
slope than the tangent line,

00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:31.680
right?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.040
Because it's going
to have to catch up.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.415
The tangent line
is going to have

00:04:34.415 --> 00:04:36.340
to catch up to
whatever-- let me draw it

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.420
again-- to whatever
we draw over here.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.370
I want to make this clear.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.940
The hyperbola, as
you go out here,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.880
actually this whole period, this
whole part of the hyperbola,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.620
is going to have a
higher slope than what

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.900
it is asymptoting towards.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.870
That's what allows it to get
closer and closer to that line.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.440
So any tangent is going
to have to have a higher

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.280
slope out here.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.725
Anything tangent
to the hyperbola

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:02.100
is going to have
to have a higher

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.340
slope than this actual line.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.230
It's going to have to have
a slightly higher slope.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.920
So if we take something
out here and we

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.200
try to draw a tangent from this
part of the circle out there,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.210
it wouldn't work.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.970
Because this tangent,
by definition,

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.050
in order to meet
the hyperbola, is

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.430
going to have to have a lower
slope than this asymptote.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.050
So this can't be tangent to
that part of the hyperbola.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.540
So what else can we do?

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.389
Well, the only other
part of the hyperbola

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.180
that we might be able
to work something out

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.890
is this part of the
hyperbola right over here.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.740
So if we find a line that's
tangent maybe there and there

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.870
on the hyperbola, then we might
have found our common tangent

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.060
with positive slope.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.550
So let me draw that.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.790
So our common tangent
with positive slope,

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.090
I'll do that in pink.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.650
Our common tangent with positive
slope could look like that.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.680
So now that we have
the visualization down,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.120
in the next video
let's try to figure out

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.290
what that line might look like,
especially when we constrain it

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.470
to having to be
tangent to the circle

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.430
and having to be tangent
to this hyperbola.
