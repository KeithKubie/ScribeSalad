&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: So,
I'm Georgia Higley.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.810
I'm head of the newspaper
section in the Serial

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.860
and Government Publications
Division.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.990
And we're the home of the
comic book collection.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.150
So, that's why I'm up here.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.740
And I have the fortunate
duty to introduce Carol.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.990
So, I want to welcome
everyone to this latest program

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.780
that we're sponsoring.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.030
And this program is celebrating
one of our special collections,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.550
The Comic Book Collection.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.610
And it's really celebrating
one piece

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.140
of that collection,
the SPX Collection.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.470
And the idea of the SPX
Collection goes back

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.760
to August, 2011.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.230
When the Library signed an
agreement with SPX that lead

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.600
to the creation of
the collection.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.300
As many of you already know,
SPX sponsors an annual festival

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.190
in Bethesda, Maryland.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.490
And it gives artists, writers
and publishers of comic art

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.030
and its multitude of forms,
the opportunity to meet

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.750
and exhibit their material.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.850
The Library aquires independent
comics and cartoon art

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.660
from publishers and creators,
appearing at the festival.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.680
As well as through the
annual Ignatz Award winners.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.640
And through todays talk,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.910
we're actually recognizing
the rewards of this agreement.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.050
Because to date, over
5,200 items have come

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.530
to the Library, through SPX.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.800
And that has been a
wonderful boon for us.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.300
Because, of course,
it is something

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.100
that probably we would
not have received

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.160
through our traditional means,
which is copyright deposit.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.270
And the annual talk
that we're sponsoring,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.570
such as this one today,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.770
is always held the
Friday before the start

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.550
of the SPX Festival weekend.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.210
So, today, we're very fortunate
to have a claimed cartoonist,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.370
painter, writer, educator.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.790
And I'm sure there are a whole
lot more occupations l could

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.780
list, Carol Tyler, as
this year's speaker.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.320
She will be discussing her
creative life in "Comics To a T,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.720
The Triumphs and Troubles
of Telling the Tyler Story."

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.360
She's a pioneer of the
autobiographical comic genre.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.760
And she uses her own experience
to kind of tackle issues

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.590
of human experience, with
grace, humor and style.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.760
Tyler's works are too
many to mention here.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.450
But they've appeared
in Women's Comics,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.920
where her first works
were published.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.740
Twisted Sisters,
Weirdo, LA Weekly,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.070
among many other publications.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.340
She has received
numerous awards.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.640
Notably named on the list

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.360
of the top 100 cartoonist
of the century.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.500
Tyler's 2015 book, "A
Soldiers Heart, the Campaign

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.620
to Understand My WW Two Veteran
Father," about her dad's trauma

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.760
from World War Two and
its impact on her family.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.460
Exemplifies the autographical
comic genre

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.900
that she has really
made her own.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.190
It received a host of
awards and nominations.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.290
Eleven Eisner awards,
two Ignatz nominations.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.530
And was twice a finalist
for the LA Times Book Prize.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.830
Alex Dubin, [assumed spelling]

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.700
of the Los Angeles Times
Book Review, considered it,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.980
"Not just Tyler's
masterpiece, but arguably one

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.880
of the 21st centuries
best comics."

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.120
Others have compared
it favorably

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.880
to Art Spiegelman's "Maus."

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.390
Her latest book, "Fab4
Mania," I love that name.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.630
Details her personal
obsession with the Beatles.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.370
And her concert going
experience,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.110
as told from her 13-year-old
self's point of view.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.270
As she once described
it, "It's me reconnecting

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.370
with the person I was,
before life came along."

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.420
So, before I turn the
podium over the Carol,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.270
I just want to point out
that we've got a display

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.920
of Carol's works.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.260
Including both "Soldiers Heart"
and "Fab4 Mania," on the tables

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.380
on the far side of the room.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.370
So, after the formal programs
over, please go take a look.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.120
And I want to put a
plug in for an exhibit

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.680
over in the Jefferson building
that also has Carol's work

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.630
in it, "Drawn to Purpose."

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.540
It's worth crossing the street
to take a look at that exhibit.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.650
So, please welcome Carol Tyler.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.000
Thank you.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.230
&gt;&gt; Carol Tyler: Thank you.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.690
Hello, everybody.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.060
And thanks for making
the trip out here

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.730
to the Madison Building today.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.690
It's nice to see everyone.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.120
This is such a beautiful
building.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.930
And I love libraries.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.850
I love the idea of being
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.280
I want to thank you so much

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.960
for inviting me to
be a part of this.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.230
It's terrific.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.510
So, yeah, we'll do
this PowerPoint now.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.910
[ Laughter ]

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.040
Okay, I've -- I'm going to try

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.830
to be relaxed, as
much as possible.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.130
I'm a little bit nervous.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.430
This is a biggy.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.730
The Library of Congress,

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.370
people have said whoo,
because it is a deal.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.320
Anyway, "Comics to a T."

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.880
So, as you heard
in the intro, yes,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.610
I am an autobiographical
cartoonist.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.550
And I've been doing this for
what, 40 something years, maybe.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.170
I don't know, sort of.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.200
I guess. I work with
my family members.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.890
This is my daughter,
up there on the left.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.300
You see her a lot in "Late
Bloomer," as a little tot.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.800
This is my husband Justin Green,
the author of "Binky Brown."

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.160
Miserable, over a cup
of coffee and life.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.490
And that's my core
family you see there.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.860
My original family.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.640
That would be my brother,
sister, my other little brother.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.350
Me, I'm in the middle.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.650
And my mom and dad.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.700
And I've spent most of my career
telling stories about this crew.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.850
One of the first stories
about the family was --

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.890
in fact, one of the
first stories I ever did,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.240
was this one called
"Uncovered Property."

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.860
And it features, mom, dad,
Jenna, Joe, Jimmy and dog,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.320
like I showed in
the picture before.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.800
Thank you for pointing this out.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.220
This story I did, "The
Hannah Story," which was

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:55.190
about my sisters'
accidental death in 1947.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.450
I did this in 1993.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.410
I think it was published in '94.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.310
And it was named as being

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.760
on the top 100 cartoonists
of the 20th century.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.280
I was very honored about that.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.580
It's not here in
your collection.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.780
You got to get a copy
of "The Job Thing."

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.670
It's everybody's favorite.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.640
This is where I have a
little problem though.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.400
Because I put the word
shitty on the cover.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.700
Stories about shitty jobs.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.330
Because at the time, I kept
saying, the jobs are shitty.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.130
What other word could
there possibly be?

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.590
But as I've kind of matured
and gone through life,

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.920
it's kind of difficult
to say, oh, no,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.320
I'm a distinguished cartoonist.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.400
And here's my book about
shitty jobs [brief laughter].

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.810
Just the wrong word.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.400
But I don't know how
else to describe it.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.460
But even in "The Job
Thing," which was

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.870
about these terrible jobs
I've had, that we've all had.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.440
The image you see, the cartoon
you see, is about my in-laws,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.270
at the time or they
weren't in-laws at the time,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.470
they were my first
set of in-laws.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.380
There's been many
[brief laughter].

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.310
Okay, this is -- I was in this
group called "Twisted Sisters,"

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.070
which was Aline and Diane

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.250
and there's Phoebe
Gloeckner in the middle.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.690
Aline Crumb, Diane Noomin.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.080
And that's me in the vest.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.790
I was wearing a vest because
until maybe the, maybe the turn

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.650
of the nine -- 20,
2,000, I never wore a bra.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.830
And so, I wanted to kind
of cover up a little bit.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.700
So, that's me in the vest with
a glass of wine, going oh,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.160
boy, I hope I'm covered.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.900
And that's that man cover.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.860
"Late Bloomer."

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:41.840
I wanted to do a collection
-- this was in like, 2005.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.520
I wanted to put together all
the stories that I had done

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.450
when I was -- "Late
Bloomer," is a collection

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.810
about all the stories I did
while I was raising Julia.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.990
And felt like it was coming
late because it was in the --

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.260
I was in my late
forties, early fifties.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.970
And this was Kim Thompson's
idea, at Fantagraphics.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.830
Let's call it "Late Bloomer."

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.080
So, that became the title.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.760
It's a collection of things like
"Anatomy of a New Mom," which is

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.200
on display over there.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.860
A page from "Migrant
Mother," where my kid is

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.540
out of control at an airport.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.150
And I had a bad infection
and oh.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.880
But one of the things I did here
is, I was really proud to try

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.000
to work panels in such a
way that it moved the eye

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.990
in a unique way,
around the page.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.670
We always read from upper
left to lower right.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.540
And I wanted to do this kind

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.460
of flow technique
with moving the eye.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.260
The same way that she was
running around the airport.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.010
Yeah, that's our family.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.490
That's me and Justin
and our kid, Julia.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.720
And this is in a story
called "The Outrage."

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.190
And I have me, as
a horrible entity.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.810
And he's an old armadillo.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.040
And our little kid is
going, ooh, stop it!

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.080
You know, kids try
to get in the middle.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.390
But I use animal personification
a lot in "Soldiers Heart."

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.740
Yeah, this is -- I'm not afraid
to say anything in comics.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.500
I never have been.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.230
And this is a panel
from "The Outrage."

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:25.330
Where I get -- I had this child
and I felt like she was just --

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.180
I hate to say it, but she was
just like, on me on the time.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.770
And I came to a point --

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.880
now they call it
postpartum psychosis.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.340
But at the time, nobody
was talking about this.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.640
So, I did.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.940
And I wrote it in this.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.740
I wrote about how I saw
these knives on the table.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.910
I got freaked out and threw
them out and threw them

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.240
out the window, really.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.230
And tried to collect myself.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.530
So, this was very common.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.390
Many women have thanked me for
bringing this to the attention.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.920
This was before what's
her name did.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.560
I did this in print.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.690
Here's my new book "Fab4 Mania."

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.420
Whoo! So, much fun!

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.700
Oh, gosh, we'll talk
about that later.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.030
But first, I do want to talk
about "Soldier's Heart."

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:16.560
Because it is the book that took
most of my cartooning career.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.480
And it took me ten
years to do this book.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.660
It began as three
separate books.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.020
A lot of people think that
"Soldier's Heart," down here,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.720
which is "You'll Never
Know," book three,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.130
is the "Soldier's Heart" here.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.600
But it's not -- this was Gary
Groth trying to make sure

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.180
that the title of the book had
the right -- for new audience.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.590
So, "You'll Never Know."

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.880
The title comes from my parent's
sweetheart song, when they meet.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.940
And there's also
other references

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.070
to not knowing what the heck
was going on with my dad

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.450
and my parents in their lives.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.800
And as children, we
always look to our parents.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.200
And they're so big and awesome.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.700
And I always had questions about
what was going on with them.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.240
The first book had a wood cover.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.930
Because I really wanted to focus
on my dad's building trades

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.690
and his workshop stuff.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.290
The second one is more
about the collateral damage

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.630
or the difficulty it took on my
mom and the rest of the family.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.580
That's why it has the
least kind of background.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.500
And then granite, because there
was so much of book three,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.840
where we come to D.C.
And there's so much

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.800
about the story that's
written in stone.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.600
So, it started like this, where
one day I picked up the phone

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.430
and all I heard was
"rivers of blood!"

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.050
I was, like, Dad, what?

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.350
Huh, what?

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.300
Because at that time, my dad
never really communicated well.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.780
In fact, my whole life,
he just wasn't much

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.980
of a -- we weren't close.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.280
He was there.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.580
He did his job.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.880
He was a great.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.090
"Give me a kiss, yeah, give me
a kiss right here, yeah, okay."

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:57.530
But he was not a smooth dude.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.710
He'd never say, "Come here
and tell me about your day"

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.010
or anything like that.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:08.340
And my mom had a stroke and
he had nobody to talk to.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.640
So, he called me
up and said this.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.110
So, I right away grabbed a
notebook and started writing

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.410
down everything he said.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.220
"Citations, North Africa,"
and all this kind of stuff.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.130
I didn't know what this meant.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.610
Because my knowledge about --
I knew he was in World War Two.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.960
I knew about the medals
or that there was some --

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.870
I didn't know any of that
stuff that you see there.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.500
Patches, I didn't know
what any of that meant.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.860
Now I know, of course,
because I researched.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.690
And he had a photograph album.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.990
And all the pictures in there
were pretty much fun, funny.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.430
I've had a lot of
people tell me that.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.940
That they get the funny,
fun stories from their dads

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.690
or grandfathers, about the war.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:56.700
When in truth, he was
pretty raging angry.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.190
And most of the time,
especially when he got older.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.090
And the older he got and the --

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.760
especially towards the end of
his life, he got more and more

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.960
into these fits of rage.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.140
That in this panel,
the panel before this,

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.440
my mother is terrified.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.350
Because he's tearing
the house apart.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.590
And she calls me up
and says, "Oh, come --

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.830
come over, he's going
crazy, he's going mad."

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.380
And he gave me the book --

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.360
I had asked him if I
could please borrow

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.600
that booklet of photographs.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.900
And he forgot he
gave them to me.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.200
And he thought I stole them.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.260
So, he was tearing the house
apart looking for them.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.370
And I knew I couldn't
tell a story about dad,

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.210
without telling a
story about mom.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:41.100
Julia, our child, Justin and I's
child, there's Justin and dad.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.160
And if you -- and me.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.070
If you look at the
photograph here,

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.400
look at the look on his face.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.170
Because I had just
given him the "365 Days

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.410
of World War Two" book.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.100
And he -- that photograph
says it all.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.930
This was the hardest thing
for him to have to deal with.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.770
It was going to take
a lot of driving,

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.610
along with note collecting
and phone calls.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.730
That was my little
driving companion, Baby.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.800
And they lived on the
other side of Indiana.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.910
And I show their house,
like you see there.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.890
I lived, at that time,
in Oakley in Cincinnati.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.290
And I show the building
like this.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.600
And this is kind of a map
of the state of Indiana.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.800
Cincinnati is right
close to the state line.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.340
And they lived on the other
state line, towards Illinois.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.390
And so, I-74 and
I-70, were my buddies.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.800
And I just drove up
and down that road.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.450
It was a four-hour
drive back and forth.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:45.270
And often had to go, at
various times, without notice.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.210
But I usually went every
ten days, two weeks,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.380
maybe about twice a month, to
see them, for about ten years.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.240
And trying to get
this stuff together.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.690
There's my house, where I ended
up moving to in Cincinnati.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.140
And there's a drawing of
my neighborhood, my street.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.970
There's always football
playing going on.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.990
I ripped out my lawn
because I didn't want to mow

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.550
and planted all that
[brief laughter].

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.000
Oh, that's my studio up there.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.460
You see where the
American flag is.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.600
And there's -- it's
a two family.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.240
And I did the whole book
up just by those windows.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.870
So, let's get started.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.170
Writing comes first.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.780
When you do a big
story of any kind,

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.080
of course, you get your idea.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.290
And some of them come in
the middle of the night.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:35.060
And some of them you map out
in -- and I use anything.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.510
Yellow pages, backs
of envelopes,

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.810
anything I could find.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.110
I did a lot of research.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.410
I had to read books.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.060
And learned to read
these World War Two maps.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.540
I learned all this
information about what --

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.420
these campaigns and generals

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.690
and official duty
booklets and everything.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.990
Oh, gosh, this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:03.330
I have at least ten stacks
of just the note taking.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.200
Just papers that
overwhelm the box.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.850
And that's just the notes.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.060
And then there's little
artifacts like that sheet music

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:15.910
that has the music to my parents
love song, "You'll Never Know."

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.570
There was so many layout
challenges to this book.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:26.630
Because I am a person that can't
-- I have -- I'd be a good DJ.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:33.700
I don't like repeating,
formats, songs, anything.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.150
So, I had to change it up.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.470
I feel like I have to
change it up all the time.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.660
And at one point I had it
out on adding machine tape.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.330
I thought, well, I'll try it.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.630
I wrote on the wall.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.930
I don't have any pictures
of the wall because its

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.230
since been painted over.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.720
But I would write on the
wall, some of these things.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.100
And then I got into having
these big sheets of paper.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.400
And I'd list everything out.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.100
And then I'd go in
with a red pen and pick

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.700
out the things I
thought were important.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.290
And then I connected
pages together.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.600
This isn't trying
to figure out --

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.280
because I knew some
of the story.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.780
I knew the outcome.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.080
I knew where I wanted --

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.790
sorry, where I wanted
to go with this story.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.700
And I knew a lot of stuff.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:17.750
It was organizing and getting
all the ducks in a row.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.050
Post-it-Notes.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.350
Sometimes they're helpful.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.650
Yeah, I used those.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.940
I did anything I could, to
try and pull this together.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.980
This is a big giant
sheet of some kind

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.080
of -- it's about this big.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.430
And I just drew the double
spread of all the pages.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.330
And that mark through,
it means accomplished.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:43.280
And in this one, you'll see,
like, orange Post-it-Notes

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.940
and yellow Post-it-Notes.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.170
It was something like,
maybe orange meant --

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.000
you know how in the book I
have just the military part.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.570
I talk about just his story.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.340
Him telling me, "And
then we went up over here

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.690
and I got a casa in Italy."

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.010
So, whenever it's just him
telling a military story,

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.310
that was orange.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.260
And then I think the pink down
here might have been kid crisis.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.190
And then I had -- because
you have to understand,

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.660
I was telling mom and dad's
story from World War Two.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.570
I was telling dad's
story from World War Two.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.590
I was telling my parents
story now, as elderly people.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.360
I was also talking about how
that folded into my life now.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.940
So, I had my kid now.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.010
At the time, she was 12, 13.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.640
My older parents now.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.320
But then me as a kid,
my parents as a kid.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.310
So, we're talking about
really looking back

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.200
at all of these decades.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.270
Trying to juggle that
and seamlessly pull it

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.870
through because of the
story that I wanted to tell.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.310
Eventually, yeah,
great, I got this table

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.670
and just gridded it off.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.040
And put it all -- I
think this is book two.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.570
I don't know why there's
an adding machine there

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.600
because [brief laughter]
I don't know.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.040
But on the wall in the
background, is the configuration

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.070
of why a dog wags their
tail, the way it does.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.510
The other day I was
looking at that.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.810
It's, like, what is that?

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.480
Oh, yeah, this means, I'm
really happy or something.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.780
The book took over my life.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.080
It took over my house.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.320
Kim Thompson, insisted
that we work with some sort

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.000
of clarity, you need to know.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.900
Because the whole
book, I would do it.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.200
I would scan it.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.950
And would send it through the
mail or I mean, through the --

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.620
some kind of server thing,
to -- over the internet.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.870
So, I never -- in the old
days, you would do artwork,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.100
like some of the early
work you see over there.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.450
I would do artwork and
then you'd box it up,

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.690
tape it up, take it to FedEx.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.570
Ship it and then
they'd receive it.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.180
So, I never once walked

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.690
into Fantagraphics
graphics department.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.430
It was all done by spreadsheet.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.600
And file names and file numbers.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.030
And I forgot to put
numbers in those three,

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.330
"You'll Never Know," books.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.320
But I did put numbers in
"The Soldier's Heart."

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.520
But this is all a
configuration of that.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.110
All right.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.010
You start drawing with a pencil.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.060
I got one in my hair
right here today.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.600
I use a yellow number
one, Ticonderoga.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.420
And a good old pencil sharpener.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:22.350
I work on Strathmore,
500 series plate paper.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.260
The draw -- the work
starts like that.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.280
And ends up looking like that.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.240
Let's have an ink party!

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:41.370
Whoo! Because I mixed, custom
mixed, the colors I would need.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.000
You see magic 50 is, blood.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.080
I think there's tank, underline
color, my mom's hair, redhead.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.210
You know, different -- any
color I needed, I custom mixed.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.450
In fact, I had 53 colors
that I worked with.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.010
And made a chart.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.320
So, like, oh, I need, mom's
hair, okay, that's going

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.620
to be -- and I'd
look at the chart.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.970
And I'd know which one of those
little containers would have the

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.210
color I was looking for.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.950
Kind of bonkers.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.830
And I drew everything
with these two vehicles,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.990
the pen and this brush.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.100
The brush made the whole
-- made the distance.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.460
The whole book, I did
with the one brush.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.890
It's a Windsor Newton
series seven-one.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:33.540
And the pen points
are 788 Esterbrook.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.510
I was so terrified -- oh,
all those pens you see

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.850
over there, ignore them.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.740
Some of them have application,
but mostly I did those.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.860
But I was so terrified I was
going to run out of pen points,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.750
that I cornered the market on
eBay of 788's [brief laughter].

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.050
So, I own them all.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.860
If you have them, they're mine.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:58.220
I bought boxes and boxes of
them because I was so afraid.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.790
This is one of the
first drawings I did.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:05.460
And I was so nervous about how
it was going to look, you know,

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.760
how I was going to do this.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.470
And I thought, well, what you do
when you do any kind of story,

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.770
is you start with what you know.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.580
And you start with
what you want to do.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.240
And I really liked
drawing objects and stuff.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.870
So, this was my dad's
collection of toxic materials.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.300
That in the book, I talk

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.470
about he's having --
he's getting chemo.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.030
And I tell the lady,
you should of just,

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.730
you know, this is Mr. Toxic.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.170
And I tell this story
about how he had all

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.400
of these horrible,
horrible things.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.410
And I -- they were
going to be moving.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.910
And I said, "Dad, you can't take
this stuff to the new place.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.210
Come on, this is stupid.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.980
You're not going to
be taking benzene

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.510
and lead and all this stuff."

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.810
"Oh, it's my stuff!

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.110
Keep your hands the
hell away from it!"

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.750
And I said, "No, you're not
-- I'm not going to allow it.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.050
You're not taking it."

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.050
So, I put it all in the
back of his Cadillac

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.270
that he started with
a screwdriver.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:00.110
And ran it to the toxic place.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.900
And they were like, "Oh, yeah,
lady, just put it over there."

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.440
Okay. So, then I went
home, it's in the book.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.090
I ran back and was like,
oh, wait, I forgot,

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.850
there's a couple -- there's
one more with something

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.290
that was oozing out
on the sides.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.160
You know, eating
through the canister.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.700
So, I thought, I'll
just run this back

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.800
to the toxic place and the dump.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.670
I go back there and
they went, "Oh, yeah,

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.670
you need to go down here.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.490
And then when you get way
to the back of the yard,

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.260
you take a left and
there's three buildings.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.380
It's the last final building
and it's back in the corner."

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.310
And I went, oh, okay.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.400
So, there's -- these
buildings are empty, right?

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.020
And this is at some
of kind of dump.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.750
And I drive all the way back.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.370
And I go all the way back there.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.240
And there, in this huge
big warehouse building,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.230
in the corner, is this
little pile of stuff

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.310
with caution tape all around it.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.660
Like, stay back,
don't come near it.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.200
It was like, it made
me sadder then anything

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.630
to see it that way.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:02.430
The other challenge was, how
am I going to draw these people

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.790
that I know what they look like.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.560
But I also have an image
of them in my minds eye.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.160
So, I had to tell
everybody to get over it.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.910
These may not -- people may
not look like you exactly.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.910
Don't hold me to
account on that.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.060
It was so complicated, I
had to make custom furniture

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.880
to accommodate the
pages and steps

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.180
that I'd have to
take in between.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.130
It looks like a wreck
because it is.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.720
But I made tilt up tables.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.130
I made, you know, a
saw, I got those skills.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.420
Just plywood, trying to
think of what I needed.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.720
Build shelves for things

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.160
like fake army men
and stuff like that.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.670
So, I also want to --
this is funny on the wall.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.800
At the time, I thought, I
need some guiding principles.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.270
So, my mom, with her stroke,
was able to bang out, "Carol,

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.740
you'll ever know that
I love you, mom."

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.950
Because she knew the book was
called "You'll Never Know."

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.880
But see how it always
kind of stuck to the right

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.180
because of her stroke.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.570
And my theory was, oh, you know,

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.500
I need family support,
plant-based diet.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.020
Exercise and all this
stuff, good sleep.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.730
My dad's theories are smoke,
drink, do everything wrong.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.030
Hope you're forgiven.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.830
Forget about it.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:21.150
[ Laughter ]

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.500
So, here's some of the
layout configurations.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.130
To tell dad's -- dad and mom's
story, I went to this kind

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.490
of office supply
look from the 40s.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.820
I noticed that all the
paper had this kind

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.200
of double black and
red line thing.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.350
And I got some stamps
to do the numbers.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.360
And then I would do four across.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.280
And this is the fourplex.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.210
And since it's "Kid Crisis,"
the -- it's in black and white.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.170
And everything is
outlined in red.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:58.340
Six packs, I made a lot of books
that has a lot of six packs.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.990
It's not just random
crazy stuff.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:01.480
I got an order here.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.510
A six pack means there
are six panels on a page.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.720
And if I'm looking back, I
often did the wavy line, like,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.710
from the old photograph
technique.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.100
Or sometimes I would put a
strip between the panels.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.070
Or sometimes I would actually
put the quarter inch gutter

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.480
between the panels,
margins, sorry.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.300
This is a variation on a 12.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.000
So, one and two are together.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.910
This is about a trip to the
archives in Saint Louis.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.690
And they wouldn't let my dad in.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.080
They wouldn't let my mom
in, to see his own records.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.480
I had to go through
Freedom of Information Act.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.780
It was crazy.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.080
You can read about
it in the book.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.110
But this is 12th.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.550
This is a variation on the
four, where what I wanted

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.400
to do was show me
talking to them.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.070
And I put them in color and I'm
over here in black and white.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.570
Because I had just come
out of a kid crisis thing.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.130
And down the middle
is the destination.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.000
I was asking dad to
come to the memorial.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.300
And he's like, "What?

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.600
I don't want to go there."

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.120
And I said, "Yes, you do.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.480
Come on, I got a personal
invitation here from Tom Hanks."

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.780
He said, "Who's Tom Hanks?"

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.840
And my mom is, with her
stroke, she's thinking,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.220
"Hanks, a star, let me think.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.140
Private. Private something."

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.070
I'm like, "Oh, no, he's
that silver screen dude."

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.370
Okay, here's Hanks.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.160
"Please join me in
honoring the achievements

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.020
of our greatest generation,
which includes you, Charlie."

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.800
My moms thinking, "Ryan?"

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.370
"Form letter."

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.320
"Okay, form letter or
not, we're going dad."

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.270
"Connotation and archivist."

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.690
And like that marine said,

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.570
"It will take us a while,
but we're doing this.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.870
Are you in?"

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.170
"Yes," he said, "I guess so."

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.070
And so, you see the memorial,
the stars, Tom Hanks and part

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.260
of the memorial features there.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.920
And then my mom,
it comes to her.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.720
"Saving Ryan Seacrest."

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.050
[ Laughter ]

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.580
I always have surprises for
you readers, in all of my work.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.360
You just have to
read it closely.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.490
Sometimes I would
do full page panels.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:11.290
For some reason, there's
something missing.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.170
But had the pencil
drawing behind it.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.500
God, I hope this
is not a problem.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.900
But here we are at
the National Archives

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:24.460
out in College Park,
doing some research.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.760
Came up bust.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:33.480
And this is the drawing
about how it goes from pencil

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.920
to ink, from the left side.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.940
Pencil to ink on the right side.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.220
And then the double
spread of both of them.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.530
And what I wanted to show
here was the feeling you get

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.530
when you walk into the
World War Two Memorial.

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.710
You get this -- you kind
of walk down in there.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.470
But then you get this uplifting,
especially when you walk

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.160
into the two sides,
Atlantic, Pacific.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.510
And I wanted to pull those
beautiful elements that are

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.180
up in the building structure.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:05.060
I wanted to pull them
up into the space.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:10.240
So -- and that's how -- I
was just like, oh, my God.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.150
It just so moving.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.780
And for dad, too.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:20.130
I took a lot of pictures, when
we were here and used them.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.960
And you can see his
hat there, him looking.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.260
That's all I had.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.810
But I had to construct
the drawing, you know,

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.470
kind of in a different way,
using a photographic reference.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.420
I also knew in the back
of the book I wanted

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.280
to have a lady swinging a kid.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.400
So, I random found a lady
and asked her permission

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.970
and used that for that.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.240
This was a made up -- you
know, when you're in Indiana

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.700
and it's bleak and
it's Christmas time,

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.000
there's nothing on the roads.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.700
But these -- I call
them "Prairie pop ups,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.600
that anchor freeway offramps,
like rivets on dungarees."

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:06.030
And then it was funny because
I went to Kroger, not too long

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.880
after and it was like, oh, I
drew that out of my imagination.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.620
Sometimes I just make shit up.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.920
Sorry for the cussing.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.370
But I was trying to
convey that everybody

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:21.670
that I was highlighting
in the book,

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:25.730
the five of us all had
issues going on in the mind.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.770
I wanted to talk about that.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:34.750
And this is a page where before
texting or whatever that is,

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.050
talking, bloop, bloop.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.840
I was trying to show --
I drew this before then.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.090
I was trying to show a
conversation that my mom

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.690
and my sister and I were
having about the time

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.760
that dad's Cadillac caught on
fire on the way back from chemo.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.530
And so, I have anything
that she says,

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.390
with her green headband,
in green.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.690
My mom's is in red.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:55.990
And mine's in blue.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.820
And we're trying to weave
together the details

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.830
of what happened and who was
where and what was going on.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:06.600
And this is another example
of trying to keep everybody --

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.470
keep the action flowing.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.310
You go from left to
right, in the first.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.610
And then it goes down and you go

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.540
across back the page
backwards the other way.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.480
And then it comes back through
and you go through here.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.720
Because I wanted
to show the action

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.870
of driving across the country.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.750
Or driving across
the state of Indiana.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.600
Now this one is very
interesting.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:33.180
Because there's a panel that
starts here and, of course,

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.340
it ends at the bottom right.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.780
But what I wanted
to do, was to spell

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.080
out the thesis of the book.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.000
This was the infamous page five.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.760
I was laying out the
book, I was like,

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.330
I don't know what I'm
going to do with page five.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.240
I had something that
lead up to it.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.620
And everything else behind it.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.810
And page five just stuck,
stuck, stuck, stuck.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.860
One morning I woke up and I
went, I got it, page five.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.160
Start at the bottom.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.150
Dad gets the plywood and
he puts it in the truck.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.210
And then he's going to drive
up through the landscape.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:04.120
You see? He drives past
a sign that says, "not."

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.810
It's up there, Arby's
sign, "not."

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.050
And then there's a tire
store that says "all."

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.670
And you see "scars,"
the cars have letters

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.480
on the top of them, "scars."

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.780
"Not all scars."

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.470
The cow says, "are" urgh.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.900
And then in the sky it
spells out "visible."

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.190
"Not all scars are visible."

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.950
Which was the post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:31.780
Otherwise known as shell shock,
for World War Two Veterans.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:37.710
And some pages, I just
had to build impact.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:42.390
This is the most stunning
statistic I came across.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.040
Was that if you take the
60 million people that died

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.610
in World War Two and
you break that down,

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:50.550
that's 25,462 people a day.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.320
Now, can you imagine the
24-hour news cycle dealing

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.620
with that today?

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:00.970
Every day for six years.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.340
Trouble. And I'm going
to apologize in advance

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.130
because this part makes me cry.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:14.010
But I will go on.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:19.220
So, my companion, throughout
the whole book, Baby.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.900
One day, she was like this.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.660
And I realized that I
had to put her down.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:34.840
And this was at the same time
that it turned out that mom,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:40.480
at 93, was diagnosed
with lung cancer.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.530
A good long life, but
still mom, you know.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.840
So, now, it changed that -- I
didn't have the book done yet.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.330
So, it changed that
I would be caregiving

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.630
at a four-hour distance.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.440
Along with teaching.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.860
Along with trying to
get the book done.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.230
Mom had a contribution
in the book.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.420
I made her, because she's
the original art person.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.270
I mean, gosh, where do
you get things from?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.690
She -- I made her sit down
and gave her some color.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.250
And she -- and I said, "You
got to draw this page, mom.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.550
It's got to be in the book."

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.940
She's like, "No.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.280
Why do you have to reveal so
much about our personal lives?

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.360
It's nobody's business."

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.660
It's, like, kind of too late
for that, is what I told her.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.460
So, she made this drawing,
"Out of War Came My Children."

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.760
And she drew this.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.290
And you can see it goes off to
the right because of her stroke.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:36.780
But the four -- her four living
children are on the right side.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.050
And then the one who passed
away, Hannah, that I told you

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.350
about from "The Hannah Story."

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.200
She's on the left
with tears coming out.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.790
She said, "They're not flowers,
they're stars in bloom."

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.650
See, they were married in 1943.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.320
And then she has that -- she
says, "That's the fog of war,"

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.690
that splotch below the flowers.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.350
Flowers, I mean stars.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:03.460
The trouble with doing family
stories, is they die on you.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.490
And you have to come back to
the studio and finish the job.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.650
So, this particular panel,
that's in "Soldier's Heart,"

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.950
I wrote a date underneath it.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:17.300
Because she passed
away on 2-4-2012.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.220
And I depicted here
as a manatee.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.040
My sister, who was
my stalwart helper

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.510
and fun friend my whole
life, who did all my editing.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.250
Always calling me
out for bullshit.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.420
Although, she was a former nun.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.180
She never used that word.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.480
She thought I cussed too much.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:46.790
I had to -- I got this call,
come here, something's wrong.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.150
So, I went over there and they
put her in the operating room.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.290
They found stage
four ovarian cancer.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.570
This is before my
mom passed away.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.490
But my sister was also
caregiving her daughter

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.970
with autism and her
husband with Alzheimer's.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.370
And there's Justin there.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.000
We would -- I had
lots of flowers.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.090
Like I said, I ripped out my
lawn and grew roses and stuff.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.850
And I was taking flowers
everywhere I went.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.940
Now, it started to be
I'd take my art pages

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.340
and I'd take these flowers
to scenes like you see here.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.100
And everywhere I
went, people were laid

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.970
out in recliners, sick.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:32.390
And I'd have to run these pages
back and forth from my house.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.740
I did these pages for
"Soldier's Heart,"

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.980
in lobbies, waiting rooms.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.280
There's elevators.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.580
I got -- I finally figured out
what the elevator buttons mean,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.550
as I rode them so much.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.630
Every -- anywhere, hospital
-- doctors offices, anyplace.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.110
I was just dragging
my pages along.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.750
Those little tray
table things on --

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.380
by the table, are
really good for drawing.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.620
I just come in, hey,
mom, how you doing.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.690
And just clear it
off and set the pages

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.780
out and just draw away.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:07.520
And then I got this
e-mail from Kim Thompson.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.750
He's my editor and
publisher of these books.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.910
So, it's like, oh, gosh.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:21.030
In the meanwhile, at home,
my daughter had some sort

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:24.400
of goofy -- oh, it was horrible.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.130
Had to have surgery
on her sinuses

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.980
and her -- everything was bad.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.310
Her boyfriend was
a heroin addict.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:32.610
He was sweet, though.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:33.910
I mean, we liked him.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:35.210
He was living with us.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.570
But I'd come home and the
house would look like this.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.170
So, I'd be caregiving over here,
running up and down the freeway.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.470
I'd come home and
there would be --

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.080
look at the mayonnaise
splotch on the table.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.000
Just everything was
always chaotic, gross.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.180
Look, I'd have to
-- I'd have to board

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.760
up the windows in the basement.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.960
Because guys that
he owed money to,

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.260
were trying to break
in all the time.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.580
Or he'd pawn my stuff.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.950
So, I was taking
pictures of everything,

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.190
before I'd go anywhere.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.260
This is just the
nonsense that was going

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.560
on in the neighborhood.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.220
There'd be all this noise and
turmoil and crap going on.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.010
I'd see needles everywhere.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.670
But my life was, either
school, at home trying

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.970
to clean up that mess.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.800
Or get on the freeway,
take my pages.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.180
I'd go take care of the people,
in conditions like this, often.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:26.490
Or how about coming to school,
starting another semester

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.140
and they said, oh, we don't
have a classroom for you.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.680
How am I supposed to teach?

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.920
Well, okay, I'll go down
and I got the janitor

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.220
to help me find some tables.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.070
I had a pop-up classroom
in the hallway.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.660
I had to teach in the hallway.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.970
And hide the stuff every
time and drag it back out.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.510
This is me.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.610
I broke out in this
virus, all over my body.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:54.910
I couldn't move.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.210
I was in bed.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.510
I couldn't move.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.810
I couldn't lift up
my feet, nothing.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.110
Some kind of strange thing.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.410
Thirty days of fever.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.710
I had a fever every single day.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.880
And all through this, I'm
writing this book about my dad.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.910
And he turned.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.640
In my -- in his mind,
I was the enemy.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.240
He accused me of
stealing his money

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.540
and all this kind of stuff.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.840
I'd come in the house,
"What do you want now?"

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.410
I mean, he was terrible.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.020
But I stayed the
course with Chuck.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:23.280
I just kind of put
up my Spartan shield.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.320
And while I'd be making soup
and serving it to somebody else.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.710
I was pretty much a wreck.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.410
My sister thought
I looked good here.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.530
I said, I don't feel good.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.470
But I wasn't going to
say anything to her.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.650
I could absolutely relate to
this guy [brief laughter].

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:46.340
But sometimes I'd come home

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.940
and there's be a deer
in my living room.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.920
That's the heroin
addict, God bless him.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.760
He was really cute.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.280
We really liked him.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.220
And then a cute new dog
showed up on the porch.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.010
It was, like, hey, yeah.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.750
And I was able to get my
mom and my sister together.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.930
To do this -- to get to this
moment, you have no idea.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:13.210
It involved me driving,
fending off my dad.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.510
Getting a truck.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.210
Getting mom out of her
nursing home, into this car

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.100
and taking her to the hospital.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:24.530
Ugh. My sister, bless her heart,
such an education stalwart.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:27.400
She had a PHD, despite
all of her troubles.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.470
And here was the day when,
just before she passed away,

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.640
they gave her an
Emeritus Status.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:38.510
And here -- and I'm
trying to give her my hair.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.810
I used it in an art show.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.310
I cut my hair off in solidarity.

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:48.010
So, yeah, she was on her death
bed and I had a deadline.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.390
Because I was doing work
for Cincinnati Magazine.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.940
And so, this is a story about
-- she used to love to swim.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.260
And she was a teacher.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.990
So, this is about me
teaching a kid to swim.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:02.250
And then when she passed away,
of course, I had a deadline.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.080
And before I went to the
funeral, I had to talk about --

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.610
I had to come up with
this month's installment.

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:11.350
So, this is about Rosemary
Clooney, at a park singing

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:13.020
"I'll Be Loving You, Always."

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:19.620
And dad, we knew he
was going to get going.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.920
And I knew that "Soldier's
Heart,"

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.220
that big fat book
was coming out.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.500
So, I had him do
signature cards.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.800
And by the way, Georgia,

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.100
I have a signature
card for the library.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.470
Dad's last Christmas.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.780
He didn't realize it
was his last Christmas.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.080
I knew that.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.380
So, kind of lonely.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.680
Everybody was gone.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.810
So, I said, "Hey, why don't
we write down all the people

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.940
from moms, that you
can remember,

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.430
from moms address book,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.970
your Christmas card
list, on these papers."

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.430
And so, we made this chain.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:55.080
And so, he was writing
down everybody's name,

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.380
that he could remember.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.870
And then I went to the funeral
on Tuesday, his funeral.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:08.460
And I got back, I think it
was Tuesday or Wednesday.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.070
I got an e-mail from
Fantagraphics, "Oh,

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.590
we need the artwork
drawing for your dads --

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.490
for the cover, by Friday.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.980
So, after all of this, okay,
I had to sit down and knock

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.250
out a portrait of dad.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:27.050
I had just put him
in the ground.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:29.900
It really does take a toll,
doing this kind of work.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.200
It's really hard.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.630
This is the hardest
to talk about.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.430
Because when I did
this, this is from

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.750
"The Hannah Story,"
I told you about.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:41.460
It got to me that my sister had
this terrible burn accident.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.860
And so, I was leaning
over the drawing, crying.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.290
And the drops were falling.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.900
I wanted to use red
ink, you know,

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.180
to show the lines,
I made these lines.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.560
But it was -- I was
dropping tears on the page.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.630
So, I took a tissue
and I was dabbing it.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.700
And it made that smear
technique that you see there.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.450
It's from me crying.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.750
No wonder I did the
Beatles book.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.830
Oh, it was time, it was time.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.320
My new book is about
mourning, though.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.380
It's about all this stuff
I've been telling you about.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.650
Losing everybody, living
with a heroin addict.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.640
Everything that entails,
the impact it had

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.600
on my life it's called
the "Ephemerata."

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.410
And I began, right after mom
died, with kind of for me,

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:28.480
traditional page
art, making grids.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.950
And this is -- I've got a
bunch of these little booklets

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.180
that I get at thrift
stores and stuff.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.480
Nonsense books.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.200
You probably have one in
your Library of Congress.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.720
"Hex Signs and Barn
Decorations."

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.210
But I'm asking probing
questions about death.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.950
And I call it a "Book Report."

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:49.130
But I've also been gravitating
towards just art with words

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.100
on it, trying to free myself.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.650
You have to understand,
ten years of making --

00:44:54.650 --> 00:45:00.320
using 53 colors, is
very limiting and tough.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:05.560
And so, this when my
sister was just at the end.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.310
It says, "These are the
only thoughts I have."

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.580
And I have the grim
reaper carrying her off.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.070
But still, I'm wondering
down here,

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.200
if this is a legitimate drawing,

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.720
is it legitimate
for me to do this?

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.290
Maybe I should make
a table or something.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:20.950
Something more purposeful,
make furniture.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:22.250
I'm very hard on myself.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.650
And I also tell my
students, and this is true.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.320
When you can't do anything else

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.680
in your life, do
a self-portrait.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.430
At least your pencil's working.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:36.820
And you know that what's going
on with that head of yours.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.560
So, I started doing --
exploring this new thing.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:46.680
Like, all these objects
and mourning and deaths.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.220
This is my great
grandmothers mourning bonnet.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.740
She tended to both Union

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.890
and Confederate soldiers,
during the Civil War.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.730
She was -- they called
her the "doctor."

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.000
That's -- I have
her mourning bonnet.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.970
And in this sequence, it comes
on me and knocks me down.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.470
So much that I have to process.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:16.770
I almost can't function.

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.310
There's days where I just can't.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.330
Because I've got
mom and dad's stuff.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.630
I got my sisters stuff.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:23.930
I got my own stuff.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:25.930
My best friend down the
street, Rose, she passed away.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.500
I got a bunch of her stuff.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.470
My brother-in-law.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.440
Sometimes I just sit there.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.560
Hey, there's dad's army uniform.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.750
There's Jimmy's bike, when
he was seven years old.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:44.290
And this has become
kind of an expression

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:46.750
of how I feel right now.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.980
I'm holding the impossible
Trident.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.970
And there's pain.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.490
I'm kind of focused on that,
but yet, I'm lost in it,

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:02.440
in this weird landscape.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.740
And this -- you know,
that Grant Wood painting,

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.660
"Woman with Plants."

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.970
And she's holding plants.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.300
There's nothing coming
out of that flower pot.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:21.590
I've been making
sculptures out of thorns

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.680
because I have thorn
trees on my property.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.220
And doing stories on saw blades.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.760
Using some of dad's old
saw blades tell us --

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.550
and then this is
from this exhibit.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.090
I'm going to show you and
we're going to watch it.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.390
I'm going to show you
a link in a minute.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:40.130
But these stumps represent
all the people I lost

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:43.090
in a three-year period.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:46.750
These were close to me.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.010
So, finally I got mom settled.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.310
She wanted to be
near a young tree.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:02.030
And that's my sister,
in the basket.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:06.250
I was able to help her
with her final wishes.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.010
Which was to be -- she was
in the convent years ago.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.070
She died -- she went back
to the convent at the end

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.090
of her life, as an associate.

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:18.020
And so, I -- my brothers
and I, distributed her ashes

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.460
at the sister's cemetery.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:26.130
I got my dad buried.

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:29.800
And in the coffin with him,
are some tools, a pipe.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.250
And that chain of
all his friends.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.970
I put that in there at the end.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.710
This past June, I went
back to visit his grave.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:50.960
And make sure they had
the Veteran, his stone.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.870
And there it was.

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.520
And as I was walking
up, I thought, oh, no,

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.830
I have nothing to give.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.130
I have nothing to bring.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:03.690
You know, whether it be a shot
of whiskey or some flowers.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:07.480
But I realized I
had a pencil, right?

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:13.030
So, I wrote on the
stone, I wrote --

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.880
I did some of the
drawings from the book.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.520
And made a little
American flag for him.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.200
And I love you.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.500
Miss you, dad.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:27.290
And that's his flag flying.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.440
I was able to get a
house in Kentucky,

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:40.440
a farm with money he got from
being a disabled Veteran.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.930
Because the Cincinnati
Zoo is buying my house,

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.850
so I have to move.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:50.060
And so, I had to get this
other place to get started on.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.360
So, I got this farm house.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.050
And there's his flag.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.610
And my little companion, Tue.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:57.970
I call her Tue, T-u-e.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:01.040
We're having -- she's
wearing a fascinator.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.330
And we're having tea
at the royal wedding.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.040
But bless her heart,
she had just gotten hit

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.560
by a car a week before.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:12.860
And as she was laying in
the street, when I saw her,

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.160
I thought, oh, God, she's gone.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.060
I went up to her
and I said, "Tue."

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.010
And she raised her head up and
said, "If you can just get me

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:24.140
to an emergency vet, I promise
I will stay the course with you.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.020
Because you've lost
too many people."

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:32.510
And then there's farmer Jones
Justin there, with the truck

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.500
that we did all the
driving with.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:39.150
And Saint Francis in the
garden, from my parents.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.750
And they've always
had that yellow thing

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:45.870
that flops around in the wind.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:49.060
And the farmhouse, which
I actually had visions of,

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.960
during my period of mourning.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.240
I imagined a space where I could
do this work the "Ephemerata."

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.860
And this is the room that
I'll be doing this in.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.010
I've already started.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:04.290
So, now, I want to
show this video.

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:08.510
This is my art show that I had
with all the pages of the book.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:19.610
[ Music ]

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.250
&gt;&gt; I feel this is one
of the best exhibits

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.340
that the Meyer Gallery
has really had.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.510
And I've come here for years.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:34.630
[ Music ]

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:35.930
It's creative, it's innovative.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:37.230
It uses the space well.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:40.510
You want to stay and
you want to read.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:47.760
[ Music ]

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.520
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's
wonderful in a variety of ways.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.380
But mainly because, you
know, I'm a book person.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.370
So, it's really unusual

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:58.510
to see an entire book
laid out like this.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:04.150
[ Music ]

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:07.270
&gt;&gt; What I think about
this show is so beautiful,

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:12.460
is that Carol actually shows
every single page of the book

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.510
that she drew by hand
very meticulously.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:30.040
[ Music ]

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.170
&gt;&gt; I think the other thing
I really like about this,

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.730
is that the other,
the second room,

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.790
I love the way she's done the --

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.180
she's opened her
head to the world.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.030
Which is cleverly done
here with the doorway.

[ Music ]

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:50.000
&gt;&gt; It does kind of feel like
you're sort of coming into sort

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.510
of like a mind field with her,
with what she's doing here.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:57.040
[ Music ]

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.870
&gt;&gt; The interior acts
as her studio.

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:05.590
And it also acts as
her fathers' workshop.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:09.950
But kind of beyond that,
it really acts as her mind.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:11.370
And the things that
are in her mind

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.540
and preoccupy her
mind and her thoughts.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.540
And the things that
she's thinking about,

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:17.510
when she's generating her work.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:32.820
[ Music ]

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:36.250
&gt;&gt; It's so amazing, reading the
story and sort of the pathos

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.870
that she's been through.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.620
I mean, the books
kind of show that.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:43.230
But seeing it here with all
the 3D, you know, objects

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:46.670
and found things, really
kind of packs a punch.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:50.860
You know, I mean, kind of really
feel the grief and you know,

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.160
what she's been through.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.460
And what her families
been through.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.760
You know, especially,

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.170
particularly the handwritten
stuff on the walls here,

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:57.970
it's just, you know,
heartbreaking.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:04.390
[ Music ]

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:08.770
&gt;&gt; Another thing that I
admire, is that Carol worked

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:12.460
out her personal
experience with her family

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.330
and her father's history.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:21.330
By going through all of her
life's experiences with him.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:22.830
And documenting that.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:26.320
And working it through in
her own way, telling a story

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.400
about her dad and her
experience with her dad.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.900
Painting it all, drawing it
all and reporting it all.

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.510
And working it through.

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.890
So, to me, this is
like a poetry.

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:42.210
It is literature.

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:43.520
It is psychology.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.850
It is art.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.150
It is drawing.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:48.710
And for students, this
is wonderful to see,

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:54.360
that an artist can have such
a breadth of information.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.960
That with her own talent
of being able to write

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.470
and being able to
draw, work that out.

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:07.320
And I feel like that joy
that she had doing this book,

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.510
is expressed in this exhibit.
