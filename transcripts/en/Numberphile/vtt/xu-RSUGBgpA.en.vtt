00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
so here's three of only three of the

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.950
Platonic solids, the things you can make

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.080
out of equilateral triangles.  So here

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
I've got tetrahedron, four triangles, octahedron, eight triangles, and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.620
the icosahedron, 20 triangles, what's changing

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.980
as you go from here to here to here is

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.230
how many triangles there are around each

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.350
corner or on each vertex so the tetrahedron

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.359
right has three triangles around the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.660
corner and the octahedron has four and the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
icosahedron has five, what comes next

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.960
well, six triangles around a vertex do

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.090
you get a platonic solid that has six

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.550
triangles around a vertex? no no no what

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.450
do you get?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.219
alright so here's six, here's you know

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.840
there's one triangle, two, three, four, five,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.360
six, so six triangles around vertex that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.640
tiles the plane right it goes on forever

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.770
so it doesn't have any curve to it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.300
so here's a way to think about it so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.120
your triangle has 60 degrees at this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.750
corner and so like 60 plus 60 plus 60

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.340
those the three around here that adds up

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.600
180 which is well less than 360 so it's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.010
sort of curves and makes a cone shape

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.650
you do this with the octahedron you get

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.450
60 60 60 60 which is what 240? still less

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
than 30 60 with five of them you got 300

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.979
when you get 6 it adds up to 360 but

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.470
there's no there's no lack of space

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.360
there's no there's nothing missing so it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.530
doesn't make a comment just makes it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.290
flat 3 4 5 6

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.960
what happens if you put even if you try

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.150
and put seven triangles on each vertex?

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.420
actually you know what would be good to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.340
try drawing it.  I'm not going to be able

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.049
to make them all the equalateral but

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.909
let's see how far we can get. so I got to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.140
fit seven, so there's going to be one

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.840
here and then I got to fit three in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.240
here, so i got to do this and all right

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.220
so I fit seven around a vertex so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.780
let's keep going so I got to here

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.420
already so maybe I'll do that that's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.799
five six seven. 3 i gotta fit

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.899
for and here you can go for quite a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.670
while actually before you start running

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.149
into trouble 1234 you can speed this up

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.810
right?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.060
okay, one two three four, i got to fit three

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.800
in here you see it starts getting

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.819
difficult

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.290
there's too many of them

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.230
they don't really fit very nicely and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.030
you start... now I'm in real trouble look

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.590
at this one two three four I gotta fit

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.269
three in here

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.810
1234 in here so you can sort of see

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.359
that this is... well try it at home,

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.519
how far can you get drawing triangles

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.250
seven triangles on each vertex.  What if i

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.560
don't do it on paper what if i do it with 3d

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.769
printed stuff then you get this thing so

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.510
right well you can see there

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.620
1234567 triangles on each vertex you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.819
know the first thing you try and do you

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.250
try and lay it flat and it doesn't work.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.139
You can make bits of it be kind of

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.760
flat and there's some given the hinges

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.109
which sort of helps out but then it

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.150
bunches up somewhere else.  There's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.609
just no way to make it flat everywhere

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.349
it doesn't work.  right what's going on

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.120
right? these are sort of like they're

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.909
closed around this or like spheres right?

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.500
three four and five six is the flat

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.930
plane.  sphere, plane

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.510
what is this thing trying to be it

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.940
doesn't look like it's some nice surface

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.680
is just some horrible thing we don't

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.510
want seven years maybe it will be better

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.540
no it is not better right so this is a

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.340
eight equilateral triangles around each

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.310
vertex.  I mean you can count them

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.949
to like it is horribly crinkly a sort of

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
like it's like call was like lettuce.  so

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.650
these are positively curved things which

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.319
like a hill or Bowl sort of curves

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.239
towards you in all directions, whereas

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.190
like something that's flat it's not it's  coming at all or it can

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.319
curve in one direction but then the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.209
other direction is is flat right doesn't

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.470
does that make sense?

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.150
like its curved this way but it has to

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.739
be flat this where you can curve in both

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.359
directions so one of the directions

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.099
plants really just flat and these are

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.669
like it wants to be like a saddle. if you

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.010
imagine my hand is a horse right and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.720
like the hand is like awesome like your

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.150
legs go either side of here so so right

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.919
so what does that mean like sometimes

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.659
it's coming towards you, and sometimes

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.129
it's curving away from you, so when

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.019
you've got both of those that's negative

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.180
coach or negative gassing curvature so

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.349
what are these things these are sort of

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.019
like so these are models of hyperbolic

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.180
space in a way they're sort of too much

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.190
of it.  it doesn't want to fit in

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.350
ordinary euclidean space and kind of

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.330
wrinkles up and gets out of control

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.670
so these these ones here right you you

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.200
run out of triangles, right.  once you're

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.910
done with your 20 triangles on the icons

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.770
evening you're done this one I could

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.600
have kept going forever right is it's

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.950
like I could just keep trying this out

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.140
words and it was just you know for the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.720
table and go off around the world this

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.530
one

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.240
well so again i've only done like a

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.000
little bit of its it seems clear that I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.960
could keep going

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.700
I mean I tried doing it over here with

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.610
the pen but it was sort of you know it's

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.830
difficult but it seems like you know if

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.120
you allowed to sort of wrinkle them up

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.160
out of the plane and like make this sort

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.540
of wrinkly thing that I could just keep

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.240
going well you kind of might run into

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.710
trouble there's actually an open

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.020
question nobody knows the answer if you

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.820
keep adding these things

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.530
how far can you go out into space

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.180
without it crashing into itself

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.770
I mean for this physical thing there's a

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.930
definite limit and and here's here's the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.210
argument right so as you sort of go out

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.890
from like the central ring to the next

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.870
ring to the next ring like the amount

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.610
of space you've got to play with his

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.470
only going up like that the cube of that

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.760
distance because you're making it a

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.710
sphere of possible places you could put

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.600
triangles but the number of triangles

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.800
that you need actually goes up

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.040
exponentially so exponential vs cube you

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.230
lose right you if you go like a few

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.020
layers out you'll just get incredible

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.700
numbers of triangles in a solid wall

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.710
because these are made of plastic the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.480
house thickness each one of the house

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.400
volume and then you just run out but the problem that's open is

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.390
like suppose there two-dimensional

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.600
triangles, like connected at the hinges

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.620
perfectly,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.080
how far can you go? is there

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.460
actually limit? because like two

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.660
dimensional triangles you could stack

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.790
like tons of the next to each other and

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.500
maybe you'd somehow be able to fit them

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.840
in without crashing into each other we

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.210
don't think so but there's no proof like

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.190
nobody knows what's the worst that the

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.450
father so you can go

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.370
I mean it's sort of like really quickly

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.160
and nasty and not really smooth and in

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.660
the same in same sort of way like the

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.400
icosahedron is not that smooth it's got

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.130
these sort of corners so what you can do

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.650
to an icosahedron to make it smoother is

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.750
like make a geodesic dome so here's one

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.130
way to do it right you take each

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.500
triangle and you subdivide it into for

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.270
you know like a triforce cut it into

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.550
four you got these extra vertices on in

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.680
the middle of the edges and you

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.180
come out of the sphere and that makes a

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.400
smoother polyhedron it's no longer

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.650
regular but you know it's a smooth the

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.840
thing that's more like it so I was like

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.800
all right let's do that with this this

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.539
it's got this crinkly thing that's to like

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.090
here like the angles add up to

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.039
360 plus 60 is 420 too many

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.479
there's like a lot of angle at each

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.850
vertex, so if you do this sort of like

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.590
geodesic dome thing with this thing then

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.270
it turns into this thing,  so this is like

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.870
it's all hard to see but so

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.150
I'm going to see this right so these

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.479
four triangles the the three on the

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.310
outside or slightly isosceles and the

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.570
one in the middle is actually equal at

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.020
all

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.820
so this is subdivided and then and then

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.070
the vertices to the activities just

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.300
squished around a little bit to make it

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.550
make it a bit smoother and then it's

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.580
it's nice to write it sort of you can

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.639
get quite large bits of it to be flat although

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.229
you can get all of it to be flat always

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:40.789
sort of bunches up somewhere

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.430
no matter how hard you try.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.680
yeah it's a hyperbolic doily that's what

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.590
is really likes to be in sort of like

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.760
saddles or crinkly start for ya fun to

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.300
play with the short side so long sides n

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.190
the short side is n minus 1 so each

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.849
rectangle is n times n minus 1 this

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.220
three of them so it's three lots of that

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.840
and then there's one in the middle

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.659
well right so that's a really hard

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:09.349
question

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:15.070
okay all right here we go
