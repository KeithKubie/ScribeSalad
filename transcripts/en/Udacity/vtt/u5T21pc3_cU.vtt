00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.980
Some classes will make use of
the tests and quizzes function.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.890
When a test is open,
you'll see them here.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.740
Most tests have a time limit.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.590
And you'll see the limit here.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.290
You must complete the test by the time
limit or else it will auto submit.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.710
Make sure to save your answers.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.720
So, let's go through this
final exam real quick.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.200
You'll receive some
instructions on this page, and

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.980
be reminded of the time limit here.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.710
So now you will click
Begin Assessment to get started.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.560
Now we will go through
the questions one by one.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.990
Some of them might be fill in the blank,
like this one.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.070
Some of them might be essay questions,
like this one.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.750
Some might be multiple choice,
like this one.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.590
Now when you're done with the exam
click submit for grading.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.000
Click this one more time to
confirm that you are done.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.420
You will then receive
a confirmation screen.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.740
Once the exam has been graded
you will see feedback here.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.120
Here you will see how you did.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.830
You may also now see your
grade in the gradebook.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.790
&gt;&gt; Some of our tests are proctored, and

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.750
we'll talk about the proctoring
services that we use a bit later.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.400
We may also run surveys
through this interface.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.910
Surveys are just like tests, but
they're ungraded and typically untimed,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.100
although usually they'll only
be open for a certain window.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.880
Generally, you should receive
announcements from your class when tests

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.060
and surveys are open, so you shouldn't
need to check this page very often.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.260
Just come back whenever a survey or
a test is announced.
