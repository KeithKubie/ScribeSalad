00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.380
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.500
Welcome to American
Furniture, 1650 to the Present,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
with Oscar P. Fitzgerald.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.720
I am Dr. Kimberley Bugg,
Chief of the Research

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.840
and Reference Division here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.420
This afternoon's lecture is
part of an ongoing series

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.990
by the Humanities and
Social Sciences Section,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.700
to highlight people such as
this afternoon's lecturer,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.880
furniture connoisseur,
Oscar P. Fitzgerald.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.110
From the splendor of the Main
Reading Room, the librarians

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.650
in Research and Reference
Division do a myriad

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.110
of activities.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.300
We do everything from
making recommendations,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.200
working with people
who have questions,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.750
registering new readers,
and providing services

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.170
for the books, loaning
and retrieving things.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.590
This afternoon's event
was coordinated, planned,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.450
and put together by our
Reference Librarian,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.800
Laura Berberian, who was just--
here she is-- in the room.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.310
And our reference specialist,
Kathy Woodrell, who is in charge

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.200
of decorative arts
and architecture.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.720
They selected items from rare
books and the general collection

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.350
for their accompanying
book displays,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.650
so I hope you have
an opportunity

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.110
to stop by before you leave.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.040
I'm going to ask that
you silence your phones

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.380
so you don't interrupt our
lecturer this afternoon.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.820
And I am going to
have Kathy come up

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.430
and introduce him to us all.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.730
Thank you.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.200
[ Applause ]

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Kimberley.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.360
I'd also like to thank the
Print and Photograph Division

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.290
for lending an iconic chair and
ottoman by Charles and Ray Eames

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.860
for our lecture today.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.930
I'm also very grateful
to the Rare Book

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.080
and Special Collections Division
for lending us such luminaries

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.500
as Chippendale, Sheraton,
and others,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.330
and I want to extend thanks to
my colleague, Laura Berberian.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.420
We worked together
on this presentation.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.460
I'm honored to introduce
Oscar P. Fitzgerald.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.820
I met Oscar about 20 years
ago when I took a class

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.370
on furniture connoisseurship
that he was teaching

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.250
through the Smithsonian.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.280
At the Winterter Estate,
at the DAR Museum,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.010
and at the Smithsonian's
Maryland storage facility,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.630
we were actually encouraged
to upend exquisite pieces

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.570
of furniture for a closer look.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.640
Somehow, when I try
this at home,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.460
it's not that thrilling
[laughter].

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.950
And nationally known historian,
lecturer, and consultant

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.240
on American furniture, Oscar is
also faculty of the Smithsonian,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.540
George Washington
University's Master's Program

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.220
in Decorative Arts,
and Design History,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.790
where he teaches all
the furniture classes

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.280
from colonial to modern.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.490
He consults on furniture
collections

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.410
in several historic house
museums, and he is the Curator

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.170
of Tengee [assumed spelling]
House, the official residence

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.260
of the Chief of Naval
Operations.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.380
Oscar often relies on Library
of Congress collections

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.180
for his extensive research.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.450
He lectured at the Library of
Congress in 2009 for his book,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.980
Studio Furniture of the
Renwick Gallery, and since then,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.460
he has produced New
Masters of the Wooden Box.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.590
And these will be on the
table after the lecture.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.430
And so other copies of his
books are on display here,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.900
as well as a number of
wonderful furniture resources.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.200
So, but today,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.420
we are celebrating Oscar's
newest tome [laughter],

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.490
American Furniture
1650 to the Present,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.720
a revision of his classic, Four
Centuries of American Furniture.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.300
Copies of the new book are
available for sale and signing,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.640
and in today's lecture, Oscar
will trace the development

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.700
and design of American
furniture by focusing

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.270
on the chair as a
furniture form.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.510
Please join me in
welcoming Oscar Fitzgerald.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Kathy.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.910
I really owe a great
debt of thanks to her

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.890
for putting this
together, and gathering

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.900
so many familiar faces, people I
haven't seen for quite a while.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.230
And it has just been really
nice to be back at the library.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.960
When I first got interested
in American furniture,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.780
I was working at the navy yard
at the Naval History Museum,

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.340
and every lunch hour, I came up
and read the antiques magazines,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.520
all the way from
1922 to the present,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.780
and that was my introduction
to American furniture.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.550
And I think the most interesting
one that I came across was

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.990
in the 1930s, and there was
this article about R. Edge,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.310
a newly-discovered
cabinet maker,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.180
and then in the next
issue, there was a sort of,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.030
in the back page says
"oh, we made a mistake,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.000
that's our edge is the right
edge," that was that [laughter],

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.600
and I would never have seen
that if I hadn't read all that,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.350
all of those magazines
[laughter].

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.480
But today, my book is out, and
it's quite-- it's pretty big.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.840
It's 850 pictures, and 600
pages, and one day, I was bored,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.140
and I counted the words, there
are 250,000 words [laughter].

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.730
So I was thinking, well how
could I introduce the book

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.030
to you?

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.020
So I thought, well,
I'll focus on chairs.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.970
And chairs really reflect the
changing styles over time,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.790
and so we're going to take
just a quick look at chairs

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.550
through four centuries.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.110
And some of the chairs were
based on some of the books

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.970
that we have in the back,
I was just telling Kathy.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.950
I have seen the Dover reprints
of some of those books,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.250
but never the real deal.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.250
And it's quite exciting to be
able to see the real thing,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.940
and I hope you enjoy
looking at those.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.630
Well, every one of these systems
is a little bit different.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.960
But anyway, there is
not much furniture.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.090
There is no furniture that we
know of, before about 1650,

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.780
when the pilgrims landed in
James-- up in New England,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.870
and down in Jamestown, and
Virginia, they were worried

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.390
about the Indians, and they were
worried about making a living

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.070
and trying to survive.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.630
And of course, that's
a long time ago,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.050
so nothing much has survived.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.580
The earliest documented
furniture dates

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.160
from about the 1650s.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.900
And...the first style
is the Jacob Ian style.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.290
I like to use the
furniture styles.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.580
Furniture was one of the
first decorative arts

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.880
that was studied.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.630
And they were able to come
up with their own words

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.020
to describe the different
styles.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.200
Other media, like silver,
and glass, and ceramics

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.740
and all, came along later.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.250
And they started using
art history terms,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.200
and the art history term
for this would be mannerism.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.640
But I like the traditional
terms,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.440
and I probably will
get those out by some

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.180
of the people and other media.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.930
But anyway, if you talk about
mannerism, you always have

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.940
to say, well, but
I mean Jacob Ian.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.390
But anyway, the first
style is mannerist.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.910
And mannerism is sort of
playing around with classicism.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.280
And from the 17th
century all the way

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.390
up into the early
19th century, really,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.020
furniture was based
on classical designs.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.320
Here are two chairs.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.180
One on the left is made by
Turner's, who would work

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.170
on a lathe, and do fancy
decoration on the wood,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.910
and the piece on the right
is known as a wainscot chair,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.350
and that was done by joiners.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.280
Cabinet makers don't
show up until about 1700.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.040
They do special things
like dovetail joints,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.470
and veneer, and inlay.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.510
But the joiner, basically joined
the wood together with mortise

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.690
and joints and you can see
that in the wainscot chair.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.550
You may wonder why is that
bottom panel not carved.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.510
And the reason is that there
would be a big cushion in there,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.730
about five pounds of
feathers, and so these chairs

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.910
that look pretty uncomfortable
were really quite nice,

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.900
actually in the 17th century,
and there weren't too many

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.150
of them, they honored guests,
you know, the governor,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.680
and all the President, and
all the dignitaries would sit

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.330
in these chairs, everybody
else kind of sat on benches.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.220
They did have some fancy
upholstered chairs.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.540
These are known as
Turkey work chairs.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.820
They look like oriental rugs,
and basically they were inspired

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.860
by those designs that we
were beginning to interact

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.040
with the middle east,
but these were done

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.970
in little cottage industries
around mostly in London.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.580
People would come around,
collect the weavings,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.520
and then sell them
to upholsterers,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.400
and so there were some
upholstered furniture.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.720
Very few have survived.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.220
This is a very rare survival.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.330
The next style is the
William and Mary style,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:37.680
and it represents a radical
change in the design.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.560
And you can see lots
of differences.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.420
For one thing, the back
is caned, all of a sudden.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.720
Where does caning come from?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.140
Well even before William
and Mary took the throne,

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.310
Charles The Second was the king,
and he came in after Cromwell,

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.800
and Cromwell was kind of,
you know, didn't like a lot

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.670
of fancy stuff, and was
kind of not too much

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.970
of a fun guy [laughter],

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.910
but Charles the Second had been
spending his exile, or traveling

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.170
around enjoying Europe, and
he married Katherine Braganza,

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.600
who was from Portugal, and the
Portuguese were already training

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.720
in the far east, and
as part of her dowry,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.420
she gave England the right to
trade in the far east as well.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.250
So all of this, these
oriental things were coming in,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.550
number one caning.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.250
And also another thing,
too, if you notice,

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.510
the first chairs had
very straight backs,

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.970
kind of uncomfortable.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.640
Now, the backs angle back.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.700
Well, the Chinese have been
doing that for a long time,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.580
and when the westerners
saw that, oh,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.750
that's a pretty good idea,
we'll angle the back.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:46.920
Already beginning in
the early 18th century,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.850
the regional variations begin
to develop, and that really is

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.210
because of the different
people that settled

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.470
in the different cities,
and in the first half

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.920
of the 18th century, the
largest cities were Boston,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.360
in New England, Newport,
New York,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.960
Philadelphia, and in Charleston.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.260
And here are three chairs,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.520
the chair on the left is
actually a Philadelphia chair--

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.570
actually a Boston chair,
I'm sorry, and the chair

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.310
in the center was
made in New York.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.420
And you see New York
kind of took a shortcut.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.470
They couldn't afford
this particular chair.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.730
Owner couldn't afford
the caning.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.620
So they just continued the
balusters across the back,

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.830
and that was a very common
variation on those chairs.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.970
And the chair on the right
is a Philadelphia chair.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.070
Sorry. Philadelphia,
and then Boston.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.990
Now you're totally
confused [laughter].

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.900
The Queen Anne style
comes in about 1725.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.720
If you know your history, Queen
Anne actually ended her reign

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.940
about 1714, but the
early scholars

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.440
of the early 18th century
furniture got a little confused,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.290
and they thought
that the styles,

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.330
really that the Queen Anne
style was a little later,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.910
so it got misnamed.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.380
But the style is
quite different.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.700
William and Mary
furniture very much turn,

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.820
lost of oriental influence,
by the Queen Anne period,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.470
it's all about curves.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.080
And people really like modern,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.740
really like Queen
Anne furniture.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.350
I saw an ad one time
in the paper,

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.220
it said Thomas Chippendale would
have really loved this Queen

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.740
Anne chair [laughter].

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.720
Well, Chippendale didn't
really make this kind of thing

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.810
but it is very modern looking,
and you can see all the curves.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.480
Even the seat is curved.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.310
The seat is called
the compass seat,

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.790
because of the compass
you draw circles with,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.950
and you lay out that
seat with a compass,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.150
and that's just one
of the many curves.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.090
Also if you notice, the feet,
the feet are trifid feet.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.630
The trifid foot is a
little three-toed foot.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.790
And that represents
the Irish influence.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.670
And there is a very strong
Irish influence in Philadelphia.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.540
Another thing that happens
in the Queen Anne period is

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.050
that mahogany is introduced
into furniture making.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.720
In the 17th century,
the wood was oak.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.150
By the William and Mary period,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.350
people started using
lots of walnut.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.610
By about 1720, mahogany
was the wood of choice

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.180
for the really best stuff.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.230
Mahogany doesn't grow in
this country, of course.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.160
It grows in the Caribbean, and
it's a very interesting wood.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.690
It grows here, and there,
and you have to kind

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.020
of hunt it down in the forest.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.750
It doesn't grow in groves.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.640
By about 1800, mahogany
was beginning to disappear,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.320
and so people thought we need to
start planting mahogany trees.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.640
So they planted the mahogany
seed, nothing happened,

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.480
then they figured out, oh, it's
got to go through a bird first.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.130
So they figured that out,

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.450
then they planted these
forests of mahogany trees.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.860
And after about 20 years,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.480
a fungus came along
and wiped them out.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.360
And they're, oh, that's
why they're here and there.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.180
So mahogany is pretty tricky.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.670
But it was the wood of
choice, Santo Domingo, Cuba,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.440
Honduras, were the main places.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.410
Now, Windsor chairs
don't really follow the

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.050
stylistic progression.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.410
Windsor chairs, if
we were sitting

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.720
in the 18th century
we'd probably be sitting

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.020
on Windsor chairs.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.310
Windsor chairs were
public furniture.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.440
The Continental Congress
actually sat

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.000
on Windsor chairs
in Philadelphia.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.950
So they don't really follow
the stylistic progression.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.970
A definition of a Windsor
chair is a plank seat,

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.020
with sticks into it, and so
you can have Windsor stools,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.870
and in the center there, a
Windsor writing armchair,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.420
and the chair next to the
writing armchair, you notice,

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.210
the turnings are very simple.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.100
And in the 18th century, the
turnings were quite complex,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.860
as you see in most
of those chairs.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:08.220
But by about 1800, the Windsor
chairs become much simpler.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.890
The chair needs to
become much simpler,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.540
because the demand increased,
and it was easier to crank

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.990
out the chairs faster with
simpler turnings, and of course,

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.450
they made any excuse for that.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.600
They say well that's
the oriental influence.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.730
Make it look like bamboo.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.160
And so much of design
is making a virtue

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.660
out of necessity
[laughter], we will see that.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.080
We will see that
as we go through.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.900
So the Chippendale
furniture comes in about 1760.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.530
I was so excited to
see an original copy

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.350
of the Chippendales director,
I've seen the reprints a lot,

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.880
but nothing that is substitutes
for seeing the original,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.760
and the cover is
quite spectacular too.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.860
It has got the original cover.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.090
Thomas Chippendale was
really the first person

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.530
to publish a book of designs.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.990
There were other furniture
designs here and there

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.320
with other books, but
his was the first one

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.130
that was all furniture.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.650
And it basically was a catalogue
for promoting his stuff.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.420
And if you look at the
designs, they're quite complex.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.210
And some people said
oh yeah, really?

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.000
You think he could
make that stuff?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.270
And Chippendale's response
is yeah, I can do it,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.400
but if you can't do it, you're
just not as good as I am.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.840
And so they are quite
spectacular.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:26.060
The design, most of the
designs are Rococo designs.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.360
Very ornate.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.820
Very much like the
chair on the left.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.640
But there were two other
elements as well too,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.420
and that was the Chinese
element, which you see

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.810
in the chair in the center,
and also gothic on the right.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.070
And the title page actually
talks about Chinese, gothic,

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.880
and the modern taste, the modern
taste being the Rococo taste.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.880
And notice, now, the curves
have begun to disappear?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.650
The backs are very rectilinear.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.030
The legs are straight,
Marlboro legs now,

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.170
and it's quite a different look.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.840
And this is another-- based
on another design book,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.750
this was by Robert Mann-Waring.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.960
You can see the engraving
on the right.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.140
And in Boston, they must have
had a number of copies of that,

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.830
because this chair was
very popular in Boston,

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.770
and you can see the direct
relationship to that.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.440
To that design on the right.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.420
Notice, also, the continuation
of the ball and claw foot.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.490
In England, the ball and
claw foot disappears.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.660
Chippendale doesn't show a
single ball and claw foot.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.320
They were ball and claw feet

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.190
on American Queen Anne
furniture, but not that much.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.370
But by the Chippendale period,

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.580
with economic things
getting better,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.090
people could afford
the ball and claw foot,

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.540
even though it was a
little outdated in England.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.670
And the regional
variations continue.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.130
The chair on the left, again,
is the Philadelphia chair.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.430
Very elaborate.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.010
By the second half
of the 18th century,

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.870
Philadelphia replaces Boston as
the largest city in the country,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.170
and the furniture, some

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.660
of the grandest Chippendale
furniture was made there.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.400
In the center is New York.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.210
In New York, had a very
strong English influence.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.880
There was a royal
governor there.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.020
There was a large
contingent of military there.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.140
So the furniture
looks very English.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.320
This is very English, with
the tassel ruffle on the back,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.350
and you can't see on the
arms, but they're eagle heads

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.490
on the arms, and
very elaborate chair.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.440
On the right is the
Boston chair.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.590
The Boston chairs tend
to be much more delicate.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.460
And you can see looking
at the seat rails,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.500
how thin the seat rail
on the Boston chair is.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.810
And because it was a little
lighter, they felt the need

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.760
to continue using stretchers

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.750
to reinforce the
chair to some extent.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.530
Upholstered chairs continue.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.870
These are, we call them
today, wing chairs.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.170
Actually the wings in the 18th
century were called cheeks,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.560
and they were really
designed as easy chairs,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.290
and would be in the bedroom.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.990
Not really in the parlor,
they'd be in the bedroom,

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.140
and it was designed so that if
you had a cold or something,

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.520
and you wanted to not wake up
while stuffed up, you could get

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.060
up and go to sleep
in your easy chair,

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.390
and that was the way people
really slept in that period.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.510
And then there is this chair,

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.200
which is really a
very famous chair.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.700
There is a book called Major
Francione's [assumed spelling]

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:29.520
Chairs, and these chairs, five
of them, appeared at auction

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.850
in England, consigned
by Major Francione.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.920
And Joe Kendig was a big
dealer in Pennsylvania,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.210
and he read about these
chairs, hopped on a plane

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.990
and thought oh, I'm
going to get a bargain,

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.290
people will think
they're English,

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.230
but they really are American.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.530
Well, too bad.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.050
Somebody knew about it,
and at the last minute,

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.570
they took them off the market,
sent them over to New York,

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:57.970
where they actually went about
$47,000 each in the 1980s.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.810
You can see two of those chairs
in the Kaufman Collection today

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.290
at the National Gallery.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.180
But it just shows that American
furniture could be as elaborate

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.040
or complex as any English
designs if there was the demand.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.430
And in Philadelphia, sometimes
there was sometimes the demand.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.690
We know that for sure
they're Philadelphia chairs,

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.500
because there is a
notation Hanlon--

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.660
and Hanlon reupholstered
those chairs in Philadelphia

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.290
in the early 20th century, so
there's no question about them.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:33.050
Well, as I say, throughout the
18th century, it was classicism.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.970
Classicism bits and pieces
of architecture, really,

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.290
by and large, if you think
of a desk and bookcase,

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.920
or a high chest, the
pediments just look

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.120
like architectural pediments
off classical buildings.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.170
But at the end of
the 18th century,

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.750
neo-classicism is
introduced, and neo means new.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.870
So what is new about classicism?

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.900
Well Robert Adam [laughs],
Robert Adam goes off

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.830
on the grand tour to
the classical remains

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.900
around the Mediterranean, and he
figures out that oh, you know,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.150
if you go into these
classical buildings,

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.790
they look a lot different
than they do on the exterior.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.260
I mean, you would never
believe what the exterior

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.520
of this building looks like by
looking at this room, I mean,

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.440
it's really very
nice, comfortable,

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.140
and very user friendly.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.090
You go outside, you walk in,
it's pretty intimidating.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.370
So that's what's new
about classicism,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.910
and neo-classicism
was just that,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.510
it was a lot more delicate,
more two-dimensional,

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.290
and still using elements
of classicism,

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.910
but as reflected on interiors.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.960
And this is a chair
made in Hartford,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.490
sort of a transitional chair.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.080
You see it still has sort of a--
the little bit of rectilinearity

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.220
of the Chippendale
style, but there's a lot

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.790
of classical details, that
are in the back, particularly.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.620
And we are delighted to be also
able to see some of the Sheraton

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.280
and Hepplewhite design
books in the back.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.930
These were very popular.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.190
Neither one of those
craftsmen, well,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.630
actually Hepplewhite
was a craftsman,

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.740
but none of his furniture
really survived.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.210
Sheraton really wasn't
so much into craft.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.930
His book was called
The Drawing Book,

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.290
and that's exactly what it was.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.150
It was a way to teach
craftsmen how to draw.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.190
And the drawings would be ways
they would present their designs

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.570
to their customers.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.590
But these two books
had a wide circulation,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.730
and had a tremendous influence
on furniture in this period.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.840
And even today, the
chair on the left,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.480
we refer to as a
Hepplewhite style chair.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.170
Whereas the one with the tapered
legs and urn-shaped back,

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.890
whereas the one on the
right, with the square back

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.980
and the turn legs is more
in the Sheraton style.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.030
If you look at those design
books, they had same chairs

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.920
in both books, so it's really
not a valid distinction,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.220
and I was reading one

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.100
of my students' thesis the
other night, and he said, oh,

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.350
he did a Hepplewhite style,
tall case, clock case.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.820
So I went to my Dover reprint,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.480
and Hepplewhite did not
design any clock cases.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.980
So I mean, what did that mean?

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.360
It really meant nothing.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.190
So it's better to just call
the stuff federal [laughter].

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:27.260
It's a neutral term,
you know [laughs].

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.410
There was, you know, American
furniture basically was,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.710
you could argue, often,

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.770
that it's just rural
English furniture.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.960
But we did some interesting
things, some unique things,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.200
and the piece on
the left is, today,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.160
often called a Martha
Washington chair.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.850
It turns out, if you
go down to Mt. Vernon,

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.880
there is a Martha Washington
chair up in her bedroom,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.200
and I went down to the
office there and asked them,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.050
well when did Martha get that?

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.070
Well, Martha didn't
really get that.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.410
We didn't get that until 1898,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.150
and why they have
it there [laughs],

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.900
she didn't have a Martha
Washington chair actually

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.990
[laughter], but a
lot of people did.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:11.000
And so what's unique
about it is [chuckles],

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.820
the chair on the right
is from about 1760.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.370
And you see it is an
upholstered chair with arms.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.330
It goes out of style in England,
but Americans kind of liked

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.890
that style, so we updated it

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.880
with these neo-classical
details, the higher back,

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.330
the nice turned legs, a little
bit of veneer on the legs,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.960
and nice delicate arms, and
all of a sudden, a new chair,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.080
mostly they were called lolling
chairs, because you could loll

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.410
around and be very
comfortable in them [laughter].

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.510
Well, the neo-classical
style is kind of complex,

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.660
because there are really
three phases in that period,

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.190
from about 1790 to about 1840.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.930
The second phase
comes in about 1810,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.100
and it's much more
three-dimensional.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:00.010
The designs are based, some
of them are based very closely

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:05.340
on actual classical Greek
and Roman furniture,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.970
and one of the most influential
was the Klismo chair.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.990
The Klismo chair had saber legs,
like you see on this chair,

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:20.300
and you see also the carving,
the figures on the arms,

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.060
and the wire on the back, all
these details, from classicism.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.320
At the same time,
Windsor chairs continue.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.780
You see a Windsor
chair on the right.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.020
The plank seat, with
the spindles.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.140
Then a new type of commercial,

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.700
or sort of public
furniture comes in,

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.830
and these are called
fancy chairs,

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.790
and they're not really
very fancy, actually.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.470
What they really
are is fanciful.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.720
And the decoration is fanciful.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.710
And of course, if you look
at that, you're thinking, oh,

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.010
that's a Hitchcock chair.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.720
Right? Well, Hitchcock
was probably the largest

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.690
manufacturer of these chairs,

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.220
but there were really
hundreds of other makers.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.030
So the proper term for that
is fancy chair, and you see,

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.610
instead of the plank
seat, it has a rush seat.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.820
Which is very, very inexpensive,
and easily replaced.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.650
And the stenciling was often
done by children, or women,

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.860
and you would paint
the gold paint on,

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.950
and you would pain
the varnish on,

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.380
then you would take bronze
dust, and it would look

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.600
like gilding on the back.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.310
Well, the third phase is
the late empire phase,

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.840
and it is sometimes known
as the Grecian style.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.100
And the Grecian style
is totally devoid of all

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.930
that elaborate carving,
and often Ormolu mounts,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.600
and the fancy gilding,
and other decoration

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.360
that you see on the
second phase.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.030
And it is just really
lots of veneers,

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.630
and lots of sculptural designs.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.520
Sometimes today we
often refer to this

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.260
as the pillar and scroll style.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.610
I don't see it so much in
a chair, but the pillars

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:02.130
and scrolls are on tables and
all sorts of other things.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.710
This looks very much like the
chair that Lincoln was shot in.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.170
And of course, you know he was
shot in 1865, this chair is

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.680
from about 1840, and the
story is that when he went

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.450
to Ford's Theater, of
course, he was a big guy,

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.750
and the little theater chairs
were just not quite right.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.540
So they went down
in the basement,

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.900
and got out this outdated
chair, and put it up there,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.200
and that is sometimes--

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.340
these are simply
called Lincoln rockers.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.950
I saw one advertised at auction,
Lincoln's rocker, and I thought,

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.020
no, I don't think so [laughter].

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.810
That one is actually in
the Henry Ford Museum.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:43.290
And just another variation
on a chair, which is new

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.550
to this period, the
Grecian style,

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.720
these are called gondola chairs.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.480
And it's interesting,
the arm is--

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:56.730
forms actually the back
in one continuous design,

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.410
not two separate pieces.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.710
Well, the Victorian style.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.410
The Victorian style is
really misunderstood.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.430
But actually, today, a lot of
people seem to be interested

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.550
in Victorian furniture because
there's a lot of it out there.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.520
And of course it's named after
Queen Victoria, who lived from--

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:18.330
ruled from 1837 to about
1901, but it's very--

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.720
it's a complex period
[laughter].

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:27.730
So that to me is the best thing

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.080
about Victorian furniture,
the idea of surprise.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.480
You're pretty surprised that you
could make a chair out of horns,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.120
and then you start
looking at that chair,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.150
and you see the other surprise?

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.410
The crest rail looks
like a pinned down hat.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.710
I mean, how clever is that?

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.300
I mean, it's just
pretty bizarre, you know?

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.800
And this one is not
quite so surprising,

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.090
but you can see what
this was designed for.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.470
You can see if you read closely

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.060
on the back, rail,
it says Albany.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.990
And this comes off a
Hudson River steamboat,

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:03.750
which would take you off to
Albany, you know, which I was,

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.120
you know, I don't know why we
would want to go from New York

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.170
to Albany [laughter],
but anyway.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.960
But anyway-- the other,
one of the influences

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.870
in this period is romanticism.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.700
People were moving
to the cities.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.310
The cities were really pretty--
not really that great a place

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.400
to live compared to the country,
but their jobs were there,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.800
and anybody could make a good
living, but people were thinking

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.940
about places all over the world,
maybe Albany I guess [laughter],

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.590
but that influence,
the furniture.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.670
Also the-- new materials
come in to use,

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.910
and of course, this is metal.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.960
This was patented
by Thomas Warren,

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.240
it's called the centripetal
chair.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.540
It's in use today.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.550
If you go to the
Treasury Department,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.850
or at least the last
time I went,

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.990
which was really a couple
years ago, the Secretary

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.910
of the Treasury sits
in a chair just

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.090
like that, or used to anyway.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.390
It's really very comfortable.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.790
I actually have one
in my office too.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.400
It's really neat.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:11.250
The springs on the bottom give
it a nice real spring to it.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.700
And this one, innovation.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.380
This is by George Huntzinger.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.800
He did a lot of really
creative furniture.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.790
And he did a lot
of patents, too.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.300
And one of the patents was for
that diagonal brace on the side,

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.570
which makes the assembly of
that chair more efficient.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.950
The other reason I show this is

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.620
that textiles become
very important.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.010
You see huge floor to ceiling
draperies, you see wall

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.930
to wall carpeting, and you
see very elaborate upholstery

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.330
on the furniture, because
textiles become much cheaper.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.330
In the 18th century,
really it's very expensive

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.340
to hand weave that stuff.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.000
We saw the chair from the
17th century, very rare.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.020
But by the 19th century,

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.840
upholstery becomes a big
deal, and very fancy.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.970
And this is kind of
an American chair.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:04.910
This is vintage really by
Michael Thone, he grew up,

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:09.490
he was born in Germany
and went to Vienna,

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.990
and came up with
Bentwood furniture.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.950
And I show it because
bentwood furniture is still

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.250
available today.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.970
It's probably next to
those plastic chairs

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.270
that you see everywhere.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.240
Probably the most
made chair ever,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.780
millions of copies were made.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.090
And you can see one reason was

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.080
that they're easily
shipped around.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.120
And he would make
them in Vienna,

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.350
send them over to New York,

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.940
then they would be
assembled and sold.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.410
In the 1930s, the Thone company
was seeing the rise of Nazism,

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.200
and they decided to
get out of Germany,

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.940
and they came to this country.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.460
And in the 1980s,
the Thone was bought

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.170
out by Shelby-William
Industries, and they are still

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:57.040
in production, the other part
of the company still exists

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.210
in Germany, but they're still
turning out these chairs,

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.170
and they're turning them
out here in this country.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:06.450
And this one, other interesting
chair form that comes in,

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.740
in this period, is
children's furniture.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.140
And why all of a sudden
children's furniture?

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.180
Well if you look at
art, and you look

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.260
at the way children are
depicted in the 18th century,

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.830
they're not depicted
as children.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.160
They're depicted as
miniature adults.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.680
There was no such
thing as childhood.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.080
As soon as you could work in
the factory, work in the fields,

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.000
whatever, you were
out there doing it.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.930
But in the 19th century, the
things become much more wealthy

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:35.960
and people can afford to let
their children stay at home.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.940
And you know, that
trend today continues.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:46.260
I mean, you have children at
home that are 35 [laughter].

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.920
But it starts in
the 19th century.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.620
And well, the first revival
style is the gothic revival.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.740
These are revivals,
they're not copies.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.980
One of the things that people
criticize Victorian furniture

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.490
on is that they didn't
get it, you know,

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.080
that doesn't really look
like period gothic furniture.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.400
Well that was the point,
they were inspired by gothic,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.200
but they are making
it more robust.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.830
They're making it
more interesting,

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.430
and you see it here,
with the rose window

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.660
in the back of the chair.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.630
But in America, gothic
was not all that popular.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.380
We don't have a lot
of gothic cathedrals,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.490
other than maybe the
national cathedral,

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.570
which has only been
completed about 1900.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:36.150
And so you do see it in
schools, and maybe in offices,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:40.210
but not too much in parlors.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.400
What you see in parlors is
more the Rococo revival,

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.330
and when you think of Victorian
furniture, some people think

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.770
of it as really Victorian
revival.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.070
And in some times, you even
hear the term Belter furniture.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.860
And that is named after
John Henry Belter,

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.400
who was probably the best known
maker of this type of furniture.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.330
This is actually a Belter chair.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.090
Part of a parlor
suite, and furniture

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.270
by the 19th century
was done in sets.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:10.730
You would have a sofa, a
man's chair, a woman's chair,

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.370
then four side chairs,
where the--

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.490
you know, lesser
people would sit.

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:17.650
And these would be all matched.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.260
And again, a symbol or function

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.030
of the wealth of
the 19th century.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.250
The thing about Rococo
furniture, if you look at that,

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.340
it's a lot of fruits
and flowers,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.140
and it's really beautifully
carved.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.440
It's all hand carved.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.170
People think 19th century
furniture is all industrial,

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.190
you know, factory made,
but all that carving,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:42.920
the first carving machines, they
don't turn up until the 1890s,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.820
so this is all hand carved
and beautifully done.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.950
More complex and really finer
than 18th century carving.

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:53.850
Well, also popular in this
period was the renaissance

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.890
revival, and renaissance
furniture is quite different.

00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:59.740
Instead of all those nice
curves of the Rococo,

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.010
it's now much more angular,
and based a lot on designs

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.170
from the renaissance, and
you can see the difference,

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.190
it's got little ears,
that's one of the signs

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.980
of renaissance revival
furniture.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.840
It has a little drop
on the skirt,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.800
and the legs are straight,
instead of the curved legs.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.200
This one happens to be by John
Geldhof [assumed spelling],

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.340
who worked in Newark,
just outside of New York.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.680
But renaissance revival
furniture is very complex.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.150
There is some furniture that
is very heavily influenced

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.080
by the Egyptian interest.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:39.590
The first exhibits in New
York, at the Met, were in 1852,

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:43.200
and in about 1879, they
installed an obelisk,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:50.020
in Central Park, and Egyptian
interest was quite strong,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.460
and you can see it
here in this furniture.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.900
But still, very angular,
turned legs,

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.420
and little drops on the skirt.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.970
Another phase of the renaissance
revival was harkening back

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.900
to Louis the Sixteenth
furniture.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.210
The Rococo revival goes
back to Louis the Fifteenth,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.300
which is Rococo furniture
in France.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.500
Louis Sixteenth is
more neo-classical

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.490
and much more angular,
and you can see

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.560
that this chair almost looks
like it might have been made

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.810
in the late 18th century instead
of in the mid-19th century,

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:25.130
so there is an influence, from
Louis Sixteenth furniture,

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:30.300
and also classicism in
general, and you see the urn--

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.570
the shape on the back, and
that is sometimes referred

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.680
to as neo-grec, the
new Grecian style,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.300
you know from earlier
neo-classical period.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.050
So renaissance revival
has three phases.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.510
And then, well, people
kind of got tired of all

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:51.900
that revival stuff, and you
had William Morris coming along

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.200
and saying, you know,

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.920
it's really terrible what
these people are doing

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.170
in the factories, they're
just putting the eyes

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.600
on the Mickey Mouse doll all day
and it's really kind of boring,

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.160
and we ought to go back to the
middle ages, when the designer

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.910
of the furniture
was also the maker,

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:11.950
which really was never the case,
the maker was always being told

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.920
by somebody, mostly the
architect, what to do.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.720
And it was pretty hard
work in those days.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.850
And things were really better

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.840
for the workmen in
the 19th century.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.810
But William Morris kind of
brainwashed a whole generation,

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:32.810
you know, that factories are
bad, and all of that extra,

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.010
ornament, and all that stuff.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.950
So he came up with
a lounge chair,

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.930
which was called
the Morris chair.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.440
And people always cite that,
oh, how creative and wonderful.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.970
I was looking through another
one of the period design books

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:49.170
from 1829, and in William
King's design book is a Morris

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.470
chair [laughter].

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:54.040
So he just simply copied
that idea, I guess.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.950
A Morris chair, this is, was
the design in Morris' company,

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.700
and you can see the back does
recline at different angles,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.680
and that is what makes
it a Morris chair.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.990
And notice also,

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:07.510
the introduction of
oak in furniture.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.380
We will talk about arts
and crafts furniture,

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.990
which is primarily oak.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:15.370
That is because all the walnut
was used up in the 19th century.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.220
They had to come up with
another wood, and oh, oak!

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.170
And it's so wonderful,
because it's the same ones

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.470
that they used in
the middle ages,

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.840
how convenient for
that [laughter].

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.080
Well, the person that
popularized a lot

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.660
of these ideas was
Charles Lot Eastlake.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.210
And I was thrilled
to see a manuscript

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.440
that it's not his hints
on household taste,

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.230
but another one by, I don't
know if it is his wife, or who,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.870
I need to really do
some research on it,

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:47.870
but full of furniture designs
that were used as design sources

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.050
in this period, but
this one comes

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.710
from his Hints on
Household Taste.

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:56.260
It is how to furnish your house,
and you can see how close it is

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.690
to the piece on the right.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.910
The little spindles
are kind of a signature

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.810
of the Eastlake style.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.520
Much thinner, much more
delicate, still turn lay,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.610
still angular, but
much lighter in feel.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:16.110
And within this period, we
call it the Eastlake style,

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.910
but really a better term
is the Queen Anne style.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.550
It gets very confused, but
the Queen Anne style was

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.850
just revivalist.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:28.030
They were coming up with
all kinds of design sources,

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.850
and one of the major design
sources was the far east again,

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.430
and particularly Japan.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:39.150
And in the 1850s, Japan was
sort of open, a little bit,

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.540
not really very much-- I
think the treaty said if one

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.280
of our sailors gets
marooned on your island,

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.030
you will liberate them, and
that was about the extent

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:53.130
of the opening, but the
Japanese got the message,

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:57.350
because when Perry arrived
with about 20 war ships,

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:01.180
they thought maybe we need
to think about modernizing

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.700
and defending ourselves
from this.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.050
So they discovered, Perry
discovered in Japan,

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:13.000
the Japanese discovered the
west, and they began to exhibit

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.980
in the World's Fairs,
which began in 1851

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.370
in the Crystal Palace in London.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:22.810
They didn't exhibit there,
but they did exhibit in 1867,

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.350
and in 1876, in Philadelphia,

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.800
the Japanese Pavilion caused
a big stir, and as a result,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.180
lots of furniture had
these oriental influences,

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.620
as you see, on these chairs.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:40.420
And then there was also this
guy, called Oscar Wilde,

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.050
my namesake [laughter],

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:46.390
who went around the country
preaching art for art's sake,

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.420
and up to that period,
furniture,

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.400
and all the decoration,
they were used as sort

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.090
of cultural conditioning, as a
way of transferring the culture

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.400
to generations and by the late
19th century, they thought,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.580
you know, we ought to just
think about this stuff as art.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.880
It's beautiful.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.180
That's all we need
to worry about.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.480
We don't have to worry
about we're trying

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.870
to educate the public.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:13.730
So at the high end of the
market, the aesthetic movement,

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.780
were the herder brothers.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.620
And the herder brothers,
interestingly enough,

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.380
if you've ever heard
of Christian Herder,

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.800
who was the Secretary of
State under Eisenhower.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.590
That's the same family,
actually.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.650
But the Herder brothers,
produced, in my opinion,

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.610
some of the best furniture
ever produced in America

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:33.840
on a large scale, and this
is one of those chairs.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.430
I saw that chair.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:39.470
I could have bought that chair
at the New York Antique Show.

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.770
I was sitting in
the chair, I said,

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.070
well how much is this chair?

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.370
They said, oh, it's
a million dollars.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.650
A million dollars
[laughter], I don't think so!

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:47.950
Well no kidding.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.140
And it's a fabulous chair.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.040
And there is not a
straight line in it.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.340
When there are no
straight lines,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.990
it's very difficult to make.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:59.390
You see the little fetlock
from a horse, you see in the,

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:04.580
on the seat rail, these
mother of pearl orbs,

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.680
and if you look closely,
they're kind of hanging

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.970
as if these are orbs
hanging on the seat rail.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.320
Another detail, which
is kind of interesting,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.910
the orb in the center is
kind of hanging there,

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:21.590
surrounded by a ribbon, and then
you look up at the seat rail,

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:24.590
the state rail, the rail
just right above the seat,

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:28.220
and that square plaque, and
it's surrounded by a ribbon too,

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.940
but if you look closely,
it's surrounded--

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.310
that ribbon has turned
into a snake

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.150
and it's really,
really very clever.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:41.940
And as I said in the late 19th
century, it's lots of revivals.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.490
And one of the most popular
revivals was the colonial

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.190
revival, and this is
clear colonial revival.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.860
You can see the date, 1876,

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.160
and wicker furniture
becomes very popular too.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.840
Wicker appears, really, well,
you know, Moses was found

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.700
in the bull rushes
in a wicker cradle,

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.930
actually so it goes way
back to classical periods.

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:08.960
It was shown at the 1870--
1851 Centennial Exhibit,

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.260
but it becomes very popular
in the late 19th century,

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.270
into the 20th century, and
a good example of that.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.150
And again, another
surprise, this is,

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.150
of course, Colonial Revival.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.430
This belonged to our
mother, as you can see,

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:24.470
it says right there,
our mothers.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.410
And we just broke up her--

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:31.490
weaving equipment and
made it into a chair.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.120
And then we came up with
a new type of chair, too,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.410
this is a platform rocker.

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.390
And well, all of that
is sort of just myth.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:43.240
There was a company that made
this stuff, and they didn't go

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.430
around collecting
old spinning wheels,

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.900
they actually made
the stuff to make

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.570
into the chairs,
like you see here.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.640
And the platform rocker was
a new idea, because you know,

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.460
people came over, and
Americans loved rocking chairs.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.940
We've always loved
rocking chairs.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.470
The Europeans were horrified.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.850
That's pretty, you know, pretty
boorish, to be sitting there

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.160
in a rocking chair [laughter],
so some people [chuckles],

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.660
really, that's what they said.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.660
So some people decided, well,
we'll make it a platform rocker.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.060
It won't be quite so obvious.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.940
You can just rock
back and forth,

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.620
and it doesn't mess
up the floor, either.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.640
That's another good
thing about it.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.300
Well, again, the bridge
between Victorian revivals

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.230
and modernism is kind of Haute
Nouveau, people were trying

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.760
to find a new source for design.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:35.160
Instead of reviving stuff from
the past, they were trying

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.030
to find something new, and
the new stuff was, well,

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.780
you could look at geometry,
which we knew, or you could look

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.550
at nature, and so
Tiffany looks at nature.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.500
You can see on the--
you can't see it,

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.080
but it's actually carved
flowers on the crest rail.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.150
And then geometry in
those little squares.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.620
Those are micro-mosaics.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:45:00.190
Just tiny little pieces of wood
based on designs in Bombay,

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.410
that were imported, and
sometimes just copied,

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:07.950
so it's got both,
the Micro Mosaic,

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.090
geometry and the plant forms.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.980
And just, another maker that
made that kind of thing,

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.280
this is Charles Roloff.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.740
He's a very interesting guy.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.960
He started out as an actor,
and then he got married,

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.790
and his wife said,
you know what buddy?

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.730
I don't want to be
married to an actor,

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.900
you need to find another job.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.250
So he'd been a kind
of amateur craftsman,

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.140
so he started making
craft furniture,

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.220
and you can see this
pretty ornate stuff.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.520
Very collectible.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.820
He was one of the few people

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.400
who received international
recognition, and he won a prize

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.820
at the Turin Exhibit in 1902.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.160
Other people, the
Greene brothers,

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.080
out in California made furniture
also with art nouveau details.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.100
You can see the inlay right
on the splat right there,

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.400
it's a little hard to see.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.980
The other influence here
is the Danish influence,

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.980
because the man that made
their furniture was Peter Hall,

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.280
who was trained in Denmark,

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:11.010
so the furniture has a very much
Danish Scandinavian look to it.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.080
Well, the arts and
crafts movement comes,

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.200
and it is sometimes
called Mission Furniture.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.090
And the reason for that
is that in the beginning,

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:24.380
this chair was sent to a
guy named Joseph McCoo,

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.950
not this particular chair, but
the one that it is based on,

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.800
and McCoo thought, well,
that's pretty neat.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.200
I'll start making that chair,
and it was a very big success,

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.880
and so that was the mission,

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.600
it came from not really
a California mission,

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.300
it was a [inaudible] church
they were building out there,

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.370
but you know, sounds nicer
to be from a mission.

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.310
And, but the most
popular person,

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:49.440
the most well-known person
making this stuff was

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.920
Gustav Stickley.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:54.860
And he was well-known, because
he started publishing Craftsman

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.710
Magazine in 1900, promoting
all these new ideas.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.680
And generally, it was
very simple, unadorned,

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.660
no decoration, but
in 1903 and 1904,

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.150
he hired this guy
named Harvey Ellis.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:10.010
And Harvey Ellis
was kind of a drunk,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.410
but very creative guy
[laughter], and said, you know,

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.190
we need to make this
stuff more interesting,

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.230
we need to put inlay on it.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.400
So for a short period of time,
some of the furniture has inlay,

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.970
and that brings the
biggest prices.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:24.280
Unfortunately, as I say,
he was an alcoholic.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.590
He died, and after about
a year, and that was it,

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:27.970
and Stickley quit doing that,

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.480
went back to the
plain furniture.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:35.130
He had four brothers,
one of whom was Albert,

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.450
who was in partnership with
Leopold for a short period

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:42.180
of time, and Albert had done a
lot of traveling around Europe,

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:46.200
so his furniture is much more
interesting and has decoration

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.310
on it, in contrast to
the Stickley stuff.

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:53.270
Then, of course, Frank Lloyd
Wright, who is really one

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.450
of the pioneers in modernism.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.860
And this is a chair
he designed in 1904,

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.150
and he doesn't get the
credit that he deserves.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.560
You see on the right, the
famous red blue chair,

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.140
of Garrett Rietveld.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.910
And that one is the one that all
of history of modern design--

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.110
but the truth, the story is,
the client came to Rietveld,

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.790
who was working in the distill
movement in Holland, and said,

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.410
you know, I want
you to make a copy

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.700
of that Frank Lloyd
Wright chair.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.260
And so you can see, it
is pretty close to it.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.630
And so you can see, it
is pretty close to that.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.860
And as you also, as I say,
it's based on geometry.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.810
Well, modernism comes
in after World War One.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:35.550
All of these, the arts and
crafts movement, all of that,

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.930
people associated
that with Europe,

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.110
and Europe caused World War One.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:46.230
And it was a terrible disaster,
and our troops went over

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.640
and fought and said, man,
if this is European stuff,

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.530
we want nothing to
do with Europe.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.780
So they came back and started
looking at American culture,

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.980
and Colonial revival
had already been going.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.770
And that took off.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.690
And here, you see,
just an example

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.100
of a Wallace Nutting high chair.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.700
And you could buy that high
chair for [inaudible] dollars

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.980
in the Wallace and Edison
Catalogue in the 1920s.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.430
That's Winterthur, and it's
really a fantastic chair.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.440
The thing about Wallace Nutting,
he was very knowledgeable.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.740
He was so knowledgeable,

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.190
that his furniture is
really a composite.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:24.500
It's better than anything they
ever did in the 18th century

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.640
and that's why they thought
it was a great example

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.940
of Winterthur, until
they realized

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:35.160
that oh, it's 1920, not 1820.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:39.440
Well, Europeans also were tired
of all that stuff from the past,

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.720
and they wanted something
new, and so one of the centers

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.870
for the new was the Bauhaus,
the new house, and the idea was

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.320
to bring good design
to the masses.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:54.130
And the idea was to use
technology, and strip all

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.790
of that [inaudible],
again making a virtue

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:59.300
out of necessity, because all
those guys that could make all

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:04.730
that fancy furniture got killed,
and we have to build houses

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:07.980
and furniture fast, and so you
can't waste time putting a lot

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.280
of ornament on it.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.580
So less is more.

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:11.880
Isn't that wonderful?

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.810
Do away with all that ugly
ornament, and you know,

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:18.670
make it out of metal, and then
these are [inaudible] Broyer's

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.500
Seska [assumed spelling]
chairs, he was the head

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.430
of the furniture
department at the Bauhaus,

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:25.410
and very revolutionary.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.370
Who could think that you could
make a chair with two legs?

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.360
And it was pretty revolutionary.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.310
And so this high
tech look was one

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.570
of the elements of modernism.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:38.200
Another person at the Bauhaus,
who was the head of the Bauhaus,

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.800
was [inaudible] and he
made the Barcelona chair,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.800
which is the icon of modernism,

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.340
for the 1929 Barcelona
Exhibition, for the King

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.040
and Queen of Spain,
to open the Fair.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.240
And it was pretty neat,
they've restored that building,

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.330
and actually sat
in a reproduction

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:59.410
of the Barcelona chair, and went
back, but they're still in use,

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:03.160
and again, that high tech look.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.590
But with a little
classical design.

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.110
It almost looks

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:09.760
like a [inaudible]
another classical chair.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.270
Americans did metal
furniture, too.

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:16.200
Warren MacArthur, instead of
using chrome-plated steel,

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.390
used aluminum, and aluminum
is very hard to weld,

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:25.180
and you can see the
joints are kind of joints

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.550
that don't require welding.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:30.240
We had a kind of
our Bauhaus, too.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:34.580
Which was known as the Cranbrook
School in just outside Detroit,

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.400
and the head of the Cranbrook
School was Eliel Saarinen,

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.400
who was a very famous
Finnish architect.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.860
If you have ever
been to Helsinki,

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.280
the railway station was his,
that was his masterpiece.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.580
Really fantastic.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.950
He came over into Detroit
to do some lectures,

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:54.810
and the son of the head

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:58.490
of the Detroit Press was very
impressed, and told his dad,

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.790
you know, we need
to get this guy

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:01.570
over to head the
school, so he did.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:06.350
And this was the chair that
he used in his dining room.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.490
And we talked about
the high tech look.

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:11.340
The other way of modernism was

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.690
to make it a little
more humanistic.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:18.150
Instead of metal, use wood, and
instead of just straight lines,

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:19.490
we can make it a little organic.

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.050
And that was sort of
the Scandinavian look.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.840
And this was done by a
guy named Russell Wright,

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.150
who pioneered that look.

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:36.060
And, okay, and one more
example is the streamlined look.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.810
This is the airline chair, where
Ken Weber, also an emigrant

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:45.280
from there, and that was
also a marvelous design.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.680
Modernism, the Danish
modern continues

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.690
with Danish modern chairs.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:52.630
This is a Hans [inaudible]
chair.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:56.000
And I can't stop without
mentioning Charles

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.300
and Ray Eames [assumed
spelling].

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:03.920
This is almost a cliché now,
but when you look at that chair,

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.620
it's a fabulous chair,
it's like, you know a kind

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.930
of a dragon or what
kind of figure is that?

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.080
Using both wood and
metal, and no upholstery,

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.400
but it's very comfortable.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.760
If you look at that little black
disc on the back, it's rubber.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.390
And it gives a little bit.

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:24.140
And Eames was known for
the first plastic chair,

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.440
that reads as plastic.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.710
If you look at fiberglass, it's
pretty ugly, but he figured

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:32.510
out how to put a skin coat on
it, and could do it that way.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:35.840
And he even did children's
furniture with a little heart,

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.170
and modernists went ballistic.

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:40.590
What are you decorating the
furniture with [laughter],

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:44.770
and Charles said, everybody
loves children honey [laughter],

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:49.890
and I'll stop with
the Eames lounger,

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:52.290
which we have an example of.

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:53.590
It's interesting.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:55.200
I'm sure this is rosewood.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.120
You can notice rosewood
is usually very dark,

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.990
but this has a nice
patina on it.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.670
And it's a fabulously
comfortable chair.

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:06.940
And if you ever-- well the only
downside is, if you get in it,

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.120
it's a little hard
to get out of it.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.180
So don't sit in it.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.510
Thank you very much.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:20.330
[ Applause ]

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.930
&gt;&gt; Any questions?

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:24.330
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you
again, Dr. Fitzgerald,

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.870
for such an informative lecture.

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:28.960
We have time for
a few questions.

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.450
If anybody has questions
right now?

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:35.940
&gt;&gt; A lot of those pictures show
the chairs a little [inaudible].

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.240
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.610
&gt;&gt; Is that how they
originally were intended,

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.500
or why are those little
[inaudible] there?

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well you know,
we associated casters

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.160
with [inaudible] furniture,

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.530
and a lot of furniture
[inaudible] had casters,

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:54.300
but the truth is, casters
go back to the 18th century.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.330
The early ones were
made out of--

00:54:56.330 --> 00:55:01.170
they'd take strips of leather,
and wind them into a circle,

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:03.250
and they were often
used as casters.

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:05.560
So there were casters
in the 18th century.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:10.170
It's kind of an expensive
detail, and by the 19th century,

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:14.340
the technology was such that you
could make them less expensive.

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:18.670
The other reason that they're
so common in the 19th century is

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:22.290
that by the 19th century, we
began to see central heating,

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:26.000
and so instead of having to
huddle at the fire all the time,

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.350
you could move the stuff around,
you know, you could put it

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:31.180
by the fire, you could go near
the window, and it was nice

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:35.440
to be able to roll the furniture
around, and very convenient,

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.510
and so a lot of the
furniture does have that.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:39.910
A lot of them have been removed,
because they're associated

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.600
with Victorian furniture,
but even today,

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.210
lots of furniture has
casters on them too,

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:46.350
just so that you can
move them around.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.230
Because furniture
is pretty heavy.

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.970
Yeah. Good question.

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:53.020
Any other questions?

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.800
&gt;&gt; You were here some months
ago and gave two talks, I think,

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.190
about a week or two apart.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:02.320
Are you coming back anytime
soon for a continuation or?

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.270
&gt;&gt; [Laughs] Well, you may--
I think you may be thinking--

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.550
I wasn't here at the
Library of Congress,

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.680
I was at the Smithsonian
American Art Museum--

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.330
&gt;&gt; That might have been it.

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:14.630
Yeah, yeah.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:15.930
&gt;&gt; [Laughs] That
was another program.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.980
I've been doing a lot of
lectures for the book.

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:25.600
I've been trying to think, I
think the next one I'm going

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.600
to give is at the
Alexandria Library,

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:31.830
it's about the April
27th, 28th, and I'm going

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:33.140
to be doing a book signing

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.910
at the New York Antique
Show in May.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:41.430
And down in July, I'm going
down to the only other Chitaqua

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.870
that survived, down
in Tennessee,

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:47.840
and then there is a program in
North Carolina, for Appraisers,

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.400
I'm going to be doing
some series there.

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.440
So a lot of lectures.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.930
But anyway, anybody wants to
hear me talk about furniture,

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.470
I'm happy to do it [laughter].

00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:59.380
Thank you.

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.680
Anything else?

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.980
Thank you.

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.280
Yes?

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.580
&gt;&gt; When you hear the phrase
[inaudible] furniture,

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:09.320
is that a style,
or just a location?

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.900
&gt;&gt; Well, it's really both.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:16.470
In mid-19th century, the
furniture industry moves west,

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:21.540
primarily because being nearer
the source of raw materials,

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:24.570
which were forests, and the
Midwest, and Grand Rapids,

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:26.480
is surrounded by forest.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.580
What also made that
possible was the railroads.

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.310
So that instead of
having to, you know,

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:35.640
just make furniture locally,
they could ship it all around.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.260
So Grand Rapids, even
though it's fairly isolated,

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.340
it's connected to
the railroad system,

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:44.900
and it became proportionally
larger center

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.150
of cabinet making
in the country.

00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:50.760
It wasn't bigger than Chicago,
but Chicago was like ten times

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:54.190
as big and tons of
population, so Grand Rapids,

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:57.670
it was really synonymous
with furniture.

00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:01.090
So that's one reason that
the term becomes synonymous

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.390
with furniture.

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:04.940
And much of the furniture being
made there was mass produced

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.760
furniture, and so it
was sort of ordinary.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.000
It wasn't the high-end really
expensive stuff, which was found

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.780
by the Herr brothers in
New York, or something,

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.610
like they had rich clients.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.980
This was the mass produced, for
the masses, and so the term,

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.820
Grand Rapids Furniture
gets associated

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:21.350
with that style of furniture.

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:23.920
It's mostly in the
Eastlake style,

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.820
and also the revival styles
that you see, so it's both.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.860
It's a furniture place,
but it connotes that kind

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.340
of mass produced furniture
of late 19th century.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.640
Yeah.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:40.720
&gt;&gt; You said the [inaudible]
examples of Federal,

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:45.460
would that also be
the same as Georgian,

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.790
or what are the differences
between Federal and Georgian?

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:51.120
&gt;&gt; Well, in England,
it actually--

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.530
most of the styles
originate in France.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.270
In terms of the neo-classical
designs, that really,

00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:02.300
you can credit Robert Adams with
that, and sometimes people refer

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.770
to that style as
the Adams style,

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:09.370
because he was really the
person that generated that.

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.910
Georgian furniture, when you
talk about Georgian furniture,

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:15.270
usually refers to
mid-18th century furniture,

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:17.380
but there were four George's,

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.130
so if it's George
the Fourth furniture,

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:28.710
it would be early 19th
century, and same style,

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:40.840
but you don't usually
see that associated

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.170
with neo-classical furniture.

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:53.740
It's usually more of the
Chippendale furniture,

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.460
from the mid-18th century.

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:56.760
That's Georgian furniture.

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.110
And as I said, there
were four George's

00:59:58.110 --> 00:59:59.640
so English furniture uses those
terms for the Georgian style,

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.940
but by the neo-classical period,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.240
it's often referred
to as [inaudible].

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.540
All right.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.840
Thank you.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.140
