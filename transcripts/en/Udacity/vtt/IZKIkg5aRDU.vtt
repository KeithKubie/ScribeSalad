00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.284
&gt;&gt; Hello, there. Here we are in the Udacity recording studio.

00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:07.120
&gt;&gt; Last lesson, we used objects from the day and picture classes, and that was

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.545
pretty useful. But what if I want to make my own classes?

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:13.325
&gt;&gt; That's what we're going to be covering today. You will learn how to design,

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.924
implement, and document your very own classes.

00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:18.700
&gt;&gt; So then, other people can use my classes in their programs, too.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.730
&gt;&gt; That's right, and it's a really important activity and that's why we're

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.910
covering it early in this course. Let's get going.
