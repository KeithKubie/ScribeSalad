00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.000
[Dr. Meghan Gray] Today, I'm excited because I'm making a video that I've wanted to make for quite a long time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.370
And it's a subject that's close to my heart, because it's about my hometown.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:15.960
I was born and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia and as we film this, we're coming up to the hundredth anniversary

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.070
of one of the most major events in the history of that city. But it's also an event that was marked around the world.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.000
Because it was the largest explosion made by human beings in the Pre-Atomic Era.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.610
Key to understanding this story is understanding the geography of Halifax as a city.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.009
And so I'll sketch it out here.
The main part of Halifax is a peninsula.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.590
Quite a funny shape. In the wider area,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.649
and what made Halifax such an incredible resource, for hundreds of years is...

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.259
the larger picture and the harbor and how it opens up into the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.000
So you have, next to this peninsula, this deep and sheltered basin called the Bedford Basin.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.079
And then, you have this tiny little passage called the Narrows, with a little bump here.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.280
And then this beautiful deep Harbor. 
You've got a few islands here, you've got a big ones here, McNabs Island.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
You've got a little one here.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
Out here is the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.299
Over here is the Bedford Basin.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.139
This side is a city, the city called Halifax.
And on the other side is a city that used to be called Dartmouth.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.869
Now they're put together in one Regional Municipality.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.439
But we'll call them separate sides to keep everything in track. Key to this story is this narrow little passage here.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.749
Which is actually called the Narrows. Let me set the scene for you: 100 years ago, it's

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.960
1917 December, World War 1 is fully in force and this is an incredibly strategic point.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.140
Hundreds of ships could fit in this nice protected Basin.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.000
And then be shepherded over the North Atlantic in convoy to Europe. It's the morning of December 6, 1917.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.829
Halifax is waking up. It's a very busy town. It's got a big naval presence. It's got a big army presence.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.160
So the night before, every night in fact, submarine nets would have come down across the harbor.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.000
To protect all the ships in this part of the basin from U-boat attack.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.599
Submarine nets would have gone down across here and across here and limited the traffic in and out of the harbor.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.869
And so we now have to introduce two boats to our story.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.019
Number 1 is the [SS] Imo, this is a Norwegian registered Belgian relief ship.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.949
So this was a neutral ship that was tasked with carrying supplies

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.590
to give relief to civilians on the continent that had been devastated by war.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.530
So this is sitting here in the basin. It's been sitting there for a while and it's getting impatient.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.820
It's meant to be leaving on the 5th, but by the night of the 5th,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.939
it still hasn't been loaded up with coal and the submarine nets are down.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.820
It's stuck, it wants to go to New York. Coming in from New York, is the [SS] Mont-Blanc.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.139
And this is a French ship and unbeknownst to almost anyone in Halifax. It's carrying. It's loaded.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140
It's packed to the brim with explosives.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.160
So it's also intending to go across the North Atlantic and help with the war effort.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.570
It arrives too late

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.469
to get through the submarine nets, so it spends the night over here, next to McNabs Island.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.679
What happens the next morning, these two ships both want to get through the harbor in different directions.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.959
According to the "rules of the road", they should be passing port side to port side.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.529
Which means they should come across like this (right lane moving) navigating carefully and slowly to get through the Narrows.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.630
However, that's not what happens.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.580
The Imo takes this corner wide to avoid an oncoming ship (passing on the left).

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.459
While the Mont-Blanc is keeping its station on the correct side.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.779
At this point, there are a few kilometers apart, and remember,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.419
it's 1917 and the conventional way of communicating is through whistles.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.530
So the Mont-Blanc whistles first, that means by rights,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.220
they should retain right-of-way. And they say one whistle, "I'm staying where I am"

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.000
The Imo, unbelievably,

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:40.729
responds with a cross signal, two signals whistles, "No, I'm keeping this station." Now we have a problem. The Imo was moving quite fast.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.750
It's not loaded with anything, so it's sitting high in the water.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.759
And it's moving probably faster than the speed limit. The Mont-Blanc cuts its speed.

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.620
Again, one whistle...

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.000
Even moves over slightly to the starboard side, the Dartmouth side. "I'm staying here." Two whistles from the Imo.

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.219
"No, I'm staying here." At this point, heads would have turned. The first exchange,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.699
people are used to that background noise. The second exchange,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.449
people would have known that something unusual was happening. And would have stopped to look. And at that point,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.299
it's quite clear that these two ships are

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.859
heading straight towards each other in this narrow channel, with very little room left to maneuver. Remember how nervous

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:32.329
the captain of the Mont-Blanc must be, he knows what's in his cargo. Cuts his engines, says:

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:40.159
"Ok, I've got to do something to mitigate this situation," cuts his engines, which causes the ship to drift towards the Halifax side.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.969
Had that been the only thing that happened,

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.389
the situation would have been avoided. It would have been a near miss, but at the same time, the Imo

00:05:50.810 --> 00:06:00.000
also cuts its engines. And because it's sitting so high in the water, its propeller has really little purchase and it has very little maneuverability.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:07.098
And so now a collision is absolutely inevitable. And so, the Imo impacts the Mont-Blanc broadside (right),

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.889
like this.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.340
Even then,

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:21.439
a fairly minor collision in the grand scheme of things. What makes this story really interesting, is to understand fully,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.550
what exactly was on the Mont-Blanc. We have a variety of things, all designed to blow up.

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.839
We have 227,000 kilograms of TNT.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.919
Have 1.6 million kilograms of wet picric acid, as well as,

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:48.289
544,000 kilograms of dry picric acid. On top of that, 56,000 kilograms of gun cotton and

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.300
strapped in barrels to the top of the ship, we had

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.379
223,000 kilograms of benzol and monochlorobenzol.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.359
So let's talk about what these things actually are, the benzol and the monochlorobenzol,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:09.470
they're petroleum byproducts and they're used, sort of, in the production of picric acid, which let's talk about a minute.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.649
They're flammable. They are in danger of catching a fire.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.880
What's packed in the holds, however, is something more dangerous.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.540
Now TNT at that time, was

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:36.000
becoming to be used in the production of munitions. It was largely replacing picric acid as the explosive powder

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.649
used in munitions, because picric acid is so incredibly volatile and dangerous.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.250
So while the new TNT was perhaps less powerful as an explosive, it was

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:57.679
relatively speaking, much easier and safer to handle than the picric acid. We've now got our two ships, then they sort of are

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.320
maneuvered apart. Okay?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.130
So they're now separate. The Mont-Blanc

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:09.409
drifting towards the Halifax side. In the initial collision, a fire started on deck. Now it may have been from the sparks.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.709
Caused by the metal hulls grating against each other. It was likely caused by the the simple,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.470
you know detonation, of a few grains of picric acid.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.250
But once the fire took hold, all of these flammable things on the top deck

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:36.030
started to catch fire. And so now, you've got a ship on fire.
[Brady] This is mainly the benzol.
[Dr. Meghan Gray] This is mainly the benzol, yeah.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:43.949
It's spewing off thick oily black smoke, and people are starting to become worried, because the ship is drifting towards the Halifax side.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:50.669
It's heading straight for some of the wooden piers that are the heart of the harbour business. Okay?

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.349
So they're worried that there's gonna be a fire on shore, they're worried about pollution in the harbor from oil.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.350
That would be bad enough. On the ship,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:05.460
the crew immediately know that there is absolutely nothing that they can do to stop this ship from blowing up. I should mention that,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:13.379
in sensible non-war times, if you were carrying a ship like that, you would be flying flags all over the place. Saying...

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.529
You know, "Danger, stay away." For obvious reasons,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:22.079
you don't want to do that in war-time. So very few people actually knew that it was a ship loaded with high munitions.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480
The crew immediately,

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:31.080
seeing how futile the situation was, got into their lifeboats. They start moving towards the Dartmouth side.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.150
They're shouting all the way, there shouting warnings to people. But the warnings are either not heard or they're not

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.829
understood because they're in French. So now we've got the situation where the ship is on fire,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.479
it's now nestled against pier six on the Halifax side. The fire is raging,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.479
the benzol and then later the monochlorobenzol

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.090
is reaching boiling points. Those barrels are shooting up into the air and exploding.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.459
So it's a big spectacle, people are rushing to windows. They're rushing down the streets to see what's going on.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.800
What's happening in the hold,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:08.609
it that these are hermetically, they're carefully constructed holds. To hold these high explosives.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:18.000
The fire is raging, the temperatures are increasing, and whether eventually it's from the incredibly high

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:25.590
temperatures and pressures inside these sealed compartments, or whether it's an impact from these exploding barrels coming down and hitting the deck.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.950
Detonation occurs: the picric acid

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:37.829
explodes, sends a shock wave through the neighboring barrels, the hold explodes, sends an air blast the rest of the ship.

00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:42.389
One by one, the holds full of dry picric acid.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:47.818
The wet picric acid and the gun cotton, which have the water inside them evaporated,

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:50.849
turning them into high explosives as well.

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:53.999
Detonates as well.

00:10:55.119 --> 00:11:00.599
You've now got a ship with three kilotons of high explosives,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.899
which is now the largest bomb that human beings have ever made and at 09:04 on December 6th, 1917,

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:09.299
it exploded.

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:17.849
Well instantly, there is a massive fireball that reaches 5000 degrees Celsius.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.489
That's nearly the temperature of the surface of the Sun.

00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:23.069
And it engulfs the neighboring streets.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:26.759
[Brady] But people on the land...
[Dr. Meghan Gray] The people on the land, incinerated.

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:32.758
The Mont-Blanc, three million kilograms of iron hull,

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:35.889
destroyed.

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:43.228
White-hot shards of iron are flown through the air. Faster than bullets and rained down on the neighboring area.

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:45.509
Most devastating was the air blast.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:50.548
Traveling a 1000 metres per second, through the narrow streets. It causes

00:11:51.489 --> 00:11:57.989
unimaginable devastation to houses, to human beings, to the whole whole city.

00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:02.758
Remember that many of these people are standing looking at this spectacle.

00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:09.118
Lining the steep hills, leading down to the harbor, looking out at the burning ship.

00:12:09.549 --> 00:12:16.168
When it explodes, all of the windows in the city exploded as well. And most of them are driven inwards.

00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:23.249
Horrifically injuring people. Everything that wasn't immediately blown up as a structure, catches on fire.

00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:26.279
It's a huge firestorm throughout the city. As the air blast

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:30.988
goes out, and the gas is cool. The air rushes back in again and

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.799
tornados full of debris, start sweeping through the streets. The 1.4 thousand kilogram

00:12:38.289 --> 00:12:40.499
anchor of the Mont Blanc was flown

00:12:41.169 --> 00:12:43.499
kilometres away. Way over on the

00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:48.628
other side of the city and can still be seen today where it landed.

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:53.428
Going back to what happened in the harbor, the expanding gases push the water away,

00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:56.668
forming a hole in the in the water in the harbor.

00:12:56.829 --> 00:13:00.418
Just like when you throw something into a pond, and and you see the ripples rebound,

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:04.948
caused a huge geyser to appear in the harbor.

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:10.649
That sucked water away from the opposite shores and then sent a huge tsunami

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:17.909
funneled down these narrow harbor walls, reaching 20 feet in height, causing even more devastation.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:21.928
At the end of that morning, you had 2,000 people dead,

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:25.228
9,000 people severely injured,

00:13:25.899 --> 00:13:27.899
12,000 homes destroyed and

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:30.220
every single

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.669
building within a 12 mile radius damaged.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.559
[Brady] You can find out more about the Halifax Explosion.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:44.600
Including some links in the video description, and I'll also have details about more from this interview with Dr. Gray.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:51.049
Also thanks to Neil Barnes from our chemistry channel, Periodic Videos for helping out with some of these demonstrations.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.949
And you can find out more about Periodic Videos, also in the video description.
