00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Just as a note, one of the interesting things about getting customers is--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I happen to draw the funnel that says awareness, interest, consideration,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and purchase, but here's just a heads up.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In your funnel, in your physical channel, you might decide the steps are slightly different.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now you feel locked in to calling them awareness, interest, consideration and purchase,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
just realize that you need to modify these to what your real cycle is and you will only kind of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
learn that as you watch customers get from being aware of your product to purchase.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Use this as a template but don't think that there's anything magic about this.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's just a proxy.
