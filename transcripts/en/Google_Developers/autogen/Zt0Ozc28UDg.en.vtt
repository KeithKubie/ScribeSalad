00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.759
youtube developer relations team and
we're continuing a series of videos

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
we're continuing a series of videos
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.220
we're continuing a series of videos
talking about the migration that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
talking about the migration that
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.800
talking about the migration that
developers might have from going from

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
developers might have from going from
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.500
developers might have from going from
version 2 of the YouTube data API to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
version 2 of the YouTube data API to
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.990
version 2 of the YouTube data API to
version 3 we strongly encourage all

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
version 3 we strongly encourage all
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.300
version 3 we strongly encourage all
developers to start that migration if

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
developers to start that migration if
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.939
developers to start that migration if
they haven't done so yet and today we're

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
they haven't done so yet and today we're
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.390
they haven't done so yet and today we're
gonna be talking about a way of

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400
gonna be talking about a way of
 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.560
gonna be talking about a way of
subscribing to a user's channel and show

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
subscribing to a user's channel and show
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930
subscribing to a user's channel and show
how that's changed between version 2 and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
how that's changed between version 2 and
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.890
how that's changed between version 2 and
version 3 of the API so let's first talk

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900
version 3 of the API so let's first talk
 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.420
version 3 of the API so let's first talk
a little bit about how you would

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
a little bit about how you would
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.369
a little bit about how you would
subscribe to a given YouTube channel in

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
subscribe to a given YouTube channel in
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.039
subscribe to a given YouTube channel in
version 2 of the API and I just have a

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:46.049
version 2 of the API and I just have a
 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.609
version 2 of the API and I just have a
page in the documentation up here to

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:49.619
page in the documentation up here to
 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.340
page in the documentation up here to
just give an overview for folks who

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
just give an overview for folks who
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.899
just give an overview for folks who
aren't familiar this is the actual

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909
aren't familiar this is the actual
 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.670
aren't familiar this is the actual
restful api call that you would use in

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
restful api call that you would use in
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.670
restful api call that you would use in
version 2 you know everything again is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
version 2 you know everything again is
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.009
version 2 you know everything again is
adam xml-based so you have this pretty

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019
adam xml-based so you have this pretty
 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.740
adam xml-based so you have this pretty
big XML document that you would pass in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
big XML document that you would pass in
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.950
big XML document that you would pass in
in a post request that's been

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960
in a post request that's been
 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.590
in a post request that's been
authenticated obviously and you know

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
authenticated obviously and you know
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.690
authenticated obviously and you know
this will end up subscribing to a given

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
this will end up subscribing to a given
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580
this will end up subscribing to a given
channel so you know that does work but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
channel so you know that does work but
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.080
channel so you know that does work but
let's talk about how you would do that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
let's talk about how you would do that
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260
let's talk about how you would do that
in the more modern version 3 of the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
in the more modern version 3 of the
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.390
in the more modern version 3 of the
YouTube data API so to start in version

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
YouTube data API so to start in version
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.190
YouTube data API so to start in version
3 we operate on channel IDs rather than

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
3 we operate on channel IDs rather than
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.320
3 we operate on channel IDs rather than
legacy usernames and this is

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330
legacy usernames and this is
 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
legacy usernames and this is
particularly important because there are

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
particularly important because there are
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.480
particularly important because there are
not a legacy usernames for every given

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
not a legacy usernames for every given
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.220
not a legacy usernames for every given
YouTube channel there are channels out

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230
YouTube channel there are channels out
 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.899
YouTube channel there are channels out
there that just have channel IDs

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
there that just have channel IDs
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.290
there that just have channel IDs
associated with them so using a channel

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300
associated with them so using a channel
 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.530
associated with them so using a channel
ID consistently throughout version 3 of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
ID consistently throughout version 3 of
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.350
ID consistently throughout version 3 of
the API means you could deal the exact

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
the API means you could deal the exact
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.899
the API means you could deal the exact
same way with any type of channel even

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
same way with any type of channel even
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.340
same way with any type of channel even
these newer channels that don't have

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
these newer channels that don't have
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.980
these newer channels that don't have
legacy usernames but that also means

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
legacy usernames but that also means
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.930
legacy usernames but that also means
that if we do have a channel and we know

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940
that if we do have a channel and we know
 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.450
that if we do have a channel and we know
that what the legacy username is we need

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
that what the legacy username is we need
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.430
that what the legacy username is we need
to first translate that legacy username

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440
to first translate that legacy username
 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.280
to first translate that legacy username
into a channel ID so let's do that using

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
into a channel ID so let's do that using
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.820
into a channel ID so let's do that using
the v3 API call YouTube channels that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830
the v3 API call YouTube channels that
 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.699
the v3 API call YouTube channels that
list I'm going to show an example of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
list I'm going to show an example of
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.770
list I'm going to show an example of
making this API call from within the API

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
making this API call from within the API
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.160
making this API call from within the API
Explorer which is just a web-based

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
Explorer which is just a web-based
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.800
Explorer which is just a web-based
harness for making API calls

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
harness for making API calls
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.350
harness for making API calls
and just kind of simplifies things it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360
and just kind of simplifies things it's
 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.230
and just kind of simplifies things it's
a great way to play around with the API

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240
a great way to play around with the API
 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.660
a great way to play around with the API
before you actually start writing code

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
before you actually start writing code
 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.330
before you actually start writing code
using our client libraries if you wanted

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340
using our client libraries if you wanted
 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.640
using our client libraries if you wanted
to just experiment with what different

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
to just experiment with what different
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.340
to just experiment with what different
API parameters do really highly

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350
API parameters do really highly
 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.770
API parameters do really highly
encourage that you check it out so in

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780
encourage that you check it out so in
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.870
encourage that you check it out so in
this particular case we want to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880
this particular case we want to
 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.120
this particular case we want to
translate a user name into a channel ID

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130
translate a user name into a channel ID
 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.430
translate a user name into a channel ID
so in v3 there's this concept of a part

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440
so in v3 there's this concept of a part
 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.760
so in v3 there's this concept of a part
parameter that most of our operations

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770
parameter that most of our operations
 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.820
parameter that most of our operations
take and I'm gonna say in this

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830
take and I'm gonna say in this
 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.710
take and I'm gonna say in this
particular case I want the ID part

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720
particular case I want the ID part
 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.800
particular case I want the ID part
returned think of this as a way of kind

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810
returned think of this as a way of kind
 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.229
returned think of this as a way of kind
of limiting the response that you get

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239
of limiting the response that you get
 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.180
of limiting the response that you get
back from the API so that it only in

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
back from the API so that it only in
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.979
back from the API so that it only in
contains information that you

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989
contains information that you
 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.290
contains information that you
specifically asked for instead of

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300
specifically asked for instead of
 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.809
specifically asked for instead of
receiving you know really large document

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819
receiving you know really large document
 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.840
receiving you know really large document
that has all the details about a channel

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850
that has all the details about a channel
 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.490
that has all the details about a channel
I'm saying here all I want back is the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
I'm saying here all I want back is the
 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.449
I'm saying here all I want back is the
ID ID so this is going to result in fast

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459
ID ID so this is going to result in fast
 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.580
ID ID so this is going to result in fast
response it's great for you know

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
response it's great for you know
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.710
response it's great for you know
contexts where you might have limited

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720
contexts where you might have limited
 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.259
contexts where you might have limited

that you pour through it a little bit it

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630
that you pour through it a little bit it
 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.940
that you pour through it a little bit it
looks a little daunting and that there's

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950
looks a little daunting and that there's
 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.560
looks a little daunting and that there's
a whole bunch of different kind of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570
a whole bunch of different kind of
 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.540
a whole bunch of different kind of
methods listed over here on the left

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550

hand side that you navigate through but
 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.860
hand side that you navigate through but
I think you'll find that all of the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870
I think you'll find that all of the
 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.279
I think you'll find that all of the
methods follow very very consistent

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289
methods follow very very consistent
 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.019

interface and naming conventions that
 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.850
interface and naming conventions that
are used throughout and once you kind of

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860
are used throughout and once you kind of
 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.010
are used throughout and once you kind of
get familiar with making API calls

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020
