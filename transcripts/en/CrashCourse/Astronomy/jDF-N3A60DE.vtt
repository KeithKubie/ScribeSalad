00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.820
Compared to human experience, the Universe
has been around a long time: nearly 14 billion years.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.740
That’s a soul-crushingly long time. That’s
older than Earth, older than the Sun, older

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.000
than, well, everything. Pretty much by definition.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.869
And yet, when you think about time itself,
how long is 14 billion years, really? It seems

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.189
like a long time to us, now. But time keeps
on slippin’ into the future, and every day

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.109
the Universe is a little bit older. I mean
sure, duh, of course it is.

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.540
But have you ever really thought about what
that means? Someday the Universe will be 20

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.480
billion years old. 30. Then 50 billion, a
hundred billion, a trillion… and even then

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.060
the clock still ticks. Those numbers sound
abstract, but those days will inevitably come.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.360
Time runs long. What will the Universe look
like in that far, far future?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.060
Different. It’ll look different.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.920
We’re about to go on a long journey. Literally the
longest possible. We’re going to the end of the universe.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.300
First, a bit of a content warning: The stuff
I’m going to show you today is incredibly

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.680
interesting, incredibly cool… and, well…maybe
a wee bit distressing to some people. But

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.640
I want to say that it’s not all darkness
and dissolution.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.350
Well, to be honest, it’s mostly darkness
and dissolution, but there is some light,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.010
almost literally, at the end of the long,
long tunnel.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.960
I’m going to have to use some pretty big
numbers in this episode, and by big, I mean

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.810
BIG. Probably bigger than any numbers you’ve
come across before! I’ll have to use scientific

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.700
notation, which is a shorthand way of expressing
numbers using powers of ten.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.880
For example, the number 100 is equal to 10
x 10, so we say it’s “ten squared,”

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.040
or “ten to the power of two.” 1000 is
10 x 10 x 10, so it’s ten cubed, ten to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.950
the third power.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.460
This might seems silly for smaller numbers,
but it gets useful for much larger ones. A

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.399
million is 10 to the 6th, a billion is 10
to the 9th, and so on. Mind you, every time

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.230
the power, the exponent, goes up by one, the
actual number is ten times bigger. So 10 to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.439
the 18th isn’t twice as big as 10 to the
9th, it’s a billion times bigger!

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.629
At different times in the life of the Universe,
different objects dominate. For example, in

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.980
the current Universe, NOW, you can make the
case that stars are the dominant objects;

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.450
they produce the most amount of energy. Before
stars, something else was. Dispersed plasma,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.189
I suppose, generally speaking.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.029
Astronomers Fred Adams and Greg Laughlin looked
at what will happen to the Universe on very

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:44.230
long time scales, and divided it into five
broad epochs. Then wrote about it in their

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.129
book, The Five Ages of the Universe, which
is a pretty good read. Their divisions aren’t

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.049
official in any way, but I think they did
a good job given what we know, so let’s

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:52.540
use them.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.870
First came the Primordial Era, which we already
went over in the last episode. It’s basically

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.139
everything from the moment the Universe big
banged up to when the first stars formed,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.799
about 400 million years later.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.129
The second era is the one we live in now,
where stars rule the night. This is the Stelliferous

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.959
Era. We’re about 13.4 billion years into
it.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.239
But how long will it last? Or to phrase it
another way, when will the last star die?

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.099
The lower the mass of a star the longer it
will “live,” steadily fusing hydrogen

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.260
into helium at a very slow rate. Models indicate
the lowest mass red dwarf can do this for

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.349
about a trillion years.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.299
That is a long time. A red dwarf that formed
when the Universe was young would only now

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.059
have used up about 1% of its hydrogen, and
has about 99% of its life ahead of it. In

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.260
human terms, they’re still infants.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.519
Right now, galaxies are merrily churning away,
converting nebular gas into stars. But eventually

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.419
that gas will run out. Estimates vary, but
star formation in most galaxies will start

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.959
to peter out in a few billion years. Fewer
stars will be born, and the ones already born

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.620
will start to die off. Galaxy collisions and
other events may trigger star formation after

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.559
that, so maybe that’ll extend things a bit.
But even if it lasts another 50 billion years,

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.709
or a hundred, it hardly matters.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.150
When the longest star sticks around for a
trillion years, why quibble about a few billion

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.980
here and there?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.750
As this happens, galaxies will change color
and fade. Most spiral galaxies have disks

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.949
that are a vibrant blue in color, the massive
hot luminous stars dominating their emission.

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.409
But as these stars die and the fainter, lower
mass stars take over, the galaxy will redden

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:30.250
and dim. A few billion years after the nebular
gas runs out the only stars left will be those

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.340
long-lived red dwarfs.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.460
In a trillion years, this is what awaits us.
It may take longer; I’ve seen some calculations

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.629
that show the very lowest mass stars MIGHT
last ten times that long. Whatever. I’m

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.919
not going to worry too much over factors of
ten here or there. As the Universe ages, those

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.909
are essentially statistical fluctuations.

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.699
But when that does happen, when the last star
dies, it means that the only objects left

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.889
in the Universe generating appreciable energy
will be the corpses of stars: white dwarfs,

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.120
neutron stars, and black holes. And, to be
fair, brown dwarfs as well, those objects

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.479
intermediate in mass between stars and planets.

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.789
With the exception of black holes, these objects
are supported by various forms of degeneracy

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.939
pressure. That means, in a few trillion years,
it will be the end of the Stelliferous Era,

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.840
and the start of the Degenerate Era.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.590
The Universe will be dark. Dark to human eyes,
at least, assuming we have eyes in a trillion

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.189
years, or that we’re even around. In the
infrared things are a bit brighter; many of

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.599
these objects will be glowing at those wavelengths
since they’ll be warm.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.819
Well, lukewarm. Neutron stars and white dwarfs
are born very hot, and fade over time. How

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.900
long that takes depends on how massive they
are and other factors, but it’s safe to

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.289
assume that they’ll have cooled to room
temperature at best in a few trillion years.

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.780
And the deeper we get into the Degenerate
Era, the cooler they’ll be.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.650
They’ll have their moments though, because
over trillions of years, binary white dwarf

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.310
orbits will decay, and the stars will merge
and explode as supernovae. Binary neutron

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.960
stars will merge and form gamma-ray bursts
too, explosions so bright they’ll outshine

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.819
a thousand galaxies in this far-flung future.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.189
Briefly. These are short-lived events, and
soon thereafter the Universe will return to

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.800
darkness.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.500
Interestingly, brown dwarfs are a better bet
as an energy source. Binary brown dwarfs could

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.879
merge to form a relatively normal if low-mass
star that could shine for hundreds of billions

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:23.469
of years. But again, time is long. After a
quadrillion years, this too shall pass.

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.360
Stars just ain’t what they used to be.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.560
In fact, in the Degenerate Era, neither is
the Universe.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.909
In our dark energy episode, I mentioned that
as the Universe expands, our view of it will

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:38.020
shrink. At the same time, all the galaxies
in the Local Group will collide and merge,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.689
forming one big elliptical galaxy. By deep
into the Degenerate Era, all we’ll be able

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:47.199
to see is our own bloated, dark galaxy; the
rest of the Universe will be forever cut off

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:47.879
from us.

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:50.169
Not that there’ll be all that much to see
anyway.

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.800
And I hate to say this, but even THAT won’t
last.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.039
Our models of how subatomic particles behave
predicts that over very long periods of time,

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.689
protons — the positively charged particles
in the nuclei of atoms — will decay. The

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:06.789
half-life of such an event is brain-hurtingly
long, at least 1034 years, and it’s almost

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:07.849
certainly longer.

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:14.550
But the Degenerate Era is longer yet. As protons
decay, one by one, matter itself will disintegrate.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.610
White dwarfs, neutron stars, brown dwarfs,
planets: All of them will dissolve as their

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.759
constituent protons decay. There’s an upside,
kinda. Adam and Laughlin calculate that proton

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.340
decay, which releases a tiny bit of energy,
will cause white dwarfs to radiate heat with

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.319
about the energy of 400 Watts. Mind you, the
microwave oven in my kitchen generates more

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:40.080
power, and it’s a lot smaller than a white
dwarf. But comparatively, in 1038 years, this’ll

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.060
look like a bright star does to us now.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.849
By 1040 or so years from now, even degenerate
stars will be gone. The only big objects that

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:49.629
will be left are black holes.

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.560
Thus begins the Black Hole Era.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.240
Black holes don’t generate a lot of energy
unless they happen to suck down a large amount

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.909
of material that can be torn apart and turned
into an accretion disk. Otherwise, basically

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:01.129
they just sit there.

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:04.629
However, there is a way black holes can make
energy: They evaporate.

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:09.300
I KNOW. Most people think that black holes
can only eat stuff, and once it’s in there,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.490
that’s where it is forever.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:18.210
Oh, but that’s a pesky word: “forever.”
When you’re talking 1050, 1060, 1090 years,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.849
what does “forever” mean?

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:24.389
Back in the 1970s, physicist Stephen Hawking
worked out the math of black holes combined

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:29.629
with quantum mechanics, and discovered that
under some circumstances they can emit particles.

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:34.729
This is a very weak effect, and has extraordinarily
complicated physical mechanisms behind it

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:39.070
— check the dooblydoo for links that explain
it. But the end result is that black holes

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:44.260
can very slowly leak mass, and the more massive
they are, the slower the leak.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.870
How slow? A black hole with three times the
Sun’s mass, the minimum size for one created

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:55.370
in a supernova, will take about 1068 years
to evaporate. That’s a ridiculously long

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.410
time… but the Universe can wait.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:02.900
Even supermassive black holes in galactic
centers evaporate. It takes them — get this

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.000
— 10^92 years.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.760
10 to the 92nd power. That number is so huge,
so colossally ridiculous, that I can’t even

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:17.470
come up with an analogy for it. It’s a 1
followed by 92 zeroes. There aren’t even

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.530
that many subatomic particles in the entire
Universe.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.720
See what I mean? Ridiculous. That’s the
length of time we’re talking here.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:30.410
But it’ll happen. Eventually. As black holes
lose mass they emit particles and energy faster,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.080
so each time one evaporates completely it’ll
emit a flare of light like a small bomb going

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.410
off. During the Black Hole Era, that’ll
be the only source of energy in the Universe.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.950
Eventually, they’ll all go away. And…
that’ll be it. There won’t be anything

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.720
else in the Universe except subatomic particles
and photons, and they’ll all be so low energy

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.310
they might as well not exist. That’ll happen
pretty much by 1092 or 93 years from now.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:10:00.450
At this point, the Universe, it’s safe to
say, is dead. Kaput. Done. We have entered

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:07.030
the ominously named Dark Era. It’ll stretch
to infinity, if time even has any meaning by then.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:12.450
That’s awful. I mean, seriously, writing
about this and talking about it is hard because

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:18.280
it’s not fun to think about this stuff. I mean, it IS,
kinda, but when you internalize it it’s bleak.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.200
There IS another idea that would prevent this
potentially eternal darkness from happening,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.680
but you won’t like it much.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.160
Dark energy is pumping up the Universal expansion,
causing it to accelerate. We don’t know

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.140
much about dark energy; we don’t even know
what it is. We do know that the cosmic horizon,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.190
how far out we can see into the Universe,
is shrinking as the expansion accelerates.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:44.450
One idea (among many) about dark energy is
that its influence will get stronger and stronger.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.310
As it does, the horizon will shrink ever faster,
closing in on us more and more rapidly.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.580
But that’s not some illusion, it’s a physical
limit to the Universe, a stretching of spacetime.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.690
No force — not gravity or electromagnetism
or anything — can cross it. It will be as

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:05.380
if that part of the Universe across the horizon
is ripped away from us, stretched beyond breaking.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.050
Over time, according to this hypothesis, the
cosmic horizon will eventually shrink until

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.700
it’s smaller than our galaxy, smaller than
the nearest stars, smaller than the solar

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.440
system, smaller than our planet… and it’ll
keep shrinking until it’s smaller than a

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.990
subatomic particle! When that happens it’ll
be as if the Universe is torn apart at the

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.170
most fundamental quantum level.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.750
Astronomers call this the Big Rip. We have
no idea if it will actually happen or not,

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.050
but if it does it’ll be many billions of
years from now, long after the Sun dies but

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.700
long before the Dark Era.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.040
I’m not particularly comforted by this idea,
but the good news is that this idea isn’t

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.290
really much more than conjecture. As we learn
more about dark energy we’ll learn more

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.730
about its eventual influence on the fate of
the cosmos.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.560
Yay?

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.700
So. Is there any reprieve?

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.000
Maybe. It’s possible, though by no means
proven, that our Universe is one of many Universes.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.880
A multiverse, if you will. Those other Universes
may be ticking along just fine long after

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.530
ours has wound down. Of course, we can’t
get to them, but still. Good on them.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.970
And there’s another idea. It’s a little
far-fetched, but not completely outside the

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.550
realm of physics as we know it.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.410
We think of the vacuum of space as being devoid
of energy, empty. But there’s an idea in

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:21.040
quantum mechanics that this might be an illusion.
There might yet be a lower energy state we

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.610
don’t see. Think of it like a staircase.
You’ve been standing on what you think is

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.350
the bottom step, but then you find out you’re
actually one step up from that.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:33.320
Our Universe may be narrowly balanced on this
second-to-lowest step. It’ll stay there,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.450
but if something bumps it, down it goes.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:40.040
It’s possible that somewhere, out in the
dark, dead Universe, for whatever reason,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.360
after a gazillion years, some small bit of
space will quantumly jostled, and drop down

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.680
to that next lower state, the true vacuum.
What happens when it does?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.740
It’ll bump the regions around it, and they’ll
drop. And so on, and so on. Here’s the weird

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.730
part — well, it’s all weird, but here’s
the really weird part: Inside this region,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:05.430
the laws of physics get rewritten. How? We
don’t know. As far as we know, we can’t

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:10.670
know what happens in there. But in a sense
it will erase space and time inside it.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.870
Like, poof. Gone. Everything changes, at some
fundamental level we can’t even understand.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.260
This wave of destruction expands at the speed
of light, engulfing all of what remains of

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.170
the Universe. What is left behind in its wake
is... something new. Something different.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.000
We literally can’t know.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.050
This idea actually gives me hope. Think of
it as a cosmic reboot. The Universe has led

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:37.550
a long, long life, and lingered an unimaginably
slow death. This gives it a new lease, a chance

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.500
to start over again. Maybe this is similar
to how our Universe came into being in the

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.360
first place, as a quantum fluctuation in some
other Universe, budding off from there to

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.180
create everything we know.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.550
Maybe this has happened before and will happen
again. Over and again, an infinite number

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:57.780
of times. I have to say, I like this idea.
If it’s true — and we don’t know, it’s

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.790
just conjecture at this point — but if it
IS true, then it’s not the death of our

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.670
one Universe. It’s the opportunity for the
birth of an infinite number more.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.000
And that is perhaps the single most hopeful
thing I know.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.290
Today you learned that our Universe’s days
are numbered. Stars will die out after a few

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:20.110
trillion years, protons will decay and matter
will dissolve after a thousand trillion trillion

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:26.330
trillion years, black holes will evaporate
after 1092 years, and then all will be dark.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.250
But there’s hope that a new Universe will
be born from it.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.540
There’s always hope.
