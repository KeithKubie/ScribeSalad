00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.545
Voiceover: So what do we have right here?

00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:05.907
Well this is just a water molecule.

00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:07.335
And this right over here, let's see,

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:11.846
we have 1, 2, 3 carbons in our backbone

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:15.431
so this would be meth eth propane.

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:16.887
We all have single bonds right here,

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:18.672
so this is propane.

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:19.932
Let me write that out.

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:23.973
This is, give myself some space, propane.

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:25.671
And then on the number 2 carbon,

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.570
I have both a methyl
group and a bromo group

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.732
and bromo comes before
methyl in alphabetical order.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:34.938
So I could write this as 2 bromo,

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:38.441
2 bromo, 2 methyl,

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:45.519
2 methyl, methyl propane.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.051
So that's this molecule that
we have right over here.

00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:49.250
Now what we're going to imagine,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.444
it's sitting in some water

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:53.320
and I have 1 water molecule
drawn right over here.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.339
Let's imagine that we have
this bromine right over here.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.649
It's pretty neutral.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:58.667
And it's neutral because it has-

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:02.049
or it is neutral because
it has 7 valence electrons.

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.685
1, 2, or you could say- or
it has the charge equivalent

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:06.701
as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:08.599
And then it has half of this bond

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:10.685
that's composed of 2 electrons.

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:14.301
So that's what's keeping
this neutral right over here.

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:16.574
But we do know that bromine,

00:01:16.574 --> 00:01:20.172
well you know, it's not
completely unstable.

00:01:20.172 --> 00:01:22.458
If it were to take an electron,

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.552
because that would get it
to 8 valence electrons,

00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:26.963
we know that it's more
electro-negative than carbon

00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:28.487
which means that if it's sharing a bond,

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:32.576
it's more likely to take the
entire bond than carbon is.

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:34.602
So let's imagine a scenario.

00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:36.952
Let's imagine a scenario where bromine

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:41.058
takes these 2 carbons in
this bond right over here.

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:43.984
And this isn't going to be a
super fast thing that happens

00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:45.710
because this molecule right over here,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.454
the 2 bromo 2 methyl propane

00:01:47.454 --> 00:01:48.823
is actually reasonably stable,

00:01:48.823 --> 00:01:50.028
so I'm not saying that this is

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:51.123
going to just happen automatically.

00:01:51.123 --> 00:01:52.498
It's going to happen super fast,

00:01:52.498 --> 00:01:53.997
but it could happen.

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.022
And so to show that this isn't going to be

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:58.098
you know, only one-way reaction,

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.067
I'll show that it's an equilibrium.

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:03.410
So the equilibrium, I'll
draw 2 arrows like that.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.390
So, once this happens, the bromine

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.495
would turn into a bromide anion.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.564
So let me draw that right over here.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:12.506
So the bromide anion.

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:16.466
So it's going to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:19.611
and then both electrons
from that shared bond.

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.692
Both electrons from that shared bond.

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:26.972
It now has a negative 1 charge.

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:28.114
Now if that happened,

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.452
what would happen to this leftover,

00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:32.198
to I guess what's now going to be

00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:35.649
the thing that bromine

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.659
was connected to I guess you could say.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.200
Let's draw that.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.857
So we have this carbon,
our number 2 carbon.

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:45.890
We have CH3 right over there.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.153
Then we go back to a CH3

00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:51.586
and then we had this blue methyl group.

00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:53.815
So, I'll add this blue
methyl group right over here

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:54.871
and the way I'm drawing it,

00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.187
it kind of pops out of the page.

00:02:57.187 --> 00:03:00.178
My best attempt to draw it
popping out of the page.

00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:05.034
So this is it popping out of the page.

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:07.784
And now, what's its charge going to be?

00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:10.041
Well it just gave up half of this bond,

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.890
the equivalent of an electron's charge.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.071
So it just gave up, you
can kind of think of it,

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.641
as giving up an electron,

00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:19.840
so this is going to
have a positive charge.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.880
This is going to have a positive charge.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.137
A positive charged carbon like this,

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:27.658
we would call this a carbocation.

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:34.405
So this right over here is a
carbocation, positive charge.

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:37.939
And the reason why this is
not a crazy thing to happen

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.842
is that this is a tertiary carbon,

00:03:39.842 --> 00:03:42.126
which means that it is
connected to 3 other carbons.

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:43.612
1, 2, 3.

00:03:43.612 --> 00:03:45.777
A tertiary carbon, one
way to think about it,

00:03:45.777 --> 00:03:49.646
is that this positive
charge can kind of be shared

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.764
with its brothers a little bit more.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:55.025
So tertiary, a tertiary
carbocation is more stable

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:56.435
than a secondary and definitely

00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:57.942
more stable than a primary.

00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:58.796
A secondary would be

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.284
if it was only connected to 2 carbons,

00:04:00.284 --> 00:04:02.245
but this is tertiary so
let me write this down.

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:04.983
This is a tertiary carbocation.

00:04:04.983 --> 00:04:08.618
This carbon is connected
to 3 other carbons.

00:04:08.618 --> 00:04:10.631
That's where the tertiary comes from.

00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.918
So once again, it can happen.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.164
I'm not saying that this reaction's

00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:16.043
just going to go super
fast in that direction.

00:04:16.043 --> 00:04:18.345
That's why we did these equilibriums.

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:20.917
These equilibrium arrows.

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.494
Now let's bring this oxygen into play.

00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:26.481
So let's bring- now let's bring-

00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:30.595
sorry not the oxygen, let's
bring this water into play.

00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:33.476
So this water, as you can
imagine, the water's neutral

00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:36.794
and it seems pretty
reasonable in this state,

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:41.051
but the oxygen end of the water does have

00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:42.800
a partial negative charge.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.411
We've seen in the past.

00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:47.944
We've seen in the past that

00:04:47.944 --> 00:04:49.057
because oxygen is

00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:51.072
a lot more electronegative
than the hydrogens,

00:04:51.072 --> 00:04:52.561
that you have a partial negative side

00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:54.242
on the side of the oxygens

00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:56.445
and you have a partial positive charge

00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:59.820
on the side of the hydrogens.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.683
On the side of the hydrogens.

00:05:01.683 --> 00:05:04.044
And so you have this positive carbocation.

00:05:04.044 --> 00:05:05.847
This has a partially negative charge.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.565
So you can imagine that this molecule

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:11.995
might be attracted to this nucleus.

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:13.748
Now it's not going to be super attracted

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:15.811
the way that an hydroxide anion would.

00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:18.232
A hydroxide anion has
a full negative charge.

00:05:18.232 --> 00:05:20.189
This only has a little
partial negative charge.

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.720
But it could still be
attracted to something

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.676
very positive like this.

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:26.344
So in this situation, the water molecule

00:05:26.344 --> 00:05:28.876
is a weak nucleophile.

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:32.038
So this is a weak nucleophile.

00:05:32.038 --> 00:05:34.686
Not as strong as a hydroxide anion

00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:35.900
that has a full negative charge,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.528
but if it sees something
positive like this

00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:39.111
and it bumps in the right way,

00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:41.789
you could imagine that one of these pairs

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.632
of this oxygen would then go-

00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:48.772
one of these pairs on
this oxygen would then go

00:05:48.772 --> 00:05:52.727
and essentially form a
bond with this carbon,

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:58.257
making this carbon
right over here neutral.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.284
So what is that going to look like?

00:05:59.284 --> 00:06:01.303
And this might happen,
this would happen faster

00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:03.307
so I'm not going to do
this as an equilibrium.

00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:06.489
This could happen like this.

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:10.308
And let me- let me just
copy and paste the bromine

00:06:10.308 --> 00:06:13.183
so I don't have to redraw the whole thing.

00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:17.313
So, let me copy and let me paste it

00:06:17.313 --> 00:06:19.930
so that's our bromine right over there.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.580
Draw it right there.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.606
Actually let me erase that little smudge

00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:27.049
and make sure it still
has a negative charge.

00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:30.093
So, negative charge.

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:31.376
It's a bromide anion.

00:06:31.376 --> 00:06:34.056
Now let me draw everything else.

00:06:34.056 --> 00:06:36.881
So I have this carbon,

00:06:36.881 --> 00:06:38.547
this carbon, let me
scroll down a little bit

00:06:38.547 --> 00:06:39.722
so I have some space.

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:41.672
Carbon, I have the carbon in the back.

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:43.091
CH3.

00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:44.497
I have the carbon on top.

00:06:44.497 --> 00:06:46.316
CH3.

00:06:46.316 --> 00:06:48.266
I have the carbon in front.

00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:51.968
I have the carbon in front like that.

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:53.775
CH3.

00:06:53.775 --> 00:06:55.339
And now my oxygen,

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.477
or I should say this
molecule right over here,

00:06:57.477 --> 00:07:00.496
the water molecule has
attached to the carbon.

00:07:00.496 --> 00:07:03.644
So these 2 electrons,

00:07:03.644 --> 00:07:05.785
you could say they've attacked the carbon.

00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:08.702
They now form a bond with the carbon.

00:07:08.702 --> 00:07:11.180
So these are those 2 electrons

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.899
in this covalent bond.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.779
And now let's draw the rest of this.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:16.714
So you have the oxygen.

00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:18.532
You have these 2
electrons right over here.

00:07:18.532 --> 00:07:20.153
These 2 valence electrons.

00:07:20.153 --> 00:07:24.948
Then you have 1 hydrogen
and then another hydrogen.

00:07:24.948 --> 00:07:27.961
Now what is going to be the charge,

00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:29.348
what is going to be the charge

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.089
right over here on the oxygen?

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:33.946
Well it was, it had a
partial negative charge

00:07:33.946 --> 00:07:35.527
because it's more electronegative

00:07:35.527 --> 00:07:39.056
but it just gave, it just gave the

00:07:39.056 --> 00:07:40.841
essentially half of a bond,

00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:41.808
half of a pair.

00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:44.674
It's now sharing a pair with this carbon.

00:07:44.674 --> 00:07:46.985
So it's equivalent to
giving up 1 electron's

00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:48.941
equivalent of charge so you would now say

00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:52.762
that this thing right now has a positive,

00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:54.374
a positive charge.

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:56.259
So you could imagine,

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.437
you could imagine,

00:07:57.437 --> 00:08:00.084
maybe another water molecule comes along

00:08:00.084 --> 00:08:01.816
maybe another water molecule comes along.

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:04.480
Let me draw a water
molecule right over here.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.424
We're sitting in water

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:07.610
so there's plenty of water molecules.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.576
So another water molecule might come along

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:14.646
and say, okay well this
thing right over here

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:20.123
is positive but the oxygen
is hogging these bonds

00:08:20.123 --> 00:08:21.531
a little bit more than the hydrogen,

00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:24.064
especially now that it's become positive.

00:08:24.064 --> 00:08:28.529
So this might give its
pair to a hydrogen proton

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:30.169
and then this hydrogen-

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:31.741
and then this bond with the hydrogen

00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:36.152
will go entirely, entirely to the oxygen.

00:08:36.152 --> 00:08:38.376
Let me draw that in a different color.

00:08:38.376 --> 00:08:41.402
So this bond, this bond right over here,

00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:44.561
goes entirely, goes
entirely to the oxygen.

00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:47.020
Electronegativity means
that if this is more

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.869
electronegative than that
then if a bond breaks

00:08:48.869 --> 00:08:52.447
that pair is more likely to
go to the more electronegative

00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:55.602
the more electronegative molecule.

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:58.419
Or I should say the more
electronegative atom.

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:01.391
So what will this look like
when all is said and done?

00:09:01.391 --> 00:09:04.394
So let's draw an arrow like this.

00:09:04.394 --> 00:09:07.598
So let me draw my main molecule.

00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:09.361
So I have the carbon.

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.574
It had bonded to another
carbon right up there,

00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:15.693
which bonded to another
carbon right over there.

00:09:15.693 --> 00:09:18.293
We have our carbon in front.

00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:21.405
We have our carbon in
front just like that.

00:09:21.405 --> 00:09:24.373
We have the bond with our oxygen.

00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:28.894
So we have our bond with
our oxygen right over there.

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:30.525
So that's our oxygen.

00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:32.878
We have this bond with a hydrogen.

00:09:32.878 --> 00:09:34.410
This bond with a hydrogen.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.861
We have this pair and now
it has gained this pair.

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:42.066
It has gained this pair
that was with that hydrogen.

00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:45.108
So just like this, this is now neutral.

00:09:45.108 --> 00:09:46.508
It went from being positive.

00:09:46.508 --> 00:09:49.160
Over here it only had half of this bond

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.076
so it's kind of the equivalent
of 1 electron charge.

00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:53.767
Now it has the whole bond.

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.067
So now it has the equivalent,

00:09:55.067 --> 00:09:56.944
it literally has both electrons.

00:09:56.944 --> 00:09:59.563
Now this thing is neutral

00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:01.579
and now this molecule right over here

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:04.081
becomes a hydronium cation.

00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.634
Let me draw that.

00:10:05.634 --> 00:10:07.535
So this water, let me see.

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:09.727
That's the 2 hydrogens right over there.

00:10:09.727 --> 00:10:12.512
This is that pair that is on top

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:18.223
and now it is sharing this pair

00:10:18.223 --> 00:10:20.531
with the hydrogen
essentially with a proton.

00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:24.637
So with the hydrogen, with
this hydrogen right over here.

00:10:24.637 --> 00:10:27.746
With this hydrogen right over here

00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:30.065
and now this will have a positive charge.

00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:33.303
This is a hydronium, this
is a hydronium cation.

00:10:33.303 --> 00:10:35.233
Maybe this bumps into
another water molecule

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:36.333
and does the same thing with it

00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:38.793
and it just keeps going on and on and on.

00:10:38.793 --> 00:10:41.598
And of course, we can't forget,

00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:45.776
we can't forget our bromide anion friend.

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:48.946
So there's our bromide anion friend.

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:50.923
We've got a negative
charge right over there

00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:52.665
and so what are we left with?

00:10:52.665 --> 00:10:54.615
Well we are left with,

00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:55.769
well there's a little bit of,

00:10:55.769 --> 00:10:59.398
there's this hydronium cation
that has a positive charge.

00:10:59.398 --> 00:11:01.841
We have this bromide anion

00:11:01.841 --> 00:11:05.184
and now what is this molecule now called?

00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:06.907
Well we'll go into more
detail in the future

00:11:06.907 --> 00:11:09.340
but when you have a
hydroxyl group attached

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.031
to the carbon backbone,

00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:12.886
it is an alcohol

00:11:12.886 --> 00:11:14.767
and so our main backbone once again

00:11:14.767 --> 00:11:16.992
has 1, 2, 3 carbons.

00:11:16.992 --> 00:11:18.801
So that tells us prop-

00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:20.686
and instead of just saying propane,

00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:22.535
it's propanol.

00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:24.317
So let's write that down.

00:11:24.317 --> 00:11:30.367
This is prop- prop- prop- an

00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:32.259
and some people say
just propanol generally

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:34.008
but if want to be a little bit particular,

00:11:34.008 --> 00:11:35.887
this is the hydroxyl group

00:11:35.887 --> 00:11:38.223
is attached to the number 2 carbon

00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:43.676
so we would say propan- 2 -ol.

00:11:43.676 --> 00:11:46.591
And of course we still
have this blue methyl group

00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:53.236
so we could say 2 methyl, 2 methyl,

00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:54.463
actually let me make this

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:59.776
2 methyl propan 2 ol is
what we are left with.

00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:02.406
Now let's think about what we can name

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:05.148
what we can name this
reaction we just saw.

00:12:05.148 --> 00:12:08.135
Well we've just substituted a bromo group

00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:09.829
with a hydroxyl group

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.409
so I think it's reasonable to say

00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:14.689
that this is going to be
a substitution reaction.

00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:17.212
Substitution.

00:12:17.212 --> 00:12:19.439
And we substituted with a-

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:20.991
it was a weak nucleophile,

00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:23.197
but it was a neucleophil none-the-less.

00:12:23.197 --> 00:12:25.872
So it involved a neucleophile.

00:12:25.872 --> 00:12:28.253
Nucleophile.

00:12:28.253 --> 00:12:31.496
But this one, unlike the Sn2 reaction,

00:12:31.496 --> 00:12:33.142
in the rate determining step,

00:12:33.142 --> 00:12:34.291
and this is the rate determining step.

00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:36.553
This is the slowest step of the process.

00:12:36.553 --> 00:12:39.022
Everything else will just
kind of start happening

00:12:39.022 --> 00:12:40.248
once this thing happens.

00:12:40.248 --> 00:12:41.807
This thing kind of is an equilibrium.

00:12:41.807 --> 00:12:43.457
This is the rate determining step.

00:12:43.457 --> 00:12:45.514
Only one reactant is involved

00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:47.280
in the rate determining step.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.065
One reactant in rate determining step.

00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:55.691
Rate determining step.

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.166
In this case, it was the bromo group.

00:12:58.166 --> 00:13:00.625
So you might guess what
we're going to call it.

00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:03.832
It's substitution involving a nucleophile

00:13:03.832 --> 00:13:05.969
so nucleophilic substitution.

00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:08.109
You can imagine this
stands for nucleophilic

00:13:08.109 --> 00:13:11.749
and only one reactant is involved

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:14.236
in the rate determining step.

00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:16.801
So this right over here,
this whole reaction

00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:20.801
that we've now drawn is an Sn1 reaction.
