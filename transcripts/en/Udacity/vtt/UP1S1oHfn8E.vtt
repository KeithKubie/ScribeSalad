00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.138
In order to launch the SettingsActivity, 
we modify Mainactivity.java

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.670
in the On options item selected method.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.610
When the Settings Menu Item 
is selected, we create

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.170
a new, explicit intent
to the SettingsActivity Class.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.010
We call Start activity
to launch this intent.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.650
We don't call StartActivity for results
because we're not expecting

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.020
a result from the SettingsActivity. 
Similarly, in the detail activity class,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.380
when the settings menu is selected,
we launch a new intent

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.680
to SettingsActivity.
