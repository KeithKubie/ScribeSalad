00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.720
Neil: On the day that the Super Bowl was played,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.120
do you realize that's a bad day to be a
chicken?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.040
Chuck: Wings and things!
Neil: I'm just saying.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.220
Chuck: Okay, so what what of stats do you have for us?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.120
Neil: In fact, any day in America is a bad
day to be a chicken. Americans consume on

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.900
average about a million chickens per
hour. The chicken is the most

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.100
slaughtered animal in all of the history
of agriculture.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.860
Chuck: Wow. It's a good thing that I don't have any feelings

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.500
for chickens, becuase they are delicious and I just

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.789
blame chickens for being so delicious, so
it's not my problem. So how

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.079
much chicken is consumed in the form of
wings, because the Super Bowl is

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.440
probably the day that more wings than
any other day in the world.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.760
Neil: I know so all these, like, sort of you know, wingless
Gary: Wandering around,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.640
Neil: Walking around, definitely walking.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.760
Gary: We have an exclusive interview on Playing With Science.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.439
Chuck: For the people who can't see, but a rubber chicken, and once he heard

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.260
Neil's stat, this is what he had to say.
Rubber Chicken: *Exhales in disgust*

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.440
Neil: Turn that face towards the camera. Look at that face!

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.840
So I got another another related statistic.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.560
Gary: I don't think that
chicken could take any more.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.380
Neil: So in the United States, we consume 8500 whole
chickens every 30 seconds.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.760
Yes, we consume 8500 chickens
every 30 seconds in the United States.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.900
Chuck: You are horrifying my friend.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.400
Neil: Alright just more data for you.
Chuck: I love it!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.960
Gary: Well I was waiting for you to say I'm going to digest those numbers, but we're going to move on.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:23.780
Chuck: Very cool, very cool.
