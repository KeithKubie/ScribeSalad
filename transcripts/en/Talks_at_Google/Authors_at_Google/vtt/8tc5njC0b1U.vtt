&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Hello everybody, I'm Julie
Wiskirchen from the Authors at Google team

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.340
here in Santa Monica. And today I'm excited
to welcome Elizabeth Currid-Halkett. She is

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.260

Professor at USC School of Policy, Planning,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.260
and Development.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.480
She holds a Ph.D. in urban planning from Columbia
University and teaches courses in economic

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.319
development and urban policy and planning.

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:28.229
Her research in economic, is in economic development
with a particular focus on art and cultural

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:29.229
industries.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.000
And today she's gonna be discussing her new
book, Starstruck: The Business of Celebrity.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.649
So please join me in welcoming Elizabeth Currid-Halkett.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.649
[applause]

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:46.440
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Well, thank you
all for-for coming in and-and listening to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.730
my-my talk on my new research, the new book.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.730
I'm going to divide it, this talk up into
three parts.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.679
The first is I'm just gonna explain why a-a
professor at USC who has a Ph.D. in urban

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.329
planning would write a book on celebrity.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.379
The-the second thing I want to do is-is do
a bit of a reading so that you get a sense

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.379
of the context.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.089
And then the third because this is Google
and you not only did I use Google data in

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.990
my research, but you guys study, you love
data like you like to drink water, and so

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.170
I thought I would, I would share with you
some of the ways in which I quantitatively

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.610
got at this somewhat nebulous phenomenon of
celebrity.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.100
So first of all why-why study celebrity?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.630
In my, in my first book I studied the art
and culture industries in New York. I was

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.039
particularly interested in why they concentrated
in particular places and why all of them did.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:45.150
It wasn't just that you had an art scene in
New York. It was that it was also one of the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.100
headquarters for fashion and for music and
for design.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.460
And of course, unsurprisingly in some ways,
these industries needed each other and they

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:10.310
really, really connected to one another and
they tended to share human capital, they tended

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.090
to share information, and-and that because
they shared this information in a very ad

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.210
hoc, spontaneous way, in a very in sort of
in situ it wasn't that they'd scheduled a

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.940
four o'clock meeting and that's when everything
happened.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.970
It was that they ran into each other in-in
coffee shops and they ended up at the same

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.530
night clubs or the same restaurants, and that
things happened in this very accidental way.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.060
And in many ways it-it is very reminiscent
of some of the historical stories of the,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.060
of the rise of Silicon Valley. Is that you
actually had these Bohemians just kind of

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.060
living their lives together and-and-and just
accidentally trading ideas that turned into-to

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060
very meaningful innovation.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.060
And so you see this in, I think, all innovation
driven industries and-and certainly the work

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.500
that's been done in technology makes very
much what I've-I've-I've seen in these creative

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500
industries.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.930
The thing that makes creative industries a
bit different than technology is not perpetual

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.370
innovation because they-they both require
that, but that they are taste driven. It is

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.820
not that a semi-conductor runs faster, it
is not that the brakes are better, it-it there-there

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.550
is not an obvious way to measure why we love
Mark-Mark Rothko and we leave thousands artists

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.760
in the dust to-to-to remain unknown.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:16.740
And so I was fascinated when I was done studying
the art industries in New York, how did people

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.100
become stars in these industries? Were they,
were they genuinely better than everyone else?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.300
And of course in creative industries you don't
just become really good or you become anointed.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.490
You genuinely become a bona fide star because
popular culture industries are so important

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.750
to the media and because they are visually
documented. The world knew who you were if

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.160
you became a good film star. You-you were
a celebrity in-in every sense of the word.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.070
And so that was the first thing I was interested
in.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.020
What I realized when I studied the Warhol
Econ, when I, when I wrote the Warhol Economy

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.170
one of the most important findings was the
fact that so much of their economic lives

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.290
were occurred within their social lives.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.350
That in fact their-their informal networks
were where a lot of their work got done or

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.700
at least the beginning parts of their work
got done. They got jobs this way, they traded

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.590
ideas this way, they found out what other
companies were doing this way.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.400
And so I knew that that probably was-was what
we might be observing in these kind of special

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.699
people; these people who became stars. They-they
must be doing something differently than everyone

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.069
else, and so I started out with that as-as
my-my premise.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:32.580
The second thing is when I-I started to study
celebrity within the popular cultural industries

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.639
I-I realized how ubiquitous a phenomenon this-this
is that celebrity is in some ways associated

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.960
with film and music and fashion. On the other
hand, why did we care as a society so much

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.259
about people that we didn't know anything
about?

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.129
The other thing that's interesting about celebrity
is that of course it is divorced from talent.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.889
It's not mutually exclusive, it's not like
you can't be talented and if you're a celebrity,

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.880
but it's that you don't have to be talented
if you're a celebrity at all. I mean this

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.289
is, this is a bit of a no brainer, we all
know this here, but-but that it was extraordinary

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.659
to the extent to which this was true.

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.449
And that was, of course, because celebrity
has nothing to do with talent. If we think

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.699
about what celebrity is it's actually about
our collective fascination with particular

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.199
people. We want to know where they had dinner,
we want to know how they like to drink their

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.289
coffee, we want to know how many hours of
sleep they-they sleep at night, and do they

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.370
go to the gym. And-and-and these are so banal
I mean why? And yet I can't speak for everyone

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.250
in the room, but I-I too am interested.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.590
But-but that is what makes celebrity quite
different from fame, of course, because fame

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.319
is simply that people know who you are. I
mean Nobel Prize winners are-are famous, but

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.490
I don't know about you but I'm not particularly
interested in how they drink their coffee

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.780
or who they had dinner with last night.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.780
[laughter]

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.780
Same with the Secretary of Defense.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.780
[talking in background]

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.789
They're also quite talented people. And I
even, in your world Bill Gates is a very interesting

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.449
example because Bill Gates is, of course,
incredibly famous. But guess what? He's a

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.310
genius, of course he's famous. I don't care
where he had dinner last night. And so that

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.900
is a real difference and in that respect you
see celebrity in many social spheres.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.960
And so it-it-it really evolved from being
a study of the cultural industries to acknowledging

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.099
that it existed everywhere in a way that it
had never before, to the fact that it wasn't

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.539
exclusive to these popular cultural industries
at all. That in fact anyone who has a Facebook

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:31.169
account or a Twitter account knows that in
fact these people exist everywhere. Jenn Smith

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.639
is eating a cookie. And-and yet in ten comments
on her Facebook profile about this as if this

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:41.770
is interesting at all. And yet it clearly
is 'cause were commenting.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.449
And-and then it was that-that in fact social
media gives us just another lens to see something

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.400
that has probably always existed. I mean the
homecoming queen and the quarterback on the,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.490
on the football team in high school they were
celebrities too. We obsessed about them for

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.919
things that had nothing to do with any contribution
they gave us. We just wanted to know about

00:06:58.919 --> 00:06:59.919
them as people.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.400
So-so that's sort of how this-this evolved.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.110
Now what becomes really difficult is if you're
a social scientist you need data, you need

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.550
something rigorous. You can't just talk about
these things. And so that was the tough part.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:21.150
And one thing that I really got my hands on
that-that was great in terms of studying kind

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.180
of main stream celebrity was photographs.
Because these people socialize which-which

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.559
I believed really was how they became stars
are documented almost 24/7.

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:33.300
You can find out what Paris Hilton is doing
on Friday night. You can find out where Angelina

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.770
Jolie is-is-is spending time right now just
by a very quick troll of-of-of the media,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.850
whether it's TMZ or X17 or whether it's actually
something like Getty Images which is, which

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.850
is what I used.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.259
And so-so-so I'm gonna talk a little bit more
about how I used this data, but I-I'd like

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:59.110
to open up talking about the data with-with-with
an anecdote from-from the book and-and a discussion

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.740
of the role of social network.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.449
So let me get right there.

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:06.449
[pause]

00:08:06.449 --> 00:08:12.789
Alright. This is from Chapter 5, How to Become
a Star in the Celebrity Network.

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:13.789
[pause]

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:18.839
"On June 2008, on a hot summer evening, my
friend Eric, who had been working tirelessly

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:23.809
on Hilary Clinton's Presidential campaign,
called to say he would be flying into New

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:28.840
York City the next day for the Senator's speech
after the Montana and South Dakota primaries.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.310
This speech would be her last before conceding
to Barack Obama.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.390
Eric said that if I wanted to come, the event
would take place at Baruch College with a

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.560
fabulous- sounding after-party at the Gramercy
Park Hotel. He would happily get me in.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.710
This was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.
I cancelled my previous plans, and the next

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:52.510
day at 6 p, at 6:00 p.m. I made a beeline
down, downtown to meet him.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.780
When I arrived the place was already swarming
with people and TV cameras, and there was

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.410
still a line of supporters all around the
block waiting for him to get in.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.900
The real picture was far removed from the
claims that journalists had made the next

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.210
day that 'barely 300 people showed up and
that the evening was more like a wake.'"

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.130
That was Andrea Peyser from the New York Post.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.790
"I got to-to the front door where Eric had
asked me to wait for him. Of course with all

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.200
of the guards, Secret Service, and various
Clinton staffers patrolling the front area

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.010
I had to make myself look really busy with
the aura being possibly an important person

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.460
which involved frenzy and unnecessary emailing
on my Blackberry, thus avoiding all eye contact

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.200
with people who could ask me to move away
from the door or into the line.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.830
Eric arrived just in time sporting an open
collar white shirt and designer jeans accompanied

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.180
by days' old facial hair, looking ever the
part of the hipster demographic that had only

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.960
recently become a politically active and tremendously
desired constituency.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.910
Slapping on a bright yellow band on my, on
my wrist Eric whisked me past some 1500 people

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.300
who had been waiting in line for hours and
were probably going to be told the event was

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.300
full.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.750
After going through a rigorous security check,
we went down to the basement where the event

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.690
was being held and watched the media flurry
unfold.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:10.660
Random politicians and high up staffers were
talking to reporters. CNN and Fox News anchors

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.080
were grooming themselves and talking into
their headsets, ready to go at a moment's

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080
notice.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.530
Socialites and supporters richer than Croatia
sashayed about the VIP section, designer handbags

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.560
and Lily Pulitzer shift dresses on full display.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.390
Shortly before Senator Clinton was to appear
on stage, Eric and a few of his staffer friends

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.070
were busy ensuring that I would get a good
seat and then later get backstage access.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.410
Eric worked for her advanced team, but more
than 500 media outlets and hundreds of supporters

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.790
were showing up so it would be pretty tricky
to arrange.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.641
Eric, however, was privy to what would, could
only be described as all access buttons which

00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:50.330
would allow us backstage to get us into the
most privileged parts of the event. These

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.440
buttons were provided by the Secret Service
in very limited batches for staff. And sure

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.230
enough Eric produced one from his pocket.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.220
Once the access dilemma had been resolved,
we went back to the VIP section where I had

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.410
to show my yellow wrist band yet again and
awaited the Senator's arrival. The staffers

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.380
were still discussing access and how to get
non-advanced team fans back to meet the Senator.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.950
Eric turned to a fellow staffer, a young pretty
blond girl, and said, 'Do you have any of

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.970
those media passes left? We'll need those
for backup.' With barely a beat between request

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.420
and delivery she proudly reached into her
enormous Prada handbag and produced a handful

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:29.230
of hot pink passes the size of index cards
with Senator Clinton's name emblazoned across

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.560
the top and 'media' in boldface on the bottom.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.570
Thanks to Eric and his friendly fellow staffers,
there I was with backups to backups of access

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.770
to see one of the most important public figures
in the world.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.130
Senator Clinton's speech was impassioned and
exhilarating in the way that television can

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.970
never quite capture. The audience was transfixed
while she spoke and erupted into thunderous

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.000
applause as she finished.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.060
Afterwards we went backstage and were introduced
to Hillary, Huma Abedin, her right hand woman,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.250
Bill and Chelsea, the former head of the Democratic
National Committee and head of the Clinton

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.820
campaign, Terry McAuliffe, and every other
significant member of the Presidential campaign.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.820
Later that evening all of these people except
Senator Clinton attended the after-party at

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.930
the Gramercy Park Hotel mingling and chatting
for hours with the attendees.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:23.410
This story makes it seem like access to the
Senator is easy, but in reality, it's impossible.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.070
You might think that if you stand in line
long enough or keep showing up at the doorstep

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.660
of important events your chances of befriending
stars increases, but it doesn't. Rite of entry

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.940
relies on one very good link. If that link
is a legitimate access point, either a celebrity

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.970
or someone who worked closely with stars,
then one has a ticket into an exclusive world.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.410
Without Eric, my chances of setting foot into
the door of the auditorium, let alone meeting

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:52.160
Senator Clinton personally and attending her
after party, were zero. My success relied

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.870
solely and totally on my friendship with Eric.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.740
But once initial access is granted the next
layer of connections is that much easier.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.710
Suddenly, by mingling at the Gramercy Park
Hotel you have all the access in the world

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.880
to people who have the potential to elevate
your profile too. Maybe you want to befriend

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.560
them, become their boyfriend or girlfriend,
or simply request their friendship on Facebook.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.810
No matter your networking goal by accessing
the party you've never been closer to attaining

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.810
it.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.050
A fundamental quality of celebrity is that
celebrities are celebrities because they spend

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.320
time with each other, reinforcing the belief
that they truly are different from you and

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320
me.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.990
This may seem to be a story about one of the
world's pol, biggest political celebrities,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.940
but the exclusiveness of celebrity world can
be mirrored in the most ordinary and small

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.010
scale ways.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.430
High school cliques and college sororities
maintain their elite sim, status similarly,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.340
except that their parties are not at the Gramercy
Heart, except that the parties at the Gramercy

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.500
Park Hotel are replaced with Friday night
sleepovers and private mixers with elite fraternities.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.010
By maintaining exclusivity in their social
lives these groups too produce their own relative

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.010
celebrities.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.300
Understanding celebrity requires a knowledge
of the social network that produces them.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.190
This may be an intellectual exercise for most
of us, but in practical terms those in the

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.370
business of wanting to become celebrities
must first make contact with those who have

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.610
already achieved this goal.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:16.080
But who cares? If a clique is that much, if,
is that exclusive and that much of a pain

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.220
to get into then maybe it's just not worth
becoming a member.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.870
In the last few decades scientists and sociologists
have devoted much of their lives to answering

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.570
these questions. Why would anyone want to
belong to a group? What are the real outcomes,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.380
both benefits and drawbacks of being a member?

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.630
Most of us have friends, some of us have a
lot of friends who aren't close, some of us

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.590
have a few friends we hold near and dear;
if we're lucky we have lots of friends who

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.820
are loyal and close and on whom we can depend.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.390
On the most basic level friends form a social
network. Some of us have very tight groups

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:53.380
of friends who are all friends with one another.
Still others have tons of acquaintances who

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.470
are not necessarily friends but make up a
wide and disparate collection of people.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:02.560
Think of Malcolm Gladwell's famous connectors,
those people with friends on every continent.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.510
A lot of us have this type of large and fairly
loosely connected friendship group on our

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:11.090
Facebook account. I am friends with people
I haven't seen in years. I'm also friends

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.590
with my colleagues at work, my husband, my
best friend to whom I talk every day.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.610
Even before social media websites social networks
formed our basic relationships with people

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.610
around us.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:26.100
But friendship isn't the only type of social
network. How we get jobs, how diseases spread,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.030
how websites become popular, and how people
attain upward mobility are all determined

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:34.000
by our relations and connections and interactions
with other people.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.690
Our ability to interact with some people and
some groups may provide benefits or may exclude

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.230
us from other groups. Mean spirited high school
cliques that don't let certain individuals

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.750
in because they are friends with someone they
don't like are the classic example of exclusionary

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.810
social networks.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.580
But in other ways social networks are useful
for meeting people who will introduce us to

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.240
our future partner or spouse, get us a new
job, write us a recommendation for college,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.240
and so forth.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.360
Studying social networks is a good way of
understanding how the world is organized;

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.400
another lens for interpreting a wide range
of phenomena in human society from why people

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.700
marry who they do to how people become rich,
catch a cold, or in this case attain celebrity

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.700
status.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.000
Through the eyes of the media, mainstream
celebrities look like beautiful people who

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.990
are photographed a lot and who are generally
sports stars, musicians, actors, or models.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.000
But another way to look at celebrities is
as a member's only group. Celebrities are

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.330
celebrities also because they get invited
to certain parties and hang out with certain

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.890
people. They are a part of a very elite, invite
only network. Individuals attain celebrity

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.250
in part by the company they keep and the events
they attend; in other words, their social

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.250
network.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.080
There are benefits to being a part of an exclusive
network. While all forms of celebrity exhibit

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.010
this type of exclusiveness, most though not
all mainstream celebrities get their foot

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:55.330
in the door first by being associated with
popular culture industries to some degree.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:00.260
Some of these individuals are genuinely talented
actors or musicians which buys them access

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.400
to exclusive events. Others may not possess
talent but their face and their presence are

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.249
of interest to the popular press enough they
are invited. Their talent or media attention

00:17:09.249 --> 00:17:13.799
is their entry to that world that would not
take notice of them simply as individuals.

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:18.220
And this is where the celebrity network is
critical. Getting invited to and showing up

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.459
at the right parties and meeting the right
people are only the surface benefits of the

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:26.630
celebrity network. If you're an actor or a
politician meeting those important people

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.620
at those exclusive parties is essential to
your career.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.279
The Vanity Fair Oscar Party, for example,
is more than just hanging out with other good

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:38.039
looking people. Young actors get the chance
to hobnob with influential directors who might

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:42.320
remember them down the line and give them
a role in a major film. Directors and producers

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.299
talk shop about movie ideas that might turn
into award winning blockbusters.

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:50.659
Even those stars with no talent need to be
at the events and parties that other celebrities

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:54.679
are attending just to define themselves as
being a part of the exclusive celebrity set

00:17:54.679 --> 00:17:58.919
and get themselves photographed. This entitles
them to a membership card.

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:02.710
For the Paris Hilton's of the world, membership
in the exclusive world of celebrity compensates

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:08.130
for the lack of an Academy Award or a Grammy.
And if you are in show business to show the

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.519
world your talent, then being a part of the
most exclusive and powerful network offers

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:13.519
huge benefits.

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:17.669
Celebrity networks are influential because
they are both the means by which celebrity

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:22.120
status is perpetuated and they provide access
points to important people who can elevate

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.970
an aspiring star's career.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.870
If we could infiltrate this exclusive world
could it tell us something more genuinely

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.600
about how people become stars?

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.860
A few years back my Ben Gurion University
colleague, Gilad Ravid and I were determined

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.380
to figure this out. We believe that celebrity
status can partially be explained through

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.880
specific networks of which celebrities are
a part. But after establishing that theory

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.559
we ran into a bit of a basic non-starter.
How does one get into a net, a celebrity network

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:54.220
in the first place and after that how does
someone become a particular type of star?

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.450
We knew it would be unlikely that Paris Hilton
or Angelina Jolie would fill out weekly surveys

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.259
on their comings and goings: whom they had
lunch with, what they did on Friday night,

00:19:02.259 --> 00:19:04.100
or who they met up with for coffee.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.190
But we knew that one of the defining differences
between celebrities and us is that they spend

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:13.049
time with each other and we spend time with,
well us. That exclusiveness is part and parcel

00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:17.860
of why it would be almost impossible to document
their networks. Most of the point after all

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.900
is that ordinary people can't participate.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:26.230
Luckily Gilad is a genius computer scientist
and I spend a lot of time reading celebrity

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.500
magazines. Between the two of us we figured
out a way to access celebrity networks and

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.820
the exclusiveness of their social lives without
asking them a single survey question or trying

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.470
to talk to Paris Hilton.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.690
A definitive aspect of being a celebrity is
that your life is fascinating to many other

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.279
people, and in the case of stars like Paris
and Angelina your life is photographed and

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:46.820
documented around the clock, around the world.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.669
If many minutes of these celebrities lives
are broadcast to the world in hundreds of

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:55.120
media outlets and thousands of photos, wouldn't
this be the most obvious way to study their

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.970
social networks and the things that they do
that are different from what we do?

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.650
What parties do celebrities get invited to
and which people do they hang out with? What

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.840
is Paris Hilton doing on a Friday night? Well,
just a glance at the photos in Us Weekly or

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.220
People will tell you.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.679
So if we look at photographs of celebrities
living their lives, we'll have a pretty good

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:16.360
sense of who they spend time with and what
they do.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.789
For an entire year we studied all of the arts
and entertainment photos taken by Getty Images,

00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:26.480
the largest photographic agency in the world.
We analyzed some 600,000 photographs of almost

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:33.529
12,000 events recording the 6.5% of individuals
who appeared in four or more images; the celebrity

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:34.749
core so to speak.

00:20:34.749 --> 00:20:39.450
We then studied all of the events they attended
and people they spend time with. So far we

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.190
figured out a thing or two about the nature
of celebrity.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:47.550
It came as no surprise that celebrities hang
out with other celebrities and they go to

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.440
events that the rest of us aren't invited
to. Celebrity tabloids love to breed the fiction

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.049
that celebrities are quote 'just like us,'
but they're not.

00:20:56.049 --> 00:20:59.789
Angelina Jolie goes to parties with George
Clooney and Matt Damon and those get togethers

00:20:59.789 --> 00:21:04.030
happen to be the Vanity Fair Oscar Party and
the Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:10.679
Ball as opposed to Aunt Sally's barbeque or
the cos, or Friday night bowling. These differences

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:15.940
between celebrities and us are not just anecdotal
they can be statistically measured."

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:21.059
Alright, so what I wanted to do now because
I wanted to kind of set the context for how

00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:25.880
I studied this is I'm gonna look, I'm gonna
show you how I actually did statistically

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.970
measure this.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.970
Alright.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.780
[pause]

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:36.409
The first thing is we looked at Getty Images.
And the reason we picked Getty Images as opposed

00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:41.450
to any other photographic database is because
it just is more consistent and robust.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:46.350
So you can look at TMZ or X17 but these-these
photographs are pretty chaotic; they're not

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:51.320
necess, they're not uniformly labeled, they're
not, their caption information is inconsistent;

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.419
but Getty is.

00:21:52.419 --> 00:21:59.929
So what we did was we looked at each photograph
and the captions associated with them.

00:21:59.929 --> 00:22:00.929
[pause]

00:22:00.929 --> 00:22:05.389
What we then did was we collected an entire
year, this was our pilot study, and identified

00:22:05.389 --> 00:22:10.240
the images, the people in the images through
caption information. We identified the location

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.500
of the event, the date of the event, what
the event was, and so forth. And you see an

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.990
example of-of Angelina Jolie at the Os-Oscars
on February 22nd in L.A.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.990
[pause]

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:28.440
We came up with an awful lot of data. This
is over 70,000 nodes, that's people, over

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:37.290
a million potential connections, on 13,000
events, in 187 locations, and over 600,000

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.340
photographs.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.619
We then reduced the noise, because you can,
all of us can kind of accidentally end up

00:22:42.619 --> 00:22:47.230
in a photograph on Getty Images, and so that-that's
a bit of a one hit wonder though. So what

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.090
we wanted to do were who was consistently
being photographed by Getty Images. This was

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:56.919
a really good proxy for what we called "the
celebrity core." And so this reduced the numbers

00:22:56.919 --> 00:23:00.669
to about 7,000 nodes and about 800,000 connections.

00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:06.350
So the first thing that we did was we wanted
to know where these photographs were taken.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:11.240
Okay? Because this is where actually having
a background in geography is really interesting

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.860
because of course things happen in particular
places. And celebrity hinges on being photographed

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.730
and it means that you can't actually just
spend all of your life in Kansas never going

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:24.779
to events. For people to know, for you and
I to know who someone is they need to make

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:26.369
sure to get their photograph taken.

00:23:26.369 --> 00:23:27.730
So where does that happen?

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:33.519
So we did two things. One thing we just figured
out where Getty was taking pictures. The second

00:23:33.519 --> 00:23:38.950
thing we did was we looked at the relationships
between places. What was the likelihood of

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.830
being photographed in one place and your likelihood
of being photographed in another place? What

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.289
places were most connected by this sort of
flow of stars?

00:23:47.289 --> 00:23:48.289
[pause]

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:54.049
So the first thing we looked at is the concentration
of Getty photographs. You can see that in

00:23:54.049 --> 00:24:02.019
general the U.S., particularly L.A. and New
York and-and also the UK are the most photographed

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:03.019
places.

00:24:03.019 --> 00:24:07.269
I think the thing that's interesting here
is-is-is not just the-the places that are

00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:10.320
disproportionally photographed, but the places
that don't seem to have any photographs. And

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:16.059
so you have large parts of Africa and parts
of the Middle East that don't have any photographs

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:17.100
in the Getty database.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.850
And we have, we have a number of-of thoughts
on why this is. I mean is it because fans

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.649
aren't interested in things going on there?
Is it because the media doesn't go there?

00:24:25.649 --> 00:24:29.590
Is it because the events aren't commodified
enough that photographs would, photographers

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.460
would show up? It-it-it's hard to know.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.590
And Bollywood actually is not photographed
at all on our Getty database which is quite

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:42.230
surprising given that it's actually bigger
than Hollywood in terms of film production.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.340
And-and-and actually one of the reasons this
is is because Bollywood is actually quite

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.460
insular. It-it's not all that interested in
connecting to Hollywood; its stars are happy

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:56.100
to stay in Bollywood. It has a huge fan base
in the Middle East and so there's-there's-there's-there's,

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.629
it's not that they're being ignored it's that
we're, they don't really want us around.

00:25:00.629 --> 00:25:01.629
Yeah.

00:25:01.629 --> 00:25:03.980
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.130
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.529
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:18.090
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: You would. I mean
what we're looking for is a-a rigorous dataset

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:24.899
for other countries that clearly house core
film industry and fashion industry activity

00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:29.320
that is not being picked up by Getty. So yeah,
we-we realized that-that this-this would be

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.399
inconclusive to-to-to just say it was all
happening in the States.

00:25:32.399 --> 00:25:38.249
The next thing we did though was look at the
relationship between places. And what we found

00:25:38.249 --> 00:25:44.249
was that New York and L.A. unsurprisingly
are the most connected. Los Angeles and London

00:25:44.249 --> 00:25:46.789
are the second most connected.

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:52.690
But what's really fascinating here is that
you actually have kind of nowhere else really

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:57.690
meaningful besides three places which is:
Los Angeles, New York, and London, and a couple

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:03.499
of somewhat temporary what I, I've been calling
kind of sub-hubs of-of-of stardom which are

00:26:03.499 --> 00:26:09.860
Cannes, Paris Fashion Week, and you also find
that U-Utah the Sundance Film Festival. And

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.690
in Florida you have a couple events that why
we used Florida because the-the-the results

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.440
would actually not be statistically significant
if you, if you looked at particular cities

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.161
within Florida. So we look at Florida as the
whole, but the-the big events going on here

00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:29.110
are Art Basel Miami and Miami's Fashion Week,
are-are two such examples.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.690
Okay, some general findings here.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:37.440
Eighty percent of all the photos that we looked
at were taken in three places. So of 600,000

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.309
photos, 80% of them are taken in three places
and that's L.A., New York, and London.

00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:46.159
Again I-I talked to you about the connectivity
between a couple of different places.

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:47.159
[pause]

00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:51.769
The next thing that we did was, and this is
actually with my colleague, Sarah Williams

00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:58.430
at Columbia University. We wanted to know
if you look on a micro level what, where are

00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:59.430
things happening?

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.299
So we got this kind of macro picture which
in some ways is-is unsurprising to us which

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:10.999
is that there are three major hubs of stardom
in-in-in the world; they're places that-that

00:27:10.999 --> 00:27:16.320
we all kind of expected as such that-that
of course some places are-are important some

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.119
of the time, this is where Cannes or Sundance
becomes important. But what's happening in

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:23.169
these identified geographies of stardom?

00:27:23.169 --> 00:27:29.720
So here what we did is we took the photographs
and we attached geotags to them. So we actually

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.751
have a longitude and latitude associated with
each photograph in Los Angeles and New York.

00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:40.470
It's about 300,000 photos and about 6,000
events. It wasn't the funnest thing in the

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.619
world I did. [laughs]

00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:45.399
So we had to look up the addresses for each
of them. And then we mapped them.

00:27:45.399 --> 00:27:51.549
And what you see here is that, I think it's
pretty clear from the slide, that the-the

00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:55.299
white is what's important; that's where things
are really happening. And sure you'll have

00:27:55.299 --> 00:28:01.009
events throughout L.A., but these are the
places where most of the activity is occurring.

00:28:01.009 --> 00:28:04.759
The bigger the yellow circle the bigger number
of photographs being taken there.

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:10.049
So you've got frequency of event and then
you have frequency of photograph. Okay?

00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:14.559
This is at what we call magnet. So in this
particular part of analysis we actually categorized

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:19.700
the photographs associated with industry.
And-and-and so what we looked at was where

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.640
do fashion events happen? Where do film, where
do music events? Magnet are events that were

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:31.109
not associated with a particular industry,
but seemed to have a high frequency of-of

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:32.109
star presence.

00:28:32.109 --> 00:28:37.999
And you can see that there's essentially three
places in L.A. that seem to drive these events.

00:28:37.999 --> 00:28:43.570
Looked at New York; New York's a little more
chaotic. You're dealing with a-a smaller geography

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.509
and you're also dealing with the fact that
people don't have to get in their car, and

00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:51.590
so New York has kind of the luxury of being
able to have more-more event activity.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:58.490
And then we did this for theater. Unsurprisingly
you have Midtown in New York. In L.A. you

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:05.149
have it primarily around Hollywood. Oh actually
this is the film industry. And so again you

00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:09.320
have really, really finite number of places
where things are happening.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.019
So it's not actually that celebrity is everywhere.
It's everywhere in the media; it's everywhere

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:20.850
in our tabloids in-in our newspapers. But
in fact the production of celebrity, the ability

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.701
to actually create your star power happens
in a limited number of places.

00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:28.009
Next thing we did is we looked at Hollywood.

00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:35.580
And what we were interested in was what kind
of geographical behavior do stars engage in

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.960
that other people do not?

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:43.100
Now I think it's fair to say that within the
world of celebrity it's not all created equally,

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:48.749
right? You have people who win Oscars; we
know who they are; we think they're talented

00:29:48.749 --> 00:29:53.259
and we're interested in them. George Clooney,
Angelina Jolie, very obvious examples of-of

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:57.629
people who-who are both talented and interesting
to their publics.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:30:02.070
And then of course you have people like Paris
Hilton or Kim Kardashian who people kind of

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.619
the running joke is, "What in God's earth
are we paying attention to here?" And yet,

00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:06.619
we do.

00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:12.010
And so what we really saw, my-my colleague
and I, were that there's clearly two things

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.820
going on here. That you've got stars that
are-are-are talented and stars that are media

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.450
stars and do they do things that are generally
different? If in fact do you kind of organized

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:26.549
your behavior such that you went to these
kinds of events would you have, be more likely

00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:31.350
to be hired to work in a particular film which
would up your talent or would you photographed

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.350
more?

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.919
So we did two things.

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:38.879
The first thing we did is we actually looked
at, we created a talent proxy.

00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:43.649
Forbes Magazine ranks actors. They actually
do really rigorous methodology. They-they

00:30:43.649 --> 00:30:48.460
do surveys with Hollywood executives. They-they
were interested in bankability, but-but the

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:54.259
three things they were, the criteria for bankability
was: can you attract other stars to your films?

00:30:54.259 --> 00:30:58.929
Can you bring in other financial resources?
And do you drum up box office receipts? And

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:03.220
they ranked 1400 actors and actresses.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:08.340
The usual suspects are at the top. You've
got Will Smith, Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:12.779
Brad Pitt; these are people who-who seemed
to really be able to bring resources to a

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:13.779
film.

00:31:13.779 --> 00:31:18.330
The next thing we did is we looked at Google.
And we thought, "Who is the world talking

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:19.330
about?"

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:24.820
So what we did is we collected data on Google
to-to rank the stars that had the biggest

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:31.009
media presence; the biggest media volume.
And we did it actually Google, Forbes star

00:31:31.009 --> 00:31:36.289
currency only came out in 2009 so we only
had that year to work with. But Google we

00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:41.070
used with the same year that we attracted,
that we got photographs from Getty.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.070
Okay.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.990
We merged these datasets. We basically said,
"You've gotta show up in Google. You've gotta

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:51.490
show up in Getty photographs. And you have
to be ranked as an actor or actress on Forbes."

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:56.330
So then our end went from, I think we started
at 70,000, moved down to 7,000, now we're

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:02.429
working with 864 stars. So these are, these
are like the mega set, the-the super in-crowd.

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:09.129
Our big question was: what is the influence
of place? And place is the events you go to,

00:32:09.129 --> 00:32:14.700
the people you spend time with in particular
places, on the type of star you become?

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.830
So we tested the influence of certain kinds
of places on star currency and the influence

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.409
on media volume.

00:32:22.409 --> 00:32:25.479
And our independent variables, what we were
testing on, were particular places around

00:32:25.479 --> 00:32:26.479
the world.

00:32:26.479 --> 00:32:30.299
And there was another way we looked at it.
It wasn't just did you show up for an event

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:35.759
in London, it was also we had a variable did
you show up to consecutive events in London?

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:39.109
As in you were fully sticking around there
or did you have to hop on a plane? Were you

00:32:39.109 --> 00:32:44.340
photographed in Los Angeles, then London,
then Los Angeles, that that would be a very

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:48.749
different variable than just seeming to spend
all of your time in a place.

00:32:48.749 --> 00:32:49.749
Okay.

00:32:49.749 --> 00:32:50.749
What did we find out?

00:32:50.749 --> 00:32:55.960
They really are different. In some ways it's
not surprising, but in others it's actually,

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.960
it's actually shocking.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:03.799
Los Angeles has no influence on talent profile.
It is not associated with stars who are highly

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:09.220
ranked in talent. We believe this is because
it's not unique; it, everyone has to do it;

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.659
there's nothing unique about showing up in
L.A.

00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:19.619
Showing up in London, going to one event in
New York, and showing up in Japan, of all

00:33:19.619 --> 00:33:25.610
places, has a positive influence on star currency
and talent.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:30.979
Any kind of long term spending time anywhere
whether it's New York or London or Los Angeles

00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:33.019
is not a good idea for talent.

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:34.109
[pause]

00:33:34.109 --> 00:33:40.139
Media, very different. L.A. actually is really
important for media. If you spend a lot of

00:33:40.139 --> 00:33:43.059
time in Los Angeles your media volume goes
up.

00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:48.860
Going to Las Vegas is actually bad for everyone
[laughs]

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.860
[laughter]

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:54.269
which is unfortunate, I, but it's just true.

00:33:54.269 --> 00:34:00.799
And London and Japan are still influential
in-in-in looking at media-media along with

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:01.799
talent.

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:05.369
Now you might be questioning as-as I would
if I were looking at this, "Why are you picking

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:08.690
Japan?" And then you look at London, the city,
it's simply is an abundance of data. So London

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:12.521
had, just has a lot of data so it becomes
statistically meaningful. Japan you have to

00:34:12.521 --> 00:34:16.619
kinda look at it as a whole to-to figure out
it's-it's influence on the model.

00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:18.859
Oh wait, before I go to that.

00:34:18.859 --> 00:34:23.569
So really quickly we know different behaviors
from different stars. This is not a cause

00:34:23.569 --> 00:34:27.530
or effect thing; I'm not saying if you suddenly
show up on Tokyo you're suddenly going to

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:32.799
win an Oscar and be viewed by the-the-the
industry as-as-as really successful. But it

00:34:32.799 --> 00:34:36.500
is demonstrating associations between types
of stars.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:42.409
The second thing we did is we ran social network
analysis. And we took that Forbes star currency

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:48.800
and we looked at A, B, and C list stars. So
the A list was the top 20; the B list the

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.300
middle 20; and the C was the bottom 20. It's-it's
a rough approximation. But we wanted to see

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.350
if they had genuinely different social networks.
They do.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:04.220
So in the Getty Image database as a whole,
people have connections of 3.26. Now you know

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.220
you've got the six degrees of separation as
in kind of common parlance. That's actually

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:12.130
true; people have studied this; it's true;
people have six degrees of separation.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.800
If you're a part of the Getty network you're
degrees of separation are 3.26. But the A

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.910
list is genuinely more special than everyone
else.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:25.869
So while, and you can kind of see this on-on
here, the A list are the circle, they're the

00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:30.140
super-clustered ones. They spend all of their
time together; they don't go to a lot of events;

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.270
and they spend time with the same people.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:36.910
If you're in the B or the C list you might
as well just be in the Getty Image database

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:41.380
as a whole because you don't have any more
connections than anyone else in the network.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:48.220
And so why might this, I mean you can see
these people are not connected at all. They-they-they

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.869
don't have this kind of connected. It's really
that center area and those are all the A list

00:35:52.869 --> 00:35:53.869
stars.

00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:59.260
Now one thing that is very clear is that we
talk about sort of toiling away on work; at

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.500
some point you can penetrate the elite network.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.221
What we find is you actually need a quantum
leap into these networks. That it doesn't

00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:10.530
just, it doesn't happen just as some sort
of linear trajectory. I mean you-you genuinely

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.579
have, something lucky has to happen or you
have to, you have to win the Oscar that gets

00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:19.440
you the invite to the Oscar parties or you
have to marry an A lister. I mean you have

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:25.430
to genuinely do something that-that catapults
you in rather-rather than just hoping it's

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.430
gonna happen one day.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:30.069
I don't have this network up, but I really
think this is important to bring up. The-the

00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:34.599
other thing that we did was we looked at this,
the media stars and we looked at their social

00:36:34.599 --> 00:36:35.650
network.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:41.150
If you are very, very recorded in the media
you're network looks like the A list. The

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.920
difference: you have to work that much harder.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.640
Paris Hilton's network, and we may laugh about
it, but actually I was actually quite impressed

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.890
with her after I'd done all this research.
She works really, really hard. Her network

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:57.510
looks like if she was an A-lister. As in if
she'd won copious awards and she was invited

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:02.750
to all these exclusive parties. Because she's
able to, by virtue of going out all the time,

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:10.069
cultivate a high number of degrees and-and-and
closer degrees of separation from other people

00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:15.400
in a way that A-listers are only given by
virtue of the fact that they-they have these

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.400
very selective outlets that have high impact
value.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.859
So actually if you're a social media star,
if you don't have talent and you're not immediately

00:37:22.859 --> 00:37:26.920
in the A list, you just need to hustle. And
that's, and that's essentially what-what it

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.990
seemed that these top media stars do.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.990
[pause]

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.990
Okay.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.440
What are some of the conclusions?

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.230
One, in some ways it's-it's not a shocker
but it, I think it has a lot of implications

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:41.590
for how we understand headquarters and competitive
advantage, is that there's only three places

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:46.920
in the world that really count in terms of
getting your photograph taken in a, in a sort

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.440
of aggregate way, right? I mean 80% of the
photographs are taken in three places.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.810
[pause]

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:58.579
The other thing though is that genuinely the
way you socially behave has some implications

00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:03.900
for your career outcome. And so it really
is that we didn't find any A-listers in Las

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:10.329
Vegas. That's not a place that they ever are
photographed. So cause and effect may be unclear

00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:14.710
maybe they just have a lot of work and they
don't have time, or maybe they just don't

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:19.440
make that decision and pigeonhole themselves
into a, being a particular kind of star that

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.210
kind of corrupts their brand, which actually
as we know in these cultural industries is

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:24.210
really important.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.329
And then the other thing is just that the
A list really is different and-and this is

00:38:28.329 --> 00:38:32.339
fascinating for people who are interested
in social networks, is that we see a stratification

00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:36.561
process when we look at Getty Images database
anyway, okay, these are elites. These are

00:38:36.561 --> 00:38:40.430
elites. They have an elite network. They spend
time with each other. They get all this what

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.390
sociologists call 'preferential attachment'
from being a part of this network. They-they

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.130
get more out of their networks than we get
out of our random networks.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:53.490
But even within this elite network we find
these micro-stratification processes. There

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:57.870
are people even within that have even more
elite networks than everyone else, and they're

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:04.049
the ones who get the most benefits. But penetrating
it is-is-is seemly impossible.

00:39:04.049 --> 00:39:05.750
So that's it.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:10.950
Thank you very much. I hope you liked this
sort of piecemeal way of doing this, but I

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:16.119
wanted to capture it from all angles so.

00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:17.119
Thanks.

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:18.119
[applause]

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:19.119
[pause]

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:21.920
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Wait for the microphone.
I'll pass it around.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.089
[pause]

00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:27.860
&gt;&gt;male #2: Are-are all these graphics in your
book?

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.500
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: They are indeed.
[laughs] Better ones in fact. [laughs]

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.930
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you for coming in --

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:35.930
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Oh, thank you.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:36.930
&gt;&gt;female #1: this is really cool.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:42.130
I wonder like just about I think you did a
great job with the data in terms of defining,

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:46.559
but I wonder what the actual causality is
because I feel like it's more like you're

00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:51.910
creating definitions for that type of A list
and I think like if you would look at TMZ

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.430
it would be a lot different than Getty 'cause
Getty is much more focused on the A list.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:01.420
And I don't know if it's so much of build
it and they will come versus they're there

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.930
so we're gonna be there.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:08.549
But yeah, I think it would be really interested,
interesting to look at this versus like a

00:40:08.549 --> 00:40:13.480
TMZ or that kind of thing and even how this
differs like over time. 'Cause I think of

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.600
like Angeline Jolie but she is never in L.A.,
she's always all --

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.640
&gt;&gt;female #1: over the place and she's in Africa
a lot so --

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.640
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.640
&gt;&gt;female #1: maybe she's those one spots over
in Africa --

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.640
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Right.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.640
&gt;&gt;female #1: and stuff like that.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.640
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: She could be driving
like all of Getty's photographs.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.130
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs] Yeah, so I mean and
I know Getty's much more focused in the type

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:34.740
of events they cover and that kind of thing.
So do you, have you looked at other like the

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:38.940
Paris Hilton of a couple years ago or now
the Kim Kardashian of like the people that

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.839
are more focused on TMZ?

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:49.760
And then also I think like with the outside
factors are going on like the whole Tony Parker,

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.609
Eva Longoria thing that they wouldn't, we
wouldn't have cared necessarily what restaurant

00:40:53.609 --> 00:40:58.150
she was going to a couple months ago, but
now everybody wants to know what she's doing

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.150
so.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.049
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Those are, that's,
I mean we're absolutely thinking alike here.

00:41:01.049 --> 00:41:04.900
That's, those are exactly the problems that
we're working on. One thing is you're right

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.109
you get a this sort of, this sort of ephemeral
nature of celebrity which is of course is

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:12.430
that Eva Longoria won't be interesting to
us five years from now.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.520
There's only a couple of people that can actually
recreate themselves. I mean Madonna is like

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.260
the obvious example; Michael Jackson when
he was alive.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.940
So there is that problem.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.599
Two things that we're doing: one is that we
are doing time series. And this is actually

00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:30.440
we're being here at Google I would love your
take on this because we want to not just do

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.339
time series with the photographs, but do time
series with the other variables that may be

00:41:34.339 --> 00:41:39.339
influencing their career outcome so that we
can trace it. I mean a snapshot gives you

00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:43.760
a sense of what the structure of their network
looks like now and what they did that year.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.490
But what did they do in 2000 that might have
influenced why they're doing this now? I mean

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.079
is there other ways to tease this out?

00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:55.609
So for-for example with-with Google, I mean
could you actually sort by particular types

00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:59.799
of media? Would-would the way you were reported
in the media actually demonstrate this? Because

00:41:59.799 --> 00:42:04.559
it is a rough approximation just say you show
up a lot in the media. It's like well what

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:08.099
kind of media might-might also dictate things
too? So?

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:09.099
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah.

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:10.099
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: so thank you.

00:42:10.099 --> 00:42:14.410
&gt;&gt;female #1: And-and also how they, what they
do to sustain the like rise in popularity

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.410
 --

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:16.410
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.370
&gt;&gt;female #1: and the downfall because how
they'll keep on making those L.A. popular

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:24.619
restaurant visits to like make sure that they're
constantly staying in the media even if they're

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:26.630
story has kinda dropped off since then.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.580
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Totally. I mean
that was one of the things that we did notice

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.891
was that these media stars did act differently.
I mean they-they did go to L.A. all the time.

00:42:32.891 --> 00:42:36.910
And of course that's because that's where
the media is and so the paps will take photos

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.599
of you if you're going to restaurants there.
They're not gonna go to Utah just to take

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:41.950
a picture of you unless it's Sundance.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:42.950
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.869
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: And so the-the
thing that's hard about using TMZ or X17,

00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:51.859
which I'd love to, it's just the data, the
photographs are too chaotic right now.

00:42:51.859 --> 00:42:52.859
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:42:52.859 --> 00:42:55.210
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: I-I need to think
about how we could collect that data in a

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:59.400
way that would be rigorous enough that you-you'd
be able to derive something meaningful rather

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.970
than just; 'cause that the thing that's beautiful
about Getty I mean they're just so systematic.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:03.970
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:04.970
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: so.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.970
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah, for sure.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.000
And then, I'm sorry, another question I had.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.660
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: [laughs] I love
this section.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:13.609
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs] Another question I had
was I always like struggle with how much it

00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:15.411
is stars putting themselves in the public
 --

00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:16.411
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:43:16.411 --> 00:43:19.060
&gt;&gt;female #1: eye versus the public eye following
them and I know it's always easier for them

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.220
to say something or --

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.220
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:25.590
&gt;&gt;female #1: to play victim or not victim
but like I mean it seems to me like there's

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.760
certain stars that do have talent but do put
themselves in the public eye like Jessica

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.760
Simpson --

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.760
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.920
&gt;&gt;female #1: versus like Angelina Jolie. I
do think that they do try to avoid it they

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.490
don't absolutely like are aggressive about
not --

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.490
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Certainly selective.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:39.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: avoiding it but --

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.490
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: [laughs]

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:41.589
&gt;&gt;female #1: yeah but I mean they're definitely
are people following her. And then some people

00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:45.619
use that to bolster their whole appeal like
Mylie Cyrus or something ?

00:43:45.619 --> 00:43:46.619
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:49.980
&gt;&gt;female #1: where she lives right where all
the public, where all the paparazzi is anyway.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.829
So do you have any insights from that based
on this about like the A list stars, that

00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:58.430
I feel like they almost can become more A
list if they're like, "Oh we're trying to

00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:59.430
avoid it," or.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.039
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Well totally.
I mean that's a, that's a really good question.

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:07.700
So one thing I do fundamentally believe is
that your celebrity is definitely there's

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:13.640
agency involved here. I mean there are stars
who have won awards or starred in fantastic

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:19.490
films who are famous, but they're celebrity
is hanging on a thin reed and-and by choice.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:24.359
I mean Keira Knightley is a very interesting.
I mean super pretty, great actress, like wide

00:44:24.359 --> 00:44:28.329
acclaim. I don't know anything about her.
I mean she is barely a celebrity. She's proper

00:44:28.329 --> 00:44:33.140
famous, proper talented. We don't have anything
to connect with her as fans because she has

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.200
no interest in giving us that information.
And that's her prerogative.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.890
And I, so I do think that there is this sort
of decision that they make to go to restaurants

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:46.789
or go anywhere where the media's taking notes
or-or taking photographs. So-so I, so I think

00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:48.569
that that's-that's really true.

00:44:48.569 --> 00:44:54.619
And-and-and you-you were saying about how
they, I think you were saying how-how they

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:58.339
act differently from others. Was that the
second part of your question? You had another

00:44:58.339 --> 00:44:59.339
really good point and I --

00:44:59.339 --> 00:45:00.339
&gt;&gt;female #1: I don't know.

00:45:00.339 --> 00:45:01.339
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Are you at, anyway.

00:45:01.339 --> 00:45:02.339
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:45:02.339 --> 00:45:03.349
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: I don't know you
asked me a really good question I got like

00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:04.349
the first half but I --

00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:05.349
&gt;&gt;female #1: [laughs]

00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:07.260
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: didn't get the
second so.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.260
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.260
Well, thank you.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.250
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah. No, thank
you.

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.250
[pause]

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:17.420
&gt;&gt;male #3: It-it seems to me that some kinds
of media need big celebrities a lot more than

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:23.569
others. For example, TV and movies just because
the cost for production is so high tend to

00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:29.589
bank a lot more on really big celebrities
as opposed to other media like Web video or

00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:35.571
just the Web in general. And in-in The Long
Tail, Chris Anderson --

00:45:35.571 --> 00:45:36.571
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Yeah.

00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:39.829
&gt;&gt;male #3: documents this phenomena where
the hits keep getting smaller. The hits of

00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:44.770
the 2000's are lots smaller than the hits
of the 80s and the 90s.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:49.750
So ha-have you seen any trends in just the
magnitude of celebrity over time or do you

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.420
have any thoughts with that?

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.150
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Well it-it's funny
you bring up Chris Anderson's work because

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.940
I don't if you're familiar with Anita Elberse's
work, she's at Harvard Business School, but

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:10.960
she studied The Long Tail. And what she concluded
was that yes we had more niche interests but

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.930
that we still did glom onto the blockbusters.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:19.609
That in fact we do, I mean she, as she put
it, "We're social folks." So it's-it's actually

00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:24.790
part of the enjoyment of having a celebrity
that you're interested in or watching a movie

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:28.210
or reading a book, is the fact that other
people have too and so you can talk about

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.210
these things.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:33.099
So I think that there are subcultures. I think
there's-there's no question in fact in my

00:46:33.099 --> 00:46:37.299
book I talk a lot about this phenomena, this,
of the relative celebrity. That if you go

00:46:37.299 --> 00:46:43.610
to a Star Trek convention or you follow War
Games, there are, there are genuine stars

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:48.100
and-and the-the fans in those subcultures
care a heck of a lot more about those stars

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.829
than they do about Paris Hilton. They really,
she is an interloper as far as they're concerned.

00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:59.309
But-but that doesn't mean that people like
Paris or Kim Kardashian or Angelina Jolie

00:46:59.309 --> 00:47:04.359
become less important. In fact, if anything,
I think that they permeate society all the

00:47:04.359 --> 00:47:08.670
more because it, there's so many low, there's
such low barriers to entry and there's such

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.810
a deluge of-of free media.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:14.039
I mean actually I think in Anderson's later
book he talks about this that there's-there's

00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:18.940
just this sort of if you refresh your Perez
Hilton page every two minutes you've got more

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:23.710
information about someone. And so, in fact
if anything their presence is-is-is more,

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:30.380
but it-it can coexist with the-the rise of
these other stars.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.380
[pause]

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:37.400
&gt;&gt;male #4: So the question I have is actually
about data quality.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:45.520
So you said that Getty was like just comprehensive,
well ordered and so on; TMZ chaotic is the

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:53.400
term you used. Do you hypothesize in the book
as to maybe why? I mean I can tell, I-I have

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.170
a very good idea why Getty is so ordered,
but why is TMZ so chaotic?

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.839
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: I think it's because
they're reporting on something totally different.

00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:05.019
I mean in some ways they're both reporting
on stars, but TMZ is about this sort of the

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:10.339
prosaic, minute-by-minute activity of stars
grabbing a coffee or getting dinner.

00:48:10.339 --> 00:48:14.471
But if you look at Getty it's-it's really
at these-these formal events. I mean Getty

00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:20.869
has very little by way of the sort of accidental
photographs of stars. And I think, so I think

00:48:20.869 --> 00:48:23.769
that they're reporting a different aspect
of celebrity.

00:48:23.769 --> 00:48:27.569
So there's no question, I mean one thing when
I presented this data before people say, "Oh

00:48:27.569 --> 00:48:33.279
you, you're not capturing the bohemia of these
creative industries." And-and-and no, I'm

00:48:33.279 --> 00:48:38.049
not. But-but that's-that's, you kind of have
to use the, what you, what you have and I

00:48:38.049 --> 00:48:43.631
think it still tells an important story but,
about the kind of celebrity and creative industries

00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:46.920
that we decide to commodify. So, yeah.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.440
But-but you're, oh sorry. Go ahead.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:54.490
&gt;&gt;male #4: I was gonna say if-if there's runner
up behind Getty Images for like well ordered

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.369
images that you could study what would that
be?

00:48:56.369 --> 00:48:58.210
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: My goodness.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.210
[pause]

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.540
&gt;&gt;male #4: I'm thinking about data points
is-is why and --

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.540
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Oh right.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.460
&gt;&gt;male #4: would it be interesting to essentially
do a comparison between the data provided

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:12.950
by Getty and then the runner up of well ordered
data on celebrity to see if there's differences

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.020
there that are interesting?

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.740
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Oh that's interesting.
I mean I almost wonder if you'd, well one

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.800
thing I was actually thinking when-when you
said that was it might even be fruitful to

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:26.140
look at something like TMZ or X17. To look
at the differences because my sense is they're

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.809
very, very different, but actually in that-that
also tells you a story.

00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:33.829
So maybe in some ways it's not looking at
what's almost as good as Getty, it's like

00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:38.099
well what's looking at a totally different
angle of these stars and their lives and how

00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:40.170
do they tell a different story from-from Getty?

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.110
So yeah that a, that's a good idea.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:44.110
[pause]

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.260
&gt;&gt;female #2: I have a question.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:51.880
Just thinking about kind of the intersection
between talent stars and media stars and do

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:57.710
media stars have talent, recently Bristol
Palin did really well on Dancing With The

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:58.710
Stars --

00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:59.710
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: [laughs]

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:03.970
&gt;&gt; female #2: and I was wondering if you had
any theories about why [laughs] or how that

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:04.970
happened?

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:08.790
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: I mean it's kind
of like a broken watch is right twice a day.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.500
I mean she might actually be a good dancer.
[laughs]

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.500
[laughter]

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:17.990
I mean it's a, I mean it sounds like ridiculous
but I-I think that there-there-there is, I

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:22.650
think the problem is with the rise of these
sort of all celebrity types that we think,

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:26.519
"Oh well they, if you're a proper celebrity
you can't possibly be talented."

00:50:26.519 --> 00:50:31.329
But you never know I mean my argument always
about Paris Hilton is she definitely didn't

00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:36.160
seem talented but she's a, she's a businesswoman.
I mean she has taken that celebrity that we

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.029
didn't think she deserved and she has built
an empire.

00:50:38.029 --> 00:50:39.029
[laughs]

00:50:39.029 --> 00:50:42.890
And that's, I couldn't do that. [laughs]

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:43.890
[laughter]

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:44.890
That's talent. [laughs]

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:45.890
[laughter]

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:46.890
[pause]

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:48.089
&gt;&gt;Julie Wiskirchen: Any other questions?

00:50:48.089 --> 00:50:49.089
[pause]

00:50:49.089 --> 00:50:50.089
No.

00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:51.089
Thank you very much, Elizabeth.

00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:52.089
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Currid-Halkett: Thank you so much.
It's been really a pleasure.

00:50:52.089 --> 00:50:52.090
[applause]
