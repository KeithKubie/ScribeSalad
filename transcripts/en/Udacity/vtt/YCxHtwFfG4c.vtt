00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.780
Congratulations!

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.760
You've reached the end of the course.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.180
Well, the course videos anyway.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.740
Now if you remember nothing else,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.670
here's what I would say is
the biggest idea of this class.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.910
When it comes to algorithm and

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.740
data structure design,
there is life after RAM.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.030
In this course,
you lived three such lives.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.290
In the form of PRAMs, distributed memory
machines, and two-level memories.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.200
And of course you'll need, in the
afterlife, hybrid models that mix and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.140
match any of these.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.680
The main point is that there
are ways to formalize and

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.860
reason about communication,
which you now know.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.150
So good work, you!

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.190
As for what comes next, remember
that this class was mostly about

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.720
algorithmic and data structure
foundations, meaning theory.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.680
But there's a whole other side to HBC
which is about how do you make these

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.110
ideas actually work on real machines?

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.560
Many projects give you a little
bit of a flavor of this but

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.350
there's a lot more to it.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.428
It's an especially complex topic and
one which I've wasted,

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:05.500
not wasted, spent,
think positive, think positive.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.200
The bulk of my career thinking about.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.330
So who knows?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.060
Maybe you'll join me in another course
where we can spend some time together

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.820
thinking about that.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.260
That sound like a pick up line?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.760
Oops.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.540
Awkward.
