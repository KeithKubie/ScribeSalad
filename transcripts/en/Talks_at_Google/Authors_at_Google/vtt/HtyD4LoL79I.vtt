MATT WERNER: Hello.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.160
Welcome to this authors
at Google

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.600
presentation this afternoon.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.950
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.140
We have the pleasure to be
joined by Adam Mansbach and T

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.170
Cooper today.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.050
Adam Mansbach is author of
Shackling Water, Angry Black

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.870
White Boy, The End of the Jews,
which was winner of the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.850
California Book Award, and most
recently, Rage Is Back.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.980
His book, The Dead Run, is
forthcoming in 2013.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.360
He is best known for his
children's book for adults

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.430
titled Go the Fuck to Sleep.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.710
It reached number one on
Amazon's best seller list a

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.970
month before its release,
and was a national

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.480
best seller in 2011.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.490
The book is perhaps best known
by its audio version read by

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.840
Samuel L Jackson, which
went viral.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.610
Mansbach lives in Berkeley,
California, and co-hosts a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.780
weekly radio show called
Father Figures on KPFA.

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:02.500
T Cooper is an American
novelist.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.180
He is the author of three
novels, Sum of the Parts,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.470
Lipshitz Six, or Two Angry
Blondes, The Beaufort Diaries.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.780
Cooper is also co-editor, with
our second reader, of the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.000
anthology, A Fictional History
of the United States With Huge

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.920
Chunks Missing.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.380
His writing has appeared in The
New Yorker, the New York

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.530
Times, The Believer, and
Poets And Writers.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.220
His latest book that he's here
to talk about is Real Man

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.080
Adventures, just published
by McSweeney's.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.380
And also, for the Googlers in
the audience, you may purchase

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.530
the books at discounted price
over in the back from Books,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.580
Inc.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.130
So without further ado, I'd like
to welcome T Cooper and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.380
Adam Mansbach.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.450
T COOPER: Hey.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.760
Thank you so much for
the introduction.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.580
Thanks for having us here.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.900
My name's T Cooper, and I'm a
little confused because of all

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.090
the Google things I've been
seeing, and a little off my

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.340
game, because it's quite a
wonder here, as you all know.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.250
To you, it's normal.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.890
To me, it's mind blowing.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.260
But I'm going to actually
start off with--

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.690
I think my wedding photos are
going to pop up because of the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.100
screen saver, so let's get this
film part out of the way

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.200
as quickly as possible.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.860
This is just a brief
intro to my book.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.300
I guess I'm a multimedia kind
of author, although I don't

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.450
really call myself that.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.490
But you'll see today
that you're

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.130
going to see some medias.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.390
This is a short film adaptation
of a few sentences

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.150
from my book, and we'll
start off after that.

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:54.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.470
What's the first thing people
ask when a woman is going to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.646
have a baby?

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:01.250
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.407
We told the doctor
not to tell us.

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:05.890
We wanted to be surprised!

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.510
Well, I'm here to tell you
that gender surprises can

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.630
happen anytime.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.197
Just ask my parents.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.960
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.110
T COOPER: OK, so that was a
very exciting multimedia

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.056
presentation for you all.

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:43.460
Is it OK if I just shut that?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.900
Good?

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.100
OK.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.180
So, I--

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.460
maybe you can tell
from the video--

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.770
am transgender, which is not
my favorite topic to talk

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.830
about, which is why I wrote
a whole book about it.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.120
I've been actually touring
a lot of the book, and--

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.166
is the feedback coming because
I'm close to the line?

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:07.950
It's fine.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.190
OK.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.940
I've been touring a ton with the
book, and this is actually

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.030
kind of toward the
end of my tour.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.110
And it is actually a very
strange place I find myself

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.610
in, because it's a topic that,
walking down the street,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.740
buying shit at the grocery
store, picking up my kids at

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.300
school, like, I don't
deal with it.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.240
I don't talk about it.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.000
Many of my neighbors
don't know.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.480
What would you know, except you
can tell I'm short, but

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.160
that's about it.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.520
So, that said, I might seem a
little chippy about it, and I

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.820
apologize for that in advance.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.340
But one way that I've been
dealing with my issues is by

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.210
having super guest stars
read with me on tour.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.080
A couple weeks ago, we
had Clay Aiken--

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.640
you might know him as being a
second place runner up in

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.820
American Idol and on Celebrity
Apprentice, though I think he

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.700
probably should have won.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.990
But he read with me,
and sang a song.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.130
And I've some other guest
stars, like in LA, like

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.050
actors, guys from Curb Your
Enthusiasm, Arrested

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.760
Development.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.490
And today, I have the Go The
Fuck To Sleep guy with me, to

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.310
be my personal little you know
what to read with me.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.360
So I'm going to actually bring
him up, because this book is

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.050
kind of a conversation, I would
say, about masculinity.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.200
By no means, we don't
call it a memoir.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.430
It's not a memoir.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.600
Hey, it's the Go The
Fuck To Sleep guy.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.900
ADAM MANSBACH: Hey.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.940
T COOPER: Sorry.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.850
We go way back, and I just--

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.092
ADAM MANSBACH: Yeah, you knew
me before I was the Go The

00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:33.820
Fuck To Sleep guy.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.652
Hopefully you'll know me
after I'm the Go The

00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:36.130
Fuck To Sleep guy.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.450
T COOPER: I hope I get to.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.380
ADAM MANSBACH: I hope
that happens.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.870
T COOPER: Anyway, the book is
kind of a meditation on

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.750
masculinity, and it deals with
a lot of different genres.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.310
And there's essay, there's a
little bit of memoir, but

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.510
there's a lot of conversations
and interviews.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.930
So Adam is going to help me
read a chapter for you.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.540
We're going to start with
the Passport chapter.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.410
This is a chapter called Why
They're Called Passports, as

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.590
in pass ports.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.790
And it's actually a actual
conversation that I had with

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.950
the United States Department of
State on the phone, when I

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.720
applied for my new passport
to have the proper

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.720
gender marker on it.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.190
And it was returned to me.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.600
And you're going to hear what
happened, I'm gonna say three

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.590
seconds after I got my passport
back in the mail, and

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.790
I was on the phone to the
Department of State.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.340
So Adam is going to play the
part of the Department of

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.110
State, and I'm going to
play the part of me.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.230
So you'll know when
I talk, I'm me.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.610
And when he talks--

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.360
we're not going to
keep saying, me,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.190
Department of State.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.820
ADAM MANSBACH: Department
of State.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.660
It's the role I was
born to play.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.870
T COOPER: Yeah, no,
this is you.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.320
All right, so I think
we're ready to go.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.080
Are you--

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.860
ADAM MANSBACH: I'm ready.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.410
T COOPER: OK.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.590
He's been practicing
all night.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.450
Me.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.260
It's the last time
I'm saying it.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.400
I don't understand what
the problem is.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.830
You have my fee, you have
my correctly filled out

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.570
application, and you have a
letter from a surgeon saying

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.830
that I had sexual reassignment
surgery and have lived as a

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.170
man for several years.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.640
ADAM MANSBACH: It doesn't say
you had complete sexual

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.620
reassignment surgery.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.090
T COOPER: I see.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.050
Well, what does complete sexual

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.490
reassignment surgery entail?

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.570
ADAM MANSBACH: It requires,
um, it requires

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.130
full complete surgery.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.180
T COOPER: What is full
complete surgery?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.155
ADAM MANSBACH: What you are
calling bottom surgery.

00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:36.910
T COOPER: Well, so essentially,
in order to have

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.040
a passport that I can safely
travel with, I need to

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.630
disclose what's in my pants.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.280
ADAM MANSBACH: I suppose you
could put it that way.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.740
T COOPER: So I could have a
penis and giant boobs, but

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.770
you'd still let me have the M?

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.040
ADAM MANSBACH: I didn't make
up the rules, sir.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.830
I'm just telling you
what it says.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.390
T COOPER: Did you have to tell
the government what's in your

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.722
pants in order to get
your passport?

00:07:56.722 --> 00:07:59.490
ADAM MANSBACH: Uh, sir,
I did not have to, no.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.770
T COOPER: So does it seem fair
that I would have to?

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.190
ADAM MANSBACH: I can't
speak to that.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.780
T COOPER: So you're
telling me--

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.250
ADAM MANSBACH: I'm sorry.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.830
I just need evidence of complete
sexual reassignment

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.590
surgery, and then I can process
your application.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.595
T COOPER: The doctor says he
considers it full sexual

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:16.310
reassignment surgery.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.246
ADAM MANSBACH: It needs
to say complete.

00:08:18.246 --> 00:08:20.740
T COOPER: OK, so you're telling
me I need to go to,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.110
like, Zagreb, Croatia, and spend
like $50,000 on a far

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.310
from perfect procedure that
would give me, essentially, a

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.330
limp piece of sirloin hanging
between my legs for you to

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.090
issue me a passport
with an M on it.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.980
ADAM MANSBACH: Again, sir, I
didn't make up the policy.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.049
I just need something that
says you've had complete

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.610
sexual reassignment surgery.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.900
T COOPER: I have completed
my transition.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.809
ADAM MANSBACH: Not according
to the guidelines.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:42.809
T COOPER: Whose guidelines?

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.460
ADAM MANSBACH: The Department
of State's.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.920
T COOPER: What about
my guidelines?

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.000
Like, what if I'm OK
with how I am?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.980
Actually, how about this?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.850
Why don't you just tell me how
many inches of penis the

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.920
government requires to
decide that I'm male.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.780
ADAM MANSBACH: I'm sure
I don't know, sir.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.810
T COOPER: No, seriously,
how long?

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.420
Because I might just make
it in under the wire.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.710
ADAM MANSBACH: I don't know.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.540
T COOPER: OK then.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.820
What if I don't have either?

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.430
Like, what if you can't tell?

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.002
What do those people get?

00:09:09.002 --> 00:09:10.240
ADAM MANSBACH: Uh--

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.330
T COOPER: Or, what if I don't
want to discuss with a

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.970
complete stranger or put down on
record with the government

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.040
what I have down there, because
it's nobody's business

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.440
except mine and whoever
I share it with?

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.650
ADAM MANSBACH: Uh--

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.470
T COOPER: OK, this is just
extremely personal, and I'm

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.230
uncomfortable having to talk
about this with you just to be

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.350
able to travel freely and
comfortably in the world.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.290
ADAM MANSBACH: I can assure
you it's not entirely

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.380
comfortable for me, either.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.670
T COOPER: I know you're trying
to help, but can I just ask

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.610
you one more question?

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.770
ADAM MANSBACH: Yes.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.200
T COOPER: All those guys in Iraq
getting their genitals

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.470
blown off by IEDs--

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.700
do you make them change their
passports from M to F when

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.990
they come home, because they
don't have penises anymore?

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.175
ADAM MANSBACH: I don't know
what you want me to say.

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.280
Send me a letter that says
you've had complete gender

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.300
reassignment surgery, and I'll
process your application.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.624
T COOPER: Thank you, Mr.
Go The Fuck To Sleep.

00:09:56.624 --> 00:09:58.085
We're stopping there.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.850
OK.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:10.330
So, my publisher is McSweeney's,
which is kind of

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.830
a playful, somewhat local
publisher, and they do a lot

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.750
of fun stuff with their books.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.600
Like, mine comes
packaged in a--

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.990
you'll see if you
check them out--

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.990
like an old-timey pulp blacked
out magazine cover, where you

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.720
just see the title and
a big angry shark

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.870
face peeking through.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.440
Another thing I got to do was
produce a CD with mostly

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.080
original music, all inspired
by various

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.870
chapters in the book.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.650
So we have some really amazing
artists on there, like

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.490
Kathleen Hanna is a new band,
has a song on there.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.660
A band called Hem,
which is great.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.120
Rick Moody, the author, has
an original song on here.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.290
And it's pretty cool, because I
sent them various chapters,

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.620
and because I wanted this to be
kind of a discussion about

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.070
masculinity, and not my being
the authority, because--

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.190
I mean, I am, but--

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.100
I felt like it was important
to have a lot of different

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.810
voices weighing in on
the conversation.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.240
So not only are there voices in
the book like the one you

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.980
just heard--

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.140
the Department of State's--

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.760
but there's actually
musical voices.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.500
So it's kind of cool to check
out a chapter and listen to a

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.640
song, as nerdy as that sounds.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.930
And today, actually, I
might have a trivia

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.120
question, if we have time.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.020
So it might be reality
TV based.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.200
So brush up on that, and you
might get a free CD out of it.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.250
But these are highly
collectible.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.180
We only made like
1,500 of them.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.280
And if you get a book today,
I think we have 10.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.600
So the first 10 people who buy
books, you can walk away with

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.390
these as well.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.160
Anyway, three of the songs in
here are kind of interstitial,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.510
like interludes.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.590
And they go along with six word
memoirs that I've written

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.030
for the book.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.160
So what I'm going to do is read
you the six word memoirs,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.070
and then play you the songs
that were written

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.150
based on the memoirs.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.310
And they're actually by this
amazing artist named Peg

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.060
Hambright, who was a part of
the band, The Judy Bats,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.570
which, if you're under 40, you
don't know who they are.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.290
Thank god, you know them?

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.570
Bless you.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.930
That guy knows The Judy Bats.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:07.470
Early '90s.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.590
Who cares?

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.100
OK, so I'm going to read for
you just these short clips,

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.610
and play the songs that
go along with.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:21.570
OK, the first one
is called High

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.400
School, A Six Word Memoir.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.720
Had a good personality,
I'm told.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.970
[MUSIC - PEG HAMBRIGHT,
"INTERLUDE: HIGH SCHOOL"]

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.330
College, A Six Word Memoir.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.980
Guys dug me.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.230
I mostly declined.

00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.911
[MUSIC - PEG HAMBRIGHT,
"INTERLUDE: COLLEGE"]

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.640
And My 20s, a six word memoir.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.070
Thank god for Astor
Place Barber Shop.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:14:01.920
[MUSIC - PEG HAMBRIGHT,
"INTERLUDE: MY 20S."]

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.010
Thank you to the Judy Bats.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.750
All right, so I guess we need
to get this show rolling.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.270
There are some heartfelt
things in the book.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.170
There's a couple interviews with
my wife, who has to put

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.160
up with me.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.130
There's a little bit about my
kids, who I don't talk a ton

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:25.445
about, but as you can imagine,
I have kind of a unique path

00:14:25.445 --> 00:14:27.605
through this world.

00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:30.420
I had one event in LA last
week where a celebrity

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.470
designer came up and told me,
after an actor read the part

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.550
of my wife and I read the part
of myself from the book, and

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.650
he said that our love was--
well, first he said I had an

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.190
aura radiating from me that
was, I think, red and very

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.050
healthy, and very vibrant, and
that I have great energy.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.190
How are you doing?

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:50.440
What are you having for lunch?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.680
She's not sharing.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.370
So he was saying, as I was
telling my truth, which made

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.010
me want to die.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.120
But then he said that my wife's
and my relationship

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.350
reminded him of LeAnn Rimes and
Eddie Cibrian, if anyone's

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.640
familiar with them.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.805
He had another lady pregnant,
and then he left her and went

00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:14.690
with this other lady,
Leann Rimes--

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.440
she's a country singer.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.010
So I felt really honored and
blessed by that comparison.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.920
I'm just trying to say there's a
lot of really touching stuff

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.470
in here that inspires a lot of
comparisons to true love.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.610
I think we're going to read one
more thing, so we can get

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.255
the Go The Fuck To Sleep
guy out here again.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.200
We're going to end with--

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.485
I didn't check to see if
it's OK to curse a lot.

00:15:41.485 --> 00:15:42.280
Is that cool?

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.210
T COOPER: OK, because this guy's
going to curse a lot.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.890
Usually I clear the room of
children for this one.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.930
It's not that bad, but,
you know, some

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.180
people are so sensitive.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.490
But I'm going to read just one
more little bit of the book

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.686
for you guys, and then head out,
and we can do some Q and

00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:02.400
A afterwards.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.345
But I do want to encourage you
to, if you're interested at

00:16:07.345 --> 00:16:11.190
all in the subject matter--

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.690
it's a very universal story,
like, the way I kind of go

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.570
through this is--

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.460
I don't know.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.490
I feel like it's about--

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.920
all stories that are interesting
are about people

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.980
becoming who they're
meant to be.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.050
So there is some heartfelt
stuff, despite what you're

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.630
hearing here today.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.100
This is a chapter
called Dialogue.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.750
I'm going to bring
him back up.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.790
Adam, come join me.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.290
Page 239.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.720
So this comes later in the book,
and I've heard this is a

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.420
controversial part of the book,
but I'm going to do it

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.260
for you here today, because I
think you guys can take it.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.540
I think you need a CD for
knowing the Judy Bats.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.150
Are you interested in that?

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.380
OK.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.975
Will you give this to him,
so I don't give feedback?

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.500
The rest of you are going
to have to buy

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.370
discounted books for that.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.290
OK.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.450
So what he's going to read for
you is an open letter to Brad

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.770
Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and
it's written by Bonnie Fuller,

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.790
and she's the editor of the
website Hollywood Life, Your

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.980
Celebrity News Gossip and Style
BFF, which means best

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.210
friend forever.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.720
She used to be the editor
of Us Magazine is my

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.240
understanding--

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.589
that print magazine that,
well, no one cares about

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.320
print, but you might
have heard of it.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.930
So Adam is going to read for you
Miss Fuller's open letter

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.070
to Brad and Angelina, exactly
as it appeared on her blog.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.470
Take it away.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.840
ADAM MANSBACH: I'm honored that
you would think of me for

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.692
the role of Bonnie Fuller.

00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:45.450
T COOPER: Does anyone
have a wig?

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.820
ADAM MANSBACH: Can I ask you
one-- how do you pronounce

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.260
that word right there?

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.990
T COOPER: He doesn't
know Brangelina.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.770
Everyone knows Brangelina.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.950
ADAM MANSBACH: I thought
it was a hard G, maybe.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.460
I'm not up on a lot of this
celebrity gossip shit.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.310
T COOPER: It's like if we were
dating, we'd be like, Tadam.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.760
ADAM MANSBACH: Wow.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.190
T COOPER: Or Coopback.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.190
ADAM MANSBACH: That's
yet another reason

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.170
we shouldn't date.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.970
T COOPER: Done.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.880
ADAM MANSBACH: Brangelina, what
are you doing to poor

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.100
Shiloh Jolie Pitt?

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.540
Your 3 and 1/2 year old daughter
is getting dressed in

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.170
boy's clothes so often by you
that the New York Post even

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.720
described her today
as your son.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.020
And no wonder.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.650
She was photographed in daddy
Brad Pitt's arms, heading into

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.050
the Broadway show Mary
Poppins on January

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.920
3rd, wearing a boys'--

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.060
literally--

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.610
Burton's--

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.800
this is terribly written--

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.620
Burton ski cap and black
puffy jacket.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.920
In recent photos, she's been
decked out in a fedora, tie,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.320
camouflage pants, boy vest,
pirate sword, navy knit skull

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.590
and crossbones hat, black jeans,
grey jackets, black and

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.750
white skull socks
and sneakers.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.140
Even the stuffed animal
she carries is blue.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.390
Never, ever is Shiloh
dolled up in

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.690
anything remotely girlish.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.700
Her blonde hair is hidden under
hats or left unbrushed

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.400
and pulled to the side
of her face.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.840
Her sister, Zahara Jolie Pitt,
however, is allowed to have

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.295
her girly touches.

00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:12.710
Her Mary Poppins hair was pulled
into a blue barrette

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.400
and pretty bracelets.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.350
Bracelets?

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.040
Sic.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.380
Sic, yeah, bracelets.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.760
Escaped from under the
arm of her coat.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.980
And you're not dressing your
little boys like girls.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.310
So Brad, and so Angelina,
what's up with the cross

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.950
gender dressing for Shiloh?

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.410
Did you both want another
boy, not a girl?

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.990
Maddox and Pax--

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.050
really, Maddox?

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.260
Weren't enough?

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.640
Aren't you worried that
you're going to

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.810
confuse little Shiloh?

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.510
Give her gender identity
issues?

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.030
Isn't it hard enough to grow
up without your parents

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.470
dressing you like the
opposite sex?

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.230
Motherfuckers?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.710
I-- sorry.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.570
I got carried away there.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.470
I added that.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.740
That was me.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.630
A shrink says yes.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.810
Angelina has said that she
was bisexual in public.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.460
This is her bisexuality
coming through.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.620
She's saying, I'm not going to
teach my daughter gender.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.770
Let her pick, believes
psychologist Dr. David

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.020
But will it confuse her?

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.720
Yes, says Doctor [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.690
She is being guided into
a bisexual role.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.910
Her mother is projecting this
onto this particular child.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.900
She has chosen her
as her favorite.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.790
I think this is an issue.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.720
Such an issue that Shiloh is
already insisting she be

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.320
called by a boy's name, John.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.670
Not much imagination
on Shiloh, huh?

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.650
Brad apparently told Oprah that
Shiloh insists on being

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:34.240
called John, he explained.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.190
It's a Peter Pan thing.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.600
Peter Pan thing my-- ahem.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.600
I just threw up a little
bit in my mouth.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:42.710
Brad!

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.580
Does Shiloh even know what
the color pink is?

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.080
Has she even seen it?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.720
Why do you let little Shiloh
be dressed this way?

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.560
All I can say is that Brad must
be whipped if he allows

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.290
this, believes Dr.
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.760
Wow, Brad!

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.910
You're whipped!

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.830
Now, come on.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.040
Time to get up your gumption for
the sake of your daughter,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.820
and let her be a girl
if she wants to be.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.890
Sincerely, Bonnie Fuller.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.710
T COOPER: Thank you.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.530
That was gorgeous.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.400
That was beautiful.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.030
ADAM MANSBACH: Thanks.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.940
T COOPER: Truly beautiful.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.900
Interestingly, there
was a response to

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.170
the letter that ran.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.980
It's an open letter to Bonnie
Fuller from Shiloh Jolie Pitt.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.170
And if you do check
out the book--

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.380
I haven't mentioned
that, have I?

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.360
If you do check out the book,
you'll see it's actually in a

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.920
child's writing, and I'm going
to read it for you here to end

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.910
this little party.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:43.590
Dear Mrs. Fuller, wow are
you a stupid cunt.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.630
I'm not the favorite.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.250
Zahara is, duh.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.540
And Maddox is the favorite
boy, by a landslide.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.720
Everybody knows that.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.700
It's an open secret
in our family.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.250
And what's this doctor
you asked about

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.250
my mom sexual history?

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.810
Is he even a doctor?

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.200
I'm three, and I know that what
clothes somebody wears

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.830
doesn't make them attracted
to the same sex.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.210
That's retarded.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.080
Not to mention, I don't
even know what sex is.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.750
And whatever it is, I won't be
having it for about 13 to 15

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.140
years anyway.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.140
Stop sexualizing me.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.070
It's creepy, like when those
ladies make their kids do

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.460
strip tease on Toddlers
and Tiaras.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.650
Listen, lady.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.150
I'm not the one who's
confused.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.590
Society is confused.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.170
Psych 101, gender is a socially
constructed concept.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.100
Practically everything in
society is assigned a gender,

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.000
like toys, colors, behaviors,
my Burton ski cap, and

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.450
apparently, even simple black
jeans and a grey jacket.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.270
My dad may be whipped,
but you spend all

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.530
day every day blogging.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:53.070
Sincerely, John Jolie Pitt.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.610
Thank you.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.450
Thank you, Adam.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.130
We're going to bring him
up, and take it away.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.210
ADAM MANSBACH: Hey, what's
going on, guys?

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.070
How's everybody feeling?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.830
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.570
ADAM MANSBACH: All right.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.190
All right.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.260
So, I have a couple
of books here.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.750
My new novel is called Rage Is
Back, and it is a story about

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:15.380
the New York City graffiti
writers of the '80s making a

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.690
dramatic comeback in 2005, and
taking over every train in the

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.450
New York City subway system at
once, painting them all in

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:28.140
order to exact a long delayed
revenge against the former

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.050
transit cop who is now
running for mayor.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.165
And it's a little different than
my previous book, Go The

00:23:34.165 --> 00:23:38.180
Fuck To Sleep, although if
you're a fan of that book, I

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.070
would say that this book
contains far more curses.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.570
This book took me much
longer to write.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.610
Three years, 35 minutes.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.610
Both, however, were
labors of love.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.610
And some people kind of-- a lot
of the conversations I'm

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.860
having about the new book begin
with the previous book,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.560
which is understandable,
because, like T Cooper said,

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.900
I'm the Go The Fuck
To Sleep guy.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.580
Sometimes people know that I
wrote other novels before

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.815
this, and sometimes
they don't.

00:24:07.815 --> 00:24:10.535
I'm always flattered when they
do, because I wrote, like, I

00:24:10.535 --> 00:24:12.390
don't know, three or four
novels before this.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.300
When this book came out-- when
Go The Fuck To Sleep came out,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.680
there was a lot of hooplah, and
shit happened to me that I

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.390
never expected to happen,
and that I still

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.150
can't believe happened.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.690
Like, I was on the
Today Show twice.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.600
And I'm basically the type of
writer who definitively does

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.650
not get to go on the Today Show,
because I write literary

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.250
fiction that doesn't contain
vampires or, like, love

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.430
stories for the ages or
anything like that.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.640
But, like, with this one, it
was just a little cute book

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.860
that I wrote kind
of as a joke.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.420
But it turned out that every
parent in the world feels the

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.390
way that I did.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.400
It's funny, because the book
barely got published.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.520
I barely even attempted
to publish it.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.600
I wrote it, I read it at dinner
parties for a couple of

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.300
months, and then I sent it to
my friend who runs a very

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.750
small independent publishing
house in Brooklyn, has a

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:03.500
couple of kids.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.380
I knew they didn't sleep.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.390
I thought he might think
it was funny.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.410
And there was this strange
moment where we both thought

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.520
the book was really funny, and
yet neither of us was really

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.640
ready to pull the trigger
and publish it.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.900
We thought we might just be
bad parents, you know?

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.950
And then even after he decided
that he would publish it, we

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.800
had all these conundrums,
all these problems.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.230
We didn't know simple stuff,
like where the bookstore would

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.680
this book be stocked?

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.620
We were clear that the
children's section was

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.870
inappropriate, in that it
says fuck on the cover.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.900
But we didn't, like--

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.620
was it humor?

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.540
Is it this?

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.710
And this was resolved one day
when Johnny, my publisher,

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.350
walked into his local
independent bookstore and

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.200
presented the book to them,
and asked them where they

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.400
would stock it.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.920
And they read it, and they
laughed, and they were like,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.810
oh, this is perfect.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.230
This goes in the parenting
section.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.050
And me and Johnny were like,
there's a parenting section?

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.480
Which confirms the earlier
thesis about us being shitty

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.650
parents, I guess.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.810
But yeah, like, on the Today
Show, I went on a couple

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.310
times, and once they knew who
I was, and once they didn't.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.070
And the first time I was on
there with Matt Lauer, right?

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.440
Real stand up guy.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.380
Very, very nice.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.260
There's a real art to
interviewing people,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.400
especially in a fraught
situation like live national

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400
television.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.910
Everybody's nervous, it's real
early in the morning, you're

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.690
heavily caffeinated, and you're
in front of a plate

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.900
glass window, and all these
people are, like, behind it

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.860
holding up signs that they made
that morning at their

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.270
hotels or whatever.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.670
I don't know what the hell
they're doing there.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.730
But like, I don't know if
they're from the Kalamazoo,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.670
Michigan Board of Tourism or
whatever, because they're

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.780
behind, they're like, aah!

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.960
Kalamazoo!

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.980
It's like, you came to New York
to stand here at 6:45 in

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.430
the morning with a sign
that says Kalamazoo?

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.080
Really?

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.890
That's your idea
of a vacation?

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.940
Anyway, so Matt Lauer has like
two minutes before you go live

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.870
on air to make you
feel comfortable.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.090
And he's great at his job.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.070
By the time I went on with Matt
Lauer, I felt like we

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.320
were old friends, and after the
interview, we were going

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.690
to go eat some pancakes or
hit some golf balls.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.580
Whatever the fuck Matt Lauer
does for fun, you know?

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.890
And we get on, and the first
thing he says is, Adam, before

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.550
this book, you wrote
several novels.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.915
You're an award winning
novelist.

00:27:10.915 --> 00:27:12.990
And I was real grateful
for that.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.360
And the interview was cool.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.810
And then I came back two days
later to do the Today Show

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.230
again, with Kathie
Lee Gifford.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.220
It's a very different
situation.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.280
Everybody referred to this as
the 11:00 hour, which sounded

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.000
really ominous.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.060
I didn't know what that means.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.370
In retrospect, it means that
Kathie Lee Gifford starts

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.100
drinking at 10:00.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.630
And like, again, two minutes
to make me feel comfortable

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.810
before we go on air.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.920
The last thing Kathie Lee
Gifford says to me before the

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.590
cameras roll and we're live
to however many million

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.780
households is, your
daughter Vivian.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.650
How old is she, that
little bitch?

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.540
I was like, really, Kathie
Lee Gifford?

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.420
I will punch you in your face
on live television.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.070
Like, I know I wrote a book with
curse words in it, but

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.600
yo, for real, Kathie
Lee Gifford?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.880
So I was like, totally
flustered

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.090
when the cameras rolled.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.340
I didn't know what
was going on.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.000
It was crazy.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.530
So, sometimes weird
things happen.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.630
And a lot of weird things
happened with this book.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.920
Among other things, people
often got the mistaken

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.400
impression that I
am a parenting

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.650
expert or a sleep guru.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.960
People also got the impression
that this was

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.170
a children's book.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:26.480
Like, people were up in arms on
the interwebs talking about

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.850
how they would never read
this book to a child.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:33.180
It seems to me that it would
take a startling unique blend

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.610
of literacy and illiteracy to
mistakenly read this book to a

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.280
child, in that it says
fuck on the cover.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.530
Again, I'll come back to that.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.710
One of the incidents that was,
to me, the funniest was, I was

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.530
asked to be a co-host
at a charity event.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.100
A fundraiser for a Boston
children's hospital.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.270
I'm from Boston, but the event
was in LA, because presumably,

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.080
people in LA have
a lot of money.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.110
So the co-host--

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.070
my co-host at the event was
this guy, Doctor Richard

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.260
Ferber, who may be familiar
to some of

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.340
you if you have children.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.070
Who has kids in this audience?

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.240
OK.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.660
Richard Ferber-- that
ring a bell?

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.690
The Ferber Method?

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.310
Sleep training?

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.890
He's regarded by some
as a monster, and

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.020
by others as a hero.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.480
He's a titan of the field.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.840
His theory is basically
that you should let

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.750
your kid cry it out.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.310
It's the opposite
of what we would

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.230
call attachment parenting.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.520
Among those who find his work
controversial and monstrous is

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.732
my wife Victoria, who was
accompanying me to the event.

00:29:33.732 --> 00:29:36.550
And I was seriously afraid that
she was going to, like,

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:40.070
throw a drink in his face or
something, because that theory

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.950
of letting your kid scream and
cry until they fall asleep,

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.260
and thus freeing yourself from
the type of situation you deal

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.160
with if you don't, she could
never really wrap her mind

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.580
around that.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.260
So I was worried about that.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.600
Doctor Ferber had requested
some slides from the book.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.690
Some images from the book to
use in his presentation.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.010
I was not giving
a presentation.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:05.180
My job was to drink
and shake hands.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.540
I'm a titan when it comes to
drinking and shaking hands.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.120
I'm great at that.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.180
And like, it was totally
inappropriate for him to give

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.180
a presentation, because these
were a bunch of decadent, rich

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.060
LA people who didn't need a 20
minute slide show about how to

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.610
put your kids to bed, because
they have nannies who do that.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.600
So he's giving this long
presentation, and when he

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.240
finally gets around to the
images from the book, the one

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.500
that he shows is an
image of a father.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.020
And this illustration is based
on me, because my Illustrator

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.990
Ricardo works from
photographs.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.140
A guy who looks something
like me, sneaking out

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.890
of the kid's room.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.760
The verse goes like this.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:47.160
Bleary and dazed, I awaken to
find your eyes shut, so I keep

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.060
my fingers crossed tight as I
tiptoe away and pray that

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.450
you're fucking asleep.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.540
And he put it on the screen.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.000
He was like, this is what
you should never do.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.010
I was like, really, Doc?

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.170
You just threw me
under the sleep

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.930
training bus, Dr. Ferber?

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.750
And it was kind of wild.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.020
I was standing in the back,
imbibing, you know?

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.850
But the crazy part is that the
next morning, I get an email

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.510
from Dr. Ferber.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.380
And the email-- we're staying
in the same hotel.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.560
He could have just knocked
on my door.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.250
And the email says, why didn't
you tell me that I know you?

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.070
I'm like, Dr. Ferber
has lost his mind.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:27.490
And it turns out that I
went to summer camp--

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.990
before I got kicked out, which
is a separate story.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.320
I used to get kicked out
of a lot of things.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.530
Sunday school, summer camp.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.760
I went to summer camp with
his son, Thad Ferber.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.330
The unforgettably named
Thad Ferber.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.700
And when you're like 13, your
friends from summer camp who

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.390
live two towns away, you see
them like, once during the

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.230
school year.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:53.250
So when I was 13 in 1990, Thad
Ferber and I went to Tower

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.250
Records on Newbury
Street in Boston.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.780
And I was a hip hop
kid, right?

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.800
I was a rapper, I was a DJ,
which is why I'm writing

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.740
novels about graffiti
these days.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.850
And so we went up to the top
floor to buy some rap records,

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.960
and there was a big life size
cardboard cutout of MC Hammer

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.140
up there, because MC Hammer,
from Oakland,

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.370
was large in 1990.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.000
But he wasn't exactly the
purest of products.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.960
Those of us who were rap
purists had a real

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.550
problem with him.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.170
We thought he was watering
down the music.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.920
He was at the top of
the pop charts.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.570
You may remember the large pants
he liked to dance in,

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.210
and subsequently the Kentucky
Fried Chicken ads he starred

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:31.280
in, followed by a long,
drawn out bankrupty.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.130
So naturally, I ripped the
head off the cardboard MC

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.170
Hammer cutout and stuffed it in
my jacket, which was not an

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.600
act of theft as much
as decapitation.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.460
And I attempted to exit the
store and was apprehended by

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.270
security, in classic fashion,
trying to go through the

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.870
revolving door, and they came
and put their foot and took me

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.380
and Thad Ferber, who was guilty
by association, down to

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.690
the dungeon beneath
Tower Records.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:59.890
And there, they browbeat us and
told us that the cardboard

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.270
cutout cost like $8,000--

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.060
which I find dubious--

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.930
and he told me I was banned for
life from Tower Records,

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.330
and they would only release me
into the custody of the police

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.160
or my parents.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.720
So this was not my
first rodeo.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.820
I got in trouble quite a bit.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.350
So I had a phone number
memorized that was a fake

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.020
number that just
rang and rang.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.200
So I gave them that number as
my parents' number, and it

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.840
just rang and rang, and I was
like, I guess they're out.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.310
Thad Ferber had never been to
the rodeo before, so he gave

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.980
them his parents' number.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.580
And in short order, Dr. Richard
Ferber showed up and

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.450
took us both home.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.920
And I had totally forgot
about this.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.670
I had never connected Thad
Ferber to Richard Ferber, so

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.750
my mind was blown.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.030
And it actually made me feel a
lot better about everything,

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.950
because clearly, Dr. Ferber is
not that great of a fucking

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:55.360
parent, in that he let his
son hang out with me.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.730
So that was one of the richer
anecdotes from the Go The Fuck

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.950
To Sleep insanity.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.800
Also good was the time that they
tried to ban the book in

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.180
New Zealand, of all
places, right?

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.300
New Zealand.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.179
I think of New Zealanders,
Kiwis, as

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.590
being fairly free spirited.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.060
But there's a group there--

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.710
and in fairness, the censorship

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.449
efforts never got anywhere.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.280
But it was this group called
Family First New Zealand.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.050
And the president of the
organization, who I think was

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.750
also probably the vice
president, the sergeant at

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.239
arms, the secretary,
you know--

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.230
put out this press release,
which I thought was great.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.690
I have it framed in
my office now.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:36.000
And it said, while this book may
be amusing and harmless in

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.750
the hands of normal, well
adjusted people, we are really

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.610
worried about its effects in
the hands of aggressive,

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.060
dysfunctional parents.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.370
I was like, that's the rubric
for what we ban now?

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.699
What aggressive dysfunctional
people should

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:50.949
not have access to?

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.870
Do you also propose
to ban spoons?

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.659
That could be a problem in
the hands of aggressive,

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.270
dysfunctional people.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.900
Luckily for us, the audiobook,
which was read in this country

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.920
by Samuel L Jackson, and also
Werner Herzog did a version

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.510
for us as well.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.840
You should YouTube that one.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.320
Also an adorable Filipino
grandmother, whose version

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.270
went viral on the interwebs.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.690
That's probably my favorite.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.020
In Australia and New Zealand,
the reader was this woman

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.830
named Noni Hazlehurst.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.660
Anybody from that part
of the world in the

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.910
building right now?

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:20.060
Yeah?

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.330
You know who Noni
Hazlehurst is?

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:23.370
ADAM MANSBACH: Yeah, she
was on Playschool.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.860
She's like Maria from Sesame
Street crossed with Meryl

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.180
Streep for that part
of the world.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.820
She's like, a successful film
actor who also is a legendary

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.340
child's television presenter.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.990
And when Family First New
Zealand came out with their

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.380
objections, Noni Hazlehurst
went on national TV and

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.400
basically told them to go fuck
themselves, and that was,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.340
like, the end of it.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.980
And that was an interesting
phenomenon here, too.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.340
Whenever somebody came out of
the woodwork and objected to

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.400
the book in whatever way, the
grandmothers of America

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.660
basically stepped in to our
defense and shut down

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.190
everything.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.720
And they had, like, the ultimate
moral authority.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.110
And they turned out to be a
really hip and crass group of

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:09.470
people, and I'm very
grateful to them.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.880
So yeah.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.110
I ended up talking nonstop
about this book for like,

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.180
eight months, eight hours
a day, crazy amounts of

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.020
interviews and stuff.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.940
And it's nice to have
a new novel out.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.310
And there is a connection, I
think, between the two books,

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.460
in the sense that what I'm
interested in exploring in my

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.020
work is sort of paradox
and human complexity.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.680
I think that's where narrative
and conflict come from.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.150
That's where good fiction
comes from.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.550
And that can be a very simple
paradox, like the paradox of

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.710
loving your kid to death, but
also being willing to do

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.110
anything in the world to get out
of that kid's room after

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:49.080
an hour and a half of trying to
put that little creatures

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.070
to bed, or it can be kind of
larger societal paradoxes.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.620
In this book, I'm dealing with
the world of graffiti.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.600
Subway graffiti as it originated
as a movement in

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.500
New York City in the
'70s and '80s.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.060
It was controversial then,
it remains so now.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.760
But for me, the lives of
graffiti writers are

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.870
fascinating, because
they embody so many

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.840
tensions and paradoxes.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.850
They tend to be the eccentrics,
the mad geniuses,

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.980
the theorists of hip hop.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.370
And I've enjoyed getting to
know them over the past 25

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.620
years of my life.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.210
And the paradoxes that they have
to deal with are sort of

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.095
the tension between fame
and anonymity.

00:37:29.095 --> 00:37:32.950
These guys are pursuing fame
in a brilliant and original

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.200
fashion, right?

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.470
The New York City subway trains
became their canvases.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:41.740
These were kids who were largely
disenfranchised,

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.560
coming out of marginal living
conditions in the Bronx and

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.690
Brooklyn, at a time when New
York City was bankrupt--

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:51.360
at a time when art and music
programs had all but been

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.900
destroyed in that city--

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.760
at a time when--

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.910
this is New York circa Ford
to New York drop dead.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.080
Jimmy Carter driving through the
Bronx, and getting out of

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.260
his car, and frowning and
getting back in and

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.020
disappearing.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.890
These kids figured out how to
make the subway trains of New

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.450
York their personal canvases.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.110
They circulated through the
city, and were seen by

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.510
millions of people a day.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:17.150
The city of New York spent $300
million between 1972 and

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:20.420
1990 trying to win this
war against a bunch of

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.670
15-year-olds.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.510
Those 15-year-olds outsmarted
them at every turn.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.950
And to me, there's always been
something epic and heroic

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.870
about graffiti in
a certain sense.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:32.340
So there's that tension between
art and vandalism.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.650
Most graffiti writers view
their work as both, and

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.970
they're not trying to privilege
one over the other.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.540
They see it as equally valuable

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.270
for both those reasons.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:44.380
Fame and anonymity, art and
vandalism, beautifying and

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.200
destroying a city.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.910
Even today, the war on graffiti,
although it's been

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.740
successful in removing graffiti
from the subway

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.240
trains, rages on.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.450
The same space that once
featured these illegal but

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:04.240
often very beautiful murals done
by the teenagers of New

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.460
York City, you can now buy
advertising space on these

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.340
trains-- on the outsides
of these trains.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.840
For $50,000 a month, you can buy
strips of advertising that

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.380
will run on the exteriors
of subway trains.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.730
So in this war over public
space, which was a coded war,

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.730
which was largely a
war against young

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.610
underprivileged kids--

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.980
kids of color, largely--
in New York City--

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.550
now, public space can be yours
if you can pay for it.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.620
And yet, the city of New York is
still so violently opposed

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.250
to graffiti--

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.090
even the aesthetic
of graffiti--

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.460
that the one thing you can't
advertise on the outside of

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.460
the train--

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.720
you can't use anything
that looks--

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.460
"looks" like graffiti.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.100
So you can put a naked
woman in a dog

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.710
collar advertising vodka.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.990
That's cool with CBS outdoor,
which administers these ads on

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.720
behalf of the MTA
and the city.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.570
You can put a placard on a bus
that is widely regarded as

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.240
hate speech against
Palestinians.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.980
That got through.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.570
But when I tried to advertise
this book--

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.370
and to be fair, I knew they
were going to say no.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.460
I didn't have $50,000 to spend
on no damn train--

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.010
they rejected the advertising,
because

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.790
it looked like graffiti.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.090
And to me, this is where the
sort of intellectual

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.900
bankruptcy of the policy becomes
clear, because the MTA

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.360
and the City of New York define
graffiti as vandalism.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.850
They define it as the defacement
of property through

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.900
a list of means.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.430
A litany of ways.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:35.030
What I'm proposing to do on this
train is not vandalism.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.210
It's advertising.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.940
And yet, the aesthetic is
being-- so it's the

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:43.150
criminalization now not of an
action, but of an aesthetic.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.290
So to tell me that I can't put
graffiti style letters on the

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.725
train, there's no real legal or
intellectual basis for it.

00:40:49.725 --> 00:40:53.490
A graffiti style letter, in this
context, is kind of like

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:56.690
a robbery style purchase.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.550
It doesn't actually
make sense.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.890
But this war was never
about aesthetics.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.560
It was about public space and
who had access to it.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.800
So what I try to do in the book,
which I don't have time

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:11.750
to read from, unfortunately,
is deal with the return of

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.340
these writers from the '70s
and '80s who have been

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.490
marginalized, who have
disappeared because the thing

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:21.040
they invented they have now
paradoxically outlived.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.760
Graffiti has become a worldwide
phenomenon, but it

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.620
no longer exists in the vibrant,
original form that it

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.810
once did in their own city.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.570
And the story is told by the
son of two famous writers.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.690
He's an 18-year-old
kid named Dondi.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.240
He's recently been kicked out
of his prestigious Manhattan

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.540
prep school for selling
marijuana--

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.100
a prep school he refers to
throughout the book only as

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.540
Whoop Dee Woo, Ivy League,
We's A Comin' Academy.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.520
And through the return of his
father, who's been on the lam

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.890
for 16 years, and the
reassemblage of his father's

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:56.370
shattered graffiti crew, and
some minor incidents of time

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.720
travel and some possible demons
who may or may not live

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.260
deep within the bowels of
the tunnel system--

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.320
New York's tunnel system goes 18
levels deep in some places,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.090
so there are a lot of
unused tunnels.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.180
There are people living in
those tunnels-- the mole

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.180
people, they're sometimes
known as-- they make an

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.830
appearance in here as well.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:17.130
This elaborate caper comes
together to attempt to paint

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:21.510
every train at once, thus
affecting either a total

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:25.030
shutdown of the MTA, which would
wreak havoc on New York,

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:29.070
or the running, once again, of
painted trains, which is

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.660
intended to bring down this
figure who's historically the

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.420
enemy of these graffiti
writers.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:38.450
It's a book I had a lot of fun
writing, and I'll leave it at

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.745
that, because I think we need
time for some Q and A, and

00:42:40.745 --> 00:42:41.660
I've been running
my mouth enough.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.870
So thank you Google, Googlers,
for having us today.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.190
We appreciate it.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:49.120
And if you want to buy
some books, we

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:49.980
definitely will sign.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.180
And even if you don't, the
discount that you get is

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.510
actually better than mine.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.420
So if you buy some books, I'm
happy to buy them from you at

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.500
a slight markup.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.760
So we can talk about that.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.240
Off camera.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.224
You wanna come back up here?

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Adam
and T, for speaking.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.690
Adam, I have a question
for you.

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:17.270
You said that after you wrote
your book, Go The Fuck To

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:22.120
Sleep, people were coming to you
as some parenting expert.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.430
And you currently have
a radio show on KPFA

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:26.580
called Father Figures.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.390
ADAM MANSBACH: Yes.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.990
I'm still pretending to
be a parenting expert.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.630
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, did
that show come out of the

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.790
book, or were you
doing it before?

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.760
And I was wondering if you could
just talk about your

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:43.350
role as sort of a theorist
on fatherhood today.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.790
ADAM MANSBACH: The show came
about after the book.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.930
I was living in Philadelphia
when the book was published.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.310
I had a temporary teaching
residency at Rutgers

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.320
University in Camden.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.610
Lovely Camden, New Jersey.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.840
When I moved back to the Bay,
my good friend Wayland

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.460
Southern, who has been a KPFA
host on a show called Hard

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.680
Knock Radio that's been an
institution in the Bay since

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.270
1996, he had also recently
had a daughter.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.150
And both of us were interested
in exploring some of the

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.160
nuances of parenthood, and
telling some of the stories

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:11.820
that go untold.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.700
I mean, the reason Go The Fuck
To Sleep was successful is

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.320
because there's a huge culture
of silence about some of the

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.350
more difficult or complicated
aspects of parenting.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:23.920
And we felt like we had a huge
cadre of friends who had

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.950
recently had kids, and that a
new generation of fathers

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.200
needed an outlet to kind
of tell their stories.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.610
So what we do on the show--

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:35.710
it's a talk show, and we talk
to mothers and fathers.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.220
Largely, we bring on people
that we enjoy

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.230
and think are brilliant.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:44.800
We bring on a lot of artists,
musicians, writers, and the

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.070
topic is sometimes parenthood.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.580
Often we get very far afield
from that, and talk about what

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.920
people are actually doing
with their work.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.030
But the common denominator is
parenthood, and a desire to

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:58.960
kind of plumb its mysteries
a little deeper.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.130
So we've been on the
air about a year.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:05.210
It's 11:00 to 12:00 Saturdays
on KPFN, and also

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.960
streaming on the web.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.430
ADAM MANSBACH: Yeah.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:11.890
I also was able to sell a sitcom
to CBS about a dude who

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.920
publishes a fake children's
book, and then has to pose as

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.830
a parenting expert in order to
keep riding the gravy train.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.110
Jerry O'Connell was going
to star in it

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:24.650
as a me-esque jackass.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.580
It didn't get picked up, so
you're not missing it or

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.850
anything, but we did write
a pilot, which was a fun

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.650
experience.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.020
AUDIENCE: And I have a follow-up
question for T. T, I

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.880
was wondering if you could talk
a little bit about what

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.610
your experience was like
publishing your latest book

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.620
with McSweeney's, because
McSweeney's is known for

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.290
having some kind of off
the wall productions.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:52.110
And it looks like you've done
some multimedia with the video

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.630
that you showed at the beginning
with the CD.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.030
And I was wondering if you could
kind of talk more about

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.450
the sort of mixed media format
for your latest book.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.810
T COOPER: They're just really
great to work with.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:06.370
I'm really honored that I got
to, because, you know, if you

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:08.200
think it, they'll do it.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.880
You have some experience
there too.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.840
I think that they would've been
fine with me moving into

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.890
the 15th level under the subways
and being a mole

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:20.140
people with this book.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.230
Anything from there
to the Today Show.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:26.070
But it's weird, because Matt
Lauer didn't call me.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:30.190
But anyway, I told them,
like, music is--

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.020
I have a lot of musical friends,
and a lot of access

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.030
to artists.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.540
If you check out the CD, there's
some really diverse,

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.690
interesting people.

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:41.980
And once I started putting that
together, it just kind of

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.770
was natural to have events
that were music related.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.430
So this is actually the first
time, or maybe the second

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:52.480
event that I haven't had live
music along with me.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:58.060
And again, anything that takes
the focus off me, thumbs up.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:03.420
So I just work with them, and
they were willing to think

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.680
creatively about venues,
and I don't know.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.700
I was really lucky.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.160
And the book also-- there's
artwork throughout.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.860
Pretty much every chapter starts
with some piece of

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.950
artwork, either my own or
artists, or there's charts and

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:18.630
graphs and photographs and
found stuff and stuff.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:25.560
So they understand that
storytelling is not square.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.150
Even though they do put out
books, interestingly, they're

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.000
not always square.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.720
But I mean, they get that it's
kind of a bigger piece that

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.560
you're putting together, and
there's so many different ways

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.750
to tell stories.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.610
So they just let me
tell it however.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:40.810
They didn't impose an ending.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:44.400
They didn't say make it happy,
make it tragic and then happy,

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.770
which you do hear a lot.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.470
So it was great.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.040
Thanks for asking.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.530
AUDIENCE: Could you talk a bit
about Angry Black White Boy,

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.250
if I have the name right?

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.780
ADAM MANSBACH: You do, yeah.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.030
Angry Black White Boy is a
novel that I published in

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:02.080
2005, and it was kind of my
attempt to remix the American

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.610
race novel for the hip
hop generation.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:09.060
As I said earlier, as that MC
Hammer anecdote perhaps

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.290
illustrated, I've been involved
and invested in hip

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.890
hop for a long time.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.560
And at the time that I got into
it in the late '80s, it

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.790
was really one of the only sites
in American life where

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:20.710
whiteness was made subjective--
where as a white

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.000
person, you had to really think
critically about race

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.090
and privilege.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:27.080
So Angry Black White
Boy is a satire.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.060
It's the story of an Afrocentric
white kid named

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:35.630
Macon Detornay who is kind of
politicized by the music he

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:38.580
grows up listening to-- the era
of Public Enemy and X Clan

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.280
and Boogie Down Productions--

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.970
and develops a rather profound
or extreme critique of white

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:50.730
privilege in America, and ends
up acting on that as a New

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:51.830
York City cab driver.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:55.900
He begins robbing other white
people who get in his cab,

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.610
which leads to a manhunt for
the presumably black cab

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.980
driver who's sticking up
all these white people.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:05.820
He ends up becoming kind of an
infamous celebrity once he's

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:10.710
apprehended, and uses his new
found platform to call for a

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:15.340
national day of apology, based
on a rhetorical statement in

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.620
Malcolm X's autobiography.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.800
Malcolm says, the nature of
racism in this country is so

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.530
pernicious, so persistent, so
unavoidable, and benefits

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:26.270
white people every day of their
lives, that they should

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.160
really be walking up to black
folks on the street and

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.540
apologizing.

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.420
Now, this is a rhetorical
statement in Malcolm's book.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.400
Macon is like, we're going to
do this shit on Friday.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.790
So people from all over the
country go to New York to

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.860
participate in this well
intentioned and ill considered

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.460
and ultimately disastrous day of
apology, and things kind of

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:45.984
take off from there.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:52.045
MATT WERNER: I would like to
thank Adam and T Cooper for

00:49:52.045 --> 00:49:53.295
coming to Google.
