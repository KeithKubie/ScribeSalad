multiple languages yeah I had a feeling

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650
multiple languages yeah I had a feeling
 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.200
multiple languages yeah I had a feeling
that this would be a big hit in Europe I

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210
that this would be a big hit in Europe I
 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.390
that this would be a big hit in Europe I
speak one language pretty well and then

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400
speak one language pretty well and then
 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.850
speak one language pretty well and then
two languages pretty badly and so we

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860
two languages pretty badly and so we
 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.379
two languages pretty badly and so we
think in Europe this is going to be a

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389
think in Europe this is going to be a
 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.690
think in Europe this is going to be a
pretty popular feature so the idea is

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700
pretty popular feature so the idea is
 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.700
pretty popular feature so the idea is
that many people don't speak just one

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
that many people don't speak just one
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.980
that many people don't speak just one
language they speak more and so what we

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990
language they speak more and so what we
 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.020
language they speak more and so what we
allow the user to do is to specify their

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030
allow the user to do is to specify their
 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.640
allow the user to do is to specify their
different languages that they speak and

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650
different languages that they speak and
 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.270
different languages that they speak and
put them in their order of preference so

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280
put them in their order of preference so
 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.340
put them in their order of preference so
when a user tries to open an app Android

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350
when a user tries to open an app Android
 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.930
when a user tries to open an app Android
will try to load the app in the users

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940
will try to load the app in the users
 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.790
will try to load the app in the users
first-choice language if that app

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800
first-choice language if that app
 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.260
first-choice language if that app
translation isn't available in that

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270
translation isn't available in that
 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.520
translation isn't available in that
language they'll load the second choice

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530
language they'll load the second choice
 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.230
language they'll load the second choice
the third choice and so on so for

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240
the third choice and so on so for
 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.850
the third choice and so on so for
example in this case with this screen

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
example in this case with this screen
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.620
example in this case with this screen
here it would first try to open the app

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630
here it would first try to open the app
 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.210
here it would first try to open the app
in English if that didn't work it would

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220
in English if that didn't work it would
 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.279
in English if that didn't work it would
try Spanish and then as a last resort it

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289
try Spanish and then as a last resort it
 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.920
try Spanish and then as a last resort it
would try French so as a developer there

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930
would try French so as a developer there
 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.180
would try French so as a developer there

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.950
right language that's right for them
so in marshmallow we talked last year

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960
so in marshmallow we talked last year
 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.810
so in marshmallow we talked last year
about a huge overhaul to the permissions

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820
about a huge overhaul to the permissions
 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.820
about a huge overhaul to the permissions
platform permissions are now real-time

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830
platform permissions are now real-time
 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.100
platform permissions are now real-time
as of marshmallow but there were a

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110
as of marshmallow but there were a
 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.480
as of marshmallow but there were a
couple things we wanted to tweak to make

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490
couple things we wanted to tweak to make
 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.550
couple things we wanted to tweak to make
them work even better so has anyone ever

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560
them work even better so has anyone ever
 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.990
them work even better so has anyone ever
had to ask for the permission to access

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000
had to ask for the permission to access
 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.820
had to ask for the permission to access
a user's internal storage and it used to

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830
a user's internal storage and it used to
 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.680
a user's internal storage and it used to
pop up a message about hey can I access

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690
pop up a message about hey can I access
 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.180
pop up a message about hey can I access
your photos and this and that and a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190
your photos and this and that and a
 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.400
your photos and this and that and a
bunch of different things we had a lot

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410
bunch of different things we had a lot
 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.719
bunch of different things we had a lot
of feedback from developers that

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729
of feedback from developers that
 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.129
of feedback from developers that
sometimes they would only need to access

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139
sometimes they would only need to access
 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.629
sometimes they would only need to access
one of these things and gain access to

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639
one of these things and gain access to
 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.310
one of these things and gain access to
all of these things was concerning to

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320
all of these things was concerning to
 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.080
all of these things was concerning to
users and we thought that that was

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090
users and we thought that that was
 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.969
users and we thought that that was
absolutely great feedback so what we've

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979
absolutely great feedback so what we've
 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.529
absolutely great feedback so what we've
done is we've broken it down so that as

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539
done is we've broken it down so that as
 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.000
done is we've broken it down so that as
a developer rather than in requesting

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010
a developer rather than in requesting
 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.310
a developer rather than in requesting
access to all of the storage you can

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320
access to all of the storage you can
 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.230
access to all of the storage you can
request access to a specific folder so

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240
request access to a specific folder so
 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.180
request access to a specific folder so
for example in this case maybe this is a

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190
for example in this case maybe this is a
 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.940
for example in this case maybe this is a
photo app and so it's actually asking to

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950
photo app and so it's actually asking to
 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.250
photo app and so it's actually asking to
access just the pictures folder and so

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260
access just the pictures folder and so
 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.239
access just the pictures folder and so
this means that it

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:34.249
this means that it
 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:36.249
this means that it
user understands a lot better why what

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259
user understands a lot better why what
 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.139
user understands a lot better why what
you're requesting is is necessary and

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:38.149
you're requesting is is necessary and
 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.089
you're requesting is is necessary and
also you're not gaining access to other

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099
also you're not gaining access to other
 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.529
also you're not gaining access to other
files that you may not need to have

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539
files that you may not need to have
 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.769
files that you may not need to have
access to so does anyone here in this

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779
access to so does anyone here in this
 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.739
access to so does anyone here in this
room work on 3d games yeah couple folks

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:47.749
room work on 3d games yeah couple folks
 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.429
room work on 3d games yeah couple folks
that's really cool so volcán is a new

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:51.439
that's really cool so volcán is a new
 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.649
that's really cool so volcán is a new
technology it's a low level low overhead

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659
technology it's a low level low overhead
 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.589
technology it's a low level low overhead
and cross-platform 3d API and it's also

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599
and cross-platform 3d API and it's also
 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.029
and cross-platform 3d API and it's also
available in the Android nougat as well

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039
available in the Android nougat as well
 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.159
available in the Android nougat as well
so this is a really great technology

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169
so this is a really great technology
 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.359
so this is a really great technology
that helps if you're trying to write

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:01.369
that helps if you're trying to write
 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.159
that helps if you're trying to write
games that work cross-platform it works

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169
games that work cross-platform it works
 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:04.929
games that work cross-platform it works
a lot more similarly across these

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:04.939
a lot more similarly across these
 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.789
a lot more similarly across these
different platforms and also if you use

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:06.799
different platforms and also if you use
 

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:08.350
different platforms and also if you use
a game engine a lot of engines are

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360
a game engine a lot of engines are
 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.239
a game engine a lot of engines are
supporting it already or have a platform

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:10.249
supporting it already or have a platform
 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:11.679
supporting it already or have a platform
to be able to support Vulcan in the

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:11.689
to be able to support Vulcan in the
 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:13.539
to be able to support Vulcan in the
future so what this means now with

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:13.549
future so what this means now with
 

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:15.369
future so what this means now with
Vulcan being supported and nougat is if

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:15.379
Vulcan being supported and nougat is if
 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.109
Vulcan being supported and nougat is if
you are using Vulcan it'll start to work

00:07:17.109 --> 00:07:17.119
you are using Vulcan it'll start to work
 

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:19.649
you are using Vulcan it'll start to work
really well on these devices right away

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:19.659
really well on these devices right away
 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.629
really well on these devices right away
so that was Android nougat and now we're

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639
so that was Android nougat and now we're
 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.979
so that was Android nougat and now we're
going to move on and talk about what's

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:23.989
going to move on and talk about what's
 

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:26.979
going to move on and talk about what's
new in material design so first of all

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:26.989
new in material design so first of all
 

00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:28.839
new in material design so first of all
how many apps here are using material

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849
how many apps here are using material
 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.159
how many apps here are using material
design already good number of folks so

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169
design already good number of folks so
 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:35.079
design already good number of folks so
if you're using material design you're

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:35.089
if you're using material design you're
 

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:36.369
if you're using material design you're
actually in a really good company

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:36.379
actually in a really good company
 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:37.479
actually in a really good company
we noticed recently that we have

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:37.489
we noticed recently that we have
 

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:39.159
we noticed recently that we have
basically a million apps on the Play

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.169
basically a million apps on the Play
 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:41.799
basically a million apps on the Play
Store that are using material design and

00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:41.809
Store that are using material design and
 

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:44.139
Store that are using material design and
if you haven't heard of it what material

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:44.149
if you haven't heard of it what material
 

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:45.969
if you haven't heard of it what material
design is is a set of principles that

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:45.979
design is is a set of principles that
 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:49.059
design is is a set of principles that
govern how acts how apps look how they

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:49.069
govern how acts how apps look how they
 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.879
govern how acts how apps look how they
move how they feel and it's this instead

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:51.889
move how they feel and it's this instead
 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.559
move how they feel and it's this instead
of design principles that covers things

00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:53.569
of design principles that covers things
 

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:57.069
of design principles that covers things
like tactile surfaces rich imagery bold

00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:57.079
like tactile surfaces rich imagery bold
 

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.809
like tactile surfaces rich imagery bold
colors and my favorite which is

00:07:58.809 --> 00:07:58.819
colors and my favorite which is
 

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.359
colors and my favorite which is
meaningful motion and why material

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:01.369
meaningful motion and why material
 

00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:02.499
meaningful motion and why material
design is important for you as a

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:02.509
design is important for you as a
 

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:04.419
design is important for you as a
developer is that when a person uses

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:04.429
developer is that when a person uses
 

00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:06.909
developer is that when a person uses
your app for the first time you want

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919
your app for the first time you want
 

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.829
your app for the first time you want
them to know how it works right and if

00:08:08.829 --> 00:08:08.839
them to know how it works right and if
 

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.209
them to know how it works right and if
you're already using this material

00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:10.219
you're already using this material
 

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:11.799
you're already using this material
design framework that users understand

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:11.809
design framework that users understand
 

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:13.779
design framework that users understand
it'll be more intuitive to them to

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:13.789
it'll be more intuitive to them to
 

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:15.159
it'll be more intuitive to them to
understand how to get started with your

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:15.169
understand how to get started with your
 

00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:16.959
understand how to get started with your
app you'll be less likely to have a

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:16.969
app you'll be less likely to have a
 

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:18.789
app you'll be less likely to have a
person who gets confused or lost and

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:18.799
person who gets confused or lost and
 

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.619
person who gets confused or lost and
doesn't know how to do it and so if

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:20.629
doesn't know how to do it and so if
 

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:22.569
doesn't know how to do it and so if
you're looking to reach the over 1.4

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:22.579
you're looking to reach the over 1.4
 

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:24.309
you're looking to reach the over 1.4
billion Android users that are active

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319
billion Android users that are active
 

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:26.619
billion Android users that are active
today you know using material design can

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:26.629
today you know using material design can
 

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:28.269
today you know using material design can
be a critical part of the process in

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:28.279
be a critical part of the process in
 

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:29.679
be a critical part of the process in
order to make sure that they're going to

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:29.689
order to make sure that they're going to
 

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:31.239
order to make sure that they're going to
know how to get started immediately and

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:31.249
know how to get started immediately and
 

00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:34.269
know how to get started immediately and
stay engaged so we'll talk about a

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279
stay engaged so we'll talk about a
 

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:36.249
stay engaged so we'll talk about a
couple examples of developers here in

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:36.259
couple examples of developers here in
 

00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:39.429
couple examples of developers here in
Europe that are using material design so

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:39.439
Europe that are using material design so
 

00:08:39.439 --> 00:08:41.170
Europe that are using material design so
first up is bring from Switzerland and

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:41.180
first up is bring from Switzerland and
 

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.259
first up is bring from Switzerland and
they've implemented material design now

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:44.269
they've implemented material design now
 

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:45.699
they've implemented material design now
if you haven't used the bring app it's

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:45.709
if you haven't used the bring app it's
 

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:47.720
if you haven't used the bring app it's
all about being able to manage

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:47.730
all about being able to manage
 

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.639
all about being able to manage
notable shopping lists and it does

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:49.649
notable shopping lists and it does
 

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:50.990
notable shopping lists and it does

you're in very good company if we look
 

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.770
you're in very good company if we look
at the top 125 apps and games on Play

well so for those of you who maybe

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:15.390
well so for those of you who maybe
 

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.120
well so for those of you who maybe
didn't know Android studio as well let's

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.130
didn't know Android studio as well let's
 

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.440
didn't know Android studio as well let's
take a little bit of time to talk about

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:18.450
take a little bit of time to talk about
 

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.870
take a little bit of time to talk about
it and talk about what was new in the

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880
it and talk about what was new in the
 

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.090
it and talk about what was new in the
past year so at the beginning of the

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100
past year so at the beginning of the
 

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.460
past year so at the beginning of the
year we launched Android studio 2.0 the

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:25.470
year we launched Android studio 2.0 the
 

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.260
year we launched Android studio 2.0 the
main focus here was speed that was a

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:27.270
main focus here was speed that was a
 

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.730
main focus here was speed that was a
real key piece of feedback we had from

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740
real key piece of feedback we had from
 

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.410
real key piece of feedback we had from
developers they said make it faster if

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420
developers they said make it faster if
 

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.540
developers they said make it faster if
you do nothing else came back time and

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:32.550
you do nothing else came back time and
 

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.340
you do nothing else came back time and
time again so we introduced something

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:34.350
time again so we introduced something
 

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.700
time again so we introduced something
called

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:34.710
called
 

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.890
called
instant run now the idea here is that

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:36.900
instant run now the idea here is that
 

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.440
instant run now the idea here is that
you can do swaps of code in real time

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.450
you can do swaps of code in real time
 

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.330
you can do swaps of code in real time
when you go to run your app there's not

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:41.340
when you go to run your app there's not
 

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.400
when you go to run your app there's not
a lot of waiting and it can push code

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:43.410
a lot of waiting and it can push code
 

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.960
a lot of waiting and it can push code
and resources directly into the app

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:44.970
and resources directly into the app
 

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.370
and resources directly into the app
while it's running on your computer

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380
while it's running on your computer
 

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.160
while it's running on your computer
and this also included not just instant

about supporting Android nougat so we
 

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.900
about supporting Android nougat so we
have support for the new features and

important stability enhancements that
 

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.470
important stability enhancements that
was something else we heard from you is

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480
was something else we heard from you is
 

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.819
was something else we heard from you is
that every time we need to update it we

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:24.829
that every time we need to update it we
 

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:26.019
that every time we need to update it we
need to make sure it's just really high

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:26.029
need to make sure it's just really high
 

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:28.870

quality productions grade stuff and then
 

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.940
quality productions grade stuff and then
in 2.1 we also made an additional

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:30.950
in 2.1 we also made an additional
 

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.190
in 2.1 we also made an additional
investment into instant run we move the

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200
investment into instant run we move the
 

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.110
investment into instant run we move the
decks in process and that was a huge

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120
decks in process and that was a huge
 

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.910
decks in process and that was a huge
accelerator allowing instant run to get

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920
accelerator allowing instant run to get
 

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.690
accelerator allowing instant run to get
even faster than previous incarnations

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:39.700
even faster than previous incarnations
 

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.769
even faster than previous incarnations
so of course now we're looking at

00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:41.779
so of course now we're looking at
 

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:44.410
so of course now we're looking at
Android studio 2.2 the main focus is

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:44.420
Android studio 2.2 the main focus is
 

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.600
Android studio 2.2 the main focus is
there are speed smarts and support for

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:46.610
there are speed smarts and support for
 

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.639
there are speed smarts and support for
nougat and so we also have a ton of

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:48.649
nougat and so we also have a ton of
 

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:50.920
nougat and so we also have a ton of
updates in this release everything from

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:50.930
updates in this release everything from
 

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.870
updates in this release everything from

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.090
firebase integration to enhance support
from C++ so I'm going to highlight a few

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.100
from C++ so I'm going to highlight a few
 

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.230
from C++ so I'm going to highlight a few
things that you should know about in

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240
things that you should know about in
 

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.050
things that you should know about in
this latest release so with the

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.060
this latest release so with the
 

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.699
this latest release so with the
developer one of the best feelings in

00:14:00.699 --> 00:14:00.709
developer one of the best feelings in
 

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:02.620
developer one of the best feelings in
the world is being in the flow you know

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:02.630
the world is being in the flow you know
 

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.630
the world is being in the flow you know
you finally sort of load up in your

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:04.640
you finally sort of load up in your
 

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.610
you finally sort of load up in your
brain all the code that's running you're

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:06.620
brain all the code that's running you're
 

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.470
brain all the code that's running you're
working on it and the last thing you

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480
working on it and the last thing you
 

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.600
working on it and the last thing you
want is to get disrupted to break that

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:10.610
want is to get disrupted to break that
 

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.190
want is to get disrupted to break that
flow when you're waiting for your app to

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:12.200
flow when you're waiting for your app to
 

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.259
flow when you're waiting for your app to
build and run on your machine so that's

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:14.269
build and run on your machine so that's
 

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:16.600
build and run on your machine so that's
why we introduced instant run and we've

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:16.610
why we introduced instant run and we've
 

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.160
why we introduced instant run and we've
made progressive improvements since its

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:18.170
made progressive improvements since its
 

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.300
made progressive improvements since its
launched you can see a lot of the

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:19.310
launched you can see a lot of the
 

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.280
launched you can see a lot of the
updates here into the speed and that's

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.290
updates here into the speed and that's
 

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.360
updates here into the speed and that's
really been getting a lot of good

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:22.370
really been getting a lot of good
 

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.920
really been getting a lot of good
feedback and we're going to keep trying

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:23.930
feedback and we're going to keep trying
 

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.300
feedback and we're going to keep trying
to work on that improving it even

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:25.310
to work on that improving it even
 

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.689
to work on that improving it even
further we've also seen a big

00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:28.699
further we've also seen a big
 

00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:29.980
further we've also seen a big
development in the Android ecosystem

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:29.990
development in the Android ecosystem
 

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.800
development in the Android ecosystem
around C++ when we first started working

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:32.810
around C++ when we first started working
 

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.389
around C++ when we first started working
on Android we thought that native code

00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399
on Android we thought that native code
 

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.380
on Android we thought that native code
was something that was going to be

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:35.390
was something that was going to be
 

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.870
was something that was going to be
pretty rare and it was and then as

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880
pretty rare and it was and then as
 

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.730
pretty rare and it was and then as
androids evolved we actually seen more

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:39.740
androids evolved we actually seen more
 

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.759
androids evolved we actually seen more
and more developers using C++ for more

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:42.769
and more developers using C++ for more
 

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:44.590
and more developers using C++ for more
and more reasons initially would just be

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600
and more reasons initially would just be
 

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.910
and more reasons initially would just be
for things like maybe physics

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920
for things like maybe physics
 

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.860
for things like maybe physics
simulations but we've seen over time

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:47.870
simulations but we've seen over time
 

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.540
simulations but we've seen over time
that more and more types of apps and

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:49.550
that more and more types of apps and
 

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.069
that more and more types of apps and
games are using native code so we've

00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079
games are using native code so we've
 

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:52.630
games are using native code so we've
realized we need to enhance the support

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:52.640
realized we need to enhance the support
 

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.470
realized we need to enhance the support
for it a lot more so you can now

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480
for it a lot more so you can now
 

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.449
for it a lot more so you can now
actually do a whole bunch of more things

00:14:58.449 --> 00:14:58.459
actually do a whole bunch of more things
 

00:14:58.459 --> 00:15:00.100
actually do a whole bunch of more things
in C++ and let's walk through a few of

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.110
in C++ and let's walk through a few of
 

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.430
in C++ and let's walk through a few of
them

more integrated the overall build and
 

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.250
more integrated the overall build and
run experience so now this is also

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:24.260
run experience so now this is also
 

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.780
run experience so now this is also
integrated with the debugger so that you

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:25.790
integrated with the debugger so that you
 

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.700
integrated with the debugger so that you
can set the breakpoint then run the app

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:27.710
can set the breakpoint then run the app
 

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.680
can set the breakpoint then run the app
and the debugger will break at the right

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:29.690
and the debugger will break at the right
 

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.570

is it gives you a lot more powerful

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:02.390
is it gives you a lot more powerful
 

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.810

you can look at different corresponding
 

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.409
you can look at different corresponding
attributes to find and fix the

00:17:40.409 --> 00:17:40.419
attributes to find and fix the
 

00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:42.119

you can see the raw file size but

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:47.049
you can see the raw file size but
 

00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:48.720
you can see the raw file size but
actually you can also see the download

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:48.730
actually you can also see the download

and what is the difference between those

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:52.869
and what is the difference between those
 

00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:54.899
and what is the difference between those
well the download size is actually the

00:18:54.899 --> 00:18:54.909
well the download size is actually the
 

00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:56.849
well the download size is actually the
estimated size that users would actually

00:18:56.849 --> 00:18:56.859
estimated size that users would actually
 

00:18:56.859 --> 00:18:58.799

need to download when the apk is served

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:58.809
need to download when the apk is served
 

00:18:58.809 --> 00:18:59.909
need to download when the apk is served
from Google Play and that can actually

00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919
from Google Play and that can actually
 

00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:02.039
from Google Play and that can actually
be different from the raw file size so

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:02.049
be different from the raw file size so
 

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:03.810

we've now improved the emulator so it's

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.110
we've now improved the emulator so it's
 

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.480
we've now improved the emulator so it's
actually faster than a physical device

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.490
actually faster than a physical device
 

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.360

and Google developer services and
 

00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:06.379
and Google developer services and
created one cross-platform suite of

00:22:06.379 --> 00:22:06.389

a bunch of different developer services
 

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.509
a bunch of different developer services
from Google you had to go to a bunch of

00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:11.519
from Google you had to go to a bunch of
 

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:12.320

documentation it was more complicated
than we wanted but with firebase we've

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:18.450
than we wanted but with firebase we've
 

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.090

cross-platform and a lot of people ask

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:05.429
cross-platform and a lot of people ask
 

00:23:05.429 --> 00:23:06.710
cross-platform and a lot of people ask
us well how is it different from Google

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720
us well how is it different from Google
 

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.810
us well how is it different from Google
Analytics and I think the key thing to

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820
Analytics and I think the key thing to
 

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.039
Analytics and I think the key thing to
know about it is it was built by the

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:10.049
know about it is it was built by the
 

00:23:10.049 --> 00:23:11.600
know about it is it was built by the
same team that built Google Analytics

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:11.610
same team that built Google Analytics
 

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.730

firebase analytics is super optimized

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:13.740
firebase analytics is super optimized
 

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.499
firebase analytics is super optimized
for mobile apps and we think it's a

00:23:15.499 --> 00:23:15.509
for mobile apps and we think it's a
 

00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:16.999
for mobile apps and we think it's a
great place to get started if you

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:17.009
great place to get started if you
 

00:23:17.009 --> 00:23:18.740
great place to get started if you
haven't picked a solution already or if

analytics product for apps and games so

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:22.460
analytics product for apps and games so
 

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.529
analytics product for apps and games so
here's an example of what firebase

00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539
here's an example of what firebase
 

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:25.850
here's an example of what firebase
analytics can look like with a

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860
analytics can look like with a
 

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.580
analytics can look like with a
particular game and then one of the

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:28.590
particular game and then one of the
 

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.080
particular game and then one of the
things we wanted to do with firebase

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.090
things we wanted to do with firebase
 

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.580
things we wanted to do with firebase
analytics is to make sure that out of

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:31.590
analytics is to make sure that out of
 

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.019
analytics is to make sure that out of
the box you get as much information as

00:23:33.019 --> 00:23:33.029
the box you get as much information as
 

00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:34.580
the box you get as much information as
possible so you don't have to spend a

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:34.590
possible so you don't have to spend a
 

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.990
possible so you don't have to spend a
bunch of time duplicating the sorts of

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000
bunch of time duplicating the sorts of
 

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.249
bunch of time duplicating the sorts of
things that every developer would want

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:37.259
things that every developer would want
 

00:23:37.259 --> 00:23:39.830
things that every developer would want
to have so it's a great way to look at

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840
to have so it's a great way to look at
 

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.779
to have so it's a great way to look at
for example the usage from your app you

00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:41.789
for example the usage from your app you
 

00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:43.580
for example the usage from your app you
can also do experiments with analytics

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:43.590
can also do experiments with analytics
 

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.259
can also do experiments with analytics
and in a lot of cases you won't even

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:45.269
and in a lot of cases you won't even
 

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:47.060
and in a lot of cases you won't even
need to do any coding so for those of

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.070
need to do any coding so for those of
 

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.860
need to do any coding so for those of
you who work at smaller companies you

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:48.870
you who work at smaller companies you
 

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.330
you who work at smaller companies you
know it's really great to set these

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:50.340
know it's really great to set these
 

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.649

lab actually the best way to do it is to

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.230
lab actually the best way to do it is to
 

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:36.270
lab actually the best way to do it is to
go into the Google Play Developer

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:36.280
go into the Google Play Developer
 

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.220
go into the Google Play Developer
console we have something in there

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:38.230
console we have something in there
 

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.600
console we have something in there
called the pre-launch report which we're

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:39.610
called the pre-launch report which we're
 

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.560

about later we definitely encourage you
 

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.000
about later we definitely encourage you
to try the pre-launch report in the

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.010
to try the pre-launch report in the
 

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.280
to try the pre-launch report in the
developer console and to be able to use

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.290
developer console and to be able to use

so firebase crash reporting is a great

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:00.430
so firebase crash reporting is a great
 

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.800
so firebase crash reporting is a great
way to find out about issues that are

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:01.810
way to find out about issues that are
 

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.510
way to find out about issues that are
occurring in the field after your launch

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520
occurring in the field after your launch
 

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.390
occurring in the field after your launch
so whenever an app crashes it's reported

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400
so whenever an app crashes it's reported
 

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.280
so whenever an app crashes it's reported
by firebase crash and the developer can

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:08.290
by firebase crash and the developer can
 

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.950
by firebase crash and the developer can
review these in a report again this also

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960
review these in a report again this also
 

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.660
review these in a report again this also
works cross-platform so you can use it

across all of your apps so that was
 

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.640
across all of your apps so that was
developing an app and now let's talk

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:17.650
developing an app and now let's talk
 

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.990
developing an app and now let's talk
about some of the technologies to help

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000
about some of the technologies to help
 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.350
about some of the technologies to help
grow an app

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.360
