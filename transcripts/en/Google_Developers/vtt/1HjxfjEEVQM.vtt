RYAN BOYD: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.650
My name is Ryan Boyd.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.880
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: And I'm
Michael Manoochehri.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.780
RYAN BOYD: And we're from our
Developer Relations Team for

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.760
Cloud Data Services.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.490
And next week at Google I/O,
we're going to have a number

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.120
of sessions on our cloud
data services.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.360
And we're super excited to share
these sessions with you.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.180
And we hope that during this
quick video today, we can show

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.790
you which sessions that we'll
have and go a little bit

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.990
beyond the abstracts and give
you some information that will

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.040
be helpful for you to decide
which sessions to attend.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.780
And hopefully you can
attend all of them.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.040
But first of all, Michael, can
you just give a quick overview

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.160
of our cloud data services?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.810
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Sure.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.910
The goal of Google's cloud
products has always going to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.460
expose our scalable
infrastructure for developers

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.360
to use to build their
own applications.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.700
So we're going to talk a little
bit about some of the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.360
different technologies we have
available, including data

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.210
store, BigQuery, a new product
we've released, and also how

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.260
to put them together and build
your own web apps on this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.130
technology.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.580
RYAN BOYD: Wow.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.330
Fantastic.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.580
So hopefully all of you are
coming to I/O. If not, catch

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.940
some of these sessions
on video.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.560
The Google I/O keynotes, I
believe, will be streamed.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.160
And some of the sessions
will be.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.150
I'm not sure if these will.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.710
But hopefully they'll all be on
YouTube for you to watch if

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.340
you don't see them
at I/O itself.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580
So we want to go through each
of these sessions that we're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.030
going to have.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.840
And we'll talk a little bit
about them and hopefully get

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.090
you excited as we are.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.910
So the first session that we're
going to have is Big

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.040
Data: Turning Your
Data Problem Into

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.240
a Competitive Advantage.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.674
This is actually be done
by two of our product--

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:39.924
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.030
who's the PM for Google
Cloud Storage.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.390
And they're gonna really go into
the different business

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.270
problems that you have
with big data.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.690
It used to be that pretty much
everyone in the world was

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.240
dealing with just very small
data sets, and only companies

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.150
the size of Google internet
scale were dealing with very

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.570
large data sets.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.700
But nowadays pretty much
everyone has a chance to get a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.780
large data set.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.710
If you launch your new mobile
app, and it gets on to the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.800
home page of the Android market,
you might really get

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.750
massive amounts of data that
you can use to improve your

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.530
applications.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.110
And so they're gonna be talking
about the business

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.150
problem here and show
you which of our

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.650
tools can be used.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.030
It mixes a little bit of
business and technology.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.220
It's really for those chief
architects or CTO-level folks

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.205
who want to learn about
Google services.

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:35.720
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: It's a
great introduction to the big

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.215
data space.

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:38.170
I think if you're interested in
that you should definitely

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.650
come to this talk.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.730
RYAN BOYD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.120
And they're also going
to have some external

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.180
speakers come up.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.130
And one of those speakers is
one of the founders of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.810
[? Beam. ?]

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.760
And [? Beam ?]

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.410
is a visualization company.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.080
And they're one of the two
companies that earlier this

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.600
week launched some visualization
demos.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.180
You should all check them out
if you didn't see those.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.270
But they launched some
visualization demos showing

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.040
how you can do data
visualization on top of really

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.120
massive data sets of half
a billion rows of

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.160
data on top of BigQuery.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.560
And so the founder of [? Beam ?]
is going to come up

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.700
and show you their tool and show
you how it was used for a

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.940
large retail company.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.520
And then the folks at
Crystalloids, another external

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.730
presenter, are going to come up
and talk about how they use

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.600
this technology.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.805
They're kind of like a
systems integrator.

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:30.100
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Yeah.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.400
I've seen their demo, and they
have a great web application

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.095
dashboard for the hospitality
industry.

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.060
It's really exciting.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.405
All built on top of BigQuery.

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:36.980
RYAN BOYD: Yeah.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.340
So this is a good session.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.630
It mixes a little bit of
technology with the overall

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.160
business problems that you're
trying to solve.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.840
So I definitely suggest
checking that out.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.580
And then the next session of
course you should check out

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.110
because yours truly is going
to be giving it.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.710
But first I want to give you a
little bit of an overview on

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.150
the cloud data space and
what Google aims to

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.430
do with these services.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.510
And this is a quote from
one of our customers.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.240
A large advertising customers
said, "By the time we prepared

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.900
the data, we've forgotten what
the question was." And this is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.060
a problem when you're dealing
with a lot of upfront costs,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.050
both costs in terms of money
but also in terms of people

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.220
and set up and all that
you have with

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.660
typical on-premise solutions.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.610
And this is why we love the
cloud data solution space is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.570
because Google offers services
that really allow you to get

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.720
up and running quickly
and dive in in an ad

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.100
hoc iterative fashion.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.410
And you won't forget what
the question was.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.490
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Yeah,
sometimes what we say at

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.300
Google is, worry about your
application, not the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.320
infrastructure itself.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.580
RYAN BOYD: Exactly.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.490
So the next session that
I was talking about--

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.370
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: I heard
this was a good one.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.570
RYAN BOYD: Yeah.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.780
So I'm giving this session
on crunching

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.900
big data with BigQuery.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.180
And I'm doing it along with
one of the folks from our

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.880
BigQuery Engineering Team,
Jordan Tigani.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.170
And this session really will
give you everything you need

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.670
to know about BigQuery.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.420
And it's going to get for
those people that are of

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.980
intermediate knowledge in the
space, technical folks, but

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.170
then really dive deep for those
people-- those data

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.620
geeks like ourselves
that really

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.510
want to know the details.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.810
So I'll give you some
examples here.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.840
BigQuery is an analytic service
that allows you to

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.040
analyze large amounts of data.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.990
And it's based off of
a REST-based API.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.360
And we're gonna talk about
that REST API.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.930
But we're also going to be
talking about some of the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.090
public data sets that we make
available with BigQuery that

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.460
everyone here that's listening
here today can go in and play

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.200
around with.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.930
And the main public dataset
we're going to go into is the

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.450
natality dataset.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.900
And this is a record of all
the births in the US in, I

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.430
think, the last 40 years.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.910
And you can really dive into
that data and see when people

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.970
were born, what states they
were born in, and go down

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.060
based off of the age of the
mother and things like that.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.630
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: I've seen
the outline for this talk, and

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.890
I think it's really
incredible.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.810
The two things I've heard from
developers about BigQuery is

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.980
that it's both fun and
empowering to use.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.160
And you're going see how to
build web applications using

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.090
it and use it for analysis.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.500
It's gonna be great.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.880
RYAN BOYD: And so one of the
demos we're actually going to

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.790
show here is using Google
Apps Script to

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.270
interact with BigQuery.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.090
And this is a quick little demo
I built that analyzes

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.440
some trends in births
given by mothers.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.920
They're first births given by
mothers, and what the weight

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.040
of the baby was and what the
age of the mother was.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.880
And I break this down by red
state versus blue state.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.760
I just thought it'd be kind of
fun, but I'm not going to give

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.880
you all the answers here.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.630
But there definitely is
some differences.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.890
Michael--

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.310
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Yeah.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.080
People will have to either come
to the to talk or watch

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.240
it on video to get
the real answer.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.697
RYAN BOYD: Yeah.

00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:50.620
So there's definitely some
differences in the age of the

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.960
mother at first birth between
blue states and red states and

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.930
differences even in the
weight of the baby.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.140
So that's gonna be
kind of fun.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.050
And I used Google Apps
Script for this.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.030
But then the real core geek part
of this session is going

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.900
to be Jordan Tigani's part.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.360
And Jordan is going to really
dive into the underlying

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.990
architecture of BigQuery.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.520
And it's fascinating really.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.920
So a lot of these technologies
Google built internally

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.950
because there wasn't any other
technology for us to solve our

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.770
data problems.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.580
So we built the underlying
technology called Dremel and

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.110
released it as BigQuery
for public use.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.280
And Jordan is going to really
dive into how that works, with

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.560
generally the hope that
understanding how the

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.490
underlying technology
works will help you

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.840
optimize your queries.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.650
And just to give you a little
hint of one of the diagrams

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.586
from Jordan's part of the talk
is this is the architecture of

00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:46.650
a query and how it goes through
the various mixers,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.420
workers, and shards
in BigQuery.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.040
And he'll explain all
how that works.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.290
And then dive into some really
complex SQL queries to do

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.280
things like seven-day active
users of the GitHub dataset,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.350
another one of those
public datasets.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.788
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Yeah.

00:07:59.788 --> 00:08:01.150
That's one of the most popular
datasets that we have.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:01.670
Yeah.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.450
And you're going to learn
a lot from this talk.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.800
Like I said, I saw
the outline.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.250
And it's a great technical
overview of this type of

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.520
technology.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.040
RYAN BOYD: So hope you all can
make it to that one as well

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.830
and see me but maybe more
importantly is coming to see

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.240
Michael at the next talk.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.750
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI:
Here's a talk you

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.830
definitely should come see.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.350
So I'm going to talk about
putting all of these

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.390
technologies together.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.570
So I'm going to talk about Data

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.040
Pipelines at Google Scale.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.030
So in a practical sense, when
you build these applications

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.630
with big data you need to use
technologies that's optimized

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.230
for each step in the collection
of data, extracting

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.640
data, transforming data, and
then the analysis of it, as

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.250
well as the story.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.799
So I'm going to talk to you
about using Google's

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.409
infrastructure to build
end-to-end applications that

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.780
use a collection of
technologies, including the

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.060
AppEngine-MapReduce Library for
doing data transformations

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.610
on a large scale.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.540
And I'll show you some examples
of using data store

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.030
App Engine to collect data and
serve a web application and

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.190
pipe that data into Google
BigQuery for analysis.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.040
So I hope you can join us.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.080
You're going to learn a lot.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.280
If you're just new to the big
data space, I think this is a

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.400
great overview for
the different

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.460
technologies available.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.070
And if you've actually done a
lot of MapReduce or big data

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.220
transformations, come see how
you can implement this type of

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.730
technology on top
of App Engine.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.260
RYAN BOYD: And this is
technology that we're

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.200
definitely using internally
ourselves.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.630
We met with one of our senior
engineers a couple weeks ago.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.230
And he was going into how he
used MapReduce on App Engine

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.290
to get his data transformed
and break it down to power

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.540
some Google products.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.285
So it's pretty fascinating.

00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:27.830
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI:
It's great stuff.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.360
So, yeah.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.996
Please stop by or watch
on the video later.

00:09:30.996 --> 00:09:32.280
Oh, and then we're
going to have a

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.500
hands-on code lab as well.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.530
So on day one we're going to
talk about actually building

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.390
an application that uses
the app engine

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.850
logs as the data source.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.370
And so we're going to talk about
building one of these

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.470
applications that's an
end-to-end data pipeline,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.970
starting with your own Google
app engine logs of your own

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.600
application, piping that data
into Google cloud storage, and

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.530
then finally, the last step
is to put it into

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.380
BigQuery for analysis.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.230
So you're going to sit down with
some Google engineers.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.280
We have a bunch of Google
engineers, including some of

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.790
the engineers talking at Google
I/O on some of the big

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.600
data talks.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.520
And we're going to show you
how to actually sit down,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.250
write the code, and build
your own applications.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.680
So definitely check it out.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.070
RYAN BOYD: And the next session
we want to preview for

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.660
you is a session that's done by
the PM of the Google Cloud

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.070
Storage team, [INAUDIBLE],
Empowering Your Application's

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.050
Data Using Google
Cloud Storage.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.210
Now Google Cloud Storage
is something

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.340
that's fairly simple.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.240
But we've actually given you a
lot of power and flexibility

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.140
in this tool.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.360
And we're releases more and more
features to really enable

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.110
you to build rich applications
that have a lot of

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.440
unstructured data.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.960
You can store tons of data
in Google Cloud Storage.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.060
I think it's about five
terabytes, I believe, for the

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.270
maximum size of an individual
object.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.840
So a lot of data can
be stored up there.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.650
And you can access it from a
lot of these other services

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.730
that we're talking about here.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.990
So for instance, if you do stuff
on AppEngine-MapReduce

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.150
you can output the results of
that to Google Cloud Storage.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.810
And then BigQuery can actually
read in the data from Google

00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.910
Cloud Storage.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.610
So [INAUDIBLE] gonna go really
into the details here of how

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.850
cloud storage works, how the
permissions model works, and

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.920
some other things, especially
some new features that you

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.710
might be interested in if you
store large amounts of

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.542
unstructured data.

00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:19.150
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: We
have another fun talk.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.720
So App Engine allows several
options for storing data when

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.800
you build a web application.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.210
We have a SQL, a relational
data store.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.910
And also the data store itself
is a NoSQL data store.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.370
And so this talk is going
to talk about some of

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.400
the pros and cons.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.900
It's called Battle
of the Backends.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.230
And we're going to finally
decide which is the best for

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.815
your web application.

00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:41.845
And surely Ryan, you agree that
SQL is the best method to

00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:42.330
store your data.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.900
RYAN BOYD: Oh, Michael.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.460
Michael, Michael .

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.980
How naive you are.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.860
It really--

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.570
the NoSQL solution, the
App Engine data

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.850
store, is just amazing.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.650
It's very fluid schema.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.230
And I can put lots of data in
it, lots of transactions.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.450
Scales really well.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.192
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: It's highly
available, but what

00:11:57.192 --> 00:11:57.720
about consistency.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.570
You gotta admit that--

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.210
RYAN BOYD: Oh, Michael, come
on, you and your--

00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.470
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI:

00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.960
--consistency is most important.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.886
RYAN BOYD: Oh, no.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:01.350
Michael.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.570
So definitely.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.640
Data store is the best one.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.840
You should definitely use data
store for all your--

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.400
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: One word
for your transactions.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.310
That's all I'm gonna say.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.980
RYAN BOYD: All right.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.870
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Anyway,
I guess you'll have to

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.590
come to this talk.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.140
We're going to have an engineer
from both teams talk

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.090
about the pros and cons of both
and when to choose the

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.930
particular technology for
your web application.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.670
RYAN BOYD: And believe it or
not, they actually agree on

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.180
some use cases which are
good for each of them.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.150
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI:
I can't believe it.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.280
RYAN BOYD: We looked at the
slides for this session.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.810
And there is some
agreement there.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.420
Apparently they've come to
some consensus, its--

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.380
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: You might
even be able to build an

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.640
application that uses both.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.390
We'll see.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.010
RYAN BOYD: Yeah.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.190
They'll talk about some
of those use cases

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.120
where you can use both.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.710
But it should be a really fun
session, like all of these.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.270
We're data geeks at heart.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.430
So of course any session that's
about data technologies

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.260
we get really excited about
and we hope you'll get

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.460
excited about too.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.930
We do actually have
Google Moderator.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.580
And if you're looking at
the live stream here--

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.410
I'm going to check to see if
anyone's asked any questions.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.050
I forgot to point that out to
you at the beginning of the

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.790
session here.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.010
But hopefully some of you have
asked some questions that we

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.760
can take a look at.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.010
Let's see here.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.430
Actually doesn't look like we
have any questions here.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.720
But maybe we'll wait
a moment and see if

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.920
anyone has any questions.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.230
And then if not, we'll
just wrap things up.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:28.330
But we really look forward to
seeing you all at Google I/O.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.570
In addition to all these
sessions, there's some great

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.700
social events.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.460
We also do have a sandbox
where a lot of external

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.700
third-party companies are going
to come in and show off

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.900
the things that they've been
building on top of our cloud

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.580
technologies.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.850
A lot of things on App Engine
and on BigQuery and Google

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.280
Cloud Storage.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.870
So there's some great third
parties that are coming and

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.230
really show off what
they build.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.410
And hopefully you guys can
talk with them about what

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.730
you're building and share some
knowledge with them and get

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.430
some knowledge from them.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.100
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: We
definitely love meeting

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.670
developers and seeing what
you're building and what your

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.830
data challenges are.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.300
Just talking to you guys helps
us refine our products and

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.300
lets us learn what you guys are
building and how you can

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.630
build your applications
on our infrastructure.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.020
So look forward to meeting
you there.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.570
RYAN BOYD: Yeah.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.190
It doesn't look like we have any
questions coming in here.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.730
Although I just did tell you
about Moderator, so we'll see.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:22.060
But I think we should
probably wrap it up.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.100
And if you do have any
questions, we've actually been

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.790
really active on Stack Overflow

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.490
recently and BigQuery.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.680
And I believe they're using that
for App Engine as well.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.472
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Yep.

00:14:30.472 --> 00:14:33.300
RYAN BOYD: So if you do have
any questions about these

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.860
technologies, feel free to ask
them on Stack Overflow.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.920
And we'll all dive in
and try to help.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.400
And the community's been
really active.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.490
And we have to say thank you for
everyone in the community

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.640
that's been really active
answering questions there too.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.130
It certainly allows us to
prepare for these Google I/O

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.030
sessions and things like that.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.170
So ask your questions
on Stack Overflow.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.570
Here's our Google+
profiles as well.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.000
You can reach out to
us on Google+.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.410
And I'll do one last refresh
here and see if there's been

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.660
any questions.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.770
Can we please share
the slides?

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.510
Yes, we can share the slides.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.160
I will post them on my Google+
stream after the end.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.470
And Michael will probably
as well.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.562
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: Yeah.

00:15:13.562 --> 00:15:15.390
And by the way, you can go to
the Google I/O website and see

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.740
when the sessions are
all going to be.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.620
And I believe all the sessions
we talked about are going to

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.430
be available on YouTube
shortly after

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.520
they're given, right?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:21.650
RYAN BOYD: Yeah.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.630
I don't know the exact timing,
but in the past we've at least

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.200
published our sessions
on YouTube.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.450
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI: So don't
worry if you're not actually

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.580
going to Google I/O.
You'll be able to

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.490
see all these sessions.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.790
And we usually publish the code
related to the sessions

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.615
and other materials.

00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:33.175
So you're going to be
able to see it all.

00:15:33.175 --> 00:15:34.420
RYAN BOYD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:34.970
Absolutely.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.940
So since we did get one
question, I'll refresh here.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.400
And no.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.160
It looks like that's all the
questions that we have here.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160
So we'll wrap it up.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.500
And thank you very much
for attending today.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.970
And we look forward to seeing
you at Google I/O if you're

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.590
going to be there.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.990
Otherwise, we look forward
to seeing you online.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.450
Take care.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.700
MICHAEL MANOOCHEHRI:
Bye, everyone.
