00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.839
We live in conspiratorial times. Deeply sinister
motives appear to be at work everywhere beneath

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.400
the surface. No one, however high their reputation,
is entirely beyond suspicion. Every institution,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.529
even the most venerable, may be at it. Whatever
may publically be said, something a whole

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.269
lot ghastlier is probably going on in private.
Taking anything on good faith seems a sure

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.889
route to naivety and disillusion. It’s never
been a more tempting moment to become a conspiracy

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:38.800
theorist. But the real choice isn’t between
naivety on the one hand and conspiracy theory

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.480
on the other. The task is to find our way
to an often-elusive third option: intelligent

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.620
scepticism. Both the intelligent sceptic and
the conspiracy theorist start from the very

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.620
same place: with an awareness that things
may well not be what they seem, and that what

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.350
is widely believed may be patently false.
This is – in itself – no sign of madness

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.630
or delusion. It’s the basis of some of humanity’s
greatest discoveries and insights. To claim

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.340
that the earth orbits the sun would have sounded
the height of delusion in 1473. It would have

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.110
sounded no less peculiar to maintain, in the
late 1950s, that the UK security services

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.260
were largely in the hands of a group of people
working for the Soviet Union. A hypothesis

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.450
can be thoroughly outlandish, very unpopular
– and still correct. What separates the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.910
conspiracy theorist from the intelligent sceptic
is not the possession of some odd-sounding

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.500
hypotheses; it’s what they then go on to
do with these hypotheses. Here are some of

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.420
the key differences: - Evidence Intelligent
sceptics know that hypotheses cannot be sustained

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.079
indefinitely without evidence. They can be
trialled for a time, but eventually have to

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.229
be positively backed up by concrete proof
or else graciously and uncomplainingly abandoned.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.250
- The Burden of Proof Intelligent sceptics
know that the burden of proving a hypothesis

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.970
must invariably fall on them, as the challengers
to the status quo, and not on the upholders

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.410
of the established ideology. They accept that
it is their duty to show that ghosts really

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.560
do exist; and not the responsibility of everyone
else to prove that they don’t.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.360
Upholding quarrelsome
hypotheses delivers some hugely redemptive

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.940
emotional pleasures. One often feels empowered
and superior to all those who still blindly

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.410
trust in the status quo. They, the idiots,
may well think the rocket went to the moon;

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.690
we know the whole thing was filmed in a downtown
studio. Our job may not be so significant

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.770
nor our house very grand, but we – unlike
the stuck-up professors – know what really

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.270
happened to the Fuhrer after the war. Intelligent
sceptics certainly know how nice it would

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.980
be if they were proved right; but they can
bear the humiliation of turning out to be

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.120
miserably wrong. It would of course be deeply
emotionally convenient if they really were

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.630
to discover the secrets of cheap nuclear fission,
if the elderly, rich man was in truth a sexual

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.160
predator or if climate change did turn out
to be a hoax. But they are also wise enough

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.280
never to let their wishes overpower the more
stubborn and unyielding claims of reality.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.740
- Basic Trust The conspiracy theorist sees
skullduggery everywhere; their default position

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.670
is that everyone must be a liar and that simply
everything is a cover up. Their fear of being

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.590
taken for a dupe is so great, there can be
no glimmer of trust. For their part, the intelligent

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.450
sceptic proceeds through the world with an
attitude of basic credence and initial benevolence.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.040
They dare to take things at face value, confident
in their power to alter their views – perhaps

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.110
quite quickly – in a much darker direction
were the facts to demand it. They are internally

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.620
strong enough to take a chance to believe
in the goodness and truthfulness of strangers.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.050
Conspiracy theory is never really a problem
of intelligence. It’s an emotional wound

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.900
that overpowers the higher faculties of the
mind – and is therefore best treated not

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.919
with a barrage of countervailing facts, but
with reassurance, kindness and love, for it’s

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.759
here that the problem invariably began. The
choice we face isn’t between naive credulity

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.199
and conspiracy theory. By understanding the
fragility of our psyches, we have the option

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.080
of navigating our perilous times with a judicious
mixture of doubt and trust.
