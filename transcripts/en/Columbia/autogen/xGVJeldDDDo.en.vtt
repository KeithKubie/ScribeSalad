there was no place to connect and so we
 

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.820
there was no place to connect and so we
created the CAA and that's been a

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:49.830
created the CAA and that's been a
 

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.830
created the CAA and that's been a
stunning success and you've led this

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840

this and then the athletics program
 

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.840
this and then the athletics program
let's let's talk about that because I

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:02.850
let's let's talk about that because I
 

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:08.000
let's let's talk about that because I
felt you know it was inexcusable to have

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.010
felt you know it was inexcusable to have
 

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.790
felt you know it was inexcusable to have
a program where young people would come

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:10.800
a program where young people would come
 

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.510
a program where young people would come
in and the expectation would be that

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.520
in and the expectation would be that
 

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.800
in and the expectation would be that
they would lose and lose again and again

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:18.810
they would lose and lose again and again
 

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.420
they would lose and lose again and again
I mean it just that was unacceptable and

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:22.430
I mean it just that was unacceptable and
 

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.270
I mean it just that was unacceptable and
and so you you had to change the culture

graduates in that environment well
 

01:06:40.569 --> 01:06:42.359

that's a big question that an important

01:06:42.359 --> 01:06:42.369
that's a big question that an important
 

01:06:42.369 --> 01:06:45.089
that's a big question that an important
one I would of course my view I bet is

01:06:45.089 --> 01:06:45.099
one I would of course my view I bet is
 

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:46.950

the same view we have everybody in this

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960
the same view we have everybody in this

room there's no better way to prepare

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:49.180
room there's no better way to prepare

a liberal arts education by which we

01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559
a liberal arts education by which we
 

01:06:56.559 --> 01:07:02.370
a liberal arts education by which we
mean non-specialized but I think that

01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:02.380
mean non-specialized but I think that
 

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.269
mean non-specialized but I think that
there are things that we have to do to

01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279
there are things that we have to do to
 

01:07:06.279 --> 01:07:09.450
there are things that we have to do to
help young people become even more

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:09.460
help young people become even more
 

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.069
help young people become even more
prepared and

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079
prepared and
 

01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:16.910
prepared and
and so what would those be one I think

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920
and so what would those be one I think
 

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:21.049
and so what would those be one I think
we've segmented our knowledge too much I

01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059
we've segmented our knowledge too much I
 

01:07:21.059 --> 01:07:24.440
we've segmented our knowledge too much I
use the law as an example I think it's

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:24.450

great that we have law schools fantastic

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:26.190
great that we have law schools fantastic
 

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:29.390
great that we have law schools fantastic
i love them but law should be taught

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400
i love them but law should be taught
 

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.799
i love them but law should be taught
more to undergraduates and there's no

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:33.809
more to undergraduates and there's no
 

01:07:33.809 --> 01:07:37.459
more to undergraduates and there's no
reason why law should be a subject that

01:07:37.459 --> 01:07:37.469
reason why law should be a subject that
 

01:07:37.469 --> 01:07:40.279
reason why law should be a subject that
should be viewed as professional and the

01:07:40.279 --> 01:07:40.289
should be viewed as professional and the
 

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.799
should be viewed as professional and the
like and so I enjoy teaching First

01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:42.809
like and so I enjoy teaching First
 

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:44.839

Amendment I to undergraduate I'd do it

01:07:44.839 --> 01:07:44.849
Amendment I to undergraduate I'd do it
 

01:07:44.849 --> 01:07:47.920
Amendment I to undergraduate I'd do it
exactly the way I do in a law school I

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:47.930
exactly the way I do in a law school I
 

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:50.420
exactly the way I do in a law school I
think so i think there's room for the

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:50.430
think so i think there's room for the
 

01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:51.769
think so i think there's room for the
business school to teach undergraduates

01:07:51.769 --> 01:07:51.779

01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.099
about it but i think Public Health we're
 

01:07:59.099 --> 01:08:00.890
about it but i think Public Health we're
getting trying to get more into the

the other thing I would say is that we

01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319
the other thing I would say is that we
 

01:08:07.319 --> 01:08:10.839
the other thing I would say is that we
really need to help our students

a small village in Kenya is is critical

01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779
a small village in Kenya is is critical
 

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:37.479
a small village in Kenya is is critical
to a young person's sense of potential

learning I mean we all know this very

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080
learning I mean we all know this very
 

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.439

and suddenly start reading every article

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:48.270
and suddenly start reading every article
 

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:51.589
and suddenly start reading every article
in the paper about this place and you

01:08:51.589 --> 01:08:51.599
in the paper about this place and you
 

01:08:51.599 --> 01:08:53.629
in the paper about this place and you
you learn about it there's something

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:53.639
you learn about it there's something
 

01:08:53.639 --> 01:08:56.419

that that triggers in your mind the
little experience you've had that makes

01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679
little experience you've had that makes
 

01:08:58.679 --> 01:09:01.039
little experience you've had that makes
it a fantastic learning experience for

01:09:01.039 --> 01:09:01.049
it a fantastic learning experience for
 

01:09:01.049 --> 01:09:04.640
it a fantastic learning experience for
for life you feel connected to it we

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:04.650
for life you feel connected to it we
 

01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:06.349
for life you feel connected to it we
need to have lots of opportunities for

01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359
need to have lots of opportunities for
 

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.879
need to have lots of opportunities for
our students to get out there and just

01:09:07.879 --> 01:09:07.889
our students to get out there and just
 

01:09:07.889 --> 01:09:10.399
our students to get out there and just
to see what's going on in the world and

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:10.409
to see what's going on in the world and
 

01:09:10.409 --> 01:09:12.439
to see what's going on in the world and
then build that into their education and

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:12.449
then build that into their education and
 

01:09:12.449 --> 01:09:16.070
then build that into their education and
I think all those things will will be

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080
I think all those things will will be
 

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.660
I think all those things will will be
important I think also bringing more

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:17.670
important I think also bringing more
 

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:19.519
important I think also bringing more
people from around the world to campus I

01:09:19.519 --> 01:09:19.529
people from around the world to campus I
 

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:23.010
people from around the world to campus I
happen to believe that

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:23.020
happen to believe that
 

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:27.960
happen to believe that
and we will be in a internationally

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:27.970
and we will be in a internationally
 

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:30.390
and we will be in a internationally
competitive world within 10 years for

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400
competitive world within 10 years for
 

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.660
competitive world within 10 years for
undergraduate education so my view is we

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:33.670
undergraduate education so my view is we
 

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:37.110
undergraduate education so my view is we
don't care whether we just want the most

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120
don't care whether we just want the most
 

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.920
don't care whether we just want the most
brilliant young mathematician and we

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:40.930
brilliant young mathematician and we
 

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.180
brilliant young mathematician and we
don't care what the person comes from

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:42.190
don't care what the person comes from
 

01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:47.400
don't care what the person comes from
Pakistan or Belarus or and and there'll

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:47.410
Pakistan or Belarus or and and there'll
 

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:50.599
Pakistan or Belarus or and and there'll
be more of that kind of competition

01:09:50.599 --> 01:09:50.609
be more of that kind of competition
 

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:52.920
be more of that kind of competition
right now I think we're at nine or ten

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:52.930
right now I think we're at nine or ten
 

01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:55.350
right now I think we're at nine or ten
percent under international students at

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360
percent under international students at
 

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.100
percent under international students at
the at the college I'll bet we'll be at

01:09:59.100 --> 01:09:59.110
the at the college I'll bet we'll be at
 

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:02.250
the at the college I'll bet we'll be at
fifteen percent in 10 years and and and

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:02.260
fifteen percent in 10 years and and and
 

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:05.850
fifteen percent in 10 years and and and
more so let's take one more question and

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:05.860
more so let's take one more question and
 

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:13.470
more so let's take one more question and
I'm getting hook here go ahead I will

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480
I'm getting hook here go ahead I will
 

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:29.330
I'm getting hook here go ahead I will
take both glad you start and you finish

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:29.340

having the president united states a
 

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:43.440
having the president united states a
graduate of your institution so so I you

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:43.450
graduate of your institution so so I you
 

01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:46.890
graduate of your institution so so I you
know I think it makes us all feel really

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:46.900
know I think it makes us all feel really
 

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:54.360

not I mean it'd be easy to say I think

01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:57.220
not I mean it'd be easy to say I think
 

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:01.200
not I mean it'd be easy to say I think
he is who he is because he he studied at

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:01.210
he is who he is because he he studied at
 

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:03.570
he is who he is because he he studied at
Columbia and maybe took some of the core

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:03.580
Columbia and maybe took some of the core
 

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.910
Columbia and maybe took some of the core
curriculum he came late I think that

01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920
curriculum he came late I think that
 

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:13.530
curriculum he came late I think that
would be kind of funny I think I think

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:13.540
would be kind of funny I think I think
 

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:17.340
would be kind of funny I think I think
he is obviously an extraordinary

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:17.350
