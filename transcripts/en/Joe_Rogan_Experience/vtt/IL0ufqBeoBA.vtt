WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.330
Yeah,
boom.
And we live,
what are you doing Greg?

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.990
<v 1>I'm looking at the title of a book.
I want to talk about which book?</v>

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.960
It's an audio book and it was about reconstruction.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.620
<v 0>Oh,
what we were just talking about with slaves.</v>

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.910
<v 1>Yeah.
And it was about how,
you know,
once the,
uh,</v>

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.150
um,
once the slaves were freed,

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:26.060
they still perpetuated slavery by,
um,
it's called a,

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.510
and I got to find it by slavery by another name by Douglas Douglas Blackmon.

9
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.530
And it's about how they would,
they had,

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.540
they'd put loitering laws in all around the country and they would find black

11
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:43.530
people.
And if they were standing around,
they would arrest them.

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.920
Or if there was like a petty larceny or a domestic violence thing,

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.070
they'd arrest them for fucking two years with the trial with one judge and no

14
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.550
jury.
And the judge was very often a,
a,

15
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:01.440
a magistrate of the coal mining company.
They'd send the,

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.303
the,
the,

17
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.200
the prisoner to a coal mine for two years where he'd worked seven days a week

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.710
with shackles on and they would fucking whip them.

19
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.990
And if they tried to escape,

20
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.650
they tracked them down with dogs and they beat them sometimes to death.

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.020
And this went on for fucking decades.
Jesus.

22
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.160
Yeah.
So people talk about,
well,
slavery ended back at,

23
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.800
no forms of slavery went on for a long time.

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.890
<v 0>Not only that slavery ended and what effort was done to sort of rectify the</v>

25
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.381
situation,

26
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:42.381
whatever it was done to like try to give even opportunities for people grew up

27
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:49.590
in African American cities that were predominantly slaves before 1865 yeah.

28
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.480
Like what,
what's ever been done?

29
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.930
<v 1>40 acres and a mule.
Do they ever get that?
Is that real?
I don't know.</v>

30
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:56.830
I think it was a,

31
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.230
<v 0>but even,
even if you're dealing with that,</v>

32
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.460
even if some people got 40 acres and a mule,
like what is that enough now?

33
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.110
Like the whole thing is crazy.

34
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:10.111
Like if you have an entire country that the ancestors that did most of the work

35
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.920
did it against their will and then you just like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

36
00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:21.720
well you don't have to do that anymore.
And then people are like,

37
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.870
we want reparations and white people are like,
that was 100 years.

38
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.570
<v 1>Do you know?
And at Georgetown you read about this,
Georgetown University is um,</v>

39
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.710
giving reparations to the slaves that built the university so that the families

40
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:37.431
of the slaves,

41
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:42.431
they tracked him down with like 23 and me or one of those companies and they,

42
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.310
they,
they're fucking knocking on doors and they're like,
hey,
are you blah,

43
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.110
blah blah?
Well,
your great,

44
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:52.790
great grandfather built Georgetown University and they're assessing the
students.

45
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.630
I don't think it's official yet,
but it looks like it's happening.
My concern,

46
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.310
they're assessing the students like 50 bucks each,
something my big

47
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.870
<v 2>concern.
So it's going to go in the other way.</v>

48
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.500
They're going to track down people's DNA and going to go,

49
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.310
we found out that your family profited from slavery.
Like yeah,

50
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.610
I'm 22 yeah,
right.
What the fuck did I do?
Yeah,

51
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.560
give me all your money,
all of your money,
all your ill gotten gains.

52
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.830
And you'd be like,
but no,
no,
no,
no.
My Dad had a legitimate job.

53
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.250
He worked for H and r block and this and that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.670
But his grandfather got his money to raise his dad because he had slaves.

55
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.990
Yeah.
Well listen.

56
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:38.991
Schwartzenegger his grandfather and ss [inaudible] we're going to talk about

57
00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:43.740
that.
He was a hazy.
Yes.
Grandfather was,
he was a green shirt.

58
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.830
Whoa.
What do you know?

59
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:51.480
Like there's a kid named John Gotti,
the third John Gotti,

60
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:56.130
the gangsters grandson,
and he's an MMA fighter.
Oh,
no shit.
And it's good.

61
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.070
No Shit.
Good.
Yeah.
Wow.

62
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.120
So far he's fighting on these,
a small promotions,

63
00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:07.710
but he's fucking people up and jacked.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.

64
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:11.520
I remember John,
cause I lived,
uh,
on Mulberry Street in,

65
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.390
I remember they had a lace and it was a fucking 10 minute apartment and

66
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:19.920
downstairs,
literally downstairs in one door over was the raven.
I'd Social Club,

67
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.280
which was where Gadi met on Wednesday nights.

68
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.290
All the bosses would pull up and the,
uh,
the Kappos and I don't know the terms,

69
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:32.160
but they lined up fucking limos.
You stayed up Mulberry Street.
Oh yeah.

70
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.780
They'd walk up and down the street smoking cigars and John Gotti junior was kind

71
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:41.160
of in charge at that time,
which I guess would be this guy's father.
Yes.
And uh,

72
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.450
he,
he,
it wasn't known as being that sharp and uh,

73
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.430
well the family kind of fell apart since then.
Well,
I don't think there's a,

74
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.570
I think the FBI just had unlimited resources,
government backing,

75
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.930
and they slowly pick the fucking the organization apart and then it's got people

76
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:00.690
to rat on each other.
They bugged the Raven I social club.

77
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:04.440
They got inside and they bug it.
And then when they found out it was bugged,
the,

78
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:07.800
uh,
the wise guys would walk up and down Mulberry Street and talk about their

79
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:09.660
business.
So the cars on the route,

80
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.700
they bugged the hubcaps of the car is on the route.
You heard about that?
Yeah.

81
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.800
Well that was always the thing about that guy,
that chin,
what's his name?
Uh,

82
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.980
the chin.
Gigante how the fuck do you say his name?
Vincent.
The Chin.

83
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.340
And he was crazy,
but he wasn't crazy,
but he would act crazy.

84
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.210
So He'd walk around with the phone in the bathroom.
Right.

85
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.750
Cause he was up on trial.
He was out on bail.
He was out of his fucking mind.

86
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.400
Wander through the streets with a bathrobe on.
Played crazy.

87
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.760
That's him just walking around.
I'm crazy.

88
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.490
That would be fun Tim too.
That'd be fun to pretend you're crazy.

89
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.850
I think he was actually the guy that they got with the hubcaps.
Oh yeah.

90
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.390
Maybe what?
Maybe they use that tactic more than once.
Yes.
These guys,
you know,

91
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:51.531
they,

92
00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:54.750
they had a fucking neighborhood where they would go to and when they were in

93
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:57.060
that neighborhood that was there,
their territory.
Right.

94
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.670
Like when you were living there,
was that going on?
Like he was out of jail.

95
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.390
That was on,
he was in jail.
He was in jail when you yeah,
but they still,

96
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.090
they still showed up.
Most of the guys I think,
I think they're really,

97
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.350
headquarters is more in Brooklyn,

98
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:13.190
but they still came back to Mulberry Street and it is literally across the

99
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.040
street was a Saint Patrick School,

100
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:21.041
which is where Robert De Niro and Scorsese went to school as kids.

101
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:25.430
And where you remember the film mean streets that was shot.

102
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.190
Remember they jump over the wall into the cemetery.
That's,

103
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:31.370
that's a Saint Patrick school and it's across from the Raven night social club.

104
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.940
Fuck.
I don't remember anything about that movie.
I remember the movie,

105
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:38.210
but I don't remember anything about what happened and I need to see that one

106
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:41.210
again.
Yeah,
I need to see that one again.
You know what I saw again recently?

107
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.480
Bullet.
Oh,
set it up,
Wayne.
You see it on a plane.

108
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.260
I think I did see they show it on a plane now and United or something.

109
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.510
What are that fucking,
that's my car.

110
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.790
I saw that movie when I was young and I said,

111
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:55.730
I want that fucking 69 fastback Mustang.

112
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.150
That's a bad ass car.
Yeah.

113
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:04.151
68 is it 68 67 or 68 [inaudible] 68 is a very specific shape that the 68 had.

114
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.560
They had like the best rear end.
It's a beautiful though.

115
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:14.561
They had really cool set up with the rear tail tail lights at 68 it was a little

116
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.060
broader.
It's just,
it was weird looking,

117
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.560
real unusual in compared to some of the other most sites.
But I love it.
Yeah.

118
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:22.820
And it's my favorite,
I think.

119
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.480
And you watch those movies like that and you realize you think it's going to be,

120
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.310
there's one big car chase.
That's it.
Yeah.
And it's long.
It's a long slow,

121
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.640
but you know,
different,
they were different.

122
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.641
They weren't afraid to do a tracking shot for two minutes with no dialogue.

123
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.570
Just fucking follow a guy walking,
walking down the street.
You'll,

124
00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:45.980
we just assume people are stupid as fuck.

125
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.120
And because of comments and because stupid people want to comment so often the

126
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.830
signals all skewed towards stupid.
You know,
like a movie.
Like,

127
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:56.780
did you ever see La Mons was Steve Mcqueen,
great.
Steve McQueen movie.

128
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.680
There's no talking at all for the first x amount of minutes of the movie is no

129
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:04.160
talking.
It's just cars racing.
Right.
And him driving around and shit.
Yep.

130
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.800
There's no talking.
Yeah.
And if you were a movie theater today,

131
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.600
there was no talking.
People are like,
is this broken?

132
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.280
I know fucking part where the guy to talk,

133
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.600
God fucking ties look there is in the original 68 Mustang and that's also a 68

134
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:22.490
charger though.
He's in a race with the original 68 Mustang.

135
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.750
I think just went for sale thing.
Somebody just bought it.
Look at that.

136
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:30.400
Do you mean the one from this movie?
Yeah,
that hero cars.
Yeah.

137
00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:32.240
Wrecked a few of these fuckers.
Fuck yeah.

138
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.890
If they're doing like how many cars did they wreck and gone with gone in 60

139
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.230
seconds.
That Nicholas cage movie,
we drove that Eleanor Mustang.
Yeah,
we'll do it.

140
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.230
You know I a bunch of those.

141
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:47.231
How many fucking orange challenges do you think they needed to get for a hazard?

142
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.910
Oh my God.
I mean they wrecked when in every episode.

143
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:54.560
That to me is one of the more interesting episodes in our culture that that
show,

144
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:56.010
which was beloved part of

145
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.630
<v 4>our past is now taboo.</v>

146
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.770
You'll never find it anywhere because the confederate flag on the roof and when

147
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:06.090
we were kids that came over here,
it's fucking KKK.

148
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:11.050
It's racism.
It's white sheets.
When we were kids.
It meant the south.
Yeah.

149
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.510
It didn't mean the same thing.

150
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.290
There's a fucking poster that I have over the pisser from Leonard Skinner

151
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.440
concert from like set some,

152
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.410
sometime during the 70s they have a giant confederate flag behind them.

153
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.770
[inaudible] stage.
Yeah,
but it didn't mean they were racist.

154
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.160
It meant they were from the south.
But somewhere along the line it shifted.

155
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:32.880
This is where the argument gets weird,
right?
Because people will say,
hey,

156
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.310
it's not about that.
It's about southern pride.

157
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.580
I understand it used to be about southern pride,

158
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.730
but now unfortunately that flag is now connected to racism.

159
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:48.240
So you're sending out a bad signal.
So what you want that flag to mean for you,

160
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.440
that's great.
But what that flag means for other people is now changed.

161
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.970
And you either accept that or you know you're fighting against it.
Oh,

162
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.370
you can't get me to fucking at this means this to the people don't,
there's,

163
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.490
they're not thinking.

164
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:06.000
People don't have time to rationally consider whether or not you're racist or

165
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:09.180
whether or not you're from the south.
What are you,
why do you have that flag?

166
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.690
They don't have time to consider that,
that just go,
oh,
you must be in the KKK.

167
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.070
Oh you must hate black people.
Oh Bang,
there it is racist.
You got that flag.

168
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.370
So some something shifted like really radically and deduce it hazardous like a

169
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.630
great metric of it.

170
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.990
So one of the great things in our culture we could use to measure and you know,

171
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:28.824
look what happened.

172
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.090
You had a hit show that literally sparked a type of clothing.

173
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.020
The daisy dukes for gay men.
Yeah.

174
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.480
And for girls that are really sad,

175
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.570
like we see a girl with Davidson Daisy dukes like,
sweetie,
you don't need that.

176
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.230
You're hot without it.
Oh are you kidding me?
So hard in those days.

177
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:51.610
<v 1>I just went to a food truck before I got here and it was an Asian girl and like</v>

178
00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:56.540
my favorite kind of Asian girl,
she was a belief Filipino big lips.

179
00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.520
Oh Tad dark tan with daisy Dukes,
open toed sandals,
beautiful feet,

180
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:04.720
nice pedicure.
We freaking out.
It was,

181
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.840
it was just me and her so I couldn't stay there and it was so painful.

182
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.860
He ever like,
you're fighting your neck like don't fucking turn,

183
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.660
keep your head straight.

184
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.120
<v 4>Here's what's interesting and this is the dynamic.</v>

185
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.730
There's a difference between men and women.
If we were to say,
describe,

186
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.740
describing it's the exact same thing,

187
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.750
but you were a girl and you were describing a guy,
it would be innocent.

188
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.700
Yeah,
it would be nothing.
It wouldn't be creepy.
It'd be like that girl.
So horny.

189
00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:36.350
Oh my God.
Like if she was like,
I was in line and behind me was Jason Mamoa.

190
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.550
You know aqua man.
Oh my God.
And if you think he looks good and movies,

191
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.760
he looks so good in real life,
sweetie.
I couldn't stop.

192
00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:47.020
I was looking right at his deck.
I looked at his dick and I looked at his face,

193
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.900
I looked his dick and he started smiling when I started nodding.

194
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.670
And no one would care.

195
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.070
<v 0>No,
you say that girls liberated.
She's free.
She's crazy.
There goes wild.</v>

196
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.000
But she could maybe grab it on the way out.
Talia,
little give a little tap,
tap,

197
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:04.090
tap.
No one's going to call the cops.
Right?

198
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.240
But if that's the difference,
and that's what's,

199
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.330
I think this is something that as men,

200
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:16.060
this is a shaky one because there are definitely some fake male feminists out

201
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:19.660
there that are just doing it because they want women to love them and they say a

202
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:22.000
bunch of shit that really screws the curve up.

203
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.420
But if you're being honest and you're being rationally have to realize that the

204
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:30.280
way a woman perceives being hit on is going to be way different than the way a

205
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:34.660
guy does cause the girls in danger.
She's in potential danger.

206
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.010
Like legitimately like if you are some fucking serial killer,
a psychopath,

207
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.790
and you decided to follow her back to her house that's on the menu that's on the

208
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:43.624
menu.

209
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.480
How rare is it that you meet a girl somewhere and she wants to come back to your

210
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:48.630
house and kill you?
Yeah,
pretty fucking real.
Yeah.

211
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.020
I lean war knows that monster for the Charlie's Thuram movie.
Oh yeah.

212
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.720
That girl prostitute and she would,

213
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.550
she would pick guys up and they would think they were going to go get laid and

214
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:00.670
she'd kill them.
Right.
And they were all so it wasn't,
you know,

215
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.560
people can demonize the John Because he's picking up a hardcore hooker cause he

216
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:09.730
wants some sex.
They see it's not victimless.
Yeah.
But you know,
he just wants sex.

217
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:13.360
He doesn't want to get murdered,
you know,
but she was tortured and you know,

218
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.450
abused so horribly in her life that men became the enemy.
Yeah.

219
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.500
There's a big lesson in that man.
I've,

220
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:24.610
I've known guys and watch them as they got older and like failed relationship

221
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:27.730
after failed relationship where they start to developing this like resentment

222
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:31.660
towards women.
You know,
this is a,
this is like a,
a deep seated like fuck them.

223
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.690
All they want is this and all they want to cause what they're getting from the

224
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:36.010
women all the time is negative.

225
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.240
They're getting a rejection because they're trying to get laid there.

226
00:13:39.241 --> 00:13:41.200
Didn't want the women that touch them and the women are like,

227
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.330
well not really in touch in you and you're like fuck these wars.

228
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.900
And they eventually develop this thing where they just hate.

229
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.650
Isn't there a name for those guys?
Misogynists no,

230
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:55.330
there's like an online sale.
And say,
yeah,
insults are guys who,

231
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.120
I think mostly they're talking about like,
look,

232
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.190
a lot of those guys are like genetically unfortunate.
Yeah,

233
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.980
fucked up bone structure room small and that's why there's an argument for

234
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:10.981
legalized prostitution because there are men that just because of deformities or

235
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.270
whatever reason,
or maybe they're,

236
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:17.680
maybe they're even a neurotic where they can't hit on a woman and so there

237
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:22.681
should be a place where a woman can knowingly and confidently and safely be a

238
00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:28.360
prostitute.
Yes,
yes.
It should be your option.

239
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.410
The problem is we equate prostitution with two things that are horrible.

240
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:35.920
Sexual abuse and sex slavery,
sex trafficking.

241
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.560
We equate prostitution with those things.

242
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:40.450
That's why like when Robert Kraft got busted,

243
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.630
one of the first things they said is this guy's a billionaire and he was

244
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:46.840
participating in sex trafficking.
That's they accused him of,

245
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.820
but then they had to drop that.
I don't know if you know that now,

246
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.400
so there was no sex trafficking there.
There was prostitutes,

247
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:57.030
<v 4>there was women who wanted to have sex for money and they weren't,</v>

248
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.430
they didn't come over in a seal tanker and slept in the no,

249
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.390
they were prostitutes.
Yeah.
You know,

250
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.740
and it's their choice and they,

251
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.570
you don't hear much about that.
This,

252
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:13.130
the sex trafficking was like a big thing I think to get him to plead guilty and

253
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.310
they put it out there and they said,
you know,

254
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.690
they were shaming him and making it this big deal.

255
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.470
This guy paid to get his dick touched,
you know?
And here he is.

256
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.890
What is he like 78 years old,
eight years old or something like that.

257
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.310
It's this old guy just wanting to get his dick touched.
He paid,

258
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.630
it was a deal's a deal.
She probably did it 13 times that day before him.

259
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.280
You know what I mean?
That's what they were doing in that place.

260
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.040
There were jerking guys off,
but people kept coming back.

261
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.130
Why they keep coming back because they hated it.
Why they keep coming back?

262
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:42.200
Because it was a rip off.
Why did they keep coming back?
No.

263
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:47.201
Because as adults they wanted to get their Dick touched and this woman was

264
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:51.890
willing to do that and she,
yeah.
Is that a bad job?
It's fucking terrible job.

265
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.300
So is Wendy's so as being a dishwasher,
those are terrible jobs to do.

266
00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:58.280
You want to,
do you want to be the guy who puts the coal,

267
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.620
the fucking tar on the streets and the hot day?

268
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.890
Do you want to be that guy the fuck out of here?
That job sucks.

269
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.860
Do you want to be a guy who works in a a gas station?

270
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.880
We are constantly stiffened fumes.
Fuck that.
That job sucks.
Law Job Suck.

271
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.350
But it's your choice.

272
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.640
It's your choice as a human being to take that job or not take that job.
I fit.

273
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:20.000
Feel the same way about prostitution that I feel about massage.

274
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.650
It's like if you can pay someone to touch your feet and rub your feet,

275
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.290
you could pay a dude.
Just be rubbing your feet.

276
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.300
Why can't you pay someone to touch you?

277
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.490
Why can't we pay someone to touch your genitals?

278
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.530
<v 1>Rid of the stigma by legalizing it and pretend those girls,
right?</v>

279
00:16:36.531 --> 00:16:39.530
I've been to the bunny ranch.
I got a tour,
I went,
you know,
my wife

280
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.690
<v 4>gave you permission to call it a tour</v>

281
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.110
and I had a map.
I had a fucking Hawaiian shirt on.
No,

282
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.600
I had the t shirt with the tour dates.
He died recently.

283
00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:50.780
And it's often a soft diet.

284
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.370
<v 1>Yeah.
So he invited me,
he came to a show I was doing in a Lake Tahoe,</v>

285
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.300
I know Reno.
And he goes,
uh,
Hey,
do you want to come take a tour?
And like,

286
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:01.900
because of the stern connection,
I kind of knew him.
He says,

287
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.730
do you want to come take a tour of the ranch?
And I go,
let me call my wife.

288
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.280
And I called her and I go,
can I just,
I go,
I just want to see it,

289
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.370
just going to smell it.
And she goes,
well,
if you bring Kathleen role,

290
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:15.680
who is the feature act with you,
then you can go.

291
00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:20.681
So they send a limo and we go off and we walk in and there was like one room had

292
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:24.950
like a fucking trap,
he's in it and the other one had a hot tub.

293
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:27.950
They all had different like themes to them and it was like,

294
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:30.740
it wasn't a Skanky as I thought,
but it was pretty down and dirty.

295
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.190
He was like trailers,
but they were clean.
And while I was there,

296
00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:36.560
a doctor showed up and they gave them all fucking,

297
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:40.100
they checked their snatches for whatever they had a little kitchen at.

298
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:43.040
They'd somebody cooking little snacks for them.
They offered me some,
I said,

299
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.810
I'm going to pass.
And then a at the end he pulls me aside and he goes,
uh,

300
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.720
by the way,
Greg take any of the girls,
it's on the house.

301
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.670
And I go,
well then is,
I've never been with a prostitute before.

302
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.400
And it wasn't because of the hundred bucks.

303
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.740
I wasn't waiting for a Freebie.
And,
but the girls were,
they were happy.

304
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:12.600
They keep 50% of the money.
They can't use drugs on the premises.
They,
um,

305
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.590
they can refuse a customer and they come and go when they want.

306
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.850
<v 4>I think people should be able to do whatever they want.
That doesn't hurt people.</v>

307
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.610
I don't think that falls into that category.

308
00:18:22.611 --> 00:18:26.570
And I think it does provide a service for really frustrated men that can't get

309
00:18:26.571 --> 00:18:29.510
sex any other way.
Yeah,
and I think it's stigmatized.

310
00:18:29.511 --> 00:18:32.990
I think it's stigmatized in a very weird way.
It's not a good job.

311
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.480
I don't want to do it.
I don't want my children to do it.

312
00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.710
I don't want your children to do it.

313
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.680
I don't want my kids to work as a dishwasher either.

314
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.910
I don't want my kids to be a coal miner.
Those things are real jobs,
you know?

315
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.620
I just don't.
I think that if we had different attitudes about sex,

316
00:18:48.621 --> 00:18:53.300
we wouldn't look at it as harshly.
We look at it as as horribly as we look at it.

317
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.450
We look at it different because we think they're like intimacies connected to

318
00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:57.284
romance.

319
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.950
Romance is connected to this emotional connection you have with this person that

320
00:19:00.951 --> 00:19:04.580
you're sharing pleasure with.
I'm like,
that's,
that is wonderful.

321
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.120
But physical release is also very important for men.

322
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.560
It's like it's very important.

323
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.790
It's very important for everyone to be touched and some people,

324
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.530
people don't want to touch them.
They're just not doing so good.

325
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.890
It's just that not in a good spot.
They don't,
they're not physically attractive,

326
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:20.620
whatever it is,
whatever the whatever.

327
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.080
For some people and they have a desire and a need to be touched and it fucking

328
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:27.490
wrecks them to the soul when they're not touched all the time.

329
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:32.030
They constantly walk around,
filled with resentment,
filled with bitterness.

330
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.560
We just quietly enraged inside at the the hand that life has given them.

331
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.270
And for those people,
if you had legalized prostitution,

332
00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:44.940
if it was like someone who like you,

333
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.830
you could conceivably have friendships with these people that you're having sex

334
00:19:48.831 --> 00:19:53.420
with if you wanted to do that.
Like I knew a girl who when she was younger,

335
00:19:53.421 --> 00:19:56.900
she was a sex worker and she's a,
I don't want to even reveal her,

336
00:19:56.901 --> 00:19:58.970
it'd be too obvious.
Five reveal what she does.

337
00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:03.530
But she did it for a while when she was like young and she fucked some older

338
00:20:03.531 --> 00:20:06.860
guys that were like,
you know,
in their sixties and shit and they didn't know,

339
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.490
you know,
they had money but they didn't have the time to date.
And you know,

340
00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:13.310
maybe they had a wife and they wanted to have sex with somebody on the side and

341
00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:15.740
she would take money from them and she liked it.
She's like,

342
00:20:15.741 --> 00:20:18.440
it's a great way to make money.
It was a lot more money.
It's not that big a deal.

343
00:20:18.441 --> 00:20:22.940
She was,
I knew who I was doing it with and I was like,
wow,
she's smart.
You know?

344
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:23.360
I mean,

345
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.420
I don't think everybody has that attitude and I would never want anybody to do

346
00:20:26.421 --> 00:20:27.890
that.
That doesn't have that attitude.

347
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.840
But if you're one of those girls that's like hustling,

348
00:20:29.841 --> 00:20:31.820
maybe you don't have a family that backs you up.

349
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.170
<v 1>No.
These girls that like,</v>

350
00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:36.050
you know they're in there is legitimately like [inaudible].

351
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.380
I got a friend who's really wealthy and his friends have,

352
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.590
some of them have like a girl in New York and they pay for her apartment and

353
00:20:44.631 --> 00:20:48.730
she's gone to college and he goes to New York seven,
eight times a year.

354
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:52.030
And when he does,
she frees her calendar and goes out to dinner with them,

355
00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:54.220
goes to wherever he sleeps there.

356
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:57.670
They have sex and it's a comfortable working relationship,

357
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.470
so I don't know where's the,
where's the problem with that?
Who's the victim,

358
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.550
right?

359
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.450
<v 0>Yeah,
he's a sugar daddy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't,</v>

360
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.660
I think we have crazy attitudes for finite beings.

361
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.850
We have this crazy idea to like,

362
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:17.851
we're leaving this permanent like ledger of all the moral and immoral things

363
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:23.830
we've done,
especially when it comes to sex.
It's just sex.
He fucks.
Yeah,

364
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.060
it's great.
Everybody wants it,

365
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.510
but everybody doesn't get it and sometimes people get rejected,

366
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:30.870
so carries all this weight and so it's just like a bit,

367
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.980
and then you're not supposed to do it because God doesn't want you to,

368
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:36.700
or you could get pregnant.
Jesus Christ.
Are you pro life?
Are you pro abortion?

369
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.210
He pro women's like to choose.
You didn't even,
you should even have a say.

370
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:44.020
You have a fucking penis.
They're like,
Whoa,
is this charge?

371
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:48.940
He is so charged and meanwhile biologically your brain is going,
no,
no,

372
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:51.370
no.
We got him.
Fuck.
Okay.
I got loads building up.

373
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:53.410
I got to get rid of these things.
You know,

374
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.020
like I used to have a bit called jerk off first and think about it.

375
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.710
It was like my advice for everything because there's so many moments in life

376
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.630
where you jerk off first and then he'd go,
what?
What was I going to do?
Right.

377
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.570
I'm not calling her,
I'm definitely not respond to that crazy fucking letter.

378
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:12.490
She sat me in the mail.
You know when you get a letter from somebody like,
oh no,

379
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:17.080
it's like sell,
bring up jerk offers.
Jefferson know your real intentions.

380
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.480
If you jerk off first and you still want to call someone,

381
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:22.840
you really care about them.
You love them.
That's right.
It's not just lust.

382
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.900
That's it.
That's empty bag.
Thank Ya.
Yeah.

383
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.600
<v 1>I,
I was never good at that.
Like A,
I've,</v>

384
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.830
I reset the clock one nowadays.

385
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.550
I pop give me 24 hours to leave me alone.

386
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.040
25 24 hours.
Well,

387
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.500
<v 0>I think I need some of those pills.
He said testosterone.
Yeah.
Need some tea.</v>

388
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.220
Our tea is that,
is that legal?
Oh,
100% yeah.

389
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.810
I think I need somebody I need to do medically to some of that.
Yeah,
dude,

390
00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:55.230
I've been on that show for 10 years.
No Shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

391
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.600
And you make it a bunch of different ways now to theirs.

392
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.410
They were making the spray for awhile.
It goes under the tongue.

393
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.640
You could put drops in and then,
I don't know if they're doing that anymore,

394
00:23:05.641 --> 00:23:08.190
but they have a cream.
The cream is good,

395
00:23:08.191 --> 00:23:12.810
but if you hug people that gets on them.
It's weird.
Wait,

396
00:23:12.811 --> 00:23:14.990
where do you rub it on?
You rub it over your chest or your arms.

397
00:23:14.991 --> 00:23:18.030
So if you have sex with your wife,
your wife started Mike growing a mustache.

398
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.730
We've you fucking very strange.

399
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.660
That'd be at like a really creepy way if you were like really in a dude's,

400
00:23:24.661 --> 00:23:28.740
but you were married to a woman or how do I,
how do I bridge this gap?

401
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.390
Right?

402
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.590
Like I'm on TRT and you would rub it all over your chest and immediately get on

403
00:23:34.591 --> 00:23:38.340
her and she believed the fuck are you doing?
Give her protein shakes.

404
00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:42.300
Make her go to the gym a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey honey,
you look good with short hair.

405
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.010
Put her under stress to make her work more.
That's something happens with women.

406
00:23:46.011 --> 00:23:48.620
Apparently there was a study on a career women,

407
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.060
and they don't know if it's a correlation or causation thing because maybe the

408
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:55.850
reason why they were queer career women and the first place,

409
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.960
because they had a lot of testosterone,
but they were,

410
00:23:57.961 --> 00:23:59.990
they would notice that women,
you have to fend for themselves.

411
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:01.830
Women have to take care of themselves.
They,
they,

412
00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:05.600
they generally have more testosterone.
Interesting.
Which makes sense,

413
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.660
but it doesn't,
I,
you never know like what came first,
the chicken or the egg,

414
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.710
is that like who they are or are they developing more testosterone because

415
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.380
they're,
they have to be out there competing.
Yeah.
You know?

416
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.970
<v 1>Yeah.
I remember I was,
uh,
I used Rogaine for awhile.</v>

417
00:24:20.971 --> 00:24:24.590
I was actually,
I got approached by my agent and he goes,
um,

418
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.250
you've got an offer to do a commercial,
a series of commercials.
I said,
for what?

419
00:24:29.251 --> 00:24:33.870
And he goes,
Rogaine,
I go,
but I do,
my hair is not thinning.
And he's like,

420
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.880
yeah,
so a,
it's five commercials.
I was in denial about it.

421
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.210
I was like 29 and I guess I was starting to crown a little bit,

422
00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:45.570
but I didn't notice.
And so he goes,
do you want to do it?
And I was like,
ah,

423
00:24:45.571 --> 00:24:49.590
I don't know.
Um,
and about to move out to la,

424
00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:51.120
I want to maybe do some acting.

425
00:24:51.121 --> 00:24:54.270
I don't want to be seen maybe on TV as the road gang gang.
He's like,

426
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.900
I talked to them and they said it's only good or it's going to be on like ESPN

427
00:24:57.901 --> 00:25:02.310
for at two in the morning.
Don't worry about it.
And I go and I go,
all right,

428
00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:04.380
fuck it.
I'm moving to La.
I got no money.
I'll do it.

429
00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:06.870
I'll get health insurance out of it.
I'm about to get married.

430
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.940
So I record the commercials and the tagline is it's me and a pharmacy and I'm

431
00:25:11.941 --> 00:25:14.400
looking at a bottle and it's Madonna monoxide,

432
00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:19.360
il five they just jacked it up from three to five and I go a four out of five.

433
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.640
The Voice of our goes,
four out of five doctors say this'll work.
And then I go,

434
00:25:23.641 --> 00:25:26.310
I look at the camera and I go,
four out of five.

435
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.620
I like my chances.
Oh Geez.
So there you are.

436
00:25:31.621 --> 00:25:35.640
So I know.
So I do it,
I do it.
And then,
uh,

437
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.410
there is,
there's that guy,
oh look,
the nod.
You're like,

438
00:25:40.411 --> 00:25:45.180
yeah,
this is legit.
So they,
uh,
so all of a sudden it starts running.

439
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.010
It runs during the fucking playoffs.

440
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:55.410
March madness.
Every guy I've ever met was calling me and gone.

441
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.750
I like my,
I'm walking down the street.
I like Mike Jensen.

442
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.580
It was everywhere.
Yeah.
And so they gave me,

443
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:08.460
they gave me a fucking supply for years and I was using it and I would,

444
00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.070
my wife wouldn't let me cuddle with her because she don't,

445
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.820
you put on your head at the end of the day before you go to bed and cuddle up

446
00:26:14.821 --> 00:26:18.990
next to her and get chicken fucking hair on her neck and it made you all greasy.

447
00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:23.640
My pillows were all greasy and all it really grew was like a,
like a fuzz.

448
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.230
Did you ever try that shit?
I

449
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.460
<v 0>tried that shit.
I tried everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

450
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.020
I wish I had shaved my head way earlier.
It's so easy.

451
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.690
I think I'm going to do it tomorrow.
For the first time in my life,

452
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.750
once I shaved my head,
I was like,
why am I fucking around with all this hair?

453
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.380
Yeah.
If I had a full head of hair,
I shaved my fucking head.

454
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.980
I shaved my head like every two weeks.
I would just let grow to stubble.

455
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.340
<v 4>Then shave it down again.
Let it grow to stubble.
It's like it's so much easier.</v>

456
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.530
How often do you shave it?
Every couple of days.

457
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.670
You take a razor [inaudible] the buzzer?
Yeah.
Easy.

458
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.760
I have one that has like a,
it's made for shaving your head.

459
00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.540
It's got like a handle on it.
It's like an electric razor.
Just wow.
Rant.
Rant,

460
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.890
rant,
rant.
So you don't miss any spots.
How long does it take?
A couple minutes.

461
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.040
Let's you feel good?
Yeah,
that's great.
I don't have to think about it.

462
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:10.710
That's what I like.
I don't know this.
I don't think about this.

463
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.410
I used to worry about my hair when my hair was falling out.

464
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.050
When something's out of your control for people to have a full head of hair.

465
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:19.230
They really don't understand this.
When you start losing your hair,
Young Jami,

466
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:23.250
son of a bitch,
when you start losing your hair,
you,
you just go,
oh my God.

467
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.710
Like this is nothing I can do about this.
This is terrible.

468
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.760
Like there's nothing you can do.
And then you look at it like these fucking guys,

469
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:33.300
like some guys that are like gross looking bald dudes and he like,
oh my God,

470
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.620
they used to be a kid.

471
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.580
They used to be just like me and then one day it all fucking fell out and they

472
00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:42.150
were this gross dude with the horseshoe around the bottom of the head.

473
00:27:42.151 --> 00:27:43.950
Like what the fuck?
That's what I'm going to be.

474
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.200
And once he shaved your head,
like for me,
I got lucky.

475
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:52.410
I have a good shape in good shape ahead,
which is something that I watched.

476
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.370
I went down a rabbit hole the other day and uh,

477
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.090
I went down a plastic surgery,
facial reconnect,

478
00:28:00.091 --> 00:28:05.091
reconstruct configuration rabbit hole because of in cells connected to this

479
00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:08.050
conversation we were having earlier about guys can't get laid.
Yeah,

480
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.790
these guys were going to,
this one doctor,
there's a particular doctor,

481
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:16.970
I think he's in Indianapolis and he does a facial reconfiguration.

482
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:23.010
Likehey widens your jaw.
He puts implants on your cheeks and jaw.

483
00:28:23.011 --> 00:28:27.390
He puts implants on your fucking head.
So I get,
maybe you have a weird shape,
ted.

484
00:28:27.391 --> 00:28:29.250
Maybe your head is shaped like a turtle or something.

485
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.170
They have a weird crest in the top of your head.

486
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:36.410
This guy puts implants under your skin to give you a nice round head.

487
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.350
And they had like before and after and this guy was like,
oh,
he's hated my head.

488
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.760
Now my head's amazing and I'm looking at this and I'm going,
oh my God.

489
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:48.870
Like I didn't even think of that.
But it look,
it looked way better.
Yeah.
But it's,

490
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.520
what it is is like genetics or responding to symmetry.

491
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.520
When you see,
when you see poor genetics,

492
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.940
you see something weird like weird symmetry.
Why is this,

493
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.060
why is this face so narrow?
Why is this chin go down so low?

494
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:07.140
What's weird about him?
Why is or why his shoulder,
so narrow wires arm so long.

495
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.790
When you see asymmetrical or weird looking people that don't seem to like,

496
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:16.791
it doesn't fit into your idea of what the accepted breeding genetics of human

497
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:21.660
beings are eventually comes.
Yeah.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

498
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.140
It's based on a,
there's a,

499
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.120
there's a certain shape of the face and the FIBONACCI FIBONACCI code.

500
00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:28.200
Is that what you're thinking?
No,
no.

501
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.810
I think it's the Davinci could if there was a religious thing for that movie.

502
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:35.010
Yeah.
But with within it,
don't they talk about the symmetry of the face?

503
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.770
I think that's the golden ratio.
Yeah.
That's the FIBONACCI.
The FIBONACCI code.

504
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.440
But yeah,
this is the guy.
This is sky.

505
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.670
<v 1>Wow.</v>

506
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.860
<v 4>So they uh,
oh,</v>

507
00:29:43.861 --> 00:29:48.840
this is an article from cut the cut the cut.com.
Yeah,
that's,

508
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.580
this is exactly where I started.
So I started on this and um,

509
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.390
I think it was on date or something like that.

510
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.820
And then I went from that to all of the,
uh,

511
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.920
different people that have these things done.

512
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.550
And that's something if you think about it,
man,

513
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:10.560
if you just get a bum deal,
you just get a bit a bad roll.
The dice,

514
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.720
you will live your life with people that don't,

515
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.310
they don't want to have sex with you.

516
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.620
And this goes back to like the prostitution thing.

517
00:30:16.621 --> 00:30:19.080
Like what do people want from those people?

518
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.050
Do they want the world to be a different place than it really is?

519
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:26.550
Cause are we operating as if this world is exactly how it is right now?

520
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.900
Or are we pretending that the world is how we'd like it to be one day in a

521
00:30:30.901 --> 00:30:34.380
Utopian society?
Because if we're doing that,
I get how you're behaving.

522
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.220
But if you're looking at the world around you the way it is and you don't think

523
00:30:38.221 --> 00:30:41.730
these guys should be able to get prostitutes,
you're,
you're an asshole.

524
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.240
<v 1>I think that kind of boils down with libertarianism is,
you know,</v>

525
00:30:45.241 --> 00:30:50.241
it's whether or not we are in a evolving you utopian mindset or whether or not

526
00:30:51.301 --> 00:30:52.200
we're going to just say,

527
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.920
let people be who they are and just accept how things are.

528
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.530
<v 4>Does a little bit of that.
I think I'm on both sides of that fence sometimes.</v>

529
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.491
You know,
there's,

530
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:03.340
there's definitely people that you just want to leave him alone,

531
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:06.970
like they're not going to figure it out.
Fuck them.
But then there's also people,

532
00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:07.360
like,

533
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.320
we've all met people that have been in a bad place in their life and turned it

534
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:15.640
around.
I don't,
I don't like giving up on people.
I just don't,

535
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:21.130
it's not human.
It's not a human thing.
Just give up on people.
Right.
So

536
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.910
I,
I've,
I'm on both sides of that.
Like,
part of me wants to go look,
figured out,

537
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.270
and then part of me wants to go,
like,
we got to help people figure it out.
Yeah.

538
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.830
And we have to try to engineer our society.

539
00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:37.030
Like this is a problem.

540
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.300
It's like we were talking about before about reparations for slavery or these,

541
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:43.174
uh,

542
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:48.280
these communities that have always been black and poor since the slave times.

543
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:52.500
Like to just leave that alone and let that sort itself out that has never gonna

544
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.353
sort itself out.

545
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.580
That's like a place in your garage that's fucked up and filled with trash that

546
00:31:57.581 --> 00:32:00.790
you think is going to figure itself out on its own.
Like you,
you,

547
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.600
you got to do something.
The garbage that you're leaving behind,

548
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.470
that's not gonna make its way to the trash.
You're going to have to sort it out.

549
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.810
You didn't have to figure out how to do it.
You have to get it out there.

550
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:16.210
If you have a impoverished crime riddled community filled with drugs and gangs,

551
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.970
it's not going to get better.
You have to do something.

552
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.610
Somebody has to do something.
You can't just pretend.

553
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.710
You can't just go further and further away from it.

554
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.270
If we're going to act as a country and it's what we're supposed to be,

555
00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:29.530
we're supposed to be a big ass team.

556
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.940
We were supposed to be looking at the spots on the team that are fucked up.

557
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.500
<v 1>Yeah.
You talk about that.
Houston is kind of famous for this.</v>

558
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.190
Literally the garbage dumps we're all put in the black

559
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.023
<v 2>neighborhoods.</v>

560
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:45.410
They just started dumping all the garbage in the poor areas with the bad
schools.

561
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.840
Totally segregated and it's the same areas that were,

562
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:52.220
they were slave shacks way back when and now it's the same fucking generations

563
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:56.340
later living in garbage.
All right,

564
00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.290
and it has to be the,
because we have to do a DNA test.

565
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.670
Find out your great grandfather was the guy who put the fucking garbage dump in

566
00:33:03.671 --> 00:33:06.880
the black neighborhood and that's what you have a catalog dude.

567
00:33:06.881 --> 00:33:10.420
My Wallet's on the table at that point.
Take it off.
I'm so sorry,

568
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.090
but you didn't do anything.
You're 23 I recycle now.
Thank you.
But Steph,

569
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.690
in the green bins,
the blue bins,
you're going to save those fish compost bins.

570
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.190
Those whales out there.
It's eating plastic.
Yeah.
We gotta just,

571
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.820
we get a genetic engineer,
the whales to actually be able to digest plastic.

572
00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.810
Figure it out.
We're good.
It's free food.
Yeah.
Come on,

573
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:35.790
man.

574
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:40.790
We got boy on slot on the podcast and he's just really young genius who is in

575
00:33:41.531 --> 00:33:45.160
the middle of devising and implementing a way to gather up the plastic.

576
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.030
He's got like this big machine that operates,
oh,
I saw this guy,
big arm on it.

577
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.460
It's like,
yeah,
it's like gotta look on net capturing.
I'm,

578
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:56.680
I'm really breaking it down much like a paraphrasing in a shitty way,

579
00:33:56.681 --> 00:34:01.681
but his machine is just going to scoop plastic up and they think they're good.

580
00:34:01.781 --> 00:34:05.650
Actually reuse that plastic and make things out of it.
Yeah,
I saw that.

581
00:34:05.651 --> 00:34:08.380
I think they,
I think they ran into some technical problems with it.

582
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.710
They just used it.
Yeah.
I think the,
when they tried it out right away,

583
00:34:11.711 --> 00:34:15.260
it didn't work that good.
Yeah,
but he kind of figured that.
He was like,
well,

584
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:18.190
there's going to be a bunch of improvements.
It's like everything else.

585
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.870
Everything go by early Tesla.
They were terrible.

586
00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.920
Maybe over Tesla May,
may not last.
Really?
Yeah.
They're saying that.

587
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.000
Well,
the problem is is they,

588
00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:33.700
they call it the entrepreneurial Shiny Object Syndrome.

589
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.470
That's what Ilan Musk has his like he can't stop.
He has to keep,
you know,

590
00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:42.170
there was space acts which is fucking phenomenal,
right?

591
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.990
What that program has done,
they are,

592
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.260
they are delivering a stuff to space for a 10th of the price of NASA.

593
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:55.990
They have cut costs ridiculously.
NASA was so fucking bloated and,

594
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.010
and which was great,

595
00:34:57.011 --> 00:35:01.720
but now it's like he wants to put a fucking tunnel under la and he wants these

596
00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:05.980
charging stations all around the country that are going to be solar powered,

597
00:35:05.981 --> 00:35:07.000
that are going to be expensive.

598
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.130
He's just overextended himself and now Wall Street used to love them and now

599
00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:14.830
they're not buying it anymore.
And it could be the end of the company.

600
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:19.000
How would it be the end of the company?
How's that work?
Well,
there the um,

601
00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.840
they need to be producing like a million cars a year to be cost effective for

602
00:35:22.841 --> 00:35:25.050
their,
um,
assembly lines for the,

603
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.480
it costs for their assembly lines and they're putting out a few hundred thousand

604
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.720
a year and they need to,
they need to up production to that point.

605
00:35:31.721 --> 00:35:36.530
And they don't think they can do it.
I shouldn't say that.

606
00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:38.070
I'm going to fucking tank the stock.

607
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.590
<v 0>Yeah.
It's um,
how many different places can you charge out now?</v>

608
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:46.230
I always charge here or a charge at home.
Yeah.

609
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.370
But how many places it real easy to charge.
Can you find a lot of spots?

610
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:54.330
I have no idea,
but I know he's trying to make it really universal.

611
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.690
It's great if you drive and it just to work like I do,

612
00:35:57.691 --> 00:36:01.800
I drive it to the store or dry wood here.
It's great.
Yeah,
they're the,

613
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:05.220
it's the best car I've ever driven but,
but it's not,

614
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.130
it's not ready for like long ass trips takes 10 hours time.

615
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:12.390
My friend just bought a,
I think it's a Mitsubishi and it's um,
it's a hybrid,

616
00:36:12.391 --> 00:36:16.890
but how it works is it goes all electric until you run out of the electric

617
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:21.150
charge.
And then it had done the motor kicks San as opposed to that.
Like my,

618
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.260
my Prius,
which is just all chatting back and forth all the time.
Right.

619
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.960
The Prius gets ridiculous gas models though.
Right.
It's amazing.
What do you get?

620
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.540
Probably 50 wow.
That's hilarious.
It looks like dog shit though.

621
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.130
I hate it.
Why do you,
why do you deal with it?
Why do you do that yourself?

622
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:42.120
You and I have had this conversation a million times.
I'm like,
Greg,

623
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.780
get a muscle car.
I want a Mustang.
All I want.

624
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.770
The new ones are amazing and matter of fact,

625
00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:50.670
they have a new bullet Mustang now that they do.
Is they do?
Yes they do.

626
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.990
They have a bullet model,
brand new 2019 green,

627
00:36:54.991 --> 00:36:59.400
Emerald Green Dope ass fucking Mustang with a,

628
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.900
I think it's more than 460 horsepower.

629
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:08.610
It's a very fast,
it's an up tuned version of the one that's in the GT.

630
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:13.590
So it's there.
Coyote generation three Mustang engine.
Look at that.
That's it.

631
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.970
Bay Be.
Oh my God,
I see it even says boat on the back.
See the back,

632
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.490
the back badge.
That's a bullet Mustang.

633
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:25.350
That's the yellow thousand 19 and you get into stick shift like a fucking man.

634
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.290
Fat.
Yeah,
I definitely got to get a stick shift drive around your,
your,

635
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.160
your balls are going to grow back.
I need them back.
I need the A,

636
00:37:34.161 --> 00:37:36.510
it's a beautiful car.
I need this Tiara.

637
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:41.150
TRT is that the testosterone therapy needed another prints in your life.

638
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.320
Praise is like shut your mouth at that Prius and stop talking about it.

639
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.070
Look at that Mustang bullet 2019.
It's like,

640
00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:49.880
you know the 50th anniversary of the movie or whatever the hell it is.
Yeah.

641
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.330
When was that movie?
40th 68 so yeah,
more than 50th.

642
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.620
Look at that man.
Whew.
Damn.

643
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.770
That's a car and it's a motherfucker of a car.
They,

644
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.920
they make great American cars right now.
Right now's a great time.

645
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.230
You know the two of them,
the old one,
the new one will allow,

646
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.380
can you know the great thing is,

647
00:38:08.381 --> 00:38:11.970
is the gas mileage on these cars isn't that bad anymore?

648
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:18.240
Yeah.
The,
they have intelligent computers running all of the,

649
00:38:18.241 --> 00:38:19.074
uh,

650
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.860
fuel injection and everything and it was the tune of the engines all done with

651
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:26.140
computers.
Now can I get one pro?
Come on.
Stop fucking around.
Yeah.

652
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.320
What are we going to get younger?
We're not,
you know,
it is,

653
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:32.670
it's the whole college thing.
But like fuck up near a talented comedian,
nick.

654
00:38:32.671 --> 00:38:35.710
Plenty of loot.
You're going to have spend money on the stupid Prius.

655
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:38.650
That thing is not free.
You have to pay for that thing.
Yeah.
Kidding.

656
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.120
God Damn Mustang.
How much one of those bullet mustangs trying to sell it.
Jamie,

657
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.480
why you think it's funny?
You know him,
right?
You know him,
right?

658
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:51.330
<v 2>Right.
I know you're right.
To how much is that the end of my life?
I'm no,
no,
no,</v>

659
00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:51.541
no.

660
00:38:51.541 --> 00:38:54.570
Now if it's in one of my kids now I'm saying at the end of my life when I look

661
00:38:54.571 --> 00:38:59.040
back,
I'm going to go,
oh my kid went to college.
Fuck him.
He can take a loan.

662
00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:03.420
Do you have the room for it in your driveway?
If you had a third car?
Uh,

663
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.760
we parked on the street.
I live in Venice.
46,000.
That's not much buddy.

664
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.500
That's a good deal.
Get that fucking thing.

665
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:14.430
He parked in the street set like a Kickstarter fund or something from my car.

666
00:39:14.431 --> 00:39:16.560
I think people would do that.
Um,
no.

667
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.540
They would say just do some gigs and put some money away.
You son of a bitch.

668
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.570
I know you fucking,
yeah,

669
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:29.580
<v 0>sell out places.
Shut the fuck up some dudes you just so frugal.</v>

670
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.610
I always find that so funny cause I'm such a slob

671
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.380
<v 2>but that's how we were when we started in Boston.</v>

672
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:39.750
Oh you were driving a fucking suicide,
a Celica gt or something that you are,

673
00:39:39.751 --> 00:39:43.360
it was a Mitsubishi story on,
it's like a little sporty liquor.

674
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:48.490
Yeah and you were leasing it and I was like who the fuck leases a new car when

675
00:39:48.731 --> 00:39:51.700
they've been doing comedy for two years and I had a fucking,

676
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.970
I had an 84 Volkswagen rabbit and and I just remember he had a fucking nice were

677
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.810
had a jacked up stereo system in it and I remember you got it got fucking

678
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:05.830
repossessed though.
That was a different card.
That was the dodge Daytona Shelby.

679
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.890
I got rid of the one that I got the second one.

680
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.520
And you didn't give a fuck or you went to the,

681
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.490
you went to the impound lot and you jumped the fence to get the radio out.
Right.

682
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.850
I had a stereo I put in it.
I installed the stereo,

683
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.350
I jumped the fence and pulled the fucking stereo out of the Daytona

684
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.960
because I knew I wasn't going to be able to pay for that fucking car anymore

685
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:29.800
cause it was okay.

686
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.980
<v 0>It was actually,
that was the first year of comedy.
That was my first year.</v>

687
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.020
I actually got that while I was still teaching and I was still,
um,

688
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:42.040
I taught,
I was teaching at Boston University.
I was teaching taekwondo there.

689
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:47.041
I was teaching at this school that I was running and revere and I was delivering

690
00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:50.380
newspapers.
So I was making a little bit of money and I was really stupid.

691
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.570
And when I found out that I could get a car,

692
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.780
like a brand new dodge Daytona Shelby in 1988 or 1989 and uh,

693
00:40:58.671 --> 00:41:02.290
I could,
I could lease it,
they would lease it to me,
is what I was like,
perfect,

694
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:03.040
let's do it.

695
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.900
But then somewhere along the line I had decided I was really going to dedicate

696
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:11.350
myself to stand up.
I was like,
I am,
I'm half asking this.

697
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.470
And some of the told me that one of the guys that I was doing open mic nights,

698
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.590
he said,
you know,
you were really funny and like six months ago,
but,
but he goes,

699
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.140
but it seems like you've fallen off a little.

700
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.550
And he said it to me and I didn't even respond.
I remember like,
fuck,
he's right.

701
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.140
He's right.
He's right.
I'm half ass in it.
And then that night I was like,

702
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:32.650
fuck this,
I'm quitting everything.
So I decided I was going to quit teaching.

703
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:37.630
I quit at Bu,
I quit teaching,
I school,
I shut my school down.

704
00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:42.950
I was like,
I'm done.
I gotta,
I gotta be a comic 100% and then I had no money.

705
00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:47.250
<v 1>So you just said,
so I lost the golf,
whatever.
I make them stand up at that.</v>

706
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:47.840
I was trying to get

707
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.490
<v 0>odd jobs during the day.
Yeah.</v>

708
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.760
But I couldn't have anything that I was dedicated to.
And when I was teaching,

709
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:55.550
I was very dedicated to teaching t it meant a lot to me.

710
00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:58.850
Like martial arts meant a lot to me.
So I'm technique means a lot to me.

711
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:02.770
So when I was teaching people,
it's very specific,
like admit a lot.
Yeah.

712
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.300
And I would teach people how to bring them to tournaments and you know,

713
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.340
I'd raised kids from like white belt all the way up to like blue belt and

714
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.310
brought him to tournaments and it was exciting.
It was really fun.

715
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.540
It meant a lot to me though.

716
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.000
It meant enough to me that I was not going to half ass it.
I was like,

717
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.940
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna have teach these people.

718
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.820
Cause when I was teaching I was very serious about it and meant a lot.

719
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:27.230
So I was like,
I'm not,
I got a,
I'm a,
I'm a coach.

720
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.990
Once I have a thing,
I'm like,
that's the thing.

721
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.060
All these other things just get in the way of the thing.

722
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.550
I have to just eliminate those.
And so that's what I did.

723
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.120
And then they took my fucking car,
but I got the stereo.

724
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.360
<v 1>Yeah.
He's like that.
I remember because,
uh,</v>

725
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:48.010
I was,
I was living with your girlfriend and you were coming over and night.

726
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.360
Fucking,
you'd come from like Cappuccinos,

727
00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:54.050
the restaurant around the corner with fucking take out like nice meals.

728
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:59.110
I was eating fucking ramen noodles.
Spent every penny.
I spent everything.

729
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.110
I didn't put anything away.

730
00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:03.860
Ever come from blockbuster with fucking five movies under your arm.

731
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.660
Yeah.
You were living with my girlfriend and another dude guy,

732
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.580
gay guy named Mike Mike Coconut,
who's a great guy.
He was a great dude.

733
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:17.750
He was the first guy I ever met who had a flux.
Oh,
no shit.
Yeah.

734
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.560
He was the first guy I met who was growing marijuana in his closet.
Oh Shit.

735
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:25.950
Lights.
That's dangerous in Boston,
the 80s right.
You'd go to jail.
Jail.
He grow.

736
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.380
He,
that was some skunk weed.
We sit around smoking that Skunk Weed Gel Gel

737
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.230
<v 0>for that.
Yeah.
Massachusetts 100% free now.
Hundred percent legal.</v>

738
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.200
Go to a store and buy it.
Yeah.
How fucking beautiful is that?

739
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.870
Illinois House passes marijuana legalization.

740
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:45.710
<v 1>Oh Wow.
Yes.
Two Pritzker.</v>

741
00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.370
I'm hoping that a governor to fuck.
Yeah,

742
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:49.480
<v 0>fuck yeah.</v>

743
00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.480
Legalize Illinois and get a gang of it out to the south side of Chicago.

744
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:59.430
Speaking of disenfranchised neighborhoods that are not going to fix themselves.

745
00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.210
That's another one.
There was five murders there last week.
It's crazy.

746
00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:05.230
<v 1>And the schools are so fucking bad.</v>

747
00:44:05.231 --> 00:44:10.231
There was this really good documentary called America is me and attracts a oak

748
00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:13.301
park,

749
00:44:13.301 --> 00:44:17.440
which is like a kind of a mixed suburb in Chicago where this black and white

750
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:22.441
students and they just track the lives of like 10 students and hit five black

751
00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:26.860
and five white and how they can be in the same place and have such different

752
00:44:26.861 --> 00:44:30.880
experiences.
You know,
black families where the fucking kid is stressed out.

753
00:44:30.881 --> 00:44:33.750
He's doing well in school and they're like,
the teacher's frustrated,

754
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:35.310
but he's like,
yeah,
his,

755
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.610
he's got a single mom and they just lost the apartment because she lost her job

756
00:44:38.611 --> 00:44:40.490
and now they're living with an aunt and you know,

757
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.110
there's all these circumstances going on.

758
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:47.850
And then you've got the white kids who are taking sat prep classes and they got

759
00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:52.260
a mom who's not working that drives them to their different sports.
Um,
it's a,

760
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.550
it's a great documentary.

761
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:55.510
<v 4>It's a different world.
That's,
I mean,</v>

762
00:44:55.511 --> 00:44:58.810
this is the same conversation we were having before the podcast started about

763
00:44:58.811 --> 00:45:01.750
this guy that we know that things that homeless people are lazy.
Yeah.

764
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.400
And we were like,
look,

765
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.870
there are people out there that were born on third base and they fucking swear

766
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:10.090
to God,
they hit a triple and they think,
Whoa,

767
00:45:10.091 --> 00:45:14.950
I fucking didn't have my shoes tied and I didn't do this and I missed out on

768
00:45:14.951 --> 00:45:19.780
birthday parties and I,
but nobody shot you.
Yeah.
You know,
nobody robbed you.
Your,

769
00:45:19.781 --> 00:45:23.020
your aunt,
uncle didn't rape you in jail.
You didn't,

770
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.110
you didn't watch your brother getting killed.
You know,
like,
oh come on man.

771
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.120
Like there's way worse hands that people get dealt way worse.

772
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:35.470
<v 1>And just the overall vague sense of entitlement.
Well,</v>

773
00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:38.740
am I saying on the other side of being surrounded by people that are not

774
00:45:38.741 --> 00:45:40.420
achieving and being,

775
00:45:40.421 --> 00:45:43.690
being exposed to people that don't think that finishing high school or college

776
00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:48.160
is a priority.
And so it's very hard to come up with that concept yourself.

777
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.460
Especially in the absence of like two functioning parents.

778
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:54.350
<v 4>The only thing that helps them now is the internet,
because you can,</v>

779
00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:57.710
you could lock onto like David Goggins or someone like that or someone who was

780
00:45:57.711 --> 00:46:00.350
also born into this terrible situations like that.

781
00:46:00.351 --> 00:46:03.920
And you can listen to his story and read his or listen to the audio book,

782
00:46:03.921 --> 00:46:04.820
which is fantastic.

783
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:10.010
Read as a book and understand there's people like him that used to be like me,

784
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.890
they made it through and now they have a story and I can do that too.

785
00:46:12.891 --> 00:46:15.110
It's possible.
And then that becomes your guiding light.

786
00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.380
But the idea that we're all on the same fucking starting block,

787
00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:21.440
it's just stupid as fuck.
Yeah,
it's stupid.
It's stupid.

788
00:46:21.441 --> 00:46:23.060
It's a bad way to look at the world.

789
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.920
And when people get upset at,

790
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.640
you know,
certain aspects of life without acknowledging that.

791
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.450
<v 1>Yeah.
And then you've got people that live in abandoned factory towns,</v>

792
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:39.350
whether it's,
you know,
in the Appalachias or it's in,
you know,

793
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:43.710
Detroit where you had jobs and your grandfather had a job and that was it.

794
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:44.521
And it was just a,

795
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:48.840
it was like there was no diversity of work in that area.

796
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:52.780
And then the fucking plant closes and it's just despair.
I have a

797
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:57.520
<v 4>good friend and his family is from coal miners and uh,
I mean he,</v>

798
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.960
the way he describes it,
he's like,

799
00:46:58.961 --> 00:47:00.940
you have never seen that kind of poverty before.

800
00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:04.120
You've never seen that kind of poverty when you're in these coal towns.

801
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:08.950
And people just all fucked up on pills.
Like the whole town's fucked up on pills.

802
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.610
I was like,
you haven't seen poverty like that.
It's dark.

803
00:47:12.611 --> 00:47:15.490
And then there's despair and there's no exit strategy.
No one,

804
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.090
there's no one to model around you.
No one,
no one's there to give you advise.

805
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.690
Everyone's a criminal.
Everyone's trying to get by everyone's selling pills,

806
00:47:22.691 --> 00:47:26.950
robbing people,
shooting people.
And this is just a segment.

807
00:47:26.951 --> 00:47:29.770
This is just what happens with despair.
Right?

808
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.920
<v 2>And this is just despair in that,
in that context.
Then,</v>

809
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.940
then there's despair in south central La.

810
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.910
Just despair in east la does despair and you know,

811
00:47:39.911 --> 00:47:42.370
really fucked up Mexican neighborhoods in La.
Well,

812
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:45.500
that's why we were talking about,
I think you had a guest on that,

813
00:47:45.501 --> 00:47:49.840
talked about how with how everything's getting ro robots are taking over.

814
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:51.370
That's the book by and Yang.

815
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:53.710
It was probably the presidential candidate talking about how they're going to

816
00:47:53.711 --> 00:47:57.400
subsidize the,
uh,
the,
the whole populations.
Yes.

817
00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.180
He's probably universal basic income with that,
you know,

818
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:03.190
it sounds like it may happen that that type of a system,

819
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.090
but there's still going to be despair because you still need a sense of purpose.

820
00:48:07.091 --> 00:48:10.330
You still need to work and feel good about yourself.

821
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.610
<v 4>That's the counter to that.
Yeah,
and I agree with both things.
Unfortunately.</v>

822
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
It's like I agree that most likely automation is going to take over.

823
00:48:20.641 --> 00:48:24.420
Here's the thing,
when,
when people need purpose,
they still need purpose.

824
00:48:24.421 --> 00:48:25.410
They need purpose now,

825
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:30.770
but would $1,000 a month if everyone knew they had $1,000 a month coming from

826
00:48:32.251 --> 00:48:35.280
the government,
would it make you more invested in being an American?

827
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.700
Would it make you more invested in keeping this thing running?
Like you're,

828
00:48:38.701 --> 00:48:39.930
you're actually getting paid from it.

829
00:48:39.931 --> 00:48:42.300
You're looking at America like it's generating income.

830
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.950
And you're getting paid from it.

831
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:47.490
You're getting enough money so you can eat and have a roof over your head.

832
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.420
Like if the three of us got $1,000 a month,
that's $3,000 a month.

833
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.370
There's a place we could get with the three of us.

834
00:48:53.371 --> 00:48:56.790
It was like 1500 bucks a month and then the rest of it we would just put into

835
00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.620
food and whatever,
and that's,
we could live hookers.
You would live like that.

836
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:01.951
That's a,

837
00:49:01.951 --> 00:49:06.060
that's a livable wage for enough if you get enough people to get $1,000 a month.

838
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.780
<v 2>So the question is how does it make you feel about yourself and about your</v>

839
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:11.340
country?

840
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.260
<v 4>But the,
yeah,
and this is the question too,</v>

841
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.750
does that stop you from pursuing your dreams?

842
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.910
Because it's not like you're getting 50 grand a year.

843
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.820
Like if you were getting 50 grand a year,
like man,

844
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.630
be hard to get me to work if I just had free 50 grand every year.

845
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.290
Like how much do you do you really need,
if you have an apartment,

846
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.260
like it's not easy.
I know folks that are making 50 grand,
I'm like,
Hey,
you know,

847
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:34.200
you'd be surprised.
You don't really save much.
And you know,
once you,

848
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.800
if you have a car and a lease and a either a mortgage or an apartment payment,

849
00:49:37.801 --> 00:49:40.860
I get it,
I get it.
But if you had 50 grand a year,

850
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:43.170
it'd be really hard for you to grind.

851
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:48.350
It'd be really hard for you to really go after something.

852
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.140
Just be obsessed.
Unless that's just your style,

853
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:54.810
<v 2>that's just who you are.
Well,
it seems like,
um,</v>

854
00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:59.850
I dunno if it's more manageable way is just socialize medicine and make higher

855
00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:00.870
education Frey.

856
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.730
<v 4>I think both those things are imperative.
I really do.</v>

857
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:06.790
I think especially education.
Why would it cost?

858
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.820
Why should it cost money to figure out how to make people more intelligent and

859
00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:12.880
contribute better?

860
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:17.230
Why wouldn't you want less losers when you want more educated people that have a

861
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:18.820
better understanding of how the world works?

862
00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.900
<v 2>Especially since we're a service economy,</v>

863
00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.960
we're not a manufacturing economy anymore.

864
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:27.970
We need people that understand how to manage and to be entrepreneurial and you

865
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.670
<v 1>know,
yes.</v>

866
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:31.680
<v 0>Communicate well.
Just be educated.
I mean,</v>

867
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.100
if there's more people that are smarter than you,

868
00:50:34.101 --> 00:50:36.590
have more competition than you have more productivity.

869
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:40.040
They mean it would just be better for everybody.
You don't want ignorant people.

870
00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.080
Yeah.
Want education?

871
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.400
<v 1>My son's going to college.
It's fucking $65,000 a year.</v>

872
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.990
That's so much times four years time.
So kids that $600,000 a year,

873
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.000
what?
American's got an extra six.

874
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:57.710
So your kid is now saddled with a debt that he'll be paying off forever.

875
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:58.910
He's underwater.

876
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.380
<v 0>$600,000 a year.</v>

877
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:05.530
You're saying $65,000 a year in two kids be five 70 180,000 you mean 60 you mean

878
00:51:07.191 --> 00:51:11.810
forever?
Yeah,
for four years.
For four years time.
Two kids like 650 grand a year.

879
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:16.410
I was like 600 total over over the course of their college careers.
Yeah.

880
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.330
Your base.
And you have to make more than a million to have that by the way.
Yeah.

881
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.130
Cause you gotta pay taxes.
Yeah.

882
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:26.210
And you're not just only spending money on that.

883
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:30.410
You've got to spend money on living expenses and your mortgage and your house so

884
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:35.240
that you know you're really talking about 2 million probably

885
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.590
<v 1>and and don't think your kids coming out of college into a job that's going to</v>

886
00:51:38.591 --> 00:51:39.790
be able to support himself.

887
00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.810
You're still going to be subsidizing their phone in their car insurance and

888
00:51:43.811 --> 00:51:46.690
probably part of their rent for the next five,
six years after that

889
00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.150
<v 0>they come to visit.
Yeah,</v>

890
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:51.660
and if you're thinking about that over over these four years that you really,

891
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:55.170
if you want a hundred grand you kind of have to make 200

892
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:58.130
<v 1>and then you got insurance.</v>

893
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.390
If you're on the market as a family of four to get health insurance in

894
00:52:02.391 --> 00:52:02.991
California,

895
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:07.550
you're paying $20,000 a year between 15 and $20,000 a year,

896
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.350
which means again you got to earn 40

897
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.490
<v 0>a lot of people are moving out of California because of state tax.</v>

898
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:18.100
A lot of people realize,
you know,
I can live in Nevada and not pay any state tax.

899
00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:23.110
Yeah.
Why would I want to pay state docs?
What am I doing?
That's a lot of money.

900
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.380
It is like a 10% right.
Yeah.
And then if you live in New York City,

901
00:52:26.381 --> 00:52:29.200
you have to pay a stain in a city tax.
Oh,

902
00:52:29.201 --> 00:52:33.310
you dirty bitch fat fucking city tax is that to keep the rats,

903
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.370
<v 1>that's to keep the electricity going for the guys that are taking the train in</v>

904
00:52:36.371 --> 00:52:39.550
from Connecticut every day and working on Wall Street that aren't paying the

905
00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:40.390
fucking city tax

906
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:43.090
<v 0>fucking communists.
Yeah.</v>

907
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.810
The people don't pay the city tax or dirty yup.

908
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:50.820
To work in the city and they don't pay the tax.
Right.
Most pay the tax those uh,

909
00:52:50.821 --> 00:52:55.720
states in Connecticut.
Yeah.
Those Weird Solis.

910
00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.030
Gigantic,
great Gatsby like estates,
Darien,

911
00:53:01.031 --> 00:53:04.060
Connecticut,
and they've all got fucking Ferrari's.

912
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.290
A buddy my watch on ice transmissions buddy might work.

913
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.330
So high school in Connecticut where all these rich kids go to school.

914
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.020
He works there.
Shout out to my boy Tommy Jr.
Yeah.

915
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.050
He works there and sees these people,

916
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:22.150
these giant fucking huge lawns and talking about buying a place there.

917
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.810
<v 1>I want a big line.
I want to be</v>

918
00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:28.510
<v 2>Kennedy.</v>

919
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:32.410
I'd like to live next to a bunch of people that are on pills out of her fucking

920
00:53:32.411 --> 00:53:36.310
mind.
Trying to make meaning out of life.
$3 billion in the bank.

921
00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:41.380
I want people whose heads had been reshaped by a guy in Indianapolis.
Yeah.

922
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.850
If you have a flat head though,

923
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.190
there's some girls don't want to fuck a dude with the flow.

924
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:49.630
I'm going to shave my head,
but it's not going to let us fly.
I get a bad head.

925
00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:54.580
You're fine.
I'm to turn sideways.
Pasty white dude.
Shave your failure.
Yeah.

926
00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.630
We'll show you what it tomorrow.

927
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.450
Do we have the clippers from the town board right now?
Do we really?

928
00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.210
Are they over there?
Have they charged up?
Probably.

929
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.560
If it only went halfway and then cut off,
you should have that.

930
00:54:05.561 --> 00:54:08.740
That should be your new look like criss cross one of these to have their clothes

931
00:54:08.741 --> 00:54:11.320
on backwards.
He shaved half the side of your head,

932
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:16.410
shaved one side and leave the other side and people like what is going on?

933
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.870
You're like,
fuck you.
I'm handicap.
Look at my head.
Yeah.

934
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:24.670
<v 1>Half the crowd.
I'm doing bald jokes for half the crowd.
The other half.</v>

935
00:54:24.671 --> 00:54:29.330
Are you doing like going bald jokes?
Dude,

936
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:34.090
I had Ari Shaffir on my podcast one time and uh,
we were at you ever,

937
00:54:34.091 --> 00:54:37.630
you ever do a podcast and the above the comedy cellar,
they've got a studio up,

938
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:42.430
dammit.
Bobby Kelly started it and it's a,
I forget what it's called.
And um,

939
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:46.270
so I'm up there doing my podcast with Ari and it's an apartment.
It's like,

940
00:54:46.271 --> 00:54:49.120
does a,
does a bedroom and a bathroom and in the studio.

941
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:55.180
And we got to talking about torture.
And I go,
uh,
I go,

942
00:54:55.181 --> 00:54:58.390
you ever been waterboarded?
He's like,
no,
I go,

943
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.710
this is a bathroom right here I go,
you want to,

944
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:05.350
you want me to waterboard you and you know Ari's like,
Yep,
sure,
Yep,
sure,

945
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.130
let's do it.

946
00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:10.030
So we go inside and I put a towel over his face and he leans over backwards and

947
00:55:10.031 --> 00:55:12.310
his head is below his body in the shower stall.

948
00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:17.340
The nozzle comes off the wall and I spray down his face and uh,

949
00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.340
nothing,
nothing,
nothing.
And then all of a sudden his bodies convulsing,

950
00:55:21.341 --> 00:55:25.450
his legs are kicking,
he's fucking screaming,
water is shooting out of his nose.

951
00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:30.660
He's choking and it went on for like a couple of minutes and I'm fucking dying.

952
00:55:31.331 --> 00:55:35.800
And then he starts laughing and we were just on the podcast laughing without

953
00:55:35.801 --> 00:55:38.620
saying a word for probably five minutes.
And then he goes,

954
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.430
well I'm going to do it to you.
I'm like,
fuck yeah.

955
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:48.650
<v 2>He waterboarded me in the same thing happened.
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

956
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.380
Waterboarding's legit.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
You can't,

957
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:55.100
that's real torture.
Yeah.

958
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:59.600
But it's weird torture cause you're not permanently injuring someone.

959
00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.620
Like can you think of towards,
you think of like someone cutting someone,

960
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.790
lighting them on fire,
Shit like that.

961
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:07.970
What's the torture you would least want to be done to you?

962
00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.960
That's a good question.
Maybe that one.
Maybe waterboarding.
I Dunno.

963
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:16.940
I got like electrocution.
They electrocute you.

964
00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.470
Ozarks.
Spoiler alert.
Oh yeah.
Don't say nothing.
Yeah.
I think,

965
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:24.460
I think being made to be cold

966
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.350
<v 1>for long periods,
I'm cold and knows.</v>

967
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.510
They say no sleep is actually the worst thing you can

968
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.780
<v 2>do to somebody's Chinese water torture.
They just have the water drip on you.</v>

969
00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:36.460
Yeah.
Just keeps you awake.
Trip days trip.
Yeah.
That's a good tip.

970
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:39.460
If you ever fallen asleep while you're driving folks,
get a,

971
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:44.550
if you stop at a gas station and get like a soda or a water and some ice and

972
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:46.300
then get like wet towel,

973
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:49.660
get a wet towel with ice in it and just rub your face.

974
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.140
Cause I used to smack myself in the face when I was coming back from gigs.
Yeah.

975
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:56.600
And I'd be driving on the mass pike and a smack in the face.

976
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.800
Just sticking my head out the window.
You know,

977
00:56:59.801 --> 00:57:01.930
just trying to stay away because you're,

978
00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.880
you just something about the hypnotic white lines.
Just dude,

979
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.400
I used to fucking locked on.

980
00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:10.560
<v 1>I used to drive from Boston to New York like once a week for like a year and a</v>

981
00:57:10.561 --> 00:57:11.820
half.
I had a,

982
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.720
I had a place I could crash in the city and I'd finished my gigs on Saturday

983
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.770
night.
I'd be at the fucking Worcester Heloc,
the show.
It ended like,
you know,

984
00:57:19.771 --> 00:57:22.800
midnight and I'd get my car and I'd drive the three,

985
00:57:22.801 --> 00:57:27.801
three and a half hours to the city and I regularly slept while driving and then

986
00:57:30.871 --> 00:57:34.080
snapped out of it.
Like how fucking crazy is that?

987
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:39.230
I once wrecked the car,
I fell asleep on the,
on the highway once I will you,

988
00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:41.850
I was in college and uh,

989
00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:45.900
I had to go down to providence for a court date.

990
00:57:45.901 --> 00:57:48.860
I got into a fight in providence and I got arrested,

991
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:52.170
spent the weekend in jail and I had to come back for the court appearance.

992
00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:56.700
So I borrowed my ex girlfriend's car and I'd been up the night before,

993
00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:01.770
all night drinking.
And so I drove down and uh,

994
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.090
I did the court appearance,

995
00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:08.120
got out of it and I'm driving home and I'm on 95 north and

996
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:13.480
<v 2>I just fucking fell asleep and I hit the guardrail,
spun out and hit a truck.</v>

997
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:14.410
Oh my God.

998
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:18.440
<v 1>And thank God I got,
um,
I cut my mouth.</v>

999
00:58:18.441 --> 00:58:19.880
I hit my mouth on the steering wheel.

1000
00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.810
<v 2>This is why we,
no airbags,
no airbags,
no,
it was old Toyota Corolla.</v>

1001
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:29.060
Fucking total.
The car.
Oh,
my ex girlfriend's car.
Oh No.
Yeah.

1002
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:33.250
Oh,
she feel she was all right with it.
She was all right with it.
She's alive.

1003
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:37.460
She was a great girl.
Oh yeah.
Cindy Murtha shout out to Cindy.

1004
00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.740
So you probably were relieved because of the court date,
right?

1005
00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:46.400
Yeah.
You relieved.
Oh,
got off.
Can't believe he got off.
Right.

1006
00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:51.080
And then drive them back.
Bang.
Fuck.

1007
00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:55.820
What a feeling,
man.
You talk about adrenaline rushing into your body that second.

1008
00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.770
It can't get no more intense than that.

1009
00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.810
Cause I knew from high school died that way.
Oh No.

1010
00:58:59.811 --> 00:59:03.890
Shit really hit like the underside of the bridge.

1011
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:10.190
Damn.
If he was asleep or he was drinking asleep,
fell asleep.

1012
00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:14.210
Damn.
Yeah.
Happens all the time,
man.

1013
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.960
<v 1>My father,
he was a,</v>

1014
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:21.080
my father was a big drinker and he was driving home drunk one time and uh,

1015
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.990
my mom was following him and another car,

1016
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:29.170
that's how complicit alcoholism was back in the 70s wives were just like,

1017
00:59:29.721 --> 00:59:32.750
all right honey,
I'll follow you because you're drunk.
Oh my God.

1018
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.620
And so he's driving and he falls asleep at the wheel and he goes head first into

1019
00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:41.090
a tree.
Oh,
Jesus cuts his jugular vein and his arm,

1020
00:59:41.091 --> 00:59:44.300
the veins in his arm.
My mom drives to get an ambulance.

1021
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.390
Know there's no cell phones.
They come by the time they get there,

1022
00:59:47.391 --> 00:59:49.880
he has no vital signs.
He's fucking dead.

1023
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.080
And they brought him back to life and he was in the hospital for like two weeks.

1024
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:57.560
Whoa.
Are they bringing back to life?
I have no fucking idea.
I was like,

1025
00:59:57.561 --> 01:00:02.560
I was like five.
I was like four or five and what does that,

1026
01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.950
they have some stuff.
They set us up.
Yeah.
They really look your guy here,
right?

1027
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:10.590
<v 0>Pet cemetery injection.
Bring it back.
That's right.</v>

1028
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:15.110
Bring 'em back.
Spike and I didn't see the new pet cemetery.
I heard it was a,

1029
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:20.240
yeah.
Who was that based on the Stephen King Book.
Yeah,
the book is Great.
Yeah,

1030
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:24.230
the movie,
the first movie was all right.
Who's all right?
They're fun.

1031
01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.250
They're there.
Campy.

1032
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:29.110
The difference between his books in his movies though are so profound because

1033
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.230
books are terrifying.

1034
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:35.590
Is books like get to the heart of the worst aspects of human nature and right.

1035
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.930
Demonic possession to want maximum overdrive would be a great one to remake.

1036
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.700
Now fucking robots are and yeah.
Shame takes over and kills everyone.

1037
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:48.380
Yeah.
No Shit.
Right?
Yeah.
They have it like with modern electric trucks and shit.

1038
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:52.430
Yeah.
The shining was the only one that was as scary as the book.

1039
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:56.570
What was different?
Very different than the book does the show,
was it?
Yeah.

1040
01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.490
I read the book,
the,
the Shining,

1041
01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:02.690
the movie with Jack Nicholson apparently bothered Stephen King because Jack

1042
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:05.060
Nicholson was like on edge from the beginning of the movie.

1043
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.120
Like he was always crazy.
Like,
he was always like,
you know,

1044
01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:12.560
he's always just kind of barely fucking hanging on.
Yeah.
You know,

1045
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:15.110
that was his whole thing.
Right.
In the book.

1046
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.160
The guy clearly becomes mad.
He becomes possessed.

1047
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:22.040
He's a normal guy who's just struggling and trying to be a writer and he uses

1048
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:25.290
this as an opportunity to write and then the house takes them over.
Right.

1049
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.600
It's more sort of an arc.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
well,
this is nothing you can do.

1050
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.850
I Tim getting pumped up for the scene.
Oh yeah.

1051
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:40.790
Didn't fire it up.
Look at them.
Yeah.
Is that Kubrick?
Yeah.

1052
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:44.990
Yeah,
yeah.
Cute.
He doesn't want you to killed by a fucking axe.

1053
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.070
Axe Willing Jack next.

1054
01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.840
<v 1>Hold on.
Yeah,
I could see that once Kubrick takes over a year.</v>

1055
01:01:48.841 --> 01:01:51.150
Now you're not going to have a lot of say in how the thing is direct.

1056
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.400
<v 0>Well not only that,
Kubrick put all this moon landing stuff in it.</v>

1057
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.580
There was all these moon references.
Yeah.

1058
01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:02.210
The kid had an Apollo sweater on like there was,
there's,

1059
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.240
there's someone made a documentary that was all the numbers and all the co,

1060
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.790
all the things that are attached to that movie room to 37.

1061
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:18.320
That's what it's about because it's 237,000 miles to the moon when they uh,

1062
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.840
made the launch,
sees,
got USA Apollo sweater on the little boy he did.

1063
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.320
There's a bunch of things.
Yeah,

1064
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:29.330
there's a ton of things that Kubrick did on purpose cause he would put weird

1065
01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:33.060
stuff like that in his movies.
He's a fascinating guy,
man.

1066
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:36.930
Do you know he was like a high level math petition.
No,
Shit.
Yeah.

1067
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:40.800
He would do high level mathematics for fun while he wasn't doing movies.

1068
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:43.290
Wow.
Yeah.

1069
01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:48.150
They had an exhibit at Lacma in La ever that Stanley Kubrick exhibit for like

1070
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:51.450
six months.
It was fucking wild.
That plays should be flattened.

1071
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.790
They should take all the homeless people and move them there.

1072
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:57.960
That places the most,
the biggest abomination of all of Los Angeles.
I went there.

1073
01:02:57.961 --> 01:03:01.270
There's a clear plastic box that was a,
yeah,

1074
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:04.890
like this boxes are hurt.
It's like,
this is art.
This is art.

1075
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:08.760
It's our space and me,
this box and this is our art.
Like what?

1076
01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.860
Like do they have it roped off so you don't sit on the box?

1077
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.640
It's like a plexiglass box.
Like get the fuck out of my face with this.

1078
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:15.773
You know what you're doing.

1079
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:19.080
Another piece of art was like people throwing basketballs in the net.

1080
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:22.910
There was like like videos of basketballs like over and over and over again to

1081
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:27.210
throwing basketballs.
I'm like,
Hey,
hey,
hey,
fuck you.
Fuck you.

1082
01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:31.050
I know what you're doing.
Yeah,
I know what you're doing.
You don't,
this isn't art.

1083
01:03:31.051 --> 01:03:33.240
You know,
this is not art.
You know,

1084
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:36.000
and there was some art there when there was some of that stuff.

1085
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:38.030
There's some things you're like,
hey,
fuck you with this box.

1086
01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.700
I know what you're doing and you get paid for this.
Who's paying you?

1087
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.860
Is this tax payer funded,
isn't it?
There's the LACMA.
Yes.

1088
01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.450
<v 6>Yeah.
They probably have to pay the people to rent their art burrow.</v>

1089
01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:52.700
The fucking real estate they're living in.
Yeah.

1090
01:03:52.701 --> 01:03:53.900
I heard something recently about museum.

1091
01:03:53.901 --> 01:03:58.901
Is that only something like 7% like most collections or what you see there's so

1092
01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:03.320
much stuff in storage like cool shit that people might want to see that there's

1093
01:04:03.321 --> 01:04:05.920
not room for because the buildings aren't big enough.
Really good.

1094
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:07.790
Lots of instruments.
For instance,

1095
01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:13.060
300 year old violins get used by like kids because it's a cheaper to just keep

1096
01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:17.780
them in use and send them around than it is to just store it and hope like

1097
01:04:17.781 --> 01:04:18.230
restored.

1098
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:22.160
Eventually like after it's unused for 25 30 years because of all the old horse

1099
01:04:22.161 --> 01:04:24.320
hair or whatever is that used to make each thing.

1100
01:04:24.321 --> 01:04:28.760
But there's really cool art by Pied de Vinci or who knows what's hidden in some

1101
01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:31.550
of these places.
But people that work there know and get to see some of it.

1102
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:36.090
<v 0>You know what's interesting to me?
People that buy dinosaur skeletons,</v>

1103
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.850
apparently there's a giant market for them in China.

1104
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:43.980
They'll spend like a million dollars and buy a dinosaur skeleton that you walk

1105
01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:48.120
in this motherfucker's house.
Fuck your artwork,
bitch.
Pretty bad ass.

1106
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:52.350
Damn t rex in my little that you imagine.
Yeah.
He walked into some,

1107
01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:54.450
some guys palace,

1108
01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:59.451
some Emerald Palace and you open these two fucking teak wood doors and you see a

1109
01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:02.400
dinosaur in the middle of his front entrance.

1110
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.220
That's what they're going for.
So they're buying these nothing.

1111
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:10.500
Nicolas Cage returned stolen Mongolian dinosaur skull.
He bought at gallery

1112
01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.910
tyranosaurs.
What does that mean?
Animal tyranosaurs bat?

1113
01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:21.040
Have you heard of that now?
T a r will,
it will be repatriated.
Ah,

1114
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:21.903
I like that word.

1115
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:27.030
After it was bought by the actor from Beverly Hills Gallery in 2007 a t rex go,

1116
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:29.770
wow.
What?

1117
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:34.070
He bought it for $276,000 that's pretty good deal.
Well,

1118
01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.680
I was 2007 I think he said.
Yeah,
she wasn't worth as much back then,
man.

1119
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.450
Now nothing stops you in your tracks.

1120
01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:44.770
And Like Museum of natural history is a good fucking dinosaur skeleton.

1121
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.260
Especially the ones that eat things like eat meat.

1122
01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.550
I don't want that big ass stupid plan.
Eaton Brontosaurus kid.
That bitch.

1123
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.580
I'm like,
yes.
That's a weird elephant.
He's a fucking Vegan.

1124
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:57.070
Who wants to hang out with a Vegan at?
I'm out of here.
I'm not scared.

1125
01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:00.790
I want to see teeth.
Let me see teeth and claws.

1126
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:05.470
What's Shit design?
Huh?
Giant head.
A little tiny baby arms.
Yeah,

1127
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:08.080
we'll shit design.
Like what is he doing with those arms?

1128
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.270
What the fuck is the purpose of those arms?

1129
01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:15.880
And this is the only animal that I can think of that developed that way.

1130
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:21.340
And was that a,
was he a plant eater?
No.
T rex.
T rex.

1131
01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.230
Yeah.
[inaudible].
They,

1132
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:28.090
they don't know if t rex was a predator or if t rex was a scavenger.

1133
01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.410
They think by the shape.

1134
01:06:29.411 --> 01:06:33.550
There's some talk that by the shape of his bones than what he might've been

1135
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:37.000
doing was using those bones to crush giant dinosaur bones.

1136
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:41.310
And that like he might be surviving on,
on dead things.
Yeah.

1137
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.990
And that they also had some speculation that they might've had their,

1138
01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.080
they don't want to know what they really looked like because they don't know the

1139
01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:47.914
skin color.

1140
01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:52.210
They had some speculation that they might've had faces like vultures,

1141
01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:57.211
like red fucked up really brightly colored faces just to let you know they're

1142
01:06:57.671 --> 01:07:01.180
disgusting and they're hitting,
you know,
cause like when you see vultures,

1143
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.710
it's not a coincidence that there the grossest fucking looking animal on the

1144
01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:06.250
planet.

1145
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:10.900
All they eat is dead shit in their big vultures are fucking big.

1146
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.440
That's a big animal flopping around with these giant wings.

1147
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.500
But we're not nearly as impressed by them as we are with an eagle.

1148
01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:21.060
And you see like the vultures never going to be the fucking national bird get

1149
01:07:21.061 --> 01:07:22.090
out of here with that bullshit.

1150
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.240
We killed ourselves bro when I went out here for sale scavenger as fucked up,

1151
01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:32.260
red faced stupid bird Smithsonian.
I think it opened some of the 8th of June.

1152
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:34.570
Just start.
They have this brand new deep time.

1153
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.870
Oh that's the Irish elk natural history.
A dinosaur exhibit.

1154
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.850
And this is some of the highlights of what they have there.

1155
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:44.060
They have this like t rex.
Wow.
Triceratops.
Yeah.
Jeez.

1156
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:49.270
Irish elk,
saber tooth cat.
Bunch of cool stuff.
Like you're just talking about it.

1157
01:07:49.271 --> 01:07:52.080
So I'm sure they might have some of these answers to the questions.

1158
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:56.740
And this is a where at which DC Smithsonian natural.
Yes.
When's this come out?

1159
01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:58.720
It's opening now.

1160
01:07:58.721 --> 01:08:02.410
It's like they just built it and it just doing all the press seems pretty cool.

1161
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.590
Yeah,
I mean who owns the dinosaur skeletons?
Who owns that?

1162
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.430
At the Smithsonian I think is,
it's free because it's US taxes.

1163
01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:12.080
So some of this stuff,
I guess we technically own,
I guess I don't,

1164
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.550
I don't see DC or New York.
One of them doesn't.
For any of the museums.

1165
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:20.360
I think it might be DC.
Smithsonian stuff was all free or when it's open,

1166
01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:21.194
it should be free.

1167
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:25.490
My friend John Dudley knows a dude who owns a ranch in Montana and they found a

1168
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:28.670
t rex on his property.
No Shit.
Wow.

1169
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:32.540
Found a bone out there moving around stuff on his property.
Look,

1170
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.270
what the fuck is this?
So it's cleaning it up.
Find something,

1171
01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:40.100
brings in some paleontologists.
They start digging and they're like,
Whoa,

1172
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:44.740
Daddy.
Yeah,
we've got a t rex here.
Alright.
Yeah,
he,
yeah,
that's it.

1173
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.700
That's a fucking job.
People get obsessed with that and they go,
I'm going to,

1174
01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:49.670
I'm going to be an archeologist when I get older,

1175
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:54.671
and then you're standing in a fucking desert with a toothbrush for eight hours a

1176
01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:58.320
day trying to find a bone fudge.

1177
01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.110
That Dude Sam,
the guy's name from a Sam O'neil,
Sam Neill,

1178
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.100
Sam Neill,
Sam Neil from Jurassic Park.
Yeah.
Nobody wants to be him.

1179
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.320
Everybody wants to be.
Jeff Goldbloom.
God shows up with a sexy jacket and says,

1180
01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:15.410
um,
life finds a way.
Oh,
it appears,

1181
01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:19.550
appears of lifelines away.
World's biggest t rex discovered Jesus Christ.

1182
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:23.470
What does this estimated 19,500 pounds?

1183
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.720
[inaudible] Holy Shit.

1184
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.270
Holy Shit.
And what can those arms even do?
Look at those dams are weird,
man.

1185
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.650
They're so weird.
And look how big the feet and legs are and the giant ass head.

1186
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.090
That's the thing that thinking like that this wasn't something that chase things

1187
01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:45.860
down.
It just sort of bent over and just jacked whatever was on the ground.
Yeah,

1188
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:51.230
but I don't know if that's like a,
I think there was some speculation we,

1189
01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:55.190
we should Google this because there was something about the physics of its body

1190
01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.710
that it wouldn't be able to run fast because it's so weirdly shaped.

1191
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.110
They like trying to figure out why is its head so big.

1192
01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:06.660
It has a little tiny ass arms and these big ass legs,
this big fucking tail.

1193
01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:08.810
It can that thing run like what,
what?

1194
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.380
And then there's also some speculation that the atmosphere was way different

1195
01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:16.940
back then
and the atmosphere is what's more oxygen rich.

1196
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.150
Maybe things just were different,

1197
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:22.880
you know like the physic could run longer and faster.

1198
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.520
Maybe even the physics of earth was a little different in terms of like a,

1199
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:31.310
the way we interacted with the gravity.
We interacted with the atmosphere rather.

1200
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.660
Yeah.
The atmosphere like held him up somehow or another.
Like it was thicker.

1201
01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.990
But I read things that I'm high and I don't remember what the fuck.

1202
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.940
I think this is just saying that it could,

1203
01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:44.090
it should have been slower maybe than like they're shown in the drastic park.

1204
01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:47.060
It wouldn't have been running that for here it says running would have broken

1205
01:10:47.061 --> 01:10:49.580
and adult time ran a source,
wrecks his legs.

1206
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.290
See that don't but go,
okay Google this cause.

1207
01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:58.460
So now we know that there's people that think that he couldn't run because of

1208
01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:00.260
the shape.
Google,

1209
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:05.810
the atmosphere was different during the Jurassic period

1210
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:10.310
because there was some,
I mean it might've been horse shit.

1211
01:11:10.311 --> 01:11:13.980
It was just an article that was written about how like we have to take into

1212
01:11:13.981 --> 01:11:18.120
account the whole world was like different before that giant asteroid came and

1213
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:22.990
fucked up everything and slammed into Cheech needs Eatsa,
you know that uh,

1214
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:28.490
<v 6>the oxygen levels might have been about 20 to 30% higher during that time
period.</v>

1215
01:11:28.491 --> 01:11:32.030
So like it might've been harder to breathe,
I guess.
I'm not sure.

1216
01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:36.410
Hard to debrief a sudden drop in oxygen from roughly 30% of the atmosphere of

1217
01:11:36.411 --> 01:11:39.440
the atmosphere to about 10% may have contributed to mass extinctions.

1218
01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:41.510
<v 0>Oh.
So from the impact,
the dinosaurs.</v>

1219
01:11:41.511 --> 01:11:43.180
So that was one of the things they thought killed.

1220
01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:46.370
There's a bunch of different ideas that they have of how quickly the dinosaurs

1221
01:11:46.371 --> 01:11:47.204
died off.

1222
01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.930
But one of the more interesting ones that I saw recently was that they all died

1223
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:52.100
almost instantly.

1224
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:53.190
<v 6>It says it would've made it,</v>

1225
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.880
he more humid with higher levels of carbon dioxide and more likely more cloud

1226
01:11:56.881 --> 01:12:01.880
cover.
Hmm.
It just,
it's gasping for breath harder.
I just keep seeing that stuff.

1227
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.390
It's just harder

1228
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:03.201
<v 0>breathe during that.
Yeah.</v>

1229
01:12:03.201 --> 01:12:05.480
That doesn't have anything to do with the way they moved though.

1230
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.800
There was something about,

1231
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.170
I remember reading something about the way a t rex moved,

1232
01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:12.380
but it's a fucking mystery cause it's not like you look at a crocodile,

1233
01:12:12.381 --> 01:12:16.250
you're like,
oh,
I get it.
Uses those four legs to get you with this big fat face.

1234
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:18.800
You know?
It makes sense.
Then you look at a t rex like,

1235
01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:21.110
why are you up in the air like that?
Why is your head so big?

1236
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.110
What's with the little legs?
The ones in the front,
one of those things.

1237
01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.570
What's the,
the arms.
What's up with this weird body?

1238
01:12:26.571 --> 01:12:30.860
You have the weight of that head.
Is He large,
giant head?
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1239
01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:34.490
He needs to go to Indianapolis.
Get that thing fucking shake down is an insult.

1240
01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:39.110
Maybe that's why some mad
kept.
Fuck.
How did they follow the fuck?

1241
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:42.530
How do they fuck Jesus Christ with that tail?

1242
01:12:42.531 --> 01:12:45.900
How do you get at the Pussy with that tail?
That's a crazy ass tail.

1243
01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.100
You'd have to come at it from the side.
You'd have to tackle her.

1244
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:52.670
You don't have to blind cider.
Tackle her.
Get a leg up in the air,

1245
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:56.960
get in like that.
You'd have to get one of them.
But then what the fuck?

1246
01:12:56.961 --> 01:13:01.961
You have no arms now she can get away and job t rex tiny arms may have been

1247
01:13:02.571 --> 01:13:06.440
vicious weapons.
Save it.
Nerd.
Save it.
Nerd.

1248
01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.870
What?
Like unlike his fucking giant face filled with huge swords,

1249
01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.900
he's got a huge head filled with swords.

1250
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.450
Tradeoff,
remnants of little wings of flightless bird

1251
01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.440
<v 6>bird it.
That's what I thought.
I was looking at my thought.</v>

1252
01:13:24.441 --> 01:13:26.870
Maybe at one point I had heard that there's some loss.

1253
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:28.940
One scientist thought those were like remnants of,
yeah,
some

1254
01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.600
<v 0>wings.
Oh,
that makes sense.
And then we're actually maybe arms but their wings.</v>

1255
01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.780
Well that totally makes sense when you think about like ostriches and shit like

1256
01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:37.730
that,
that they used to have wings and they turned to those things.

1257
01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:40.880
Let me see it again.
Let me see his fucking little shitty arms.

1258
01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.720
That makes me way more sense.
That makes way more sense.

1259
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:47.710
The remnants of four wings cause like that.

1260
01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.940
If you think about what an ostrich looks like,

1261
01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.170
you could kind of morph an ostrich into a t rex,
right?
Yeah.

1262
01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.960
I mean they don't have a tail,
but they do have those fucked up legs,

1263
01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:01.400
giant ass legs,
and a weird body and a fucking head.
And when they look at you,

1264
01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:05.060
they look at you like they look right through you.
Like you don't mean Shit.

1265
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:08.030
Like if you got run over by a truck in front of an ostrich,

1266
01:14:08.031 --> 01:14:10.840
they wouldn't even flinch.
They don't give a fuck about you now.

1267
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:14.140
And just like a dinosaur,
they just have this bird face.
Yeah.

1268
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:18.730
They have zero compassion for you.
Yeah.
Ask.
Just have no empathy.

1269
01:14:18.731 --> 01:14:22.200
That's why they have small arms.
They never hug anybody.
No assholes.

1270
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.230
All of those.
All those fucking creatures that fly around or used to,

1271
01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:32.730
they can all talk it.
Allbirds Allbirds are gross.

1272
01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.360
I love when people keep them as pets.
See if you can find,
um,

1273
01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.650
o p a bird is better.
Loves me.
Yeah.
Keep your window open.
Yeah.
See what happens.

1274
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:48.000
A T rex used to look like vulture.
This is a weird one.

1275
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:50.010
They don't even know what they were covering.
Feathers.

1276
01:14:50.011 --> 01:14:51.540
They think it might have been covered in feathers.

1277
01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.480
That's a more recent speculation.

1278
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:59.190
They think that all dinosaurs were covered in feathers.
Wow.
Yeah.
Or most of them,

1279
01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:02.130
you know,
that's why you know,
you see chickens.

1280
01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.050
Chicken litter literally is at dinosaur.

1281
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.540
Just one that lived one that made it.
Oh,
that's one.
That's creepy looking.

1282
01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:15.690
Um,
now there was one where it had a red face.
There was some,
uh,
yeah,

1283
01:15:15.691 --> 01:15:20.520
that's it right there.
That exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So yeah,

1284
01:15:20.521 --> 01:15:22.980
that's how they had it done with like feathers and shit.

1285
01:15:22.981 --> 01:15:24.420
Feathers in a big old red face.

1286
01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:31.320
I don't know why we're attached to like one idea what that fucking thing look

1287
01:15:31.321 --> 01:15:32.670
like.
All we have is bones.

1288
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:36.390
They have no idea what the skin was like easily could have been covered in

1289
01:15:36.391 --> 01:15:40.910
feathers.
Is it amazing that every kid,
I don't know if it's girls too,

1290
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:44.810
but every boy gets fascinated with dinosaurs at a certain age.
Isn't that weird?

1291
01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.880
Oh yeah.
It's like archetypal.

1292
01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:51.440
There's something deep in your brain that wants to know and connect with

1293
01:15:51.441 --> 01:15:56.441
dinosaurs when you're like four or five years old because it's such a fucking

1294
01:15:56.571 --> 01:16:01.571
wild hail Mary by nature and they they ruled for so long and they were snuffed

1295
01:16:03.441 --> 01:16:06.770
out by or Brock.
Like if that rock didn't hit earth,

1296
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.800
we would be under the reign of these vicious fucking reptiles roaming the

1297
01:16:12.711 --> 01:16:15.140
planet,
eating everything.
We would have never evolved to where we are.

1298
01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:17.240
We would have been hiding in little holes in the ground.

1299
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:20.300
We'd be a little mammals.
This is good as you're ever going to get.

1300
01:16:20.301 --> 01:16:22.100
You're never going to develop a fucking city.

1301
01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:26.300
Good luck pitches raptors everywhere.
There's just running around Jack.

1302
01:16:26.301 --> 01:16:29.600
You don't think homo sapiens would have never,
never made it.

1303
01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.250
Never got to that part.

1304
01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.270
We were moles for hundreds of millions of years.

1305
01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.480
We were these weird fucking creatures and then from 65 million years ago,

1306
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:45.770
that mole evolved into a human being.
According to these fucking scientists,

1307
01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:47.610
all their fancy,

1308
01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.400
they have $65,000 a year that you have to pay for education.

1309
01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.480
This book I was just listening to about music and the brain talked about the

1310
01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:59.090
first instrument found is this a,

1311
01:16:59.091 --> 01:17:03.590
I think it was like a rib flute of like an elephant or a something that's like

1312
01:17:03.591 --> 01:17:06.200
50,000 years old,
but because it's a flute they go,

1313
01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:10.640
that's probably most likely not the first instrument being used because it was

1314
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:15.410
probably drums to get into a flute.
That's making sounds.
It's a big evolution.

1315
01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.633
Like how,

1316
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.240
how far back do you think they were just using drums before they had language,

1317
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:24.110
you know,
let's have the Haka and New Zealand,
that whole thing,

1318
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:27.290
which is just a lot of sounds in the ground screaming.

1319
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.230
But that was a way to communicate.
Yeah.
Like,
um,

1320
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:33.800
what is the accepted timeline for the invention of language?

1321
01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:38.930
I don't know what it is,
but let's take a guess.
Um,

1322
01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.140
I want to say language was invented a hundred thousand years ago.

1323
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.350
What do you think?
I don't even think it's that.
Well,
it have been,

1324
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.420
I'm going to say it's 40.

1325
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:51.950
I'm going to say language was invented 40,000 years ago.
Homosapian right?

1326
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:55.760
Is that,
yes.
But homosapien didn't always have language.
Right.

1327
01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.360
Homosapien I think is 250,000 plus years old.

1328
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.820
There's like the argument from like two 50 tickets,

1329
01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.420
shaky to like 300 5,400 whatever the whatever it could be.

1330
01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:07.250
But they think somewhere around there.

1331
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.790
And the other thing is like they intersected with,

1332
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:14.360
was it neanderthal man that came beforehand and originally they just thought

1333
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:16.370
that one ended and the next one started.

1334
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.820
But then in fact they actually existed together for a long time and they fought.

1335
01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.220
Yup.
And they fucked.
And neanderthal was around way longer.

1336
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.950
The NFL survive for half a million years.

1337
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:32.720
So neanderthal was alive way longer than humans have been alive.

1338
01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:36.920
Then modern homo sapiens.
What's up?

1339
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:40.340
Everything I keep finding just says like it starts with ancient Egypt.

1340
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:44.180
Like that can't be right.
Maybe written.
That's probably like written language.

1341
01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.650
Spoken language at the origin,
date of spoken language.

1342
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:51.470
Well on the Andy Warhol was bigger and stronger,

1343
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:55.850
but homosapien they organized.
Yeah.

1344
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:58.580
Well they work with,
they work as a group.

1345
01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:03.170
What really happened because neanderthals actually have bigger brains.
Oh really?

1346
01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:06.050
Yeah.
But they're also built way better,
way,
way different.

1347
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:08.750
So it might've been the,
they're bigger brains was to control.

1348
01:19:08.751 --> 01:19:13.580
They're much stronger body cause they were like five,
seven,
250 pounds.

1349
01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.840
20 pounds.
Yeah.
They were built different than us.
Yeah.

1350
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:21.650
They were thick ass bones man.
Like a five,
seven,
200 pound man today.

1351
01:19:21.651 --> 01:19:24.710
Like man that guy has got to be lifting some weights.
It's basically my height.

1352
01:19:24.711 --> 01:19:28.180
I'm five,
eight I weight 200 pounds.
So I'm built like in the inner tall,

1353
01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.740
like legitimately,
yes,
they were all built like that in thicker.
Right.

1354
01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:39.020
But with Wade,
denser bones,
bigger heads,
bigger heads,
bigger arms,
bigger bones,

1355
01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:42.140
the bones,
the forearm,
the arms,
the legs,
everything was thicker.

1356
01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.270
They were just more sturdy than us.

1357
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:46.730
They're like naturally like they didn't have to lift weights.

1358
01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.410
They would rip your fucking arms off.

1359
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:52.820
They were just built like almost like a half a chimp like on the way from being,

1360
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:54.410
you know,
Australia or you know,

1361
01:19:55.220 --> 01:20:00.220
Homo Erectus or Australia Pythius or any of those early man cut type species.

1362
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.570
They were in that,
you know,
there's,
there was a,

1363
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.000
they think there was dozens of them.

1364
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:08.160
They think that there's the ones that are Russia that they found out about,

1365
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.340
<v 4>I think they're called Denisovans.
There's those a little hobbit,</v>

1366
01:20:11.341 --> 01:20:15.840
people that were in,
um,
Australia Flores for us.

1367
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.260
They think there might be ones in those places too.
Even in Vietnam,

1368
01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:23.430
they have a one they call the orange pen deck.
I think it's how you say it.

1369
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:27.090
And they,
that's a like a little monkey man,

1370
01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:31.830
like a little hairy man that lives in the forest out there.
And before this,

1371
01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:34.950
a hobbit discovery,
which was holding like a decade ago,

1372
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.400
the people that live in the island of Flores and they found out that there was

1373
01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:40.560
absolutely three foot tall,

1374
01:20:40.561 --> 01:20:44.130
a little hairy people that had stone tools and you know,

1375
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:48.390
and they organized,
they lived in these places and they use fire.
Like that's a,

1376
01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:50.590
that's a really bad damn thing.
Yeah.

1377
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:55.350
And they just found that out within the last decade or so.
So I mean,

1378
01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.490
how many of them were out there?

1379
01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.070
How many other ones are out there that we just don't have fossils of.

1380
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:00.810
And when you talk to God like Graham Hancock,

1381
01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:04.230
who has that amazing book right there called America before.
Fuck,

1382
01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:06.610
that's a good book.
It can't find these deep in that

1383
01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:10.660
<v 6>it's about 10,000 years ago.
Seems to be the most agreed upon.</v>

1384
01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.770
10,000 potential for it for spoken language.

1385
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:16.180
I only have evidence that goes back that far.

1386
01:21:16.181 --> 01:21:20.290
There's people that say it's probably should go back as far back as 60,000
years.

1387
01:21:20.291 --> 01:21:24.760
But I know,
I don't believe there have any evidence of that to support that.

1388
01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:30.070
How would you,
and that's the problem when they developed,
uh,
the larynx,

1389
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.310
the voice box,
I think they,
they trace it to that.

1390
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.390
<v 4>Yeah.
That's the problem with history,
right?</v>

1391
01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:41.550
Like who knows what the Fuck Lincoln said.
All we know is what Lincoln wrote.

1392
01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:42.631
Okay.

1393
01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:45.900
When you have Lincoln holding hands with his boyfriend going for walk through

1394
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:50.160
the garden bits,
you just making shit up.
You make that a thing.
Now look,

1395
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:54.130
there are,
there is speculation that Abraham Lincoln was a gay man.
Huh?

1396
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:59.010
And then he slept with a man for a long periods of time,
um,
in the same bed.

1397
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:04.370
But apparently people did that very often back then for warmth because uh,

1398
01:22:04.861 --> 01:22:05.400
you know,

1399
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.210
you lived in a place that was made out of wood that you chopped down your

1400
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:11.790
fucking self and should've been for four years.
So listen,

1401
01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:13.680
when I just cold for four years in a row,

1402
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:17.490
I'd be tough to share a bed with Lincoln.
He was fucking huge.
Yeah.

1403
01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:21.910
He's all strong too.
So wrestler Waze.
Yeah.
Huh.

1404
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:27.360
Yeah.
He was an excellent wrestler.
Supposedly shared a bed with his captain,

1405
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:30.850
captain of his body guards whenever his wife was away,
hip hop arrays.

1406
01:22:30.851 --> 01:22:35.490
So maybe it was cold.
Hey.
Um,
it might be both me now we have to,

1407
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:38.340
you know,
think about it in context.
Right?

1408
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.670
I think if you go back to the Greeks and the Romans,

1409
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.850
gay sex was way more common.

1410
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:49.250
I mean it was like almost like everybody was half guy,
right?
It's kind of,

1411
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.210
and pedophilia was just a normal thing.

1412
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.590
Young boys,
like if you read Socrates,

1413
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:04.300
he read the history of of him or have a lot of scholars in like really respected

1414
01:23:04.321 --> 01:23:06.130
thinkers.
They had young boys

1415
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:07.263
<v 0>that they would bang.</v>

1416
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.320
So what was what today is a horrific crime against humanity was completely

1417
01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:18.820
normal back then.
Yeah.
So when did that stop?

1418
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:23.410
When a dude's to stop banging and dudes and did they just kind of do it and not

1419
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:26.530
talk about it or was it,
it seems like a

1420
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:29.680
<v 1>Christianity first brought about the shame,</v>

1421
01:23:29.681 --> 01:23:31.630
the sexual shame that we have today.

1422
01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.870
So I would probably trace it back to like 2000 years ago.

1423
01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.420
<v 0>If you how,
here's the question,</v>

1424
01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:44.810
how much of being gay is stopped by society's expectations?

1425
01:23:46.531 --> 01:23:51.531
Like what is the percentage of people who are actually gay who just can't act on

1426
01:23:51.541 --> 01:23:52.710
it because it just,

1427
01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:57.740
it whether their mom or their religion or their church they go to,

1428
01:23:58.201 --> 01:24:00.690
or the,
you know,
the God married and they had kids,

1429
01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:05.280
but they really want to be gay.
How much of that exists today?

1430
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.790
Look what percentage out of all,
all the gay activity,

1431
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.380
if you could put it on a pie chart,

1432
01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.220
how many more gay people would there be if they didn't?

1433
01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:19.080
If there was just no one cares to?
Yeah.
There's no expectations from religion.

1434
01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:23.160
No expectations from your community?
Ibm.
What'd you mean?
Fuck yeah.

1435
01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.970
Do you think you'd be a top or a bottom top?
That's what everybody thinks

1436
01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.180
I'd be,
I'd be a screaming bottom.
A lot of crying.

1437
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.070
I'd be a running bottom.
It would be just like when you were waterboarded,

1438
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:40.680
you'd be fucking spasming uncontrollably

1439
01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.230
and it turns out that that's what a lot of the guys are into.
Unfortunately.

1440
01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:53.820
Just sets the biggest [inaudible] in the community.
Waterboarding but fucked.

1441
01:24:57.150 --> 01:25:00.180
Getting Butt fucked by waterboarding.
It's the new black,

1442
01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:07.650
it's the new thing.
Yeah,
it's the rage.

1443
01:25:07.651 --> 01:25:11.200
It's all the rage nipple clamps and,
hmm.

1444
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:15.390
Did you ever watch orange is the new black couple times?
Is there any good?

1445
01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:20.000
It's not bad.
I just,
I didn't,
I felt like the character Jews

1446
01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:24.220
<v 1>were a little too over,
over drawn.
I didn't buy them as real people too much.</v>

1447
01:25:24.221 --> 01:25:29.221
They seem like it felt like a writer coming up with a character as opposed to

1448
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:33.700
like really trying to portray human behavior.
But then again,

1449
01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:36.850
I've never been in a women's prison.
My mom worked in a women's prison for years.

1450
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.570
Dude.
Really?
Yeah,
she talked about,
they were all victims.

1451
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:44.790
We were talking about earlier about,
um,
you know,
women who were abused,
abused,

1452
01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:49.510
and every fucking,
one of them was abused sexually,
physically.

1453
01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:53.710
Almost all of them are in jail because of a guy they were carrying drugs for a

1454
01:25:53.711 --> 01:25:54.460
guy.

1455
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:58.720
They stay fucking killed the guy because he kept attacking her.

1456
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:04.130
It was pretty rare,
you know,
and a lot of it was obviously drug use,
but

1457
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:08.850
<v 2>that stems from usually childhood abuse.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1458
01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.730
But for a lot of them,

1459
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.760
my mom said it was the best environment they'd ever lived in because there was a

1460
01:26:16.131 --> 01:26:18.950
solidarity among a lot of the women.
There was a lot of support.

1461
01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:22.910
There was education,
there were support groups and uh,

1462
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:26.360
and they developed relationships with women without men around.

1463
01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:31.780
And so they were able to foster and nurture real female empowered relationships.

1464
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.300
That's so sad and cool at the same time.
Yeah,

1465
01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:42.800
it's sad,
but it's like,
well,
it's nice that something is working out for them.

1466
01:26:42.801 --> 01:26:47.801
Like women in jail seemed to have a way better time of it than men in jail just

1467
01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:52.160
seems like a better deal I think.
So.
You probably not getting beat up as much.

1468
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:56.780
Isn't there a new reality show about women in jail with her following these

1469
01:26:56.781 --> 01:26:59.480
women?
Not just women.
It's mostly women that follow.

1470
01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:02.960
I saw that sa called jailbirds on Netflix.
I watched like the first steps.
Right?

1471
01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.360
Is that good?
Is that bad?
Yeah.

1472
01:27:04.361 --> 01:27:08.600
It follows them in like the Sacramento jail holding or it seems like there's so

1473
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:12.950
many fucking shows about people in jail that it must be like prisoners must get

1474
01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:17.870
agents now get off.
I got an offer from MSNBC for lockup.
Greg,

1475
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:20.930
they like you,
but they'd like you to just get some face tattoos.

1476
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:25.820
Do you think you'd be good?
You know they'll put you on a Annie.
Okay.
Annie,

1477
01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:29.810
bad guys show.
Think of any size in jail.

1478
01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.370
Greg Fitzsimmons on them.
We're giving you a two year option,

1479
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.490
but I'm only in here for one.
You Follow Golf,
right?
Yeah.

1480
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.770
I wanted to talk to you about this because it's so ridiculous.

1481
01:27:39.771 --> 01:27:44.771
I saw this guy got suspended from his serious golf show because,

1482
01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:49.580
uh,
he was talking about the Lpga and he goes,
uh,
who,

1483
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.350
who's gonna win the LPGA?
He goes,

1484
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:53.990
let me go out on a limb and say it's going to be a Korean.

1485
01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.340
Cause apparently Koreans when a lot of them,
70% of the LPGA is Korean.

1486
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.690
It's crazy.
Somebody said,
uh,
he goes,
could pick a name.
He goes,
uh,
is it Lee?

1487
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:07.490
He goes,
how many leads do we have that entered in?
It's like six Lee's six leads.

1488
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:08.520
Was there six Lee's,

1489
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.980
they said he was racist and sexist and they suspended him for those comments.

1490
01:28:12.981 --> 01:28:16.820
Like,
first of all,
it's not bad to win.
Okay.

1491
01:28:16.821 --> 01:28:20.210
When he's saying who do you think's gonna win?
Probably a Korean.

1492
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:24.200
Well that's good.
That means the Koreans kick ass at golf.

1493
01:28:24.201 --> 01:28:27.170
That's a fucking racist.
Is Not racist to say that.

1494
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:30.890
It's also not racist to say,
ah,
maybe their name is Lee.

1495
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:35.060
Cause there's a lot of Lee's that's not racist.
That's accurate.

1496
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:38.150
It turns out there was six Lee's yeah,
like,
come on folks.

1497
01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:39.770
We're not saying anything bad.

1498
01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:42.860
You're talking about something that everybody loves,
which is golf.
Right.

1499
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:43.611
You all love it.

1500
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:47.810
That's why you're listening to golf radio and talking about an impoverished

1501
01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:52.811
country that is found a way like black people found boxing or Irish guys,

1502
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:58.850
uh,
found the fucking police force.
Like you find something to rise up out of.

1503
01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.220
Well,
Korean harbor card,
I mean,
a guarantee.
That's

1504
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.230
<v 4>part of it.
Yeah,
it's part,
it's part of the culture.</v>

1505
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.630
I had a very good friend of mine that I've talked about many times in this

1506
01:29:06.631 --> 01:29:10.440
podcast who was us national champ while he was in medical school,

1507
01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:15.570
national taekwondo champion.
And I realized how hard some people,
oh yeah.
Junk.

1508
01:29:15.571 --> 01:29:19.020
Sick Chang.
That was his name.
Yeah.
Great Guy.

1509
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:21.660
One of my favorite people I've ever met.
I loved him to death

1510
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:26.640
<v 1>women.
But in men's golf and men's golf is very international now.</v>

1511
01:29:26.641 --> 01:29:31.020
It's never had more players from around the world,
but not a lot of Koreans.

1512
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.160
It's like a Japanese guy who's way up top and there's another Korean guys.
Good.

1513
01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:37.080
But nothing like Lpga.

1514
01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.960
<v 4>That's interesting.
I don't know anything about,</v>

1515
01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.590
I didn't know anything about Koreans in golf before I saw that.

1516
01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:47.860
But we have to make a differentiation between something that is about a race and

1517
01:29:50.241 --> 01:29:53.510
something that's racist.
This is not negative.

1518
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:58.460
You're literally talking about a positive thing.
They're winners.

1519
01:29:58.790 --> 01:30:01.250
You want to win.
Don't you want to,
when you're trying to win,
right.
Well,

1520
01:30:01.251 --> 01:30:05.510
they win a lot.
They're awesome at it.
And it's not,
they're not cheating.

1521
01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:08.810
They're just kicking ass.
They're better at golf.
Yeah,

1522
01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.460
and some of them are named Lee.
There's nothing racist here.
This is not right.

1523
01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:17.410
<v 1>They're upset because the ratings for the LPGA or way down because they want to</v>

1524
01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:22.350
see Americans playing.
So there's like a,
so it's an issue.
Yeah,

1525
01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.010
it's a big issue because the ratings,

1526
01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:29.160
you think his attitude is racist because he's like mocking it because Koreans

1527
01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:32.800
winning it so he doesn't care.
I don't know that.
I don't know that that's his,

1528
01:30:32.801 --> 01:30:35.590
that's tension.
No,
I don't think it's as intention.

1529
01:30:35.591 --> 01:30:39.580
I think there's a sensitivity about it because it's become an issue.

1530
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.740
<v 4>I'd get that.
I get that.
That makes sense.</v>

1531
01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:47.340
But it just doesn't make sense if you're just going off of what he said right

1532
01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:48.174
off what he said.

1533
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:51.660
What I'm getting is you're being super fucking sensitive with how you,

1534
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:54.660
how you treat people that are talking about winners.
Yeah.

1535
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:58.650
Like that's the case with uh,
Filipinos and pool.

1536
01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.800
Filipinos are some of the greatest pool players of all time.

1537
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:06.390
Some of my all time favorite pool players are from the Philippines.
Um,

1538
01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:11.820
Francisco Bustamante Efrin Rayez,
Rodolfo,
Lou [inaudible],

1539
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:17.220
Alex,
Peggy,
Elian,
some of the greatest of all time.
Uh,
Dennis or Coolo,

1540
01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:21.270
all those guys were Filipino.
Those are the top of the food chain man.

1541
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.120
When you saw those guys playing a tournament,
like fuck,

1542
01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.910
like you knew they were winning.
Yeah,
I mean F and raise one.

1543
01:31:26.911 --> 01:31:29.820
Everything Bustamante one,
everything's guys are murderers.

1544
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:34.290
And if you said like,
who's going to win this tournament?
Probably a Filipino.

1545
01:31:34.410 --> 01:31:38.220
Everybody would start laughing like,
yeah,
probably they wouldn't be a negative.

1546
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:43.200
It'd be a positive there.
The,
some of the best in the world.
That pool.
That's odd.

1547
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:47.430
<v 1>Racist.
That's accurate.
Yeah.
Now what is it with it,</v>

1548
01:31:47.431 --> 01:31:51.750
with MMA,
what are,
what are the big nationalities is,
that's a good question.

1549
01:31:51.751 --> 01:31:52.710
Russians,
the

1550
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:55.810
<v 4>Russians are murdering it right now.
There's a lot of bad ass rushes.</v>

1551
01:31:55.811 --> 01:31:57.370
Wherever life is hard.

1552
01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.300
You're going to find fighters and you're find people that survive where life is

1553
01:32:01.301 --> 01:32:04.870
hard and thrive.
And then that's how you get like a cubby number gummit off.

1554
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:09.070
He get a hard mother fucker who knows how to fight and then it scares shit.

1555
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:13.330
Same thing with Conor McGregor.
You get a hard neighborhood,
hard life,
you know,

1556
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.170
growing up in Dublin,
dangerous fighting since he was young,
you know,

1557
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:22.270
that's how you get these beasts and then you get American MMA guys come from

1558
01:32:22.271 --> 01:32:26.200
wrestling or the military.
Right.
Yet some of them,
some of them from the military,

1559
01:32:26.201 --> 01:32:30.040
you know,
it's rare.
You know,
we had special forces guy like Tim Kennedy,

1560
01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:32.470
of course,
he's probably one of the most famous Brian Stan.

1561
01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.510
I'm also a military veteran.
And you look at these guys that are,
you know,

1562
01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.860
the,
the guys that are capable of being seals or rangers are green berets.

1563
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.270
They're just elite humans.
They're just,

1564
01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:48.100
they're people that know how to do things and push themselves in a way that

1565
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:48.934
other people don't.

1566
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.380
Sometimes that translates over the fighting and sometimes it doesn't,
you know,

1567
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:54.790
sometimes they just don't have the physical capability of it.

1568
01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:59.410
Like they might have the mindset to survive war and the ability to get through

1569
01:32:59.411 --> 01:33:03.670
buds and to get through grueling physical training.
But he ain't beat John Jones.

1570
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.390
You know,
like there's,
there's levels to this thing and this genetic levels,

1571
01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:08.061
you know,

1572
01:33:08.061 --> 01:33:12.220
Jon Jones says like some of the best genetics ever and then uses them as good as

1573
01:33:12.221 --> 01:33:16.180
anybody that's ever existed best at controlling distance of all time.

1574
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.490
He's got two brothers that are NFL players,

1575
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:23.230
so this is like super genetics in the house.
Both his brothers are NFL stars.

1576
01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:28.150
That's amaze and he's the baddest light heavyweight of all time.
Any smart.

1577
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:31.450
So it's not just physical,
it's also intellectual.

1578
01:33:31.451 --> 01:33:34.260
He's also sets traps for people.
He measured them,

1579
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:36.100
he sees what they're doing and he fails him,

1580
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:40.090
weaken any pressures and puts heavy pressure on people he knows when to ebb and

1581
01:33:40.091 --> 01:33:44.920
flow.
He's just a genius at fighting.
The lightweights have longer careers?
No,

1582
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:49.430
no.
I would say the opposite.
I would say the bigger guys actually have,
uh,
they,

1583
01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:53.320
they can compete at a higher level deep into their 30s and even forties.

1584
01:33:53.321 --> 01:33:54.430
Like Randy coture I think,

1585
01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:59.680
I think he really won the heavyweight title when he was 42 check cause I would

1586
01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:01.690
think there'd be more knockouts with heavyweights.

1587
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.600
There's a lot of knockouts with heavy weights,
but they,

1588
01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:09.690
their bodies maintain what got them to the dance later in life.

1589
01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.660
Like George Foreman,
George Foreman won the heavyweight title,

1590
01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:17.440
I think he was 46 when he knocked out Michael Moore.

1591
01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:22.450
So the oldest ever heavyweight champion and that's just unheard of at

1592
01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.260
welterweight.

1593
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.310
You're not going to see 46 year old welterweights winning the world title

1594
01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:30.490
against Earl Spence Jr someone like that.
You just not going to see that 43,

1595
01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:32.470
he was 43.
Brandy was,
yeah.

1596
01:34:32.710 --> 01:34:35.950
And find out how old George Foreman was when he knocked out Michael Moore.

1597
01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:39.940
So that's crazy.
That's crazy.
Old 43 you don't see that at 125 pounds.

1598
01:34:39.941 --> 01:34:43.540
You just don't,
you just don't know.
125 pounds.

1599
01:34:43.541 --> 01:34:45.640
No one wins the title at 43 years.

1600
01:34:45.641 --> 01:34:48.760
It's just the mass almost helps you survive something like that.

1601
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:52.930
I also think they lose less as they get older.

1602
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.030
He was 45 45 so yeah,

1603
01:34:55.031 --> 01:34:59.340
George Foreman was the oldest ever heavyweight at 45 crazy.
Wow.

1604
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.140
That is so unusual as like a middleweight.

1605
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:06.830
The only one who maintained a world championship caliber,
uh,

1606
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:12.110
skillset deep into his forties was Bernard Hopkins and Archie Moore when Archie

1607
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:13.640
Moore was younger.
I'm going to put some,
you know,

1608
01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:16.640
we're talking about the rocky Marciano days.
That was,

1609
01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:18.800
he fought deep into his forties as well,

1610
01:35:18.801 --> 01:35:20.480
but he was just like a real crafty veteran.

1611
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:23.240
He actually also trained George Foreman,
which is very interesting.

1612
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:28.340
So like that crafty veteran trained George Foreman to be a crafty veteran and

1613
01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:32.000
maintain his power.
He had a real unusual,
I remember to remember,

1614
01:35:32.001 --> 01:35:36.140
but George Foreman used to almost like put his hands up like he didn't know how

1615
01:35:36.141 --> 01:35:39.830
to fight.
Like,
Hey,
don't hit me.
Don't hit me.
It almost like that.

1616
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:43.460
But that was his defense.
He would move forward like this.

1617
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:48.350
Cause he was so big,
he was such an enormous man with these enormous arms.

1618
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:51.770
So when you would stack them on top of each other and walk towards you like
that,

1619
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:56.270
it was this weird offerance and he learned that from Archie Moore who was part

1620
01:35:56.271 --> 01:35:59.600
of the part of his defense and holding his hands up in a weird way.

1621
01:35:59.601 --> 01:36:00.830
He learned from Archie Moore,
right.

1622
01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:03.100
<v 1>Well,
you know,
uh,
the oldest,</v>

1623
01:36:03.101 --> 01:36:08.101
a hockey player in the NHL is also the biggest six foot eight guy is a Dana

1624
01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:11.760
Chara.
All the Bruins fan

1625
01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:15.860
<v 2>43.
What's that name?
What is his name?
Zidane.</v>

1626
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:20.480
Achara what?
Slovakian he,
that dude was from the Lord of the rings.
Look,

1627
01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:23.630
let's listen to that thing that gave birth to him in a meadow.

1628
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:28.290
They rode a horse out there.
It was destiny.
They predict how long he been.

1629
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:30.890
I was young.
Yeah.
Just that name.

1630
01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:35.810
He came out of eight is a fucking viking.
He's an animal.
He fights.

1631
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:36.860
I saw,
Oh yeah,

1632
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.920
I saw this one fight where he hit a guy and the guy kind of took a dive and he,

1633
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:46.180
he leaned down and picked him up with one hand and started punching him with the

1634
01:36:46.181 --> 01:36:49.040
other,
lifted him off the ice with one hand.
Yeah.

1635
01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:53.420
I saw one thing that guy did that's really fucked up a guy,

1636
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:58.070
a hip toss to dude.
He judo through him.
Like he swept him.

1637
01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.980
Like he grabbed a hold of them,
swept his leg up,

1638
01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:05.120
kicked his leg out like Uchi Mata and slammed his fucking head onto the ground.

1639
01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.390
Geez.
It was rough.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was like,
man,

1640
01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.680
that ain't the same as fighting like you,
you,
you know you're on ice.
Yeah.

1641
01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.740
He maybe,
no one's told me couldn't do it.
Right.

1642
01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:18.170
But he used some really fucking sneaky shit.

1643
01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:22.720
<v 1>Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
The F the F,
the fighting and the NHS.</v>

1644
01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.700
It's funny,
there's a,

1645
01:37:23.701 --> 01:37:28.701
there's really great clips of guys talking to each other before fights and it's

1646
01:37:29.311 --> 01:37:33.850
amazingly calm.
They literally go like,
uh hey,
you want to go and the guy,

1647
01:37:33.851 --> 01:37:34.680
I'll be like,

1648
01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:39.680
y'all go and then they fight and then they throw and then as soon as the other

1649
01:37:39.811 --> 01:37:42.240
guy,
cause yeah,
they just throw their gloves down and they start fighting.

1650
01:37:42.241 --> 01:37:45.510
It's all,
it's all part of the game.
It's all fucking orchestrated.

1651
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:48.660
And there's players that fight and there's players that don't and if you're on
a,

1652
01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:51.320
if you're on the ice with another goon,
then it's,

1653
01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.990
it's expected that you guys are going to fight at some point.
Yeah.

1654
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:56.010
What a crazy way to make

1655
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:00.270
<v 0>a living bare knuckle fighting up slippery floor.
Yeah.
But you know,
they don't,</v>

1656
01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:03.840
they don't get hit that much because they get to Jersey up.
They do.

1657
01:38:03.841 --> 01:38:06.660
They get hit enough though.
Yeah.
I've been watching dudes who have skills.

1658
01:38:06.661 --> 01:38:10.290
Now you're seeing way more guys who have boxing skills,
right.

1659
01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.880
Doing this like guys who like laying like short uppercuts and left hooks where

1660
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:17.640
you like,
Oh my God,
I've got to turn that punch over.
That guy knows how to punch.

1661
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:18.180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1662
01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:21.320
<v 1>Not as many over hands where you're all you're doing with the overhead and the</v>

1663
01:38:21.321 --> 01:38:22.790
guy in the helmet with your fist.

1664
01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:25.220
<v 0>Yeah,
the flailing.
Sometimes you don't see that.</v>

1665
01:38:25.221 --> 01:38:27.740
Sometimes you've seen guys would throw fucking straight punches and like,

1666
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:30.290
all right,
I love you.
Don't know how to fight,

1667
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.230
and then this guy knows how to do that while he's out.
Yeah.
This one,

1668
01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.710
look at this.
Boom,
boom.
Becka knockout bowls at home.

1669
01:38:36.770 --> 01:38:41.540
Well that's a good Kao while he's hold and then he gives them one way is going

1670
01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:46.280
down and then he goes down.
He's out cold.
Yeah.
Boom.
Boom.

1671
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:50.900
Fang guys out.
Oh yeah.
He believes his right from the shoulder.

1672
01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.540
Oh yeah.
That guy can punch.
He's and he's,

1673
01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:57.320
you're punching in the face while he's punching you in the face too.
It's chaos.

1674
01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.900
It's a terrible way to find people.
Not only a great fighter,

1675
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:04.100
one of the best players in the league,
and also a great fighter.
Wow.

1676
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:08.310
That's a crazy sport.
Man.
Doesn't get enough love.
Yeah.
Name names.

1677
01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:11.690
Get the average person name a famous hockey players currently playing.

1678
01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.410
<v 1>I know this,
the same guy.
This crazy thing happened this year.</v>

1679
01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:17.590
This is an insane video to watch.
I can't show it.

1680
01:39:17.730 --> 01:39:19.390
Every people at home might have seen this,

1681
01:39:19.391 --> 01:39:24.160
but the puck literally flies and hits him right in the face and he barely moves

1682
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:26.800
as it might've should show it again in slow motion right here

1683
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:31.770
<v 0>to see if his teeth got knocked out.
Oh Man.
You've got parked right in the mug.</v>

1684
01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.300
Yeah Bro.
That is hard.
Wow.
That guy can take it.

1685
01:39:36.301 --> 01:39:37.990
Fuck it now.
It's insane.

1686
01:39:38.650 --> 01:39:43.190
<v 1>The fucking Bruins.
And I actually dropped game one last night against the blues,</v>

1687
01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:48.160
but the Bruins are set to win the Stanley Cup,
which means Boston.

1688
01:39:48.161 --> 01:39:51.760
We'll win the fucking super bowl,
the world series and the Stanley Cup

1689
01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.470
<v 0>one year.
I remember when we lived there,
they couldn't win shit.</v>

1690
01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:59.090
It was like they had such an inferiority complex.
Yeah.
And then we get close,

1691
01:39:59.091 --> 01:40:00.050
like the Celtics were good.

1692
01:40:00.051 --> 01:40:02.840
They had Larry Bird and Danny Ainge and have it forever.

1693
01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.420
Cause like when was the last time the Yankees won the world series?

1694
01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.790
How long ago was that cheese?
2000

1695
01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:10.090
<v 7>um,
eight.</v>

1696
01:40:10.670 --> 01:40:15.110
<v 0>So it's been 11 years.
I know I could be way off on that,
but they still have it.</v>

1697
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.080
There's still the Yankees,
you know what I mean?
But for the Red Sox,

1698
01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.950
they never pulled it off.
And then that bill Buckner thing,

1699
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:24.220
Bill Buckner just died.
Oh,

1700
01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:27.520
<v 1>so sad.
Yeah.
And that's the thing about being in Bali,</v>

1701
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:28.660
because I grew up a mets fan.

1702
01:40:28.661 --> 01:40:30.850
We had season tickets to the met since I was a little kid.

1703
01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:34.630
And so when they get into the world series and I was going to school in Boston,

1704
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:38.770
surrounded by mass halls watching these fucking games and they're just,

1705
01:40:38.890 --> 01:40:43.330
I'm sorry if you're from Boston,
take it the fuck easy about your sports.

1706
01:40:43.331 --> 01:40:47.920
They're so loud.
Like,
like,
like last night with the,
with the a Bruins game.

1707
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:51.790
They uh,
they boo the entire,
they introduced the,
the blues,

1708
01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.980
they boo every fucking,
it's just,

1709
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:57.190
<v 2>it's barbaric.
The animals.
So then fucking Buckner,</v>

1710
01:40:57.191 --> 01:41:01.410
who is this storied amazing player who's a journeyman,

1711
01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.120
he's been out there for ever.
They put them at first base.

1712
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:07.090
He used to be an outfielder,
but he slowed down.

1713
01:41:07.091 --> 01:41:09.640
I think he had bad legs or some say put them at first base.

1714
01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:14.890
He gets a fucking ball hit to him it,
it took a bad hop,
watch the video.

1715
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:18.460
It took a bad hop and he missed it and they fucking,

1716
01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:21.790
there were death threats.
They dropped him that year.

1717
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:25.090
He went down to Pawtucket in Rhode Island's plan.
The miners,

1718
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.340
they showed up there and fucking terrorized him.

1719
01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:30.640
He had to move out to like Arizona to hide.
Jeez.

1720
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:34.990
Cause these fucking Boston fans.
I remember people walking the streets.

1721
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:40.420
What year was that?
80 46 86 I remember people walking the streets,

1722
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:44.140
they'd just be walking around the neighborhood with their hands in their hair

1723
01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:49.150
like fuck you after they lost.
Fuck yeah.
Just walk in the street.

1724
01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:53.020
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're so mad.
It was all anybody wanted to talk about.
All right,

1725
01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:58.060
because they hadn't won a world series since 2017 or something.
It was crazy.

1726
01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.010
I was early 2019 17 yeah,

1727
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:03.860
1917 I was already over baseball at that point.

1728
01:42:03.861 --> 01:42:05.350
I wasn't interested in baseball anymore.

1729
01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:08.090
So for me it was really fascinating to watch.
Yeah.

1730
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:12.550
Watch these people cause I had grown from caring about baseball to being

1731
01:42:12.551 --> 01:42:15.170
obsessed with martial arts and that was in the tree,

1732
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:17.890
like got obsessed with martial arts and like 81.

1733
01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.750
So by the time 86 rolled around I was like,

1734
01:42:19.751 --> 01:42:23.070
what the fuck are you people paying attention to?
Some guy dropped a ball,

1735
01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.250
you're going to be okay.
Yeah.
What is this?
Not only that,
but that same year,

1736
01:42:27.251 --> 01:42:30.190
I believe it was that same year,
the um,

1737
01:42:31.090 --> 01:42:36.090
the mets that same year that the Patriots lost to the bears in the Superbowl and

1738
01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:39.730
they guy was one of the biggest blowouts in Superbowl history.
Oh yeah,

1739
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:42.460
that's right.
They were riding off of that too.
It was rough times.

1740
01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.460
Half Times for Boston.
Yeah.
I,

1741
01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:48.190
I don't want to live there cause I can't deal with the cold.

1742
01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:52.810
I'm too too much of a pussy these days.
Yeah.
But I love those fucking animals.

1743
01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:57.810
Oh,
Boston the best.
I fucking love Boston different man.
Yup.

1744
01:42:57.850 --> 01:43:01.390
The characters,
the different growing up there.
I think for both of us,

1745
01:43:01.391 --> 01:43:03.730
like to start and to start our comedy careers there,

1746
01:43:03.731 --> 01:43:07.060
I think it was insanely valuable.
Yeah.
Cause they're not taking any bullshit.

1747
01:43:07.061 --> 01:43:07.940
They're,
they're not.

1748
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:12.990
They're not taking any half ass act that's slow and meandering and self

1749
01:43:13.371 --> 01:43:16.550
absorbed.
Not happening now.
And it's still like that still.

1750
01:43:16.551 --> 01:43:20.230
Like I was just there and it's like they don't,
here's what,
here's what it is.

1751
01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.390
When you walk on stage in Boston,

1752
01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:27.400
the audience doesn't automatically by default give you credit for being in

1753
01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:30.910
charge.
You have to earn it every time we are first year.

1754
01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:33.490
First Joke in Boston is fucking clots.

1755
01:43:33.491 --> 01:43:35.290
You got to get up there and get a laugh fast.

1756
01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:39.040
It's fucking cold there in the winter.
It makes harder people.
Yeah,
that's right.

1757
01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:43.990
It makes people that know how to get past that fucking hump.
Yeah.

1758
01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:47.590
That's all three month hump where it's socks.

1759
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:52.460
You remember that?
Yeah.
It's brutal.
Umber.
It's fucking windy

1760
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:55.330
<v 1>down to stitches.
I'll fucking calm APP.</v>

1761
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:57.770
It's fucking freezing and getting through the door.

1762
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:00.710
Just trembling while you wait for the train outdoors.

1763
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:02.210
How about a fucking underground stuff.

1764
01:44:02.890 --> 01:44:06.980
<v 4>No.
Outside,
outside.
Outside.
Nobody.
Right.
Fuck you.</v>

1765
01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.570
Yeah.
That be so much together.
But he's freezing every time the door opens.

1766
01:44:10.571 --> 01:44:13.140
If it was fucking freezing,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck.
Yeah.

1767
01:44:13.150 --> 01:44:15.850
Get in your car in the morning to start it like,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,

1768
01:44:15.851 --> 01:44:19.360
fuck.
Yeah.
All right,
so cold.

1769
01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:22.920
<v 1>And then they also have the,
it's a,
it's an immigrant city too,
you know,</v>

1770
01:44:22.921 --> 01:44:24.990
they edit all the Italians and the Irish.

1771
01:44:24.991 --> 01:44:28.770
They all came in and they fucking fought it out over real estate where they were

1772
01:44:28.771 --> 01:44:29.281
going to live,

1773
01:44:29.281 --> 01:44:33.840
who's going to get the union jobs and it created a very tough [inaudible].

1774
01:44:33.930 --> 01:44:37.650
It's like Philly or the Bronx.
There's just cities where they had that,

1775
01:44:37.890 --> 01:44:39.630
that fighting at the turn of the century.

1776
01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:43.890
<v 4>Yeah.
And I think it's the,
it was the magical ingredient for stand up.</v>

1777
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:47.670
That's part of the magical ingredient.
The magical ingredient wasn't just that.

1778
01:44:47.671 --> 01:44:52.020
There was guys like Barry Crimmins and Lenny Clarke and Steve Sweeney and dawn

1779
01:44:52.021 --> 01:44:55.770
Gavin and Mike Donovan and all these brilliant comedians that we saw that we

1780
01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:59.250
were so lucky to see.
It was also that they,
they were being,

1781
01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:03.450
their audiences were savages.
Yeah.
So they're like,
great,
how about another joke,

1782
01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:06.940
you know?
Great.
How about another one?
Like they'll like kick coming in,

1783
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:10.980
come with the jokes,
jokes.
Like they want joke,
joke,
joke.
Like those guys,

1784
01:45:10.981 --> 01:45:15.180
like when you would watch like Lenny Clarke murderer room,
you,
there was no,

1785
01:45:15.210 --> 01:45:19.050
no one's getting a break.
There's no breathing room.
You just getting pounded.

1786
01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.490
Yeah.
He's just smashing you.

1787
01:45:20.710 --> 01:45:25.410
Like those guys developed in that style where people just were constantly

1788
01:45:25.411 --> 01:45:30.270
wanting to be amused.
Like,
let's go,
let's go with the fucking Mandarin.
Yeah.

1789
01:45:30.690 --> 01:45:31.160
They,

1790
01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.680
<v 1>well,
they want it.
They want it with attitude.</v>

1791
01:45:33.681 --> 01:45:37.280
They were anti authoritarian attitude.
It was always like,

1792
01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:41.310
I remember Kenny Rogers since joke of like,
uh,
I remember,
uh,

1793
01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:44.840
I'm not saying I was drinking a lot,
but I,
uh,
I drove into a lake,

1794
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:49.880
got pulled over by the coast guard.
They said I had been drinking.
I go,

1795
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.380
I'm going to lake.

1796
01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:59.410
It was always just fuck you too with other,
you know.

1797
01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.460
<v 4>Yeah.
Everything was like,
so I'm doing a bump.
Yeah.</v>

1798
01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:06.450
Everything was like do it lines and drinking and chaos.

1799
01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:10.360
<v 1>Yeah.
Jon Tobin who runs the uh,
laugh Boston,
he's telling me this story.</v>

1800
01:46:10.361 --> 01:46:14.080
He's a fucking,
if you ever want to hear Gavin stories for an hour straight,

1801
01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:18.630
go to lunch with Jon Tobin and bring a fucking handkerchief cause he's got Don

1802
01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:19.330
Gavin's stories.

1803
01:46:19.330 --> 01:46:23.110
He's talking about how Gavin who likes to drink white Russians does a late show

1804
01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:28.030
and goes up there and repeats a joke and he walks off stage and one of the

1805
01:46:28.031 --> 01:46:30.100
Comedians goes,
uh,
Don,

1806
01:46:30.101 --> 01:46:34.660
you said the same joke twice up there and he goes records six,

1807
01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.980
<v 4>six times.
Oh my God.
How drunk are you?</v>

1808
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:50.030
Like on death's door?
You're like rubbing your face on door of death

1809
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:51.470
<v 0>will come low,
let me.</v>

1810
01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:55.980
But it's also the not giving a shit that he did it six times and go fuck,

1811
01:46:56.230 --> 01:46:57.330
give a fuck.
Give a fuck.

1812
01:46:57.331 --> 01:47:00.240
He's still didn't give a fuck last time I saw him still don Gavin.

1813
01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.570
How's a slow down drinking?
One hand,
big smile on his face.

1814
01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:07.230
He's always been my favorite.
He's one of the greatest of all time in my opinion.

1815
01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:09.390
From what I've seen.
I mean,

1816
01:47:09.391 --> 01:47:13.170
he was so sharp in the 80s and the early nineties when we were around,

1817
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.930
he was so sharp.
He,
his,

1818
01:47:15.931 --> 01:47:19.290
his punchlines would come one after the other and you didn't see him comment and

1819
01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:23.430
they would just catch you off guard.
Little offbeat punchlines.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1820
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:25.530
We'll throw away like throwaway line.

1821
01:47:25.531 --> 01:47:27.730
That was like some of the funny shit you ever heard that,

1822
01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:31.810
that whole bit that he used to do about going to a salad bar.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1823
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:32.963
He was a murderer.

1824
01:47:33.450 --> 01:47:36.670
<v 1>He goes up front,
they got chickpeas in the back.</v>

1825
01:47:36.671 --> 01:47:38.610
He got the lobster given you the finger,

1826
01:47:41.230 --> 01:47:42.970
<v 0>which is so lucky,
man.
We're so lucky.</v>

1827
01:47:42.971 --> 01:47:46.720
We got to experience that because I think it's so different out here now.

1828
01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.210
Like where we're at now is like,
um,

1829
01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:52.900
like if comedy was an education,

1830
01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:57.840
w were hanging around with a bunch of tenured professors,
right in La.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1831
01:47:58.030 --> 01:48:00.430
Everyone's gotten tenure.
Everyone's like,
uh,
you know,

1832
01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:04.320
whether it's just the neck or you know,
Neal Brennan or you are,

1833
01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:08.680
this is just a gang of headliners,
like a,
a swamp of headliners.

1834
01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:10.930
But when we were doing it,
man,

1835
01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:15.850
it was so uncertain.
There was not,

1836
01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:20.880
there was not that thing where there was like this established community of like

1837
01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.810
nationally touring stand up comedians that you were around all the time.

1838
01:48:25.811 --> 01:48:26.290
You didn't have it.

1839
01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:28.100
<v 1>Yeah.
Nobody had any TV credits,</v>

1840
01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.440
nobody bloody any TV credit.
One headliner.

1841
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:34.750
It was all about,
and the beauty of it was,

1842
01:48:34.751 --> 01:48:38.200
it was a total meritocracy because there were guys like,

1843
01:48:38.230 --> 01:48:39.700
you know Gavin and sweet.
There was,

1844
01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:44.290
there were half a dozen guys that could draw and the rest of us were hired

1845
01:48:44.291 --> 01:48:46.510
because there was a comedy night.

1846
01:48:46.930 --> 01:48:50.950
Somebody's fucking hand drew comedy on a sign and put it in front of a Chinese

1847
01:48:50.951 --> 01:48:54.610
restaurant and you showed up and you've got booked because the booker thought

1848
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:59.150
you could kill.
It's all that mattered was that you could do a good job and said,

1849
01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:00.130
can you do it?

1850
01:49:00.130 --> 01:49:04.840
CanNot their credits you have not one fucking Twitter account you have.

1851
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:07.750
Once you got credit,
so then you could do the road.
That was the difference.
Yeah.

1852
01:49:07.751 --> 01:49:09.310
To get out of Boston.
You needed a credit.

1853
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:11.270
<v 0>Yeah.
When you're doing the road.</v>

1854
01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:14.060
They all wanted to know what TV show you've been on.

1855
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:17.540
They all wanted to know that.
Yeah.
Have you done comedy spotlight?

1856
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:21.890
What about half hour comedy hour?
Have you done this?
If you had HBO special.

1857
01:49:21.891 --> 01:49:24.020
Holy Shit.
Yeah.
That was the bomb.

1858
01:49:24.021 --> 01:49:26.840
Diggity your headline and every club you wanted to,
he goes,

1859
01:49:26.841 --> 01:49:28.520
guys got an HBO special.

1860
01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:33.170
But back then everyone that we knew had nothing.

1861
01:49:33.670 --> 01:49:37.690
<v 1>I remember Budd Friedman came to town in the early nineties when it was evening</v>

1862
01:49:37.691 --> 01:49:42.610
at the Improv was like the original strip shot stand up comedy show that put it

1863
01:49:42.611 --> 01:49:45.550
on the map,
put a and e on the map.
It was their first big show.

1864
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:50.890
I remember he to town and there was a showcase at duck soup and uh,
we all,

1865
01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:54.250
we all went up and then Budd Friedman,
who fucking great guy,

1866
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:59.530
takes us all out to dinner afterwards and sits us down and he goes,

1867
01:49:59.610 --> 01:50:01.990
goes through each of us.
He goes,
you did a great job.

1868
01:50:01.991 --> 01:50:04.310
You need a little bit more work.
I liked that that bit.
You did A,

1869
01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:08.530
and he gets a day Fitzgerald and he goes,
you got it,
you're doing the show.

1870
01:50:08.531 --> 01:50:10.960
And we were just all like fuck

1871
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:15.810
<v 0>Fitzgerald when people thought they forgot about he was very funny.
Yeah,</v>

1872
01:50:15.811 --> 01:50:19.710
he was great.
Very funny.
Tight,
great drinking stories.
Yeah.

1873
01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:23.640
He's another guy that found his a stage legs during alcoholics anonymous

1874
01:50:23.641 --> 01:50:27.990
meetings.
Right.
There's a few of those guys.
He's like,
yeah.
You know,

1875
01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:31.940
they say they say you go to Aa meetings and you end up just getting it

1876
01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:33.720
<v 1>addicted to coffee.
Yeah.</v>

1877
01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:37.770
I never walked out of a Dunkin donuts with the Willdabeast on my arm.

1878
01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:42.740
<v 0>My um,
my um,
my,
um,</v>

1879
01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:48.380
and the more Boston accent you had in Boston,
the more they loved you.
Yeah.

1880
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:52.430
You know?
All right,
Len,
he was the only one who had legitimate credits.

1881
01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.470
Cause at that time,
like even in the 80s,

1882
01:50:54.471 --> 01:50:58.340
Lenny had already been on Rodney Dangerfield special.
The HPO.
Yeah.

1883
01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.230
I think when I worked with them,

1884
01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:02.590
it was after he had been on Rodney Dangerfield saga.

1885
01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:07.190
I had plenty on like three weeks ago,
four weeks ago.

1886
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:11.990
He was a fucking hilarious.
He's still so funny.
Man.
Yeah,
he's all healthy now.

1887
01:51:11.991 --> 01:51:15.530
Totally sober exercises.
But uh,

1888
01:51:15.531 --> 01:51:19.760
I opened up for him like the second time I ever got paid and I think it was

1889
01:51:19.761 --> 01:51:23.810
after he had already been on Hbo,
I think it was like right afterwards.

1890
01:51:23.811 --> 01:51:28.610
So he was a terribly partying with Kennison and he was in the middle of like
his,

1891
01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:31.730
his run where he started.
Got You've got a television show out here.

1892
01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:33.680
He talked about that too,

1893
01:51:33.681 --> 01:51:37.580
about how he got ripped off his agents stole all of his money.
No Shit.

1894
01:51:37.581 --> 01:51:40.070
You don't know that story.
Oh God.
I'll send you the link.

1895
01:51:40.410 --> 01:51:43.070
I don't want to repeat the story cause you want to,
you want to hear him say

1896
01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:47.930
<v 1>wow.
There was a big scandal.
Those,
his thinking was called spotlight agency.</v>

1897
01:51:47.931 --> 01:51:51.950
I forget what the spotlight number.
They stole everybody's money.
Yep.
Yeah,

1898
01:51:51.951 --> 01:51:55.730
they still Landry buddy's money.
Yeah.
One agent just,
yeah,

1899
01:51:55.731 --> 01:51:59.160
they used to put a lot of colleges and stuff.
Um,
but,
uh,

1900
01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:03.710
but there's a story about how Jim Mccauley,
who booked the tonight show forever,

1901
01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.200
he said he'd heard about Boston and he's like,

1902
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:10.280
and they're telling me this is back in like maybe the mid eighties and they're

1903
01:52:10.281 --> 01:52:12.800
telling them about how you got to go to Boston.

1904
01:52:12.801 --> 01:52:14.990
All the great comics are in Boston now you've got to,
you know,

1905
01:52:14.991 --> 01:52:16.460
talking about all the names we just said.

1906
01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:21.110
So he sets up a showcase at the,
what was that?

1907
01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.390
That Chinese restaurant that was like the original

1908
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:27.540
<v 0>room.
Which one?
Cow loon.</v>

1909
01:52:27.710 --> 01:52:30.650
<v 1>No beef.
Way Back.
Oh,
the Ding Ho.</v>

1910
01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:34.880
They set up a showcase of the Ding Ho and all the guys come down and they're in

1911
01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:38.630
the green room and they're drinking,
they're doing blow,

1912
01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.920
they're cracking each other up and they all go up there and they do fucking,

1913
01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.490
you know,

1914
01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:48.140
local references and they're doing jokes about the Boston accent.

1915
01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:51.380
And Mccall is just sitting there going,
what the fuck is going on in here?

1916
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.550
And then Steven,
right?
Yeah,

1917
01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:56.400
<v 0>goes up.
And he does Steven Wright and,</v>

1918
01:52:56.730 --> 01:52:59.760
<v 1>and they find out a couple of days later,
nobody got it.</v>

1919
01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:04.200
Except Steven Wright and Steven,
right at that time,
Lenny told him,

1920
01:53:04.230 --> 01:53:08.580
I think it was Lenny,
one of them sat Steven Wright down and goes,
Steve,

1921
01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:11.760
you're a sweet guy.
You're terrific kid.
This isn't for you.

1922
01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:16.500
Because he used to bomb and Boston because he was,
he was monotone and you know,

1923
01:53:16.501 --> 01:53:20.040
he was doing his shtick and it didn't play in Boston.
We did for these guys.

1924
01:53:20.041 --> 01:53:24.750
They told him you should stop.
And then he got the tonight show.
They fly him out.

1925
01:53:24.810 --> 01:53:29.490
He does a set.
Johnny liked him so much.
They said,
can you stay another week?

1926
01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:30.960
Did another spot.

1927
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:35.990
And in that first year he must've done for tonight shows and he became fucking

1928
01:53:36.571 --> 01:53:39.310
huge.
You've got a special out of it and they're all sitting at home,

1929
01:53:39.311 --> 01:53:42.210
gone like I fucking killed that night.
He didn't kill him.

1930
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:49.260
<v 0>Yeah.
Whoops.
Tell him to quit.
That's hilarious.</v>

1931
01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:52.650
Comedy.
The only been around for 30 years.
Yeah.
You tell him to quit.

1932
01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:56.600
Nobody knows how to do it yet.
All right.
You don't imagine I'm,

1933
01:53:56.710 --> 01:54:00.780
I'm an expert in this.
You gotta quit like nobody.

1934
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:02.910
Nobody can really tell you that.

1935
01:54:02.911 --> 01:54:07.590
You can never figure it out because comedy is not that different than anything

1936
01:54:07.591 --> 01:54:10.920
else.
And that if you really put a lot of time and effort and attention to it,

1937
01:54:10.921 --> 01:54:15.630
you get better at it.
So if you've got any laughs at all you can get,

1938
01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:19.560
you might not be doing it the right way,
but that's part of the process,
right?

1939
01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:23.340
<v 1>Yeah.
I think George Carlin said,
no matter how bad a comedian is,</v>

1940
01:54:23.341 --> 01:54:27.840
there's always one joke in his act that I go,
God,
I wish I wrote that joke.

1941
01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:31.590
And if you have that one joke,
it means you're capable of writing one.
Yes.

1942
01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:36.540
And sometimes your life changes and it puts you in a different space that makes

1943
01:54:36.541 --> 01:54:39.390
you a better comedian,
whether it's your performance of your writing,

1944
01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:44.340
but we go and comedy is,
it's a,
uh,

1945
01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:47.820
you're displaying what's going on inside of you.
When you're on stage,

1946
01:54:47.821 --> 01:54:50.910
on some level,
your anger,
your fear,
whatever it is,

1947
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:52.560
it comes out in your performance.

1948
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:55.350
And so if something changes fundamentally in your life,

1949
01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:58.590
sometimes it's getting married,
sometimes your father dies,
whatever.

1950
01:54:58.830 --> 01:55:02.940
You see people change,
they get sober and they can,
they can suddenly get good.

1951
01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:07.730
<v 0>Yeah.
It can happen.
If it's like anything else in your life,</v>

1952
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:10.970
you run into someone,
they lost a hundred pounds.
Like what the fuck?

1953
01:55:10.971 --> 01:55:14.810
You lost a hundred pounds.
How did you do it?
I just made a change.

1954
01:55:14.811 --> 01:55:17.810
I just decided I'm not doing that anymore.
I'm going to live my life different.

1955
01:55:17.811 --> 01:55:21.710
And then I started riding that momentum and then here we are 16 months later.

1956
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.030
Yeah.
That could happen with anything.

1957
01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:26.890
<v 1>I remember Jim Norton when he started,
wasn't that funny,</v>

1958
01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.810
struggled and all of a sudden boom found his voice.
He's fucking great.

1959
01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:35.310
<v 0>Yeah.
It's weird when someone can't find their voice,
right.</v>

1960
01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:38.880
It's like there's that uncertainty of life.

1961
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:43.410
Is this going to work out?
Yeah.
My wasting my time then find it.

1962
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:47.340
Yeah.
Or not or not.
You know.
And,
and again,

1963
01:55:47.341 --> 01:55:51.750
it's dependent also about how good are you at recognizing when you fucking up

1964
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:55.530
how good at you or do you gloss over mistakes or do you examine them and learn

1965
01:55:55.531 --> 01:55:58.200
from them?
Cause if you gloss over,
God damn,

1966
01:55:58.201 --> 01:56:01.260
it takes forever to figure it out because you've got to play little games with

1967
01:56:01.261 --> 01:56:04.460
yourself and pretend you didn't do bad.
So if you didn't do bad,

1968
01:56:04.461 --> 01:56:06.540
you don't feel bad.
If you don't feel bad,
you're not going to change.

1969
01:56:06.710 --> 01:56:09.510
Like that's part of the reason that exists,
that,

1970
01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.150
that horrible feeling when you fuck something up like

1971
01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:17.070
that is so that's the,
the back,

1972
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:21.120
that's the biological buzz.
Like,
hey fuck face,

1973
01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:24.900
you lost.
This is bad.
Figure this out.

1974
01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:27.870
But if you can lie to yourself,
you don't feel that ballsy.
Like,

1975
01:56:27.871 --> 01:56:31.070
oh mum didn't find it.
It was amazing.
[inaudible] crowd socked.

1976
01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:34.800
<v 1>Well that's why getting sober can can affect that change because that's</v>

1977
01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:37.470
ultimately what sobriety is.
You know,
if you have a problem,

1978
01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:42.180
you keep lying to yourself and you go,
you know,
I'm fine.
It was just last night.

1979
01:56:42.181 --> 01:56:43.410
I'm not gonna do that again.

1980
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:48.240
<v 0>Yeah.
Or you can say it was that crowd.
And then you know,</v>

1981
01:56:48.241 --> 01:56:52.410
you'll see them struggle in some sort of weird way.
But comedy is,

1982
01:56:52.670 --> 01:56:56.790
it's so Aben flow dependent on day to day.

1983
01:56:56.791 --> 01:56:59.160
It's like talking to people,
you know,

1984
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:03.420
you talking to people on a day to day basis,

1985
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:05.250
like the people are different data day,

1986
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:09.570
they subtly this way or that way and when you get enough people in a fucking

1987
01:57:09.571 --> 01:57:13.920
room and the drink and it's weird and then maybe you're a little tired and then

1988
01:57:13.921 --> 01:57:16.560
it comes off strange like,
God,
that's,
that sucked.

1989
01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:19.620
I need to get another set under my belt and then the next set like Paul,

1990
01:57:19.621 --> 01:57:22.770
I don't want it to be like that last set something up,
fire the fuck up and then,

1991
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:26.310
oh,
this one's good,
good,
good.
Let me relax now.

1992
01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.500
Just I don't have to work that hard.

1993
01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:31.470
<v 1>How tall is set?
Sorry</v>

1994
01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:35.930
<v 0>motherfucker.
And then you're like,
okay,
we're playing this game.
Are We?
Yeah,</v>

1995
01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:36.913
that's the process.

1996
01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:40.420
<v 1>Yeah.
And if I never have a better set than after</v>

1997
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:43.810
<v 0>a bad set.
Always.
You're on your toes.
Yeah.</v>

1998
01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:47.790
I tried to play a little game with myself where I pretend I just ate shit before

1999
01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:51.010
I go on.
Say the pretentious ain't shit,
here's my chance to redeem myself.

2000
01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.480
Let's go.
Ah,
yeah.
I play little games with myself sometimes.

2001
01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:59.740
<v 1>I had the last night I had a,
who was sitting in the crowd?
Oh,</v>

2002
01:57:59.741 --> 01:58:03.750
Andy kindler was sitting in the crowd with son of a bitch.
Sorry.

2003
01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:07.780
Just kidding.
Andy and a,
I love that idea.

2004
01:58:07.930 --> 01:58:09.970
And who the fuck else was out there?
Oh,

2005
01:58:09.971 --> 01:58:14.971
and a Harland Williams who are both like such interesting comedians that they're

2006
01:58:15.701 --> 01:58:19.150
watching me.
And you feel,
I usually don't give a fuck who's watching me.

2007
01:58:19.151 --> 01:58:23.050
But last night was the Improv and it was like nobody there and I felt like I

2008
01:58:23.051 --> 01:58:26.380
can't mail it in with a regular set.
I gotta fuck around here a little bit.

2009
01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.950
And I had just had a fucking great sad because it,
it made me dig in a little.

2010
01:58:30.951 --> 01:58:31.540
Yeah.

2011
01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:32.850
<v 0>Yes,
yes.</v>

2012
01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:36.090
That's one of the really good aspects about the comedy store these days too.

2013
01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:39.950
I said there's always people that you respect in the room.
Yeah.
Zoe,

2014
01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:44.230
someone there,
right is always Ronald whites there.
You know,
fast.

2015
01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:46.420
Jen gave me a big compliment the other night.
I,

2016
01:58:46.421 --> 01:58:50.980
one of my jokes that felt nice that Sebastian is the guy that struggled,

2017
01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:54.460
struggled kitty or early on,
I didn't know,
had a hard time,

2018
01:58:54.690 --> 01:58:57.180
had a hard time finding his voice and uh,

2019
01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:01.000
I didn't get a chance to see how good he had become.

2020
01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:05.260
And I watched him on showtime in a hotel room in Vegas.

2021
01:59:05.650 --> 01:59:09.000
I was there for a UFC or something and I watched a Sebastian,

2022
01:59:09.001 --> 01:59:12.850
I'll show showtime special.
And I was like,
God damn,
this is good.

2023
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.060
I think I tweeted about it.
I eat either tweeted it or I emailed him.

2024
01:59:16.061 --> 01:59:20.330
I don't remember which,
where I was like,
that is fucking,
he's fucking good.
Yeah.

2025
01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:24.670
[inaudible] I watched him at the store the other night.
I mean,
Jesus,

2026
01:59:24.671 --> 01:59:29.110
he is bigger than life up there.
He just dominates the room.

2027
01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:33.310
She's very good.
And it took awhile.
It took awhile for him to find that thing.

2028
01:59:33.311 --> 01:59:37.830
And it happened while I was,
I was not around the comedy store's,

2029
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.230
I really didn't get a chance to see his sets.
So before he was funny,

2030
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:44.100
he was funny,
but he would have good sets and bad sets.
Who'd,

2031
01:59:44.170 --> 01:59:48.110
it was kind of struggling a little bit,
but then he found it.
Yeah,

2032
01:59:48.250 --> 01:59:51.370
just took his time.
Worked hard.
Always hustled.

2033
01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:56.230
Founded Jessel next,
last special.
I was so fucking good.

2034
01:59:56.231 --> 01:59:59.440
He's so good.
I mean it's like I've always liked them.

2035
01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:03.100
I've always enjoyed why and I don't watch people's whole hour.
Rarely,

2036
02:00:03.101 --> 02:00:07.330
but I've always watched his whole hours.
His writing is just so like intensely.

2037
02:00:07.331 --> 02:00:08.890
It's,
he's a craftsman.

2038
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:13.260
He works hard and there is 2013 to Curtis personal hotel room laugh.

2039
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:17.890
I also let's park.
Yes.
Sexy Bitch.
Yeah,

2040
02:00:17.891 --> 02:00:18.491
that was too,

2041
02:00:18.491 --> 02:00:23.080
so that was 2013 I had been a still out of the store.

2042
02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:25.390
I'd been out of the store for like a,

2043
02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:30.010
at that point shit was six years.

2044
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:34.240
I hadn't been in the store in six years.
Specialist.
Excellent.

2045
02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:39.160
I just love guys like him and [inaudible] and Harlan's.

2046
02:00:39.161 --> 02:00:44.140
What one of those guys too that they're comedies is very specific to them.

2047
02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:45.550
They're like,

2048
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:49.390
Brody was a great example that Brody's comedy is so specific to Brody.

2049
02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:54.040
Like if you see eight one eight to like die,
like why is that funny to you?

2050
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:55.030
But to you,
would you like,

2051
02:00:55.031 --> 02:00:58.990
you immediately got a smile thinking about Brody saying it because comedy was so

2052
02:00:58.991 --> 02:01:00.190
specific to him.

2053
02:01:02.050 --> 02:01:05.140
I was a male model in Pakistan.

2054
02:01:05.650 --> 02:01:07.120
I was on the cover of camel beat.

2055
02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:12.850
Oh,
he was so funny.

2056
02:01:12.851 --> 02:01:16.560
We would ask him to do those jokes to and do the male model joke.
Hey,

2057
02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.600
you'd yell out to them.
Brody,
did you ever do any modeling?

2058
02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:23.260
Funny ask yet.
Brogan supportive.

2059
02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:27.650
I go,
Brody,
how did you get to the store tonight?
Laci,

2060
02:01:27.810 --> 02:01:32.650
Yana God north took it to sand the send day.

2061
02:01:32.670 --> 02:01:37.510
He would just say names of roads in La for five minutes and it was funny.

2062
02:01:37.511 --> 02:01:40.100
For whatever reason,
God,
I miss that guy.

2063
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.090
<v 1>He was like,</v>

2064
02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:46.370
to me it was always like he was trying to make people laugh and he was also

2065
02:01:46.371 --> 02:01:50.900
trying to blow himself up.
He was trying to fill himself up.
He was like,

2066
02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:54.950
he was doing self affirmations with his comedy.
He wasn't boasting.

2067
02:01:55.130 --> 02:01:57.810
He was trying to convince himself that he was good enough to be up

2068
02:01:57.830 --> 02:02:00.350
<v 0>there forever.
In my office.</v>

2069
02:02:00.351 --> 02:02:05.120
I had a photo laminated photo that said office depot employee of the month and

2070
02:02:05.121 --> 02:02:09.530
it was Brody.
He took this photo.
It was like what he was using as a head shot.

2071
02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:14.990
I kept it just to give you a smile.
Yeah,
I was riding,

2072
02:02:14.991 --> 02:02:17.990
I put it up on my little cork board.
See if you can find that man.

2073
02:02:17.991 --> 02:02:20.690
I needed to get another one of those.
I don't know what the fuck happened to it

2074
02:02:20.970 --> 02:02:23.310
<v 1>when he died.
I've never seen,</v>

2075
02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:26.820
I don't think I've ever seen a turnout for a comedian dying.

2076
02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:31.880
<v 0>Is it the way his memorial was that was laminated in my office.</v>

2077
02:02:33.090 --> 02:02:36.000
Please do me a favor and print that up and let's get it.

2078
02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:40.030
Get that turned into another one that I put in my office because I,
uh,

2079
02:02:40.050 --> 02:02:44.620
somewhere in the move from,
um,
this studio from the old studio,

2080
02:02:44.670 --> 02:02:49.590
the studio,
I lost it,
but I always had that in my office.

2081
02:02:49.610 --> 02:02:54.450
It's just to look at just cause Brody was just so Brody.

2082
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:59.100
Yeah,
he was just open,
raw and he,
you know,

2083
02:02:59.190 --> 02:03:04.020
he was one of those guys where you really have to be there.
You have to see him.

2084
02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:07.710
Yeah.
He's,
he's not,
he doesn't translate.

2085
02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:11.400
No one translates a hundred that's a dirty little secret about comedy specials.

2086
02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:16.260
You don't translate 100% of what you're experiencing when you're in that room.

2087
02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.990
That's why you're writing has to be even sharper and your,

2088
02:03:18.991 --> 02:03:21.480
your act outs have to be even sharper.

2089
02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:25.440
Everything has to be tightened down because you're not experiencing the physical

2090
02:03:25.441 --> 02:03:30.390
presence of all the audience members and the comedian all in this room together

2091
02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:31.800
because it's an intangible.
Right.

2092
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:35.610
So if like going to see you live at the Wilbur theater,

2093
02:03:35.611 --> 02:03:40.570
if that's 100% watch new on Netflix is like 80% yeah.

2094
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:44.340
The takeaway,
all the other people,
there's no other people there.
It's just you.

2095
02:03:44.490 --> 02:03:46.560
You can pretend they're there,
but they're not there.

2096
02:03:46.890 --> 02:03:49.950
So you don't have that feeling of being in a public place with a bunch of other

2097
02:03:49.951 --> 02:03:53.430
people which lights you up and then you don't have the comic that you came to

2098
02:03:53.431 --> 02:03:56.580
see right in front of you.
You don't have that.
Yeah,
you don't have the air.

2099
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:59.400
You're all sharing the same air.
You're all in the room together.

2100
02:03:59.401 --> 02:04:03.570
You feel each other and some sort of a weird way,
so it's like 20% of every show

2101
02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:07.980
<v 1>is also the momentum of like if you cut,
if you come to a comedy show,</v>

2102
02:04:07.981 --> 02:04:12.930
you're surrounded by people that have an agenda to laugh.
They got a babysitter,

2103
02:04:12.931 --> 02:04:14.910
they paid money,
they sat down.

2104
02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:18.660
They are motivated to laugh and so now you're surrounded by,

2105
02:04:18.661 --> 02:04:19.680
if you're the Wilbur theater,

2106
02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:22.860
you've got a thousand people that all have that energy together.

2107
02:04:23.130 --> 02:04:27.540
You're sitting in your underwear under a blanket on a couch watching a show.

2108
02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:30.690
<v 0>Yeah.
It's 80% though.
For the most part.
Yeah.</v>

2109
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:36.030
Maybe s might be in the 70s 79% what's the best standup comedy special of all in

2110
02:04:37.261 --> 02:04:40.500
your mind?
There are error dependent.

2111
02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:44.940
The thing about them is none of them really last.
They're not,

2112
02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:48.360
it's a comedy is one of the most,
um,

2113
02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:54.230
rapidly depreciating art forms in the culture in terms of its staying power and

2114
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.400
try it.
Try and watch a movie we loved in the 80s try to watch a comedy movie.

2115
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:04.860
My kids,
let's get me and they go,
why are you showing me garbage?

2116
02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:09.270
Yeah.
Yeah.
A few of them stand up blues,
blues brothers.
Sure.
Yeah.

2117
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:13.890
But does it really,
it stands up because it's a classic,
but if it came out today,

2118
02:05:13.891 --> 02:05:18.210
would it be that much on the classic?
Probably not.
Things change.

2119
02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:22.920
They evolve in comedy.
They evolve rapidly and they're unforgiving.

2120
02:05:23.550 --> 02:05:24.900
Like I always say Lenny Bruce,

2121
02:05:24.901 --> 02:05:29.430
who I think is the main guy that started this whole thing,
he started it.

2122
02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:31.980
I mean there was other guys that were kind of doing it,
you know,

2123
02:05:31.981 --> 02:05:36.960
there's Mort Sahl,
there's a few guys who were doing,
you know,
some similar stuff.

2124
02:05:36.961 --> 02:05:38.340
I'm sure that didn't become famous.

2125
02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:43.700
But as far as guys that became famous at that time who are genuinely regarded

2126
02:05:44.541 --> 02:05:48.810
almost universally as being brilliant comedians.
Lenny Bruce was the Mac Daddy,

2127
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:51.000
like he was a guy who did all the television shows.

2128
02:05:51.001 --> 02:05:54.430
He did all those shows and they wanted him to come on and he was brilliant and

2129
02:05:54.431 --> 02:05:58.860
he would go on there with great material and it was clean and then he morphed,

2130
02:05:59.080 --> 02:05:59.371
you know,

2131
02:05:59.371 --> 02:06:03.780
he just kept expanding and morphing and he got more into drugs and just started,

2132
02:06:03.781 --> 02:06:07.110
just just at the end of his career was really losing its fucking mind.

2133
02:06:07.111 --> 02:06:11.400
He was just fighting these obscenity cases and he was taught going on stages,

2134
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:15.810
videos of him.
You could watch videos of him of that.
He could buy that.

2135
02:06:15.811 --> 02:06:20.250
I bought VHS tapes of back in the day where he would read the transcripts of his

2136
02:06:20.251 --> 02:06:24.360
trial on stage and people would like tell jokes,
come on,

2137
02:06:24.361 --> 02:06:28.410
where's the fucking jokes?
Like in the end he just completely went off the rails.

2138
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:30.660
Right.
But his,

2139
02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:34.200
his steps I think were the first steps of modern standup comedy.

2140
02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:37.800
So anything he did was the greatest thing of all time back then.

2141
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:40.350
You watch it now and then it doesn't hold on.

2142
02:06:40.351 --> 02:06:45.060
Holland does not hold up at all at all.
Neither does a lot of other books.

2143
02:06:45.150 --> 02:06:49.310
Prior holds up.
Prior holds out.
Yeah.
Prior holds up.
Lear,
um,
uh,

2144
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:52.360
Hicks holds up,
but in a weird way.
Yeah.

2145
02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:56.160
Hix holds up in a way where you're,
you're realizing like,
wow,

2146
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:59.460
this guy was doing some shit that no one else was doing back then.

2147
02:06:59.850 --> 02:07:03.330
Like young man on acid realized that life is just,
you know,
you know,

2148
02:07:03.331 --> 02:07:06.180
the whole bit that he does about positive stories in the,
in the news.

2149
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:08.490
I remember exactly how the bit worse,
but it's hilarious.

2150
02:07:08.491 --> 02:07:11.550
Bit like that's a brilliant pit.
Yeah.
Well crafted bit.

2151
02:07:11.551 --> 02:07:14.720
He had a lot of those old people should do stunts in movies.

2152
02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:20.610
Yeah.
That was,
yeah.
I mean,
he had some great shit,
man.

2153
02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:23.730
They were great bits.
He was a different guy.

2154
02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:27.230
What he did is he like made people,
um,

2155
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:31.800
in the audience think about ideas that you probably wouldn't have thought about

2156
02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:35.320
if not for his act.
And he challenged you to be smarter.

2157
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.530
<v 4>Like though there's part of that,
one of the things that Hicks was doing,</v>

2158
02:07:38.531 --> 02:07:42.260
it was like he was his like,
Kinison went this way,
right?
Kinison was like,

2159
02:07:42.330 --> 02:07:45.490
<v 1>Ronald Reagan,
the fucking president.
We're going to kick ass.</v>

2160
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:50.470
<v 4>Yeah,
he went.
But he was also smart and he had great points.</v>

2161
02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:54.940
Like the only reason why that bit about the African people that were starving to

2162
02:07:54.941 --> 02:07:58.030
death,
that bed about those late night television shows,

2163
02:07:58.090 --> 02:08:01.090
which is one of his darkest pits ever,
and one of his best bits.

2164
02:08:01.690 --> 02:08:03.590
But this,
it,

2165
02:08:04.450 --> 02:08:08.620
it worked because he was smart because he had points that were irrefutable.

2166
02:08:08.710 --> 02:08:11.830
It wasn't just these African kids starving to death.

2167
02:08:11.831 --> 02:08:13.990
Let me tell you what's funny about that.
Nothing's funny about that.

2168
02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:15.300
It was him saying,

2169
02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:17.030
<v 1>why don't you feed them?
You're right.</v>

2170
02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:18.790
<v 4>And,</v>

2171
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:23.790
and then he would have these kind of bits that were fucked up,

2172
02:08:25.190 --> 02:08:29.240
but there was so well crafted.
You like,
Jesus,
this guy,

2173
02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:30.470
this is so good.

2174
02:08:30.471 --> 02:08:34.400
And so for then he was the greatest of all time when kid isn't came along,
man,

2175
02:08:34.401 --> 02:08:38.300
he was a mother fucker.
No one had ever seen anything like that before.

2176
02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:41.910
<v 1>Yeah.
I remember how much you were affected by him,
you and Mike McDonald.</v>

2177
02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:46.580
He was fucking Mike McCarthy.
Mccarthy.
Fuck comedy Barbaria.
Yeah,

2178
02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:47.683
yeah,

2179
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:52.660
<v 4>yeah.
We both were huge.
Kinison fast.
He just made me think,</v>

2180
02:08:52.690 --> 02:08:54.280
oh,
that's comedy too.

2181
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:56.770
I didn't know you could do that if that's a different thing.

2182
02:08:56.771 --> 02:08:58.190
This guy's screaming.

2183
02:08:58.220 --> 02:08:59.810
<v 1>I was married twice</v>

2184
02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:06.230
and he was fat and he had a Baret od overcoat and he would come into the stern

2185
02:09:06.231 --> 02:09:10.010
show drunk after being up all night and do without a doubt.

2186
02:09:10.011 --> 02:09:11.780
The best darn appearances of all time.

2187
02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:15.600
<v 4>Yeah.
You know his story too,
right?
Do you know what chair?
Right?</v>

2188
02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:20.200
You know what flipped him though?
Head injury hit by a car.
No Shit.
Yup.

2189
02:09:20.210 --> 02:09:23.040
Him and Roseanne.
Both the same story.
Wow.
Yup.

2190
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:28.010
There's something about traumatic brain injuries that lead to a lot of people

2191
02:09:28.011 --> 02:09:32.930
being extremely impulsive and they wind up doing a lot of wild shit.

2192
02:09:33.230 --> 02:09:35.120
Tj Miller hold themselves.
Yeah.

2193
02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:39.670
<v 1>He had some kind of a brain thing happened to him and he needed a,</v>

2194
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.400
he got treated for it and he recovered.

2195
02:09:42.401 --> 02:09:44.770
But that's when he started acting kind of erratic.

2196
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:47.020
<v 4>Whoa.
Yeah.
It happens.</v>

2197
02:09:47.230 --> 02:09:51.130
People get irrational and you get impulsive,
get very impulsive.

2198
02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:55.270
Happens with ex football players,
ex fighters.
Right.
Um,

2199
02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.580
but that's what happened to Sam.
He got hit by a car.

2200
02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:02.170
His brother wrote a book about it called brother Sam as brother Bill.
And uh,

2201
02:10:02.171 --> 02:10:05.020
that's one of the things it talks about.
Like Sam was like this normal kid.

2202
02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:08.200
It gets hit by a fucking car and then all of a sudden he's is wild man.

2203
02:10:08.201 --> 02:10:12.880
Like wild demon and no control.
Just didn't give a fuck.
Right.
You know,

2204
02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:18.100
that's a guy that I wish I met and like,
Fuck God.
Damn it with a low,

2205
02:10:18.101 --> 02:10:22.250
I really wanted to meet that goal.
We did mean heck we softly,

2206
02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:24.790
we were in the room with him.
We didn't hang out with them.

2207
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:27.640
Or he said hi to him in the green room.
That was about it.
Oh yeah.

2208
02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:31.490
<v 1>I always think of that when like a young comic comes to the Green Room to say hi</v>

2209
02:10:31.491 --> 02:10:34.070
to me.
I always think fucking be

2210
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:38.300
<v 2>nice to this kid because this means more to him than you can imagine.
Fuck yeah.</v>

2211
02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:42.950
Just the fact that Hicks acknowledged I was alive.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2212
02:10:43.050 --> 02:10:47.120
We got,
we've got amazing comedy education,
my friend.
Yeah.

2213
02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:51.920
It's so lucky to have a job where you could say what you want to and you don't

2214
02:10:51.921 --> 02:10:55.430
have to worry like that.
Poor Lpg,
a guy,

2215
02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:58.700
Cork Golf Guy,
kid suspended.
Well,

2216
02:10:58.701 --> 02:11:01.580
especially now because like it really TV,
doesn't matter.

2217
02:11:01.581 --> 02:11:04.550
Being banned from TV doesn't end your career anymore.
No.
No.

2218
02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:09.560
Look if fucking Jim Jeffrey says some shit that's fucking crazy.

2219
02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:14.570
He says his whole bit about rape that like,
I couldn't believe they,

2220
02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:19.130
it was on Sirius XM radio the other day and like,
you know,
his show got canceled.

2221
02:11:19.131 --> 02:11:22.760
He's got another fucking show.
But without those,
it doesn't matter.
You get,

2222
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.060
you get your shit up on the Internet,
you do a podcast,
the tour.

2223
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:30.830
You don't ever have to do the tonight show again.
You don't have to do,
you know?

2224
02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.490
Yeah.
There was only a few avenues back then.
Yeah,
Santa Fe.
Right.

2225
02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:39.830
So those would be good.
Yeah.
You just have to be interesting or not even,
man.

2226
02:11:39.831 --> 02:11:43.000
I mean there's a lot of fucking people that just do makeup tutorials and then

2227
02:11:43.001 --> 02:11:45.100
make millions.
The world's crazy.
Yeah,

2228
02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:46.580
but don't think that it's supposed to be fair.

2229
02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:50.510
Like all those guys back in Boston.
Hey,
what the fuck I killed that night.

2230
02:11:50.511 --> 02:11:52.730
Same thing.
Yeah.
I don't think this world's supposed to be fair.

2231
02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:55.040
This thing is not this thing.
No one knows what the fuck is going on.

2232
02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:59.510
This kid is making $30 million review and toys on Youtube.
Yep.

2233
02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:02.690
That's just how it is.
Cause he loves toys and that's what he started.
Dylan,

2234
02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.840
what do you love?
No,
do it.
It's just that's how it is.

2235
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:09.170
Like you're getting upset about that.
It doesn't help anybody.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2236
02:12:09.171 --> 02:12:12.920
The kid makes 30 million review and toys.
Go figure it out.
So you're thinking,

2237
02:12:12.921 --> 02:12:17.180
oh yeah,
we'll get him mad at the kid.
Fuck that kid.
Yeah,
I got money.

2238
02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:21.760
I just want 1 million a year.
At all and want from you.
Come on kid.
Hey,

2239
02:12:21.850 --> 02:12:24.860
he'll give it to me.
You're not even gonna use it.
You're seven.
I was a veteran.

2240
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.380
It some veteran reviewing Tillys online.

2241
02:12:28.410 --> 02:12:31.900
Get 12 [inaudible] is for good little queers.

2242
02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:36.350
It's fucking dog.
This little doll.

2243
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:41.570
This fucking soldier never saw the shit.
I saw the shit.
Yeah.

2244
02:12:41.571 --> 02:12:45.880
This is this fake GI Joe Bullshit fucking soldier.
Yeah.
What,

2245
02:12:45.881 --> 02:12:49.460
what is the next thing?
Like it's not veterans review and toys.

2246
02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:51.920
It's not going to be that.
But what would be the next thing?

2247
02:12:53.690 --> 02:12:54.890
The next thing.

2248
02:12:58.210 --> 02:13:02.380
So I think it's gotta be,
it's gotta be something that,

2249
02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.100
that like lets people interact more.

2250
02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:09.700
That's what people are looking for.
I mean,
you've got social apps,

2251
02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:13.810
but how do you take a social app and make it something that you sit down and

2252
02:13:13.811 --> 02:13:18.790
watch every day as programming?
Right.
Let's do that.

2253
02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:20.770
What's the clip show or what's the,

2254
02:13:21.730 --> 02:13:26.730
who is the host that can take social media and do like with talk soup did with

2255
02:13:29.051 --> 02:13:32.010
uh,
with video clip,
with cable,

2256
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.250
<v 0>cable TV shows.</v>

2257
02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:39.540
How do you capture social media and present it to people?

2258
02:13:39.541 --> 02:13:41.940
In a way that is more linear.
Well,

2259
02:13:41.941 --> 02:13:46.560
the thing is like everybody's sort of agreeing that social media is insanely

2260
02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:50.220
addictive and that people are sort of in denial about it.

2261
02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:55.350
Most people have a real issue with it.
Yeah.
Most people that I know,
um,

2262
02:13:55.590 --> 02:13:59.550
or their phones there stare at their phones all day,
they can't help it.

2263
02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:03.780
They're that drawn to the next text message.
They want the next tweet,
tweet,

2264
02:14:03.930 --> 02:14:05.090
whatever it is.
Yeah.
They want,

2265
02:14:05.150 --> 02:14:08.070
they want to see that next Facebook posts and Instagram posts.

2266
02:14:08.071 --> 02:14:11.690
They're addicted to it.
And what,

2267
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:16.350
what we're doing is making it more,

2268
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:21.720
more addictive.
They're making it better.
Right?
Everything keeps getting better.

2269
02:14:21.721 --> 02:14:24.150
The cameras keep getting better.
The apps are better,

2270
02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:26.040
<v 1>the algorithms,</v>

2271
02:14:26.041 --> 02:14:31.041
they figure out how long it should take to reload and to move to another page

2272
02:14:31.171 --> 02:14:32.550
and went to present the next,

2273
02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:37.020
the next graphic that all that stuff is the same guys that figured out how slot

2274
02:14:37.021 --> 02:14:39.870
machines should work in Vegas to keep you putting quarters into them.

2275
02:14:40.270 --> 02:14:44.100
They figure out how often you need to win and uh,
how,

2276
02:14:44.101 --> 02:14:45.570
how loud the bells should be.

2277
02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:47.690
<v 0>And they extract your data,
right,</v>

2278
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:52.940
and then they sell that data and then they make infinite amounts of money and

2279
02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.740
they want to keep you on the tit and so they're going to keep that touch.

2280
02:14:56.750 --> 02:15:00.650
You see all kinds of new stuff.
What about these anti-vaxxers?

2281
02:15:00.651 --> 02:15:03.800
They're moving into your neighborhood.
What?
Fucked.
Yeah.
Next.

2282
02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.390
You know you're embroiled in a Facebook anti vaccs debate that keeps you up in

2283
02:15:08.391 --> 02:15:09.830
the middle of the night.
You go back to chuck the post.

2284
02:15:09.831 --> 02:15:12.280
What the fuck did you right the fuck did he wrote,
Oh,

2285
02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:15.870
he's got to go to sleep and now I'm going to let him know,
oh,
my COO.

2286
02:15:15.871 --> 02:15:17.060
My piece of my mind.

2287
02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:20.600
How many people are just ready to blow their fucking brains out sand in front of

2288
02:15:20.601 --> 02:15:24.770
the computer at night and arguments with people on Facebook?
Yeah.

2289
02:15:25.130 --> 02:15:29.030
First of all,
that is one of the worst ways to communicate.

2290
02:15:29.031 --> 02:15:31.370
I understand that it's a really effective way to communicate,

2291
02:15:31.371 --> 02:15:35.980
but just text messages,
just text,
just writing things back.

2292
02:15:36.030 --> 02:15:38.370
It's like one of the crude is ways that we know it's,

2293
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:41.510
he might as well send a raven.
Yeah,
really right.

2294
02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:45.470
Wrap a fucking a piece of paper around that Ravens Foot and send it and I'll

2295
02:15:45.471 --> 02:15:47.660
read it when I,
okay,
this is what he means.
Yeah.

2296
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:49.950
Like we could talk to each other now.
Like it's,

2297
02:15:50.010 --> 02:15:53.570
we should limit the amount of texting we do.
I really think,
well what did

2298
02:15:53.610 --> 02:15:57.770
<v 1>about video texts.
Yeah.
I haven't seen much of that.
A lot of,
hey Joe,</v>

2299
02:15:57.771 --> 02:15:59.450
what's happened to man?
Give me a call later

2300
02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:01.720
<v 0>sand.
That's cause you're white.
Yesterday,</v>

2301
02:16:01.721 --> 02:16:06.220
Wiz Khalifa was here and he was saying that everybody facetimes now.
Hell yeah.

2302
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.900
And the,

2303
02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:10.750
I know this for a fact because I was taking a shit when killer Mike facetime to

2304
02:16:10.751 --> 02:16:15.340
me.
So he is also a member of the prestigious community and yeah,

2305
02:16:15.341 --> 02:16:19.120
he's their fucking,
they're facetime each other now,
which I'm for.
Yeah.

2306
02:16:19.121 --> 02:16:22.030
That's great.
That's better.
That's better.
That's connecting everybody.

2307
02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:25.870
<v 1>No,
you called me on the phone yesterday.
Yes.
And you were like,
that's it.</v>

2308
02:16:25.871 --> 02:16:29.620
I'm done with texting.
I'm only calling in and I was like that Joey Joey Diaz.

2309
02:16:29.621 --> 02:16:31.090
That's yeah,
I'm doing that now.

2310
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:35.380
She only gets offended and almost angry if you email them.
I mean,

2311
02:16:35.381 --> 02:16:35.940
I'll text people

2312
02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:38.130
<v 4>details for things and addresses and stuff like that.</v>

2313
02:16:38.131 --> 02:16:41.400
But if it's somebody that I like I like,
I mean I'm,
I'm wanting to talk to them,

2314
02:16:41.510 --> 02:16:42.120
say hi.

2315
02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:45.270
And there's other thing that's happened when you keep in touch with people with

2316
02:16:45.271 --> 02:16:49.010
texts,
you realize how rarely you talked to them on the phone.
You know,

2317
02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:51.900
there's a few of my friends that I hardly ever see.
Yeah.

2318
02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:55.110
So I've been trying to make time for like dinner plans,

2319
02:16:55.410 --> 02:16:58.700
go to hang out with you know,
friends and just,

2320
02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:01.560
just instead of always working.
Yeah.

2321
02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:05.620
So like I'm always every like plan that I make in terms of uh,

2322
02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:08.790
what I do with my times,
either family related or work related.
Yeah.

2323
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:12.060
And I feel like I have got to,
I've kind of like reach out to friends,

2324
02:17:12.061 --> 02:17:14.730
boring like a one on one face to face sort of.

2325
02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:20.360
<v 1>It was just this comprehensive study that started in the 1930s by Harvard</v>

2326
02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.600
University about what causes happiness.

2327
02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:28.670
And the number one thing was friendship.
People talk about family,

2328
02:17:28.671 --> 02:17:31.940
they talk about work and you overlook community.
You know,

2329
02:17:31.941 --> 02:17:34.310
friendship means it's almost like,

2330
02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:38.870
like sometimes I feel like I really love my wife.
I got so fucking lucky.

2331
02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:44.210
She,
I hear her voice and I get happy when she walks in the door.

2332
02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:46.100
I jump up,
I want to talk to her.

2333
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:49.910
But to the point where on a Saturday night we just go out to dinner.

2334
02:17:49.911 --> 02:17:52.730
We just go do something during the day.
We just hang out.

2335
02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:56.720
And sometimes I think I should be spending more time with friends,
you know?

2336
02:17:57.230 --> 02:18:01.340
Especially since then I can talk shit about her.
There you go.
Good call.

2337
02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:03.890
But you know,
it's really,
it really is like,
you know,

2338
02:18:03.891 --> 02:18:05.900
you don't carve out that time.
And this,

2339
02:18:05.901 --> 02:18:10.010
this study said that gratitude and friendship by the two main things for

2340
02:18:10.011 --> 02:18:10.844
happiness.

2341
02:18:11.090 --> 02:18:15.860
<v 4>You're married to your friend.
That's beautiful too.
Right?
Um,</v>

2342
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:20.450
when you have friends,
when you have people that you can confide in and talk to,

2343
02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:23.450
you have different perspectives,
different points of view.
Whether,

2344
02:18:23.451 --> 02:18:27.200
I mean it's always best if it's in your house like it was your wife who'd be

2345
02:18:27.201 --> 02:18:29.690
amazing,
you know,
um,
very,

2346
02:18:30.050 --> 02:18:35.050
very pro getting your shit together in terms of uh,

2347
02:18:35.690 --> 02:18:40.310
like the,
the way you run a relationship,

2348
02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:45.290
right?
Like how nice are you?
How,
how,
how well do you guys get along?

2349
02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:47.960
And I think he should extend not just to your,

2350
02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:51.110
like your spouse but also to like all your friends.

2351
02:18:51.111 --> 02:18:55.850
Like how nice are your friends?
Like what,
how little bullshit do you give them?

2352
02:18:55.851 --> 02:18:59.110
How much compliments do you give them a hum.
Uh Hum.

2353
02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:02.930
How objective are you with the way you guys interact with each other?

2354
02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.970
<v 1>How often do you tell them that you care about them?</v>

2355
02:19:06.410 --> 02:19:07.580
<v 4>How often do you take them for granted?</v>

2356
02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:12.050
I'm very pro analysis and I think all of us could,

2357
02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:16.070
we could do well to analyze like how we interfaced with each other.

2358
02:19:16.071 --> 02:19:19.820
Cause I think most most problems that people have,
they,

2359
02:19:19.821 --> 02:19:22.700
it's like one thing happens,
then this thing happens and that thing happens.

2360
02:19:22.701 --> 02:19:25.340
But if the first thing didn't happen with the second thing have happened,

2361
02:19:25.550 --> 02:19:30.410
if the first slight didn't happen,
if the first way you greeted someone,

2362
02:19:30.411 --> 02:19:33.330
it was with a big smile and a handshake and maybe a little roll,

2363
02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:35.450
the whole conversation with a role that a totally different way.

2364
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:38.420
And then afterwards someone said,
hey,
I thought you were mad at Greg.

2365
02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.970
You know when I was with the way he came over and shook my hand,

2366
02:19:40.971 --> 02:19:43.910
smiled at me and I'm like,
Oh,
who cares?
What am I worried about?

2367
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.060
Whereas if he came over with an attitude,
oh,
this fucking guy.
And then he's like,

2368
02:19:47.061 --> 02:19:49.880
oh that fucking guys hasn't dropped it yet.
Yeah,
we're still,

2369
02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.930
we're still arguing about the stupid fucking thing.
You know,
I'm writing,
no,

2370
02:19:53.930 --> 02:19:58.150
it's half of it is the way we interact with each other.
Right?
Male,
female,
boy,

2371
02:19:58.151 --> 02:20:00.560
boy,
whatever the fuck.
It's just human beings.

2372
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:04.970
Half of the way human beings like the,
the way things go.

2373
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:07.160
Half of it is how we interact with each other.

2374
02:20:07.410 --> 02:20:08.310
<v 1>He had the energy,</v>

2375
02:20:08.311 --> 02:20:12.360
like I go to the comedy store sometimes and if I show up and like I show up

2376
02:20:12.361 --> 02:20:16.110
three minutes before my spot and then I parked the car and I'm walking in and

2377
02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:20.850
somebody I like,
we'll say hi to me,
you know,
I'll see,
uh,
you know,

2378
02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:23.850
dove Davidow for somebody I haven't seen in awhile and he says what's up?

2379
02:20:23.851 --> 02:20:25.800
And I kind of brushed past him cause I'm late.

2380
02:20:26.350 --> 02:20:29.250
That fucks up the relationship because that person feels like,

2381
02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:32.440
oh I thought I meant a lot to that guy.
So it's like shit,

2382
02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:36.180
I got to show up early and be and think before I walk in,

2383
02:20:36.330 --> 02:20:40.980
be available to people because you know,
it's,
it is,
you're right,

2384
02:20:40.981 --> 02:20:43.470
it can be very subtle how you shake someone's hand,

2385
02:20:44.130 --> 02:20:46.560
you like don't hug them or hug them.

2386
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:47.840
<v 4>Yup.
Yup.</v>

2387
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:52.140
<v 1>Friend of mine goes the other day.
Uh,
we played beach volleyball on Sundays.</v>

2388
02:20:52.141 --> 02:20:56.090
That's my big social things.
We 15 years I've been playing with the same guy.

2389
02:20:56.490 --> 02:20:58.830
Yeah,
that's great exercise too.
It's great.

2390
02:20:58.831 --> 02:21:01.470
And we call ourselves the shirts because we're the only guys on the beach

2391
02:21:01.471 --> 02:21:06.120
playing with our shirts on
and were fucking terrible.

2392
02:21:06.121 --> 02:21:10.920
We never get any better.
And uh,
and so,
um,
so we,

2393
02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:15.420
we go out and I,
I hug,
I showed up and I hugged everybody.
And then this one guy,

2394
02:21:15.421 --> 02:21:17.520
Evan goes to me,
he goes,
uh,
you know,

2395
02:21:17.521 --> 02:21:19.590
I don't think you should hug everybody all the time.

2396
02:21:19.591 --> 02:21:22.380
I think a hug should be like for a special moment.

2397
02:21:22.381 --> 02:21:24.300
So it actually means something.
And I go,

2398
02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:29.310
you have enough intimacy problems and don't fucking put them on me.

2399
02:21:29.810 --> 02:21:33.120
I'll,
I won't hug you,
but I'm fucking hugging everybody else.
I love it.

2400
02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:36.030
I love a moment where I can hug somebody.
The

2401
02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:38.640
<v 4>comedy store should be called the hug festival.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

2402
02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:42.870
Places all about hugs and everyone's always hugging everybody.
Yeah.
You know,

2403
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:46.110
the more people that you can have like that in your life,

2404
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:50.200
more people that you want to hug,
the better off you are.
That's,
you know,
a,

2405
02:21:50.201 --> 02:21:52.440
a community of people that you actually care about.

2406
02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:55.020
I hugged the shit out of my kids.
Yeah.

2407
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:58.710
It bums me out when people don't like to know as bums me out when people don't

2408
02:21:58.711 --> 02:22:02.490
like to,
to hug their kids.
Man.
The kids.
It's a bummer.
It's a real bummer.

2409
02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:06.910
You know,
when you know someone who doesn't like being a parent,
it's rough.
Yeah.

2410
02:22:07.150 --> 02:22:10.920
Cause you know you,
you know that that feeling,

2411
02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:15.240
it's all,
I mean it's just one of the things about having children.

2412
02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:19.350
Do you realize it's all about trying to foster love.

2413
02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:20.700
It's all about that.

2414
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:25.380
It's all about you want them to be loving people to meet other loving people is

2415
02:22:25.381 --> 02:22:26.610
like,
this is possible.

2416
02:22:26.970 --> 02:22:27.810
<v 0>This is possible.</v>

2417
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:31.470
If this family can get along and we all love each other and care about each

2418
02:22:31.471 --> 02:22:33.990
other.
So much weight,
why can't the human race,

2419
02:22:34.410 --> 02:22:37.170
why can't all these people get along better?
Why can't they?
They can.

2420
02:22:37.171 --> 02:22:39.110
In the ideal circumstances,
you're out.

2421
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:43.770
You're under ideal circumstances and most people aren't.
Well,
it's fear.

2422
02:22:44.310 --> 02:22:48.570
I think that that's what keeps people from being vulnerable.
Yeah.

2423
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:52.470
And hugging and expressing how they feel about each other and supporting like

2424
02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:57.000
unconditioned,
unconditional love is getting rid of the fear.

2425
02:22:57.390 --> 02:23:01.110
You can't be afraid that this love is going to turn on you and this person is

2426
02:23:01.111 --> 02:23:04.560
going to hurt you.
Right.
And you have to have had that happen a few times.

2427
02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:08.600
So you're like,
well,
I know what that is.
Yeah.
I must've been annoying.
Right.

2428
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:16.380
Yeah.
Listen analysis,
it's part of the problem.
Yeah.

2429
02:23:16.410 --> 02:23:19.560
We're all part of the problem.
Yeah,
man.
It's um,

2430
02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:23.490
I think it's an interesting time for people to communicate though.

2431
02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:29.040
I don't think anybody is a really gotten to the bottom of things in later.

2432
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:31.020
I mean,
in the past,

2433
02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:34.380
the way people are trying to get to the bottom of things now there's a lot of

2434
02:23:34.381 --> 02:23:37.560
noise.
What do you mean emotionally?
I think emotionally,

2435
02:23:37.561 --> 02:23:39.090
the way we communicate with each other,

2436
02:23:39.091 --> 02:23:44.091
even the way people are examining government and examining foreign policy and

2437
02:23:44.111 --> 02:23:48.300
examining the offices of the president and examining voting and the electoral

2438
02:23:48.301 --> 02:23:49.990
process and there's,

2439
02:23:50.010 --> 02:23:53.640
there's things that people are in analyzing now and looking at the,

2440
02:23:53.641 --> 02:23:56.880
I think because of all the chaos of the Internet,

2441
02:23:56.910 --> 02:24:00.300
we kind of lose sight of all the crazy shit that it's doing.

2442
02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:04.980
It's doing so many different things.
And changing things so much that it's,

2443
02:24:05.010 --> 02:24:09.600
it's rewiring the way people are looking at the world itself.
Yeah,

2444
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:13.200
and that's why all these fucking drugs are getting legalized.

2445
02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:17.610
The giant part of why silicide wind is getting legalized now.

2446
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:22.500
It's decriminalized in Denver.
Marijuana's being decriminalized left and right.

2447
02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:24.420
It's because people here,

2448
02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:29.600
people like you and me and anyone else that has a brain that understands about

2449
02:24:30.271 --> 02:24:33.170
drug laws,
hear them talking about it and you go,
this is crazy.

2450
02:24:33.171 --> 02:24:36.480
You can't lock people up for mushrooms and you should take them.
Yeah,

2451
02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:38.760
she fucking take him.
They'll probably fix your brain.

2452
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.880
They'd probably give you a new perspective and make you realize you were being a

2453
02:24:41.881 --> 02:24:45.630
dick.
It's half of what's wrong with us,
right?
We're,

2454
02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:49.520
we're just worried about how we interface with each other and we see the same

2455
02:24:49.850 --> 02:24:50.420
foot.
You see,

2456
02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:53.910
you're saying the internet is giving people insights and information that's

2457
02:24:53.911 --> 02:24:58.260
changing the way we live?
I think so for sure.
I think the access to information,

2458
02:24:58.261 --> 02:25:00.030
because the stream is so large,

2459
02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.680
so much nonsense comes through it that you lose perspective of all the positive

2460
02:25:04.681 --> 02:25:06.330
changes taking place because of the Internet.

2461
02:25:06.930 --> 02:25:10.740
All these drug legalization things I don't think would ever be possible without

2462
02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:14.190
all of the information that's been distributed online,

2463
02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:17.310
whether it's through videos or through people talking about,

2464
02:25:17.311 --> 02:25:22.311
or podcasts or comedy routines or just facts were facts based.

2465
02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:24.003
You know,
news

2466
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:25.600
<v 2>organizations start putting out the,</v>

2467
02:25:25.601 --> 02:25:28.390
here's the real facts about marijuana and you know,

2468
02:25:28.391 --> 02:25:30.400
and fatalities and this is this.

2469
02:25:30.401 --> 02:25:32.590
These are the real facts about where the money's going,

2470
02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:36.420
how it's going right now to fund cartels and how this is crazy because we're,

2471
02:25:36.421 --> 02:25:39.910
we're literally creating an organized crime empire because we're making

2472
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:44.860
something that everybody wants.
Right?
All that stuff is available now.

2473
02:25:44.861 --> 02:25:48.640
You can't scratch it.
We were just talking about,
yes,
that's another one.

2474
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:51.520
You can't squash it with propaganda like they couldn't have had,

2475
02:25:51.521 --> 02:25:54.760
they could just kind of decide what narrative gets played out in the newspapers.

2476
02:25:54.761 --> 02:25:55.840
Right.
You can't do that anymore.

2477
02:25:56.170 --> 02:26:00.940
Did you read that article I sent you about stories versus facts?
Yes,
I did.

2478
02:26:00.970 --> 02:26:04.180
And that's the,
you know,
uh,
you've all Herati,
right?
Yes.

2479
02:26:04.181 --> 02:26:09.040
The guy that wrote sapiens and it basically says that,
you know,
stories,

2480
02:26:09.041 --> 02:26:13.720
Trump facts and that basically we are a culture.
The human,

2481
02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:17.950
the human species has always believed the myth,

2482
02:26:17.951 --> 02:26:22.951
whether it's religion or whether it's a political dogma that we are more apt to

2483
02:26:23.351 --> 02:26:26.860
ignore facts that don't support a story.
Uh,

2484
02:26:26.861 --> 02:26:31.861
because telling facts being factual is difficult because sometimes that fact

2485
02:26:33.791 --> 02:26:38.260
doesn't jive with what you thought was true and now you have to rectify that and

2486
02:26:38.261 --> 02:26:42.670
that's hard.
And so it's easy for us to just say,
you know,
we're all,

2487
02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:46.570
Jesus came and when we die our sins will be forgiven and we're supposed to do

2488
02:26:46.571 --> 02:26:51.190
this.
And then if facts come up to negate how,
how long ago,

2489
02:26:51.191 --> 02:26:52.780
man,
you know,
all the,

2490
02:26:52.810 --> 02:26:56.650
all the things we know from archeology that negate everything that's in the

2491
02:26:56.651 --> 02:27:00.820
Bible.
Then the story,
you still have 60% of the,

2492
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:05.080
of our country doesn't believe that the,

2493
02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:09.760
they think that you planted is 6,000 years old.
I think it's 46%.
Yeah,
yeah.

2494
02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:11.620
46% of the country thinks that,

2495
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:16.270
but they only think of it in terms of they won't denounce the Bible.

2496
02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:19.120
Do they really?
I mean,
if you had a gun to their head,
they really think that,

2497
02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:22.090
I don't think it's that high.
I think it's a lot of horse shit.

2498
02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:25.240
I think there's a lot of people that say,
if that's what the Bible says,

2499
02:27:25.810 --> 02:27:27.550
is that what the Bible says?
The Bible says,

2500
02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:29.860
my want to believe the stitcher tail and Bert,

2501
02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:33.460
I told him that's what the Bible says.
Mama good boy.
Yeah,
there's a lot of that.

2502
02:27:33.730 --> 02:27:36.580
When he's with his friends and he cracks open a beer and he's like,

2503
02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:40.440
what the fuck does my Mama know about?
Oh,
the fucking earth is,
yeah,

2504
02:27:40.450 --> 02:27:41.650
there's a lot of people,
little gold.

2505
02:27:41.651 --> 02:27:45.040
She is just try and know a lot of people go to church on Sunday because

2506
02:27:45.041 --> 02:27:48.670
culturally that's what you do.
It doesn't mean they subscribed to all that stuff,

2507
02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:53.020
but then you've got,
you know,
the uh,
every four years the government puts out a,

2508
02:27:53.021 --> 02:27:58.021
an environmental study that is done by I think 12 different departments in the

2509
02:27:59.021 --> 02:27:59.830
government.

2510
02:27:59.830 --> 02:28:03.820
And it's considered the quintessential update on where the environment is

2511
02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:04.900
internationally.

2512
02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:10.350
And that came out in November and it was damning about pollutants.

2513
02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:15.310
And uh,
the administration put it out on black Friday,

2514
02:28:15.311 --> 02:28:18.580
the day after Thanksgiving at three o'clock in the morning and they buried it.

2515
02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:22.190
And in it is everything about global warming you ever needed

2516
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:26.270
<v 4>to know and they're no longer calling it global warming.</v>

2517
02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:28.580
They're no longer calling,
um,

2518
02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:31.233
<v 3>uh,</v>

2519
02:28:31.390 --> 02:28:34.630
<v 4>it's no longer fossil fuel.
It's freedom.</v>

2520
02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:36.160
What is the new thing they're calling it?

2521
02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:37.473
<v 3>Freedom,</v>

2522
02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:40.370
<v 4>freedom,
juice,
some like that.
Jesus come,</v>

2523
02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:44.020
they're literally changing the name of fossil fuels.

2524
02:28:44.410 --> 02:28:46.330
This is the Trump administration gas.

2525
02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:51.700
Natural gas is being rebranded to freedom gas.
Wow.

2526
02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:55.000
That's just like some team America,
world police type Shit.

2527
02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:57.970
And it's like people that want to deny global warming,

2528
02:28:58.030 --> 02:29:02.560
it's like the facts are there in unrefuted.

2529
02:29:02.561 --> 02:29:05.440
I don't think anyone's denying that the planet's warming.
Right.

2530
02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:09.250
I think they're denying how much of an impact human beings have and whether or

2531
02:29:09.251 --> 02:29:14.251
not it's worth changing the way we do in industry.

2532
02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:19.300
Yeah.
And whether or not we're need to impose more restrictions on,

2533
02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:22.980
on exhaust fumes.
And I mean factories,

2534
02:29:22.990 --> 02:29:26.530
how much you're trying to drive by a factory and you see that pillow ing smoke

2535
02:29:26.531 --> 02:29:30.550
and yet here you're like,
how the fuck are we allowing that?
Yeah.

2536
02:29:30.730 --> 02:29:34.180
Like there's places to this day.
Will you drive there and you go,
oh,

2537
02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:39.250
this group gets to pollute the air that the babies breathe.
Yeah,

2538
02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:42.160
they do for this business.
Whatever the fuck they doing.

2539
02:29:42.161 --> 02:29:44.890
What are they making tires they get to pollute the air.

2540
02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.900
I mean what is the worst polluter?

2541
02:29:47.050 --> 02:29:48.820
Like when you drive by a factor and you see the,

2542
02:29:48.821 --> 02:29:52.540
the black smoke shooting in the sky.
Like what the fuck are they doing?

2543
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:56.080
Cruise ships.
Oh,
I think I read there the number one polluter.

2544
02:29:57.130 --> 02:30:01.330
We did a thing where we were trying to figure out was it with 'em

2545
02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:04.860
who was it with?
Um,

2546
02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:09.920
someone was explaining how much devastation cruise ships do in terms of the

2547
02:30:11.671 --> 02:30:15.780
amount of fuel that they burn and the impact that they have.
And the fact,
oh,

2548
02:30:15.781 --> 02:30:17.880
it was volunteering.
Thomas,
was it her

2549
02:30:18.940 --> 02:30:19.773
<v 3>sounds</v>

2550
02:30:21.850 --> 02:30:25.390
<v 4>they were talking about like each cruise ship,</v>

2551
02:30:25.391 --> 02:30:28.060
like how much actual fuel they burn off.
It's preposterous.

2552
02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:32.230
I think I read there the biggest burners of fossil fuels in the world.

2553
02:30:32.290 --> 02:30:35.190
So giant fucking metal thing in the water.
Yeah.

2554
02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:38.440
You ever tried to push up fucking row boat?
It's a lot of work.

2555
02:30:38.470 --> 02:30:41.320
It's a lot of work,
man.
How,

2556
02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:44.860
what assholes are people where they built something like the titanic?

2557
02:30:44.861 --> 02:30:47.170
Like just what kind of an asshole says,

2558
02:30:47.530 --> 02:30:51.740
not only am I gonna make it out of metal,
I'm like,

2559
02:30:51.790 --> 02:30:55.210
can we just use a bunch of small boats and get,
nope.
Nope,
nope,
nope,
nope.
Nope.

2560
02:30:55.270 --> 02:30:59.740
I'm going to make the biggest,
biggest boat ever.
And when I wrote on it,

2561
02:30:59.890 --> 02:31:04.760
even God can't sync it.
I mean,
I'm Noah.

2562
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:10.390
Imagine what an asshole you have to be to write even God can't shake it.

2563
02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:13.840
Yeah.
On the side of the boat.
Oh,
is that what they wrote?
Just,
Oh,

2564
02:31:13.841 --> 02:31:16.410
that's hilarious.
Wasn't that?
Is that,
that's a fact,
right?

2565
02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:20.160
That better not be an urban myth.
I think it said on the side of the titanic.

2566
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:22.680
<v 2>Even God can't sync it.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2567
02:31:23.730 --> 02:31:27.000
They weren't one of these people would be excited and they're going nowhere.

2568
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:30.830
Cruise ship,
just going nowhere.
Well,
it was something to do back then,
man.

2569
02:31:30.930 --> 02:31:33.540
Imagine living back then.
Oh,

2570
02:31:34.290 --> 02:31:38.580
I know the titanic quiz to conditioning and that was on TV.
Yeah,

2571
02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:43.470
titanic 1920s yeah,

2572
02:31:43.471 --> 02:31:48.060
the roaring that we're making one and so out to tank to name did it.

2573
02:31:48.090 --> 02:31:51.330
Did it say what?
I think it said that.
That's a quote.
Someone said an employee,

2574
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:55.200
I don't know if it was written on him,
but I got the loan was written 1911 oh,

2575
02:31:55.201 --> 02:31:56.040
it's a launch code.

2576
02:31:56.160 --> 02:32:01.160
It was 1911 quote rather 1911 fuck live in then it's more than a hundred years

2577
02:32:02.250 --> 02:32:06.510
ago.
Okay.
At cave people where they back then we were,
I said,

2578
02:32:06.511 --> 02:32:09.690
what can a cave people with a back then you can have x ray machines.

2579
02:32:09.691 --> 02:32:13.840
How the fuck they sit?
Your broken leg?
What'd they do?
What'd they do?

2580
02:32:13.841 --> 02:32:17.610
The thing on the cruise ships,
it's a video about how much they pollute.
Whoa.

2581
02:32:17.611 --> 02:32:21.720
One ship or watch a cruise ship pollute as much as 13 million cars in one day is

2582
02:32:21.721 --> 02:32:25.080
what this video is called.
Wow.
No Shit.

2583
02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:29.910
Whoa.
Hold.
It has gotten so much bigger over to over time.

2584
02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:35.130
Holy Shit.
19 million cars.
Let's just ban cruise ships.

2585
02:32:35.490 --> 02:32:38.370
Wow.
Trump does zero Trump cruise ship.

2586
02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:43.100
Why doesn't he ever crucially,
