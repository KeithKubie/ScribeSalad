let's say you're in Britain on a dual

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230
let's say you're in Britain on a dual
 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.830
let's say you're in Britain on a dual
carriageway and I try and draw this two

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
carriageway and I try and draw this two
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.820
carriageway and I try and draw this two
lanes and we're both go in this

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830
lanes and we're both go in this
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.619
lanes and we're both go in this
direction and there's a blue car on the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
direction and there's a blue car on the
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.350
direction and there's a blue car on the
left and it's going at 70 miles per hour

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
left and it's going at 70 miles per hour
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.780
left and it's going at 70 miles per hour
which is the legal limit on motorways

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
which is the legal limit on motorways
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.410
which is the legal limit on motorways
and dual carriageways in this country

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420
and dual carriageways in this country
 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.150
and dual carriageways in this country
yeah and so they should be trouble is

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
yeah and so they should be trouble is
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950
yeah and so they should be trouble is
you could be doing the right thing and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
you could be doing the right thing and
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.779
you could be doing the right thing and
other people on the roads might not

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
other people on the roads might not
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.609
other people on the roads might not
there's a guy overtaking the blue car

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
there's a guy overtaking the blue car
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.070
there's a guy overtaking the blue car
it's gonna be the red car so he's the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
it's gonna be the red car so he's the
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.630
it's gonna be the red car so he's the
red car and he's going faster in fact

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
red car and he's going faster in fact
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.580
red car and he's going faster in fact
I'm gonna draw him in at the moment he

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
I'm gonna draw him in at the moment he
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.950
I'm gonna draw him in at the moment he
overtakes and he's going as I'm sure

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
overtakes and he's going as I'm sure
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.759
overtakes and he's going as I'm sure
it's happened to me

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
it's happened to me
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290
it's happened to me
in the blue car I hasten to add I've

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
in the blue car I hasten to add I've
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.580
in the blue car I hasten to add I've
been in the blue car and someone comes

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
been in the blue car and someone comes
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.190
been in the blue car and someone comes
barreling past me going at 100 miles an

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
barreling past me going at 100 miles an
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.569
barreling past me going at 100 miles an
hour but certainly it could happen

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579
hour but certainly it could happen
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280
hour but certainly it could happen
whether it's on a motorway or dual

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
whether it's on a motorway or dual
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.450
whether it's on a motorway or dual
carriageway now they're not going the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
carriageway now they're not going the
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.799
carriageway now they're not going the
same speed but there is a moment when

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
same speed but there is a moment when
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.209
same speed but there is a moment when
they're neck-and-neck and that's the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
they're neck-and-neck and that's the
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830
they're neck-and-neck and that's the
moment want to freeze time and ask you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
moment want to freeze time and ask you
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200
moment want to freeze time and ask you
about what happens next because at this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
about what happens next because at this
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.490
about what happens next because at this
moment when they're neck-and-neck they

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
moment when they're neck-and-neck they
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.229
moment when they're neck-and-neck they
see in front of them a tree or some

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
see in front of them a tree or some
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.450
see in front of them a tree or some
barrier which is unexpected and so they

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
barrier which is unexpected and so they
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.889
barrier which is unexpected and so they
both need to break and we're going to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
both need to break and we're going to
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.240
both need to break and we're going to
assume lots of things like it's always

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
assume lots of things like it's always
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.529
assume lots of things like it's always
the case with a mathematical question we

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
the case with a mathematical question we
 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.760
the case with a mathematical question we
have to model it to keep it simple

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
have to model it to keep it simple
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.349
have to model it to keep it simple
enough to answer so the models here

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
enough to answer so the models here
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.910
enough to answer so the models here
might be the let's assume have same cars

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
might be the let's assume have same cars
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910
might be the let's assume have same cars
let's assume reaction times are not part

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
let's assume reaction times are not part
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.960
let's assume reaction times are not part
of this we could have those things in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
of this we could have those things in
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.399
of this we could have those things in
later if we want to complicate the model

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
later if we want to complicate the model
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.780
later if we want to complicate the model
let's assume they're both slam on the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
let's assume they're both slam on the
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.010
let's assume they're both slam on the
brakes at the same time and they break

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
brakes at the same time and they break
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899
brakes at the same time and they break
in the same rate and by the time he gets

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
in the same rate and by the time he gets
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330
in the same rate and by the time he gets
there the blue car sort of just stopped

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
there the blue car sort of just stopped
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700
there the blue car sort of just stopped
in time so that's the blue car he's got

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
in time so that's the blue car he's got
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039
in time so that's the blue car he's got
smaller apparently see he wrote hey he

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
smaller apparently see he wrote hey he
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.630
smaller apparently see he wrote hey he
stopped with millimeters to spare which

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
stopped with millimeters to spare which
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.630
stopped with millimeters to spare which
is good no crash for the blue guy he

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
is good no crash for the blue guy he
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310
is good no crash for the blue guy he
slammed on the brakes just in time well

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
slammed on the brakes just in time well
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.539
slammed on the brakes just in time well
I'm gonna claim it's obvious that the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
I'm gonna claim it's obvious that the
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969
I'm gonna claim it's obvious that the
red guy is in trouble the red guy is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
red guy is in trouble the red guy is
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.499
red guy is in trouble the red guy is
moving quicker he brakes at the same

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
moving quicker he brakes at the same
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.060
moving quicker he brakes at the same
time at the same rate I think he's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
time at the same rate I think he's
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.350
time at the same rate I think he's
definitely gonna crash no one seems to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
definitely gonna crash no one seems to
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.399
definitely gonna crash no one seems to
argue about whether the red guy's gonna

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
argue about whether the red guy's gonna
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.020
argue about whether the red guy's gonna
crash what's really crucial and here's

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
crash what's really crucial and here's
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730
crash what's really crucial and here's
the puzzle for you is that it matters

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
the puzzle for you is that it matters
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469
the puzzle for you is that it matters
what speed you crash it right if you

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
what speed you crash it right if you
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.850
what speed you crash it right if you
crash at one mile now I no one's gonna

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
crash at one mile now I no one's gonna
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010
crash at one mile now I no one's gonna
really worry you if you crash it a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
really worry you if you crash it a
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080
really worry you if you crash it a
thousand miles an hour you're in trouble

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
thousand miles an hour you're in trouble
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880
thousand miles an hour you're in trouble
no he's not gonna crash at thousand

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
no he's not gonna crash at thousand
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.020
no he's not gonna crash at thousand
miles now he's gonna crash slower

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
miles now he's gonna crash slower
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.660
miles now he's gonna crash slower
because he started braking but at what

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
because he started braking but at what
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370
because he started braking but at what
speed does he hit the tree and that's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
speed does he hit the tree and that's
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.889
speed does he hit the tree and that's
the puzzle there's an intuition to get

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
the puzzle there's an intuition to get
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.090
the puzzle there's an intuition to get
involved here there's also some math to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
involved here there's also some math to
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310
involved here there's also some math to
check it out and the answer is why

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
check it out and the answer is why
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.960
check it out and the answer is why
surprised me

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970
 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.210
we're back so the the red guy has

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
we're back so the the red guy has
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.710
we're back so the the red guy has
crashed I just feel like I missed my

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
crashed I just feel like I missed my
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.059
crashed I just feel like I missed my
chance to draw a crash so this is the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
chance to draw a crash so this is the
 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.300
chance to draw a crash so this is the
red guy he's he's in pieces all over the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
red guy he's he's in pieces all over the
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.030
red guy he's he's in pieces all over the
place because your intuition doesn't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
place because your intuition doesn't
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.710
place because your intuition doesn't
work well with speed questions and this

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
work well with speed questions and this
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.119
work well with speed questions and this
is why I got a bit surprised about this

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129
is why I got a bit surprised about this
 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.400
is why I got a bit surprised about this
the first thing to notice is that a lot

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
the first thing to notice is that a lot
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.320
the first thing to notice is that a lot
of people think the answer is 30 miles

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
of people think the answer is 30 miles
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.039
of people think the answer is 30 miles
now it's really sensible to think about

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049
now it's really sensible to think about
 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.270
now it's really sensible to think about
the difference in speed which is 30

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
the difference in speed which is 30
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.890
the difference in speed which is 30
miles an hour at the start and think if

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
miles an hour at the start and think if
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.059
miles an hour at the start and think if
everything else is the same surely

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069
everything else is the same surely
 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.350
everything else is the same surely
that's the speed it's got left over

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
that's the speed it's got left over
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.569
that's the speed it's got left over
there are lots of reasons why it's not

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579
there are lots of reasons why it's not
 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.190
there are lots of reasons why it's not
correct and one of the reasons you'll

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
correct and one of the reasons you'll
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.180
correct and one of the reasons you'll
probably think is I wouldn't be asking

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
probably think is I wouldn't be asking
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.190
probably think is I wouldn't be asking
this question if it was 30 fine

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
this question if it was 30 fine
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.289
this question if it was 30 fine
another intuition thing to ask though is

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299
another intuition thing to ask though is
 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.390
another intuition thing to ask though is
do you think it's slower than 30 or do

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
do you think it's slower than 30 or do
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.830
do you think it's slower than 30 or do
you think it's quicker than 30 because

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
you think it's quicker than 30 because
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.710
you think it's quicker than 30 because
if it's not there's one of the two and

if it's not there's one of the two and
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.030
if it's not there's one of the two and
I'm gonna tell you the answer and I'm

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
I'm gonna tell you the answer and I'm
 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.470
I'm gonna tell you the answer and I'm
gonna justify it because when someone

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
gonna justify it because when someone
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.589
gonna justify it because when someone
told me the answer just bawled I'm

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599
told me the answer just bawled I'm
 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.059
told me the answer just bawled I'm
surprised I was also a bit shocked and

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069
surprised I was also a bit shocked and
 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.890
surprised I was also a bit shocked and
dare I say it's so good and maybe I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
dare I say it's so good and maybe I
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.390
dare I say it's so good and maybe I
changed my driving habits a little bit

it's pretty easy to justify this but the

it's pretty easy to justify this but the
 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.520
it's pretty easy to justify this but the
answer is sobering enough so I think we

should justify it before I leave you

this uber thing but if you think about

this uber thing but if you think about
 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.809
this uber thing but if you think about
kinetic energy this is actually is quite

kinetic energy this is actually is quite

easy so I'm gonna imagine that they do
 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.849
easy so I'm gonna imagine that they do
lots of slightly dodgy things here but

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859
lots of slightly dodgy things here but
 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:07.780
lots of slightly dodgy things here but
you have to imagine that I'm just

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790
you have to imagine that I'm just

be to do with several things there's a

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689
be to do with several things there's a
 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.240
be to do with several things there's a
formula for kinetic energy which looks

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250
formula for kinetic energy which looks
 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.589
formula for kinetic energy which looks
like this there's a half in there for

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599
like this there's a half in there for
 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.699
like this there's a half in there for
reasons I'm not going to go into there's

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
reasons I'm not going to go into there's
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.140
reasons I'm not going to go into there's
the mass of the car which we're going to

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150
the mass of the car which we're going to
 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.520
the mass of the car which we're going to
assume is the same for both cars and

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530
assume is the same for both cars and
 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.339
assume is the same for both cars and
there is its velocity now if we're gonna

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349
there is its velocity now if we're gonna
 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.570
there is its velocity now if we're gonna
actually work out the kinetic energy

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580
actually work out the kinetic energy
 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.010
actually work out the kinetic energy
we'd work this out in meters per second

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020
we'd work this out in meters per second
 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.360
we'd work this out in meters per second
because that's the units that kinetic

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370
because that's the units that kinetic
 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.310
because that's the units that kinetic
energy works in I'm just gonna dodge

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320
energy works in I'm just gonna dodge
 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.900
energy works in I'm just gonna dodge
that so I'm actually gonna say that this

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910
that so I'm actually gonna say that this
 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.610
that so I'm actually gonna say that this
kind of kinetic energy is proportional

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620
kind of kinetic energy is proportional
 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.469
kind of kinetic energy is proportional
to this because I'm just gonna work with

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479
to this because I'm just gonna work with
 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.570
to this because I'm just gonna work with
70s but I hope you forgive me this dodge

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580
70s but I hope you forgive me this dodge
 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.830
70s but I hope you forgive me this dodge
because I can do the same in the red car

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840
because I can do the same in the red car
 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.689
because I can do the same in the red car
so we can compare them so the blue guy's

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699
so we can compare them so the blue guy's
 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.180
so we can compare them so the blue guy's
got half em whatever the M is and we've

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190
got half em whatever the M is and we've
 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.180
got half em whatever the M is and we've
got 70 squared that's this velocity in

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190
got 70 squared that's this velocity in
 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.589
got 70 squared that's this velocity in
miles per hour and we won't worry about

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599
miles per hour and we won't worry about
 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.409
miles per hour and we won't worry about
it being a meter per second red guy easy

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419
it being a meter per second red guy easy
 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.810
it being a meter per second red guy easy
enough calculation has the kinetic

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820
enough calculation has the kinetic

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.560
energy at the start of 1/2 m we're going
to see less the same mass because it's

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570
to see less the same mass because it's
 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.939
to see less the same mass because it's
the same car but this time we've got

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949
the same car but this time we've got
 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.469
the same car but this time we've got
hundred squared because that's his

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479
hundred squared because that's his
 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.719
hundred squared because that's his
velocity to start with and I'm gonna

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729
velocity to start with and I'm gonna

claim that in braking you're getting rid

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349
claim that in braking you're getting rid
 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:04.990
claim that in braking you're getting rid
of kinetic energy I don't think that's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000
of kinetic energy I don't think that's
 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.850
of kinetic energy I don't think that's
controversial and the blue guys got rid

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860
controversial and the blue guys got rid
 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.550
controversial and the blue guys got rid
of all of it so there's none left so

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560
of all of it so there's none left so
 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.480
of all of it so there's none left so
what we need to work out is how much

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490
what we need to work out is how much
 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.580
what we need to work out is how much
energy that is and if actually I

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590
energy that is and if actually I
 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.350
energy that is and if actually I
calculate their number here is 70

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360
calculate their number here is 70
 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.510
calculate their number here is 70
squared it's the so I'm gonna say this

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520
squared it's the so I'm gonna say this
 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.770
squared it's the so I'm gonna say this
is proportional to 70 squared which is

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780
is proportional to 70 squared which is
 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.810
is proportional to 70 squared which is
4900 amount of energy it's not in joules

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820
4900 amount of energy it's not in joules
 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.070
4900 amount of energy it's not in joules
because I'd need to have the unit's

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080
because I'd need to have the unit's
 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.670
because I'd need to have the unit's
changed but the red guy is proportional

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680
changed but the red guy is proportional
 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.399
changed but the red guy is proportional
to hundred squared which is 10,000 so

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409
to hundred squared which is 10,000 so
 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.870
to hundred squared which is 10,000 so
even if the red guy gets rid of all the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880
even if the red guy gets rid of all the
 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.760
even if the red guy gets rid of all the
energy the blue guy's got rid off which

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770
energy the blue guy's got rid off which
 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.260
energy the blue guy's got rid off which
he would if everything else is the same

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270
he would if everything else is the same
 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.499
he would if everything else is the same
I just need to do 10,000 take away 4900
