homes today comes through a series of
 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.720
homes today comes through a series of
water treatment processes and piping and

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730
water treatment processes and piping and
 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.190
water treatment processes and piping and
pumps and you know things that bring

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200
pumps and you know things that bring
 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.259
pumps and you know things that bring
that water to us today and then the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269
that water to us today and then the
 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.029
that water to us today and then the
wastewater is returned back to treatment

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039
wastewater is returned back to treatment
 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.460
wastewater is returned back to treatment
to treatment plants a couple of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470
to treatment plants a couple of
 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.020
to treatment plants a couple of
challenges those municipalities are

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030
challenges those municipalities are
 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.630
challenges those municipalities are
facing one is that the infrastructure is

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640
facing one is that the infrastructure is
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.990
facing one is that the infrastructure is
aging it's leaking there's between a lot

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000
aging it's leaking there's between a lot
 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.090
aging it's leaking there's between a lot
of cities have between 30 and 60 percent

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100
of cities have between 30 and 60 percent
 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.590
of cities have between 30 and 60 percent
of the water that they produce never

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600
of the water that they produce never
 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.880
of the water that they produce never
makes it to the end of the line because

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890
makes it to the end of the line because
 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.800
makes it to the end of the line because
it leaks out of these pipes it's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810
it leaks out of these pipes it's
 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.299
it leaks out of these pipes it's
difficult for them to replace it because

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309
difficult for them to replace it because
 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.180
difficult for them to replace it because
there just isn't the reserve the revenue

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190
there just isn't the reserve the revenue
 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.810
there just isn't the reserve the revenue
to be able to invest in this replacement

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820
to be able to invest in this replacement
 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.060
to be able to invest in this replacement
one of the other challenges is it's very

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070
one of the other challenges is it's very
 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.459
one of the other challenges is it's very
energy intensive between three and

energy intensive between three and
 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.930
energy intensive between three and
twenty percent of a typical

municipalities budget goes to energy to
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.520
municipalities budget goes to energy to
produce and pump this water around so we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530
produce and pump this water around so we
 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.369
produce and pump this water around so we
look at smart grid type of technology

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379
look at smart grid type of technology
 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.590
look at smart grid type of technology
not unlike we see in the energy smart

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600
not unlike we see in the energy smart
 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.770

improve this system part of that is to

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300
improve this system part of that is to
 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.000
improve this system part of that is to
be able to detect where are these leaks

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010
be able to detect where are these leaks
 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.490

infrastructure we as consumers if we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890
infrastructure we as consumers if we
 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.440
infrastructure we as consumers if we
really understood where our water was

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450
really understood where our water was
 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.480
really understood where our water was
was going and we had some control over

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490
was going and we had some control over
 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.580
was going and we had some control over
that and we could you know use the water

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
that and we could you know use the water
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.709
that and we could you know use the water
and off-peak hours all the same type of

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719

grid I think it would really improve our

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619
grid I think it would really improve our
 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.120

overall consumptive habits of water

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
overall consumptive habits of water
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.069
overall consumptive habits of water
another thing is that there the water

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079
another thing is that there the water
 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.740

pricing structure is it's a real

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750
pricing structure is it's a real
 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.779
pricing structure is it's a real
challenge for us today many parts of the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789
challenge for us today many parts of the
 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.340
challenge for us today many parts of the
world including many parts of United

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
world including many parts of United
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.649

States basically water is free and so as

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659
States basically water is free and so as
 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.300
States basically water is free and so as
long as water is free or highly

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310

subsidized there's really there's

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469
subsidized there's really there's
 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.190

there's kind of no incentive for us to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
there's kind of no incentive for us to
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.929
there's kind of no incentive for us to
reduce our consumption or change our

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939
reduce our consumption or change our
 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.940
reduce our consumption or change our
behaviors so I think a smart system

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950
behaviors so I think a smart system
 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.800
behaviors so I think a smart system
would give us that insight that we need

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810
would give us that insight that we need
 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.870
would give us that insight that we need
to really change behaviors because I do

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880
to really change behaviors because I do
 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.169
to really change behaviors because I do
think people want to want to be smart

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179
think people want to want to be smart
 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.940
think people want to want to be smart
consumers of our water but without that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
consumers of our water but without that
 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.889
consumers of our water but without that
information it's very difficult to make

those those smart decisions

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350
 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.230
there's a lot of really smart

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240
there's a lot of really smart
 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.270

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.680
infrastructure system to monitor they
really are brilliant in the way they've

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690
really are brilliant in the way they've
 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.480
really are brilliant in the way they've
put a long-term plan together around

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490
put a long-term plan together around
 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.200
put a long-term plan together around
their water supply

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210
 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.120
future really is one of the major

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130
future really is one of the major
 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.460
future really is one of the major
solutions for our future water challenge

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
solutions for our future water challenge
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.220
solutions for our future water challenge
is going to be reuse of water and you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
is going to be reuse of water and you
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.660
is going to be reuse of water and you
know there's often a negative

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670
know there's often a negative
 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.910
know there's often a negative
connotation to that people think Oh

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920
connotation to that people think Oh
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.770
connotation to that people think Oh
toilet to tap we've heard to flush to

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780
toilet to tap we've heard to flush to
 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.990
toilet to tap we've heard to flush to
brush shower to flower so a lot of

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000
brush shower to flower so a lot of
 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.990
brush shower to flower so a lot of
different thoughts but really the beauty

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
different thoughts but really the beauty
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.820
different thoughts but really the beauty
of wastewater reuse is we can actually

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830
of wastewater reuse is we can actually
 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.640
of wastewater reuse is we can actually
purify that wastewater way beyond the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650
purify that wastewater way beyond the
 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.920
purify that wastewater way beyond the
quality needed for for drinking water in

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
quality needed for for drinking water in
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.960
quality needed for for drinking water in
fact it's a nice consistent high quality

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970
fact it's a nice consistent high quality
 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.240
fact it's a nice consistent high quality
water now people don't have much issue

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
water now people don't have much issue
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.920
water now people don't have much issue
with desalination to be able to take

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
with desalination to be able to take
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.450
with desalination to be able to take
seawater and make drinking water and

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460
seawater and make drinking water and
 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.220
seawater and make drinking water and
actually waste water is much easier to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
actually waste water is much easier to
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.280
actually waste water is much easier to
treat than seawater but independent of

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290
treat than seawater but independent of
 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.310
treat than seawater but independent of
that that negative reaction to

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320
that that negative reaction to
 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.230
that that negative reaction to
wastewater reuse if you think about it

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240
wastewater reuse if you think about it
 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.940
wastewater reuse if you think about it
ninety percent of the world's water is

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
ninety percent of the world's water is
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.040
ninety percent of the world's water is
not used for human consumption or for

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050
not used for human consumption or for
 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.750
not used for human consumption or for
domestic use so we've got a great

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760
domestic use so we've got a great
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760
domestic use so we've got a great
opportunity to treat and reuse our

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
opportunity to treat and reuse our
 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.850
opportunity to treat and reuse our
wastewater for agricultural irrigation

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860
wastewater for agricultural irrigation
 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.520
wastewater for agricultural irrigation
for industrial uses for a lot of other

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530
for industrial uses for a lot of other
 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.260
for industrial uses for a lot of other
uses before we ever get to the point

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270
uses before we ever get to the point
 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.790
uses before we ever get to the point
where we have to use it for you know

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800
where we have to use it for you know
 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.760
where we have to use it for you know
direct potable water reuse so today we

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770
direct potable water reuse so today we
 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.890
direct potable water reuse so today we
see a lot of adaptation of reuse water

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
see a lot of adaptation of reuse water
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.680
see a lot of adaptation of reuse water
to take the load off of streams and

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690
to take the load off of streams and
 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.690
to take the load off of streams and
rivers and fresh water supplies to be

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700
rivers and fresh water supplies to be
 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.810
rivers and fresh water supplies to be
used in industrial plants

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820
 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.580
another great area related to water

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590
another great area related to water
 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.890
another great area related to water
reuse is this idea of waste to value how

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900
reuse is this idea of waste to value how
 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.330
reuse is this idea of waste to value how
you take a waste stream don't look at

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340
you take a waste stream don't look at
 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.670
you take a waste stream don't look at
that as a as a liability anymore there's

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680
that as a as a liability anymore there's
 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.170
that as a as a liability anymore there's
a lot of goodies in your in waste water

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180
a lot of goodies in your in waste water
 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.570
a lot of goodies in your in waste water
for instance in a municipal wastewater

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
for instance in a municipal wastewater
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.520
for instance in a municipal wastewater
system tremendous amount of carbon

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530
system tremendous amount of carbon
 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.230
system tremendous amount of carbon
content which you can convert to energy

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240
content which you can convert to energy
 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.940
content which you can convert to energy
so this idea of having a wastewater

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950
so this idea of having a wastewater
 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.160
so this idea of having a wastewater
plant that is that is carbon neutral or

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170
plant that is that is carbon neutral or
 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.470
plant that is that is carbon neutral or
actually generates you know more power

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480
actually generates you know more power
 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.450
actually generates you know more power
than it consumes a tremendous

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460
than it consumes a tremendous
 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.120
than it consumes a tremendous
opportunity phosphorus is a dwindling

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130
opportunity phosphorus is a dwindling
 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.400
opportunity phosphorus is a dwindling
resource globally yet there's a lot of

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410
resource globally yet there's a lot of
 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.080
resource globally yet there's a lot of
phosphorus and waste streams so there's

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090
phosphorus and waste streams so there's
 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.490
phosphorus and waste streams so there's
some cool technologies coming out

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500
some cool technologies coming out
 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.810
some cool technologies coming out
they're going to be able to selectively

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820
they're going to be able to selectively
 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.270
they're going to be able to selectively
remove things like phosphate or metals

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280
remove things like phosphate or metals
 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.550
remove things like phosphate or metals
like copper from a waste stream and be

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560
like copper from a waste stream and be
 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.380
like copper from a waste stream and be
able to process those into a finished

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390
able to process those into a finished
 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.480
able to process those into a finished
product so we need to stop thinking

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490
product so we need to stop thinking
 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.910
product so we need to stop thinking
about a wastewater stream as as pure

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920
about a wastewater stream as as pure
 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.160
about a wastewater stream as as pure
waste and look at that as a as an asset

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170
waste and look at that as a as an asset
 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.960
waste and look at that as a as an asset
not unlike we've been looking at you

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970
not unlike we've been looking at you
 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.310
not unlike we've been looking at you
know if you think about recycled

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320
know if you think about recycled
 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.050
know if you think about recycled
aluminum and plastic and all that used

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060
aluminum and plastic and all that used
 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.090
aluminum and plastic and all that used
to be a pure waste stream that's now raw

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100
to be a pure waste stream that's now raw
 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.460
to be a pure waste stream that's now raw
material for for other processes so

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470
material for for other processes so
 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.980
material for for other processes so
wastewater in the future will be a raw

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990
wastewater in the future will be a raw
 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.420
wastewater in the future will be a raw
material for many processes

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430
 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.640
of water is a real that's a hot topic

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650
of water is a real that's a hot topic
 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.080
of water is a real that's a hot topic
we're where we stand with the price of

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090
we're where we stand with the price of
 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.970
we're where we stand with the price of
water is it needs to be priced relative

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980
water is it needs to be priced relative
 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.070
water is it needs to be priced relative
to the value received from that water

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080
to the value received from that water
 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.640
to the value received from that water
often where water is underpriced or not

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650
often where water is underpriced or not
 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.560
often where water is underpriced or not
priced for value there's no real

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570
priced for value there's no real
 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.420
priced for value there's no real
incentive to reduce consumption or

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430
incentive to reduce consumption or
 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.580
incentive to reduce consumption or
change behaviors and so the most

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590
change behaviors and so the most
 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.380
change behaviors and so the most
important thing I think relative to

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390
important thing I think relative to
 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.760
important thing I think relative to
price is that it has to be priced

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770
price is that it has to be priced
 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.380
price is that it has to be priced
according to the investments made to get

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390
according to the investments made to get
 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.330
according to the investments made to get
that water to you know people say water

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340
that water to you know people say water
 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.920
that water to you know people say water
is a human right and I completely agree

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930
is a human right and I completely agree
 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.380
is a human right and I completely agree
what is not necessarily a human right or

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390
what is not necessarily a human right or
 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.380
what is not necessarily a human right or
free is that treatment and transport of

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390
free is that treatment and transport of
 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.030
free is that treatment and transport of
the water to get it conveniently to us

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040
the water to get it conveniently to us
 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.700
the water to get it conveniently to us
so I think the most important thing is

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710
so I think the most important thing is
 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.440
so I think the most important thing is
that people realize the value of that

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450
that people realize the value of that
 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.360
that people realize the value of that
water you know today our water bill in

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370
water you know today our water bill in
 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.890
water you know today our water bill in
most parts of the world is much less

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900
most parts of the world is much less
 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.930
most parts of the world is much less
than our cable bill much less than our

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940
than our cable bill much less than our
 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.420
than our cable bill much less than our
monthly cell phone bill and yet you

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430
monthly cell phone bill and yet you
 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.310
monthly cell phone bill and yet you
could certainly live without those long

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320
could certainly live without those long
 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.230
could certainly live without those long
before you can live without water so we

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240
before you can live without water so we
 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.960
before you can live without water so we
we are encouraging the world to look

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970
we are encouraging the world to look
 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.450
we are encouraging the world to look
more wisely yet water pricing and one of

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460
more wisely yet water pricing and one of
 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.130
more wisely yet water pricing and one of
the challenges regarding price for

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140
the challenges regarding price for
 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.170
the challenges regarding price for
instances agriculture seventy percent of
