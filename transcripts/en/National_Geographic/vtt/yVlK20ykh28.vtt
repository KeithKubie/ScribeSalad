00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.633
[music playing]

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.400
SIGOURNEY WEAVER
(VOICEOVER): China

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.400
has changed a lot since I first
came here in the late '70s.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.900
What used to be sleepy villages
are now thriving mega cities.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.333
Back then, China's most
valued asset was cheap labor,

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.033
and so they became a
factory to the world,

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.734
growing their economy 70-fold
in less than four decades.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:32.967
Think about that.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.934
Nothing like it
has happened before

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.967
in the history of mankind.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:40.700
To power it all, China built
more than a thousand coal

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.367
plants which contribute
to an energy sector

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:48.000
that pumps out an
astounding 20% of the gases

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.200
warming the planet.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.233
SIGOURNEY WEAVER:
I like this one.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:58.467
KEVIN MO: Try it.

00:00:58.467 --> 00:00:59.166
Nice.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.100
That looks nice on you.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.467
Is it me?

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:02.266
Yeah?

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.533
KEVIN MO: Looks nice on you.

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.734
SIGOURNEY WEAVER: Were
you born in China?

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:06.133
SIGOURNEY WEAVER
(VOICEOVER): Kevin Mo

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.266
is a top climate
adviser to the American

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.133
and Chinese governments.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.300
He came down from
Beijing to meet with me.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.834
KEVIN MO: In the Walmart,
a lot of "Made in China"

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.367
stuff, exactly like here.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.367
That's why they are saying
this is a factory of the world.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.133
Yeah.

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.700
And so that's what
China becomes now.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.033
SIGOURNEY WEAVER (VOICEOVER):
He tells me if China's going

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.700
to quit coal, it
will have to pivot

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.834
away from so much
reliance on manufacturing

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.433
and dirty industry.

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:31.667
So how will the
economy have to adjust?

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:32.600
How will it change?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.667
Well, now you
have to transition

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:38.633
it to a service-based
economy, which is finance.

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.100
- Finance.
- IT.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.500
OK.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.367
Insurance.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.266
Those kind of things.

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.600
Yeah, got it.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.200
It's not like energy
intensified industries,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.000
like steel, cement,
those kinds of things.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.033
SIGOURNEY WEAVER: Yeah, got it.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.433
So it's different.

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.300
So if they can make
that transition--

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.834
If they can make
that transition,

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:59.800
the economic growth
will be more sustainable

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.533
and consume less energy,
but generate more revenues.

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:05.400
OK.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.633
In your opinion, can they do it?

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:10.066
And can they do it as
fast as they hope to?

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.333
Well, let's say this.

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.500
If China doesn't make
all these changes

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.333
and still use the previous
growth model, economic growth

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:23.100
model, then the scenario
would be by 2050,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.900
China's carbon
emissions would be

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.100
more than the current total
carbon emissions in the world.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.433
Oh my goodness.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:31.967
SIGOURNEY WEAVER
(VOICEOVER): That much carbon

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.900
dioxide in the air would make
life on earth unbearable.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.834
But Kevin claims China's
leaders acknowledge this threat,

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:43.500
and are making plans to
ensure that doesn't happen.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.467
The problem is that if China
shifts away from manufacturing,

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:51.367
other countries-- including
ones that burn lots of coal--

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:54.233
will be picking up the
slack, and so the benefit

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:55.233
to the climate is unclear.
