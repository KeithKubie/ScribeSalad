small finger stick samples because they
 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.569
small finger stick samples because they
wanted to maintain the illusion that

they did have this innovative technology
that could test do the full range of

hacking these commercial machines they

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969
hacking these commercial machines they
 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.089
hacking these commercial machines they
they made the testing less accurate and

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099
they made the testing less accurate and
 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.699
they made the testing less accurate and
less reliable and so essentially they

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709
less reliable and so essentially they
 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.780
less reliable and so essentially they
they put lives at risk

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
they put lives at risk
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.000
they put lives at risk
that's that's one

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
that's that's one
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.309
that's that's one
big piece of it and that's that's part

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
big piece of it and that's that's part
 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.990
big piece of it and that's that's part
of the wrongdoing here but another part

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000
of the wrongdoing here but another part
 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.059
of the wrongdoing here but another part
of it is that by going commercial and

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
of it is that by going commercial and
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.369
of it is that by going commercial and
then soliciting funding from investors
