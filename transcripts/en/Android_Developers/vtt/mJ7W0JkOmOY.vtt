ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
to "Android Design in

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.080
Action." My name
is Roman Nurik.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.740
ADAM KOCH: Hey, guys.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.770
Adam Koch.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.720
ROMAN NURIK: And unfortunately,
Nick Butcher is

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.270
stuck at Devoxx and trying to
figure out a way to join us

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.980
via Google+.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.570
Hangout.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.050
So he may join at some point,
hopefully quite soon, but

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.605
we're going to give him
a few extra minutes.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.360
For those of you who are
new to the show--

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.190
[SIDE CONVERSATION OFFSCREEN]

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.890
ROMAN NURIK: It seems like
Nick is joining.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.960
Has Nick joined,
Producer Pete?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.600
Nick has joined.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.660
Hopefully, he can hear us.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.020
Can you hear us, Nick?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.380
ADAM KOCH: There he is.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.565
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
I can hear you.

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:33.940
Can you hear me?

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.600
ROMAN NURIK: Finally.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.140
For those that weren't watching,
we were having some

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.430
trouble getting Nick
connected.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.350
But Nick is now connected
live via Devoxx.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.160
Nick, you want to do a
quick introduction?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.970
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.830
So I'm here at a Devoxx
conference in Antwerp.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.845
So it's been a fantastic kind
of Java-based conference.

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:53.770
So hearing about things related
to the world of Java

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.100
and talking some
about Android.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.580
We did delivered a code of that
yesterday telling people

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.891
how they can sync data between
their Android apps using

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:02.727
Google Drive in the
background.

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:05.231
It was also cool to hang out
with some of the Android

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.855
framework engineers like Romain
Guy and people like

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:09.753
that and hear about all of the
latest improvements in the UI

00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:11.740
toolkit, so pretty
nice conference.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.280
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.870
And we're very envious that we
can't be there with you, Nick.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.640
But we're hoping you guys are
having a great conference.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.550
So for those of you that are
new to Android Design in

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.970
Action, in this show, we
look at existing apps.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.710
And sometimes we look at
existing categories of apps

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.340
and look at what types of design
renovations or design

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.630
re-imaginings we can
do for them.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.330
On this episode, we're going
to cover instant messaging.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.440
And we're not going to go too
deeply into that because we

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.780
have some more important stuff
to talk about, and that is a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.300
community redesign.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.500
So last week on "Android Design
in Action," we gave

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.610
kind of a mission, a challenge
to the community to take an

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.200
app that you've seen before and
potentially that you maybe

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.220
don't like the layout
for and rethink

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.020
it, redesign it yourself.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.310
Use your Photoshop skills, use
your sketching skills and put

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910
up a public redesign
of that app.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.490
And we've gotten a lot
of contestants--

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.160
well, actually not really
contestants, a lot of entries.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.620
And we're going to take a look
at some of those today as well

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.220
as talk about VIA, the tablet
UI stencils that we promised

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.850
to give away before.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.480
So let's get started and jump
into instant messaging.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.610
So rather than take a look at
existing apps like GroupMe and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.200
Trillion that were covered in
last week's App Clinic, we

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.080
wanted to think of what would
a hypothetical, awesome IM

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.440
client or messaging
client look like.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.080
And so we came up with a few
screen mocks for what that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.360
could look like.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.180
We didn't give it a name or
anything, so it's just called

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.090
hypothetical messaging app.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.930
And you can see here this is
kind of one of the key Hero

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.310
screens for the app.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.230
It's basically the conversation
view.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.440
In this view, you're
communicating with a bunch of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.000
different people.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.370
In this case, you're
Luke Skywalker

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.390
talking to all your friends.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.500
And the point here is that
we didn't want to really

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.540
emphasize all the Chrome around
the instant messaging,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.210
like all the action bar stuff
and the action buttons that we

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.550
talk about usually.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.940
We really wanted to focus on how
you present the content.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.220
So here you can notice that
there's three different types

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.340
of content, really.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.320
There's rich information about
a place that you've shared, a

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.620
rich kind of audio snippet with
transcribed text, and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.720
then a bunch of photos that
you've submitted.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.600
So that's at a very basic
level what this

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.370
screen shows you.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.450
And it's really just a
conversation view.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.940
You guys have any preliminary
comments before we keep going?

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.494
ADAM KOCH: No.

00:03:40.494 --> 00:03:42.120
I have something quick.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.400
I just really like the fact
that there's rich content

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.150
included here directly.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.360
I think we've moved beyond
having just text in instant

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.390
messaging clients.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.390
And now we have phones, which
you can take pictures, you can

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.810
record audio.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.700
Obviously, sharing places
is very important.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.640
So I just really like how it's
sort of different content

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.100
types are being brought
out here.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.640
ROMAN NURIK: And a lot
of this isn't new.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.790
Existing apps like GroupMe
already do this.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.580
So you can share your current
location or--

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.972
actually, I don't know if you
can share a place, but I think

00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:10.190
you can check in with
Foursquare, for example.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.360
And you can also
share pictures.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.840
So existing apps do this, but
what we'd really like to see

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.560
is more and more apps
doing this.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.114
Because it's no longer,
like you said,

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:18.329
Adam, about just text.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.050
You really want to share
content or objects.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.100
In the next screen, you'll
notice that when you touch the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.300
little attach icon on the bottom
left, you could be

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.170
presented with things like
take a photo, record some

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.410
audio, and then maybe
automatically transcribe it,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.990
and then obviously, attach
location, things like that.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.130
One of the coolest things that
I really want instant

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.040
messaging clients to start
thinking about

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.150
is streaming video.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.680
And this is kind of interesting
because you have

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.460
things like Google+ Hangouts
where you can basically create

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.050
a shared meeting space with
your friends and with your

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.140
family and all be on video
at the same time.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.160
But for some reason, I was
thinking about, like what

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.320
about those push-to-talk days?

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.580
You know Sprint, Nextel, where
you'd push, say something, and

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.320
everybody would hear
it streaming live.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.990
What if you could do
that with video?

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.080
So I did a quick mockup.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.130
Let's just skip this one.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.850
I did a quick mockup of what
that could look like.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.295
I guess you press the attach
icon, and select stream video

00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:18.620
from your camera.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.760
It immediately changes the
compose box into basically a

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.630
preview of your front-facing
camera.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.810
As you're talking, it's
streaming live in the stream

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.760
of the conversation
to everybody else.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.800
And then for you as the
recorder, you just see this

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.690
live token in the stream.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.810
And then maybe as people are
saying stuff, as they are

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.720
responding to your video, they
can type and type and type,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.990
and it will maybe stick
your video feed to the

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.440
top of their window.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.190
That wasn't mocked
up, of course.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.630
ADAM KOCH: So just to be clear,
the video's actually

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.310
playing in line in the
conversation with you, right?

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.190
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.950
ADAM KOCH: And would there
be like a full

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.930
screen mode as well?

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.700
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.800
Yeah, so, I mean, we didn't
mock this up.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.900
I think if we had some more
time, we'd totally do this.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.320
But the idea would be like
you're streaming video.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.030
It's not like--

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.000
actually, it is recorded, so
after you press this check box

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.800
to indicate that you're done,
that video is just a token

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.840
that's playable, kind of like
a YouTube video or whatever

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.140
that's attached.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.830
But in line, in the stream, if
somebody's currently streaming

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.640
video, you can watch it in
line or full screen it.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.645
So this is something that I just
haven't seen other apps

00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:28.040
do, and I think that it's
something that--

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.540
like think about ways to compose
rich content, not only

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.815
view rich content,
but compose it.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.670
In another one of these
screenshots or mocks, you have

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.530
this kind of composition window
that can accept tokens.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.910
So let's say you
paste the URL.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.790
What if you just paste the token
indicating that this is

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.110
a URL object?

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.770
And maybe a place is also kind
of like a place token or such.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.990
This is just something
that I think folks

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.500
should think about.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.650
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I think
it's cool because--

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.115
NICK BUTCHER: Is the idea with
the images as well that you

00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:01.310
can scroll those in line?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.560
ROMAN NURIK: Yes.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.400
Where is it?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.360
Let's go back here.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.890
If you have a set of six or
seven images that you've

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.420
attached, then you
should probably

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.840
support the share intent.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.310
So if I'm in Gallery, and I
select eight images, I should

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.380
be able to share to my
messaging client.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.050
If I get a conversation or a
message, with eight images, I

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.580
should be able to swipe
through them left

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.850
and right in line.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.730
NICK BUTCHER: That's awesome.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.290
And yeah, with so many apps,
there's like a lot of--

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.380
I guess you call it pogo
sticking, where you have to go

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.090
up and down, in and
out, and have all

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.170
these context switches.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.010
So I love the idea of staying
within a fluent conversation

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.403
but being able to take in
all the immediate types.

00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:40.090
It's cool.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.490
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and this is
something that the Gmail

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.480
recently did with the
Android 4.2 update.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.360
Gmail now lets you have this
mini-Gallery view within an

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.970
email message.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.880
So if you get an email message
with 10 attachments, you don't

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.480
have to jump in to see
each individual one.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.370
You basically have a
horizontally swipeable gallery

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.080
for the email messages of the
attachments that were there.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.760
So rather than spend too much
time on instant messaging,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.470
again the main event
is coming up.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.180
The last thing I just want to
talk about is the tablet UI

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.920
that we designed here.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.060
So again, this is fairly
standard, a very simple master

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.890
detailed view, where on the
left, you have a master list

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.410
of all your conversations, and
then on the right, you have

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.220
your conversation view.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.670
The important thing to note
here, and this is where the

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.380
interesting part of tablets
comes in, is there's a lot of

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.110
ways to optimize for a tablet.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.250
On the left, obviously, we're
combining screens.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.179
But on the right, you'll notice
that the presentation

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.280
of the conversation itself
is slightly different.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.750
We've increased the padding,
the spacing, the margins to

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.360
let the core content float
freely within your bounds so

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.390
that it's not compressed into
one of the corners and edges.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.630
So the spacing between the
conversation and the avatar is

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.760
increased, between the avatar
and the side of the screen.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.270
And then everything
is just bigger.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.100
These images are no longer a
one-to-one aspect ratio.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.790
They're slightly wider to,
again, account for the extra

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.780
width you have on that screen.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.630
And then everything is larger.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:25.380
So this composition bar
at the bottom is--

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.740
I forgot the exact dimensions it
shows, but it was about one

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.880
and a half to two times as tall
for a much larger, more

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.570
accessible touch target.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.710
And then at the very top, this
presence bar that shows you

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.560
all the people that are
currently viewing the

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.970
conversation as well as all the
people that are involved

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.610
in the conversation, that's also
slightly larger to give

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.110
the thumbnails more
space to breathe.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.690
So that's kind of just one
example of how you could take

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.400
something as simple as a list of
messages and turn it into a

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.250
great tablet UI.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.260
Before we jump into our main
event talking about all the

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.220
awesome stuff that the community
has done, anything

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.290
else you guys want to talk
about in terms of IM and

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.540
messaging clients?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.400
ADAM KOCH: I guess one thing I
wanted to mention was there's

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.850
a lot of popular IM clients out
there on the Play Store.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.790
But for some reason, the most
popular ones typically do a

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.290
pretty poor job at the actual
presentation and design, maybe

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.140
because they've been around for
a long time, maybe because

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.580
they focus more on the
functionality.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.630
I'm not sure, but personally,
I'd really love a client that

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.890
just had a great design and
worked really, really well,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.380
like this, for example.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.980
ROMAN NURIK: I think also just
on top of that, just getting

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.480
the details right, making sure
notifications work, making

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.060
sure things are quick, that
you never miss anything.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.730
That's also important.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.580
But on top of that, to go
above and beyond your

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.180
competition, having a great
tablet UI and having a strong

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.160
visual presentation of the
content itself, of the

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.930
messages and your friends that
you're talking with, that's

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.160
going to put you above
and beyond.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.490
All right, so let's move
on to the main event.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.500
So as we mentioned in the
beginning, last week we set

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.100
out a challenge to the community
to take a look at

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.650
one of the apps you use
regularly or one of the apps

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.230
you just don't like how
it looks or whatever

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.030
and redesign it.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.010
If that company were to hire
you to redesign the entire

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.130
app, what would that
look like?

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.300
What are some of the key
things you'd use?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.280
And the response was just
crazy, phenomenal.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:32.560
NICK BUTCHER: Overwhelming.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.520
I was so impressed.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.440
ADAM KOCH: We thought we were
going to get four, maybe five,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.490
but it was very, very
impressive.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.320
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we got
a lot of submissions.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.070
And if you'd like, you
can actually check

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.750
them all out now.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.130
If you go on Google+ and search
for these two hashtags

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.620
here, for public posts tagged
to those, you'll

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.820
see all these entries.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.770
But we've done a quick kind
of collage of what all the

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.850
entries look like and we'll just
quickly show you a few.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.380
So

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.990
this is just like all the great
content of the community

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.600
has come up with.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.860
Really phenomenal.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.760
Obviously, there's some
tablet layouts here.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.240
We'll talk about Catch
That Bus in a moment.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.760
IMDb by Paul Burke
was a great job.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.160
Last.fm, we'll talk about, and
then Good Food, which is a

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.800
Nexus 7-specific layout.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.220
And Nick, I believe you've
looked at Good Food

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.780
specifically, right?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.185
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I have been
talking to the developers

00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:24.040
of it, and I think there's some
really good ideas in this

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.720
redesign, which are awesome.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.386
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and I mean,
a lot of these developers are

00:12:29.386 --> 00:12:31.190
going to have to look at some
of these screenshots now and

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.430
say, let's get cracking.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.400
Let's figure out how to
implement some of this.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.900
So overall, really great work.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.100
And there's another
page of this.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.710
Again, lots of tablet UIs.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.070
This one down here at the bottom
left, this is for speed

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.440
tests, right?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.580
And we'll talk about that.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.440
Android guys, lots of good
stuff going on here.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.370
So great work overall.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.520
These are the entrants
that participated

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.530
and submitted something.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.200
So again, round of applause
for them all.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200
I think overall it was a

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.740
phenomenal job by the community.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.950
And then regarding the stencil,
we originally said

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.470
that we were going to give out
10 of the UI stencils from

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.610
uistencils.com.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.830
So first of all, before we jump
into who we're giving

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.420
things to, you can, of course,
purchase them at

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.540
uistencils.com, and click on
the Android tablet kit.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.300
So that should be
available today.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.830
But for all of the entrants
that submitted something,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.620
basically everybody here, we'll
be sending you guys a UI

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.960
stencil from uistencils.com.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.420
And we'll be reaching out to
you on Google+ to find out

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.950
your shipping address
and all that.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.550
So great job, job really
well done, and

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.540
you're all getting Stencils.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.520
So with that, let's move on
to some of the highlights.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.990
We wanted to pick a few of the
community entries, and look at

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.730
them in detail, and say a few
words about what we loved

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.140
about them.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.700
So first is WhatsApp.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.850
Adam, you want to talk
about WhatsApp?

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.340
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.200
So this is an app I actually
personally use quite heavily,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.680
I guess grudgingly use it.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.270
It's one of those apps where a
ton of my friends across the

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.400
world use it a lot so I'm
forced to use it.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.880
It's actually pretty good in
terms of functionality.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.770
It's very responsive, it's
very quick, and it's very

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.860
simple to use.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.280
But the design is definitely
lacking.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.570
They certainly have the menu
button of shame down the

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.980
bottom there.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.515
It's a very dated-looking UI.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.440
I don't think they have much
sort of visual flair, I guess.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.470
It's very plain.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.340
So the redesign of this--
very, very nice-- by

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.750
Maximilian Solomon.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.280
Hopefully, I'm not slaughtering
that name

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.070
pronunciation.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.790
But it's a really nice
re-imagining of the app with

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.060
the Holo theming.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.204
Let's see if we can just
zoom in here a bit.

00:14:50.204 --> 00:14:51.630
ROMAN NURIK: You probably want
to shift it over so there's no

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.450
window blocking.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.700
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.840
It actually uses a few things
that Roman put into the

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.440
hypothetical messaging
app as well.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.070
The one thing I'm not sure
about actually is the top

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.540
tabs, what that would
be used for.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.510
But I really like just the
conversation list here, plus

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.850
the split action bar
down at the bottom

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.630
for the quick actions.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.570
It's worth noting as well that
those split actions down the

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.270
bottom would be evenly spaced
if you implemented using the

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.930
standard split action
bar on Android.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.780
But yeah, it's nice.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.440
You've got this sort of snippet
of text there with the

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.570
emoji still showing.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.770
You've got the unread message
count showing there directly.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.250
And instead of using a long
press to trigger the

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.000
contextual action menu,
they've got the little

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.530
triangle down the bottom right
corner to signify that there's

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.400
additional actions that you
could take on that particular

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.010
conversation.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.880
And then a bunch of the
additional actions have been

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.020
collapsed under the overflow
menu there that you wouldn't

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.340
necessarily access
all the time.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.260
Guys, any thoughts
on this screen?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.090
ROMAN NURIK: The first thing I
like-- and this is a theme

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.600
throughout.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.700
The choice of colors and the
color palettes that were

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.400
chosen throughout all of the
contestants were really,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.170
really strong.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.960
I thought that the combination
of the dark teal and green

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.140
color, it fits in with the
branding of WhatsApp.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.870
I mean, I don't know much too
much about the company and the

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.080
app, but it seems to fit
with that green brand.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.910
In the original screen you see
here on the left, there is no

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.680
hint to that at all.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.310
So I thought the branding here
is particularly good and

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.110
obviously using the Holo
elements is awesome.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.250
But I think even more
interesting was the second

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:29.900
screen, right?

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.320
ADAM KOCH: Yes.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.000
ROMAN NURIK: In this screen,
this is kind of the

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.510
conversation detail view,
where it shows all the

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.360
different messages that have
been going back and forth

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.070
between you and your friends.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.870
And I think that the redesign
of this screen, particularly

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.070
for me, just was a
stark contrast.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.040
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, definitely.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.510
ROMAN NURIK: So I think
this is quite good.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.310
Even these little details,
like having the little

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.320
triangular callouts include
part of the image.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.510
So like the simplest way to
implement something like this

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.850
is you just have the callout,
which is always white.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.890
And then if there's an image,
then you show the image to the

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:03.650
right of that.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.380
But here, the developer, or
rather the designer, has shown

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.720
that, let's not do that.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.010
Let's actually make the image
part of the callout.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.079
And again, it gives you this
feeling of immersiveness, that

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.390
it's an image that's taking up
the entire space, that it's

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.670
this free-form piece
of content.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.460
I can't really put it into great
words, but that's the

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.770
feeling I get from that.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.430
Nick, anything else you want to
add to the awesome WhatsApp

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.940
design, or should we move on?

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.460
NICK BUTCHER: I like it.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.210
It's very clean.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.650
It looks like an Android
app to me now.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.420
Good job.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.740
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome
All right, so

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.410
next we have Last.fm.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.450
And Last.fm, this is the old
screen, so what you're

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.450
currently looking at
is the current app.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:49.740
Last.fm is basically an app that
lets you look at online

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.540
radio stations and play them and
whatnot, kind of similar

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.680
to Pandora.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.530
It's been around for
quite a long time.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.850
I actually know one of the
former developers.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.990
The app is written really well,
and the app is actually

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.550
open source.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.610
So it's quite a good, strong app
in terms of using Android

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.530
features, but the design
is kind of dated.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.420
ADAM KOCH: Kind of
dated isn't--

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.870
probably an understatement
there.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.770
ROMAN NURIK: So you could see
that they're using the old

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.800
Eclair-style tabs.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.300
They're using these right-facing
carets.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.020
And really, just the
content screens

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.160
aren't really that immersive.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.450
You just have seas of white
and splotches of

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.330
text here and there.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.030
ADAM KOCH: Really tiny images
in the list view there.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.870
ROMAN NURIK: So I think if we
were to give out awards at

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.810
all, I think the starkest
contrast between old and new

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.080
goes to this one.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.960
So I hope I'm pronouncing
your name right.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.280
Walmyr has done an awesome
job redesigning this.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.170
Here's the new screen.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.500
So you could see that complete
shift in terms of color

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.620
palette, in terms of
content first.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.820
The images just immediately
stick out, like the first

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.610
thing you see is the content.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.910
But also, I mean, he's done a
great job introducing some of

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.280
that branding.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.950
The color palette here
is very strong.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.760
It's kind of that red, dark
grey, white theme, and it's

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.320
really strong here.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.470
It's a really good job
introducing that

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.600
color palette here.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.956
Some of the specific things I
wanted to point out, and this

00:19:13.956 --> 00:19:17.400
is something that doesn't get
enough attention I think, is

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.960
when you have list items or
grid items, basically

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.450
collection views, spend some
time on the individual layout

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.770
for each row or each cell.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.440
Here, there's a really
interesting presentation where

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.300
you kind of couple the content,
the album art, as

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.760
well as who is sharing that.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.570
So this is kind of a great way
to show two pieces of content

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.670
layered on top of another.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.090
And then as you can see here,
there's just tons of that red

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.670
shown everywhere, and it's
really powerful evoking that

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.570
brand everywhere throughout.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.500
NICK BUTCHER: A couple
of details I'd like

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.690
to call out as well.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.770
I think they've done a really
nice job with the branding,

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.120
like you say, extending the
color palette throughout, but

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.230
also, and I don't see people
do this enough, is having a

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.450
full-on Last.fm logo on the
top of the whole screen.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.030
But then, you don't need to have
that taking up a lot of

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.190
space throughout every level
of the hierarchy.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.080
So I love the way that he's
gone and put the collapsed

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.950
representation on their child
screens, which allows you to

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.390
use the title space more
effectively, which I think is

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:21.180
a really nice detail.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.170
They've done very well there.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, definitely,
definitely.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.850
And this is something that
the I/O app does.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.280
So if you want to see how
it's done in terms of

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.810
implementation, just take a look
at the Google I/O app,

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:33.570
which is open source.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.690
And it does this, showing a logo
on your home screen and

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.640
then just an icon, which
is again customizable.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.050
It doesn't have to be your
launcher icon, just an icon on

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.670
detail screens and
category screens.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.710
So moving on from Last.fm, the
next app is Speedtest.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.170
Adam, you want to talk
about Speedtest?

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:50.440
ADAM KOCH: Yes.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.350
Speedtest, for those of you
who haven't used this app,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.410
it's a pretty simple app, at
least on the Android side.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.620
I'm sure there's a bunch
of infrastructure

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.650
on the server side.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.995
But it's used just for measuring
the speed of the

00:21:00.995 --> 00:21:02.080
connection that you have.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.160
So it could be measuring
Wi-Fi connection.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.380
It could be measuring 3G, 4G,
whatever connection that you

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.180
have to the server.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.930
So it really does
just two things.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.540
It measures your speed, it
does a speed test, and it

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.640
stores your historical test so
you can see where you were and

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.000
which speed you got.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.050
It's actually fairly popular.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.700
People have used this service,
at least in the

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.630
US, for quite awhile.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.355
We don't have a shot of
the original app yet.

00:21:27.355 --> 00:21:29.530
I think this might almost
get the award for

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.540
stark contrast as well.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.460
The interesting thing about
the current app is that it

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.020
actually locks itself to
particular dimensions.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.150
I'm not even sure how
they did that.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.490
I think they would have had
to go out of their way

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.470
specifically to do that.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.645
Even on my Nexus 4 it shows in
a small cropped window with

00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:48.430
black space around it, which
is really peculiar.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.410
ROMAN NURIK: It's almost like
frame, not even letterbox.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.820
It's framed in black pixels.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.640
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, definitely.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.100
And if you load it up
on a tablet, it

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.660
does the same thing.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.000
It's just this tiny little
window in the

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.420
middle of the screen.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.280
So I like this just because
it really simplifies

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.090
the look and feel.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.520
It brings the content out, and
it sticks to the roots of what

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.880
the app is trying to do here--
measure the speed and show

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.490
your historical entries.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.325
NICK BUTCHER: It also has
elements of the new clock app

00:22:16.325 --> 00:22:19.500
I think, that new stopwatch app
that shipped with Android

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.630
4.2, which I think
is a good thing.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.070
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I agree.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.780
So not much else to comment
here other than I think it

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.540
looks really nice.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.400
The Holo thing is great.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.580
And it really sticks to a sort
of main navigation we would

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.560
recommend for an
app like this--

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.620
Menu button, action bar, tabs
and then two content panes on

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.700
the tablet UI.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.380
ROMAN NURIK: I think the other
thing I just want to point out

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.800
for the tablet UI is look how
much you can do just changing

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.850
metrics, just changing
dimensions.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:46.880
The only difference--

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.180
and I'm guessing that the assets
are probably the same.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.530
They're probably not even
using the assets.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.820
This is probably some custom
drawing if you were to

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.220
implement this.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.660
But the font sizes are
slightly larger.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.150
The spacing between elements
is slightly larger.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.370
The size of that circle
is obviously larger.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.440
But then it's really just about
spacing, font size, and

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.052
just dimensions and metrics, and
then obviously, if you're

00:23:08.052 --> 00:23:11.380
showing images, showing those
images at full resolution.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.870
But it really shows the power
of what you can do with just

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:15.680
dimensions.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.370
So for developers out there,
if you just extract your

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.220
dimensions into dimension
resources, you don't even have

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.430
to create a tablet-specific
layout in a lot of cases.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.150
You just change the dimensions
for tablets.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.690
ADAM KOCH: Yep.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.985
Good job, Glenn Barker.

00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:30.490
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I guess
the takeaway from the

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.150
designers for that is don't be
scared about having something

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.790
that looks similar, but then
you call out different

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.000
switching points at which you
say the text size should be

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.260
larger because that's really
easy for developers to do.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.970
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.540
We should probably do a future
episode on how to best

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.780
annotate that in your mockups.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.200
That's definitely something that
requires some logic, like

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.140
if this, than that.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.380
Maybe we should talk about
that a little more.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.250
But anyway, let's move on to
the next app since we're

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.160
running a little low on time--

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.840
IMDb.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.570
Nick, do you want to
talk about IMDb?

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.420
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.770
What I really liked about this
redesign, in particular, was

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:11.090
they didn't only apply a Holo
look and feel to it.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.490
They also took a stab at looking
at the information

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:14.930
architecture.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.190
So when I say they,
it's Paul Burke.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.490
Good job, Paul.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.320
He looked at the way that
people, he and his friends, he

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.350
says, use IMDb.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.300
And it definitely resonated
with me, that you're quite

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.750
often using mobile in a
different context than you are

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.530
using a website.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.530
And he's really rearranged the
hierarchy of the information

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.640
to make things, like you know,
you're watching a movie.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.170
You want to see who the actor
is or what other movies

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.580
they've been in and make that
really, really quick.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.000
And he's used images really
well, I think, throughout the

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.610
app to make it very quick to
see what's going on and

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.960
visually you kind of
like pause the app.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.000
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and you
can't see this here.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.010
In one of his mockups, he
basically hid all the trivia

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.220
information, like the birth date
and so on for the actor,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.680
hid that under an expandable
item here at the top.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.130
And it's nice to be able to
focus on the stuff that you

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.380
immediately want to
see on mobile.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.660
I mean, you probably
want to see, oh my

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.740
god, I just saw somebody.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.870
Is that Joseph Gordon-Levitt?

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.110
You want to be able to tell
by looking at some photos.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.350
Maybe you're not as interested
about when they were born or

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.000
where they grew up or
something on the go.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.550
So definitely a good rethinking
of the entire

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.100
experience on mobile of what is
the user trying to get at.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.990
And then when you touch on one
of these movie titles, it

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.970
gives you a very quick pop-up.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.490
I'd probably use something
beside a pop-up.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.960
But it shows you a very quick
pop-up showing you the

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.900
immediately important things
like the rating and then I

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.650
think the metascore.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:43.660
So obviously, you want to see if
movies are good on the go.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.980
You're deciding between
something, so making that

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.125
rating, number, or star meter
or whatever really prominent

00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:52.810
is probably pretty important.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.410
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, generally
a dialogue's not the answer.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.320
But I'd quite like to see that
perhaps as another expand in

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.600
place, a bit like
he has for the

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.498
information about the actor.

00:26:00.498 --> 00:26:02.640
That could be quite fun.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:02.970
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.330
I think the last app we have
today is Catch That Bus.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.150
And I'll just briefly mention,
the one thing I loved about

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.910
this is the focus on the
different screens.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.190
And actually, this is
implemented already.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:21.150
The designer slash developer,
as part of the redesign

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.390
actually re-implemented
everything.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.110
So if you go ahead and download
Catch That Bus, this

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.410
is what it looks like.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.570
NICK BUTCHER: And it's
design in action.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:28.320
Wow.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.575
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:26:28.575 --> 00:26:31.510
It's design and implementation
in action.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.750
But the one thing I loved here
is that he clearly thought

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.540
about the different
screen sizes.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.890
That's something that's more and
more important as you have

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.490
devices like the Nexus 10,
Nexus 7 out there.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.310
And the other thing
that I loved here

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.620
is the color choices.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.030
Again, the single accent color
where they're using yellow as

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:52.600
the accent color is really
unique, and it really stands

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.080
out throughout the app.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.580
You could see that kind of
yellow is everywhere.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.980
Yellow is in the
tab selections.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.040
Yellow is in the core
iconography and in the

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.020
launcher icon.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.020
So I think it's--

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.560
NICK BUTCHER: Even in
the setting screen.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.880
I think it's just the one where
he colored some of the

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.150
switches in the setting screen,

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.960
really thorough branding.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.300
ROMAN NURIK: For sure.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.350
Yeah, so great work.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.370
I think that's the
last one we had.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:19.870
Any other notes around the
community stuff, guys?

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:20.270
ADAM KOCH: Only that
some of the

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.470
others were also fantastic.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.990
We just didn't have time
to cover all of them.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.190
But great job, guys.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.470
Yeah, really, really great.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.690
NICK BUTCHER: The other thing
I've been really enjoying is

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.020
actually just seeing a community
of people evolving

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.090
around their hash Android
design hashtags,

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.140
certainly on Google+.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.770
I'd love to see this continue.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.060
It's been fantastic to see all
the conversation, seeing

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.060
people dive in to other
people's redesigns and

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.220
offering feedback,
and then people

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.190
iterating on their designs.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.110
That's been incredible.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.880
ROMAN NURIK: And I should say,
if you get feedback on your

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.420
design, don't take that as
somebody criticizing you.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.680
We're, in general, trying to
provide positive feedback.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.920
And just learn from what
others are doing.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.210
If they give you criticism,
that's

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.930
totally positively minded.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.522
They're not trying to tell
you that you suck or

00:28:03.522 --> 00:28:05.520
anything like that.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.070
Just before we sign off, I
really want to quickly give a

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.750
shout out to Taylor,
who is actually

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.190
also one of the entrants.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.390
He submitted a redesign
for Google Finance.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.340
And he just this morning
released a

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.990
sketching kit update.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.550
Basically, this is a sketching
kit that you can print out

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.270
onto A4 paper.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:29.040
It's a template that shows you
the real sizes of the Nexus 4,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.920
the Nexus 10, Nexus 7.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.710
I think he's got all the
Nexus devices in there.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.310
So if you're interested in
doing some sketching,

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.890
definitely download
Taylor's kit.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.080
So with that, I think that's
it for this week's episode.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.500
Nick, thanks for joining
from the conference.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.960
It's been fun.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.390
NICK BUTCHER: Glad that I could
find a stable internet

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.110
connection.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.690
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, pretty
remarkable that you haven't

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.390
dropped off.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.790
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, good work.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.940
And not really design news, but
the Nexus devices, the new

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.560
Nexus devices, are
on sale today.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.680
So happy Nexus day, everyone.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.420
ROMAN NURIK: Indeed.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.790
I'll be buying some as soon as
they're available in the US.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.700
All right, well, that's
it for Android Design.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.630
Thanks for coming.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.780
Thanks for showing up, and
thanks for watching.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.410
My name is Roman Nurik.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.830
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.650
NICK BUTCHER: And
Nick Butcher.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:15.130
Thanks, guys.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:15.570
ADAM KOCH: Thanks guys.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.270
ROMAN NURIK: See you
guys next week.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.470
ADAM KOCH: Bye.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:25.200
