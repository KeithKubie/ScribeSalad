00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.340
(Disneycember Music)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.920
Well I finally finished up the High School Musical trilogy with High School Musical 2. I know that's not the last one...

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.829
but I actually saw the last one first, the first one second, and the second one last!

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.720
Yup! That's entirely out of order. So, I'll just jump right into it: When I popped this movie in, I'm not gonna lie I was

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.099
blown away!

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.050
This opening is

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.910
amazing. Probably the best thing I've seen out of all the movies

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.300
First off, it has a

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.779
legitimately funny intro. The kids are all waiting for high school to end and summer to start and the clock behind the teacher

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.880
literally gets bigger every single time it cuts back to her. That's so clever. It could be a John Hughes

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.459
joke. Then the song singing about summer break starts, and I'm not gonna lie, it left me kind of speechless.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.420
They must have thrown everything

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.719
into this one musical number. Look at the dancing, look at the movement, look at how they're utilizing

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.119
everything around them, look at the creativity in these steps. How many things can they do with a basketball and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.069
dancing? Damn, they find just about everything you can do with it. Look at the editing look at the

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.200
camerawork, look at what a grand scale

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.979
this is and on top of that, parts of the film and legitimately good jokes. Yeah, not jokes like "oh, it's for kids

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.239
I guess I'll laugh" â€” no, legitimately funny jokes. I love these yuppie parents

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.710
that use their kids as balance. The scene demonstrating how bad kid golfers can be is downright hilarious.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.519
"Good job, killer. Make the ball fear you." I actually rewind the film to hear that line again, it made me laugh so hard.

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.449
It's also the only High School Musical to show the bloopers and they're pretty funny, too.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.239
So yeah, an unbelievable opening followed by some real good laughs and an all-around "ehh"

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.920
movie. Yeah,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.679
if you thought this was the one that was finally gonna win me all the way over,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.689
you're tapping to a different tune. While it does have some of the best parts of any of the movies,

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.958
it's still on par with say, that season of Saved by the Bell where they all got jobs at a resort over summer vacation.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.379
You remember that? Of course you don't; if you're watching this you're not in your 30's.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.360
Summer begins and everybody just so happens to get a job at, of course, a

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.369
fashionable resort owned by Sharpay's parents. Sharpay decides for the resort's talent show, she wants Zac Efron as her co-host. This, of course,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.048
angers her incestuous brother. Okay? I'm not doing one who sees this, right? Tell me somebody else sees this!

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.390
Of course, he, his girlfriend Gabriella, and all his friends want to be in the talent show too, but Sharpay thinks

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.969
that's too many people and tries to, of course, sabotage him into only working with her. Okay pretty lame,

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.799
but it is made a little bit more interesting when her parents seem to be opening a lot of doors for

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.469
scholarships and good schools. This makes him more susceptible to Sharpay and even easier

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.040
letting his friends go. While doing the talent show, in the grand scheme of things, is not a big deal

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.640
they do make kind of a bigger deal that he is sort of manipulating himself and changing himself to open doors

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.380
and he doesn't know how much to hold on to and how much to give up.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.529
This is kind of an interesting subject to talk about and sometimes they do treat it very seriously

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.509
but the problem is its dealt with a lot better in the third one, when all the kids are graduating

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.329
they're trying to figure out what to do, where to go, what colleges

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.019
they're gonna be at, splitting up, discovering who they want to be, and yeah...

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.099
It's just done better, more realistic, more thought-provoking, and this is just the typical "You're letting that girl brainwash you, man.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.888
Who are you? I don't know who you are anymore." Granted,

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:31.039
its done a little bit more delicately and they don't entirely make Sharpay the villain, but the version I saw is almost two

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.728
hours and it feels like it. When they try telling jokes and doing visual humor, it works, but a lot of the drama

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.749
And yeah, even a lot of a song numbers aren't exactly that strong.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.359
I feel like they open with too strong of a punch. That first musical number was such a big deal that

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.408
nothing in the rest of the movie could possibly top it. So a lot of it

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:58.249
just kind of meanders. A good half of it is them just moping around the resort and skipping in kitchens. Okay,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.900
rewind that, we gotta see that again. Can somebody explain what this is?

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.300
And while nothing in it is certainly bad

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.049
it doesn't really all gel together either. I remember kind of looking at my watch saying, "Man,

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.119
how long is this movie? Can we get to the funny stuff again or can you throw one of them a basketball?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.880
I don't know, just do something like what you were doing before!" But yeah, when it gets to those enjoyably corny scenes,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.579
they are enjoyably corny. The last-minute duet with that pops up at the end had me laughing so hard when it's revealed

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.389
who he's gonna do the duet with that I had a pause it. I was laughing so much.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.980
You just shrug and lovingly say, "Only the Disney Channel would give us something so schmultzy." And like I said, that

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.460
stuff surprisingly doesn't bother me. That's part of the fun. For me,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.890
its just when it's slow,

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.339
serious, and been done a million times, adding nothing really new. It by no means does it throughout the entire film,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.420
but it does it through a lot that you do kind of move around in your seat a bit.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.629
There's not even a high school musical in it. The first one

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.790
we don't get to see the High School Musical and this one that they just write it out of the entire movie. Talk about false

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.179
advertising. Does it need to exist? No. Does it really further the characters that much? Not really. But again

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.360
there are some very impressive, very creative, and even very funny scenes. I guess if you liked the first one,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.870
you'll like this one enough.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.540
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to see some parts again, either to laugh or just admire

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.149
how well choreographed it is. Kind of a mixed bag,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.650
but that's High School Musical in a nutshell to me. Get your dance shoes on and check it out for yourself.
