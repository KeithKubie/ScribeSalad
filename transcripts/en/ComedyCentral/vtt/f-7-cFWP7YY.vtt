00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:03.937
All right, can I take
your order?

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:09.676
Excuse me.
What would you like sir?

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.545
Can you wait?
Isn't that your job?

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.280
Aren't you a waiter?

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.920
Hey, could you turn your phone
down kid, this is a restaurant?

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:23.256
It just so happens
I have anxiety.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.391
That means I have trouble
being around assholes

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.093
who won't leave me alone.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:33.733
Oh, hello Eric.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.468
Shut up, I have anxiety.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.404
Hey kid. Hey kid!

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.106
I'm on my phone!

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.841
You're about to get hit
by a car.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.478
All right, that's it.
Everyone stop the

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.347
(bleep).
Stop right now!

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:51.918
Listen up people,
I have anxiety.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.853
That means I'm in my shell

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.156
and have a hard time
expressing myself.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.926
I find it difficult
to engage with others,

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.228
so everyone shut the
(bleep)

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.931
up, because my anxiety
is up here right now.
