00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.540
There are a few canned materials that 3JS provides. You can have a diffuse

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.586
surface, a glossy surface, and a reflective surface. You can make objects

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:13.590
transparent. You can even apply textures. In this unit we'll start by digging a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.634
bit deeper into the graphics pipeline. One important element of the modern GPU

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.514
is that significant parts of its pipeline can be programmed to do whatever we

00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:25.730
want. This is particularly compelling for displaying materials. You can use a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.753
wide variety of equations to simulate how a surface looks. With this ability to

00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:32.987
fully control the illumination model, you can create a wider and wider range of

00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:37.118
substances as you learn more techniques. You can create objects that look

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:41.340
refractive like glass, or semitransparent and hollow. You can make objects that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.925
have unusual optical properties. Once you get into illumination models and

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:49.971
shader programming the world takes on a slightly different look. I know myself

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:53.133
when I look at some unusual mineral or beautiful wood grain I think, hm, how

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.421
many shader instructions could I do that in?
