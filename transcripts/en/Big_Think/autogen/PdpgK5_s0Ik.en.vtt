three interesting trends right now one I

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
three interesting trends right now one I
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.330
three interesting trends right now one I
think is the cell phone or the device

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
think is the cell phone or the device
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.790
think is the cell phone or the device
formerly known as the cell phone which

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
that is going to be fascinating to watch
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.750

I believe the personal computer is we

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
I believe the personal computer is we
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.260
I believe the personal computer is we
have known it has already peaked I don't

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
have known it has already peaked I don't
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.240

mean that it's going away it's still

going to be the dominant device but i

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
going to be the dominant device but i
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.020
going to be the dominant device but i
think it is piqued because i think

and I think that's about to blow up I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
and I think that's about to blow up I
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249
and I think that's about to blow up I
don't mean that it's going to blow up

don't mean that it's going to blow up
you're going to wake up one day and the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
you're going to wake up one day and the
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.219
you're going to wake up one day and the
whole system is going to be blown up but

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

I think we are just on the verge of

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
I think we are just on the verge of
 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.190
I think we are just on the verge of
seeing power flow away from those

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
seeing power flow away from those
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.699
seeing power flow away from those
companies and flow to either tech

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
companies and flow to either tech
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.670

companies like Google or Apple or

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
companies like Google or Apple or
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.929
companies like Google or Apple or
companies like that or consumers or some

combination of both I think Wi-Fi and

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469
combination of both I think Wi-Fi and
 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.360
combination of both I think Wi-Fi and
wimax and some of these other

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
wimax and some of these other
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.929
wimax and some of these other
technologies have the possibility of

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939
technologies have the possibility of
 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.580
technologies have the possibility of
blowing that open and I think you're

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
blowing that open and I think you're
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.319
blowing that open and I think you're
going to see more freedom in the

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329
going to see more freedom in the
 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.270
going to see more freedom in the
creation of software and services on

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
creation of software and services on
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.429
creation of software and services on
those devices so that's another big

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439
those devices so that's another big
 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.580
those devices so that's another big
thing I also think the less you hear the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
thing I also think the less you hear the
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.179
thing I also think the less you hear the
word internet the more integrated into

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189
word internet the more integrated into
 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.420
word internet the more integrated into
our lives it will be I compared the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
our lives it will be I compared the
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.800
our lives it will be I compared the
internet to the electrical grid the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
internet to the electrical grid the
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.629
internet to the electrical grid the
electrical grid is all around you it's

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639
electrical grid is all around you it's
 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.000
electrical grid is all around you it's
in your home it's in your offices in

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
in your home it's in your offices in
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.110
in your home it's in your offices in
your hotel room and there's an uncounted

number of things that plug into the

number of things that plug into the
 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.879
number of things that plug into the
electrical grid the television cameras

into the electrical grid so does the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480
into the electrical grid so does the
 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.479
into the electrical grid so does the
toaster oven and the electric toothbrush

in the and the hair dryer that you might
 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.460
in the and the hair dryer that you might
have used this morning but you did not

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
have used this morning but you did not
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.680

the electrical grid or i'm going to use
 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.179
the electrical grid or i'm going to use
the electrical grid you it would be

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189
the electrical grid you it would be
 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.369
the electrical grid you it would be
laughable for you to say that and i

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379
laughable for you to say that and i
 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.649

in so for instance you wouldn't
 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.300
in so for instance you wouldn't
necessarily expect a pocket-sized device

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310
necessarily expect a pocket-sized device
 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.180
necessarily expect a pocket-sized device
to do the same thing as a device with a

to do the same thing as a device with a
 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.640
to do the same thing as a device with a
larger display you wouldn't necessarily

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650
larger display you wouldn't necessarily
 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.010
