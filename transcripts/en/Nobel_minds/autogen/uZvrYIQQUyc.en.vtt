00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.400
 but these words well no I am very 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.189
 pleased to see you and congratulations from 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.250
 nobel price is customary 6 very kind 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.470
 from when you received the news of 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.260
 nobel prize you said that this one 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.019
 you assemble unreal yes yes I'm 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.199
 is it more real now 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.670
 wi2wi because little by little we yes to 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.540
 At the beginning we have the impression that it is 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.590
 someone else 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.340
 what does it sound like so much 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.740
 strange that and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.750
 and then little by little we realize that 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.760
 it's because we're a bit like 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.120
 a sleepwalker at the beginning we do not know 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.690
 very well 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.820
 then after we yes we notice above all 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.300
 when when we are in Stockholm 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.449
 but I think of you as a guardian of 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.949
 lighthouse of memory you relight the past 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:04.070
 to save people have forgotten the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.200
 uses at the exact addresses for yes yes 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 same but because what is not necessary 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.520
 forget ben that is actually yes 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.880
 when when we talk about memory all 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.710
 that we think I'm turned to the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.970
 past and all that but in fact it's not 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.320
 it's not quite that 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.220
 say that as we live a period where the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.270
 time has gotten a little faster with all 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:38.240
 the internets the social networks 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:41.990
 all this we have we have tried the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.979
 memory becomes a plus a species of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.810
 him for actually in time it was 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.220
 easier to have memory because 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.800
 that things were much more 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.619
 slow while now everything is the 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.410
 time is very jerky so this is 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.800
 normal that someone of my generation would 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.130
 either focuses on memory for 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.579
 try to 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.030
 to catch up with bits and pieces of the past as 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:14.370
 because the weather is becoming so 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.110
 so jerky things 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.760
 disappear very quickly there is the all the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.670
 world taps as and when then 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.519
 finally wants dadd doc salma that 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.959
 causes a desire for more memory 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.900
 strong maybe that in the other 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.239
 time actually about memories I 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.120
 know that you gave a picture but 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.180
 nobel yes I know like picture and 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.000
 what did I know yes I gave 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.190
 a photo of a French photographer who 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.670
 is willy ronis it was a photos 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.670
 he had taken 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.260
 in black and white it was a child 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.870
 is pretty charming that this is a 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.150
 child who looks at a cat but then 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.720
 it's a photo I had 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.760
 often on my desk because actually 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.860
 it was like children 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.700
 to women with children of my time 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.640
 finally he said that reminded me of my own 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.640
 childhood because even three-quarters 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.370
 I could have thought press that it was 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.470
 me or a comrade finally these photos 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.069
 like that of children's dance years 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.140
 50 but at the same time to questions from 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.850
 mysteries at the same time yes it's this 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.130
 mysterious because it's black and 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.260
 white but at the same time this child 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.480
 can also look like children's 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.950
 now except obviously the photo 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.110
 is in black and white then it gives a 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.900
 little more than 2 mister o 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.430
 and what did he replace his crazy 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.010
 photo then we will listen to nothing game but 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.630
 I'm happy I'm happy that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.769
 it's because I liked it a lot 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.580
 especially but I'm glad she 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.430
 be stockton not what it is 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.450
 cc is one of my favorite cities 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.920
 so I'm happy because in addition 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.990
 I have ties with Sweden 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.360
 family all so I'm glad that 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.400
 that this photo is like it's like 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.560
 if I was a little less time together in 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.080
 permanence but because the city of 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.660
 Paris it was a constant protagonist 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.420
 time how do I stick to you 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.970
 now as you are here become 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.680
 a little more modern is that yes because 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.570
 that I have come several times to 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.190
 stockholm because I have a little son 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.490
 Swedish etc. Oddly it's a city 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.600
 which inspires me almost as much as paris 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.120
 because I was in other cities 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.700
 i do not have to berlin where they come from and 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.370
 where in other European cities but 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.920
 gégé 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.730
 I feel like something is 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.260
 two individuals game 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.210
 an impression I've ever had in 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.770
 another city is like I had 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:03.390
 lived a life before stockholm 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.930
 is in general I had been in summer but 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.990
 as 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.360
 the age one is in winter and the like 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.620
 night falls quickly 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.820
 that's when I do not know 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.940
 why did I feel like I 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.650
 already lived in another life that makes me 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.690
 a funny effect and I never had this 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.940
 impression in another life is good 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.199
 true thank you very much sir monette 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.630

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.229
