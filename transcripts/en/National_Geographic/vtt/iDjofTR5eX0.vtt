What I'd like to share
with you this evening is

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:06.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
some of my latest
work for National
Geographic about sharks.

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:11.411 align:start size:97% position:3%
Or as we say where I come
from in Massachusetts, sharks.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.813 align:start size:84% position:16%
Over the last two
years I've worked on

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.748
four separate projects.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:19.819 line:0%
Four separate stories about
the top predatory species

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.288 line:0%
of sharks on planet earth. 

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:25.091 line:0%
And the idea was,
this was done in hopes

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.460
by running em as Greg said,
by running these stories

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.962 align:start size:97% position:3%
consecutively in the
magazine, we ran three of em,

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.363
one more upcoming.

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.533
The idea was to sort
of give these animals

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.201
somewhat of a makeover.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:39.271 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think the hope at least
my hope was to change

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.674
or replace fear with respect.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.080
Because nobody respects
sharks more than I do.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.084 align:start size:97% position:3%
Believe me, nobody respects
sharks more than me.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.454 align:start size:84% position:16%
But what I also
wanted to do tonight,

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:57.189 align:start size:97% position:3%
in addition to showing
some of this brand new work

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:00.259
or the latest work was to
include some earlier work

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:04.130 align:start size:97% position:3%
that might give a little
context to these new stories

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.300
because for me sharks have
been sort of this life long

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
pursuit, something
that has fascinated me

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.805
for a very long time and
I wanted to sort of give

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.675 align:start size:88% position:13%
context to how I arrived
at these new stories

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.243
by looking at some
of the early stuff.

00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:22.849
I actually saw my very
first shark in the wild,

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.950
back in 1982.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:29.154
It was off the coast of Rhode
Island in very murky waters

00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:31.790
out there, I was about
20 years old at the time

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.295
and I had been invited to join
a group of marine biologists

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start size:97% position:3%
that were doing their own
sort of little private trips

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.733
out there and they were
lead by a scientist named

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.235
West Pratt, who built
his own shark cage,

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start size:97% position:3%
sort of this little chicken
wire cage that he made.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.108
And he would go off shore and
put a little chum in the water

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:52.211 align:start size:84% position:16%
and hope to see
mostly blue sharks.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.346 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I can remember
standing in that cage

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:57.984
just below the surface on
sort of a mildly rough day

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:01.687
and waiting for hours just
staring out into the gloom,

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.356
hoping to see a shark.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.792 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was just about
ready to give up hope

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.795
when at about four o'
clock that afternoon,

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.964
that first shark appeared.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was a female blue
shark, about six feet long.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.838
And the instant I saw her,
I was both instantly amazed

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:22.141
and sort of hypnotized,
stunned by that beautiful

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.677
blue color that they
have on their backs,

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.712 align:start size:84% position:16%
sort of glowed in
that afternoon light.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.848
Without really thinking
about I, opened the door

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.418
of the shark cage
and swam outside.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.954 align:start position:0%
Because the shark wasn't
coming close enough to the cage

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:38.024
and I really wanted to get
close and to make pictures.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.060
The scientist later told me
that I was the first person

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.264
to ever swim outside the cage,
but I just had to get close,

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:47.500 align:start size:84% position:16%
I needed to be up
close to this animal.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.303 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now my heart was racing
in those moments,

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.605
there was a real
mix of emotions.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.975 align:start position:0%
On one hand I was thinking,
what do I do if she comes at me?

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:58.077
What do I do if she
tries to bite me?

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.980
And on the other hand
I was just so thrilled

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.217 align:start size:94% position:6%
to finally be out there
in the middle of the ocean

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.885
with this gorgeous animal.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.988
She moved elegantly
through the water,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.356 align:start size:81% position:19%
sort of meandering
her way around,

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.358
coming pretty close at times

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.461 align:start size:97% position:3%
and clearly aware of my
presence but really paid me

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.729
little attention.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.330
It was as if she was
on her own mission,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.667
some ancient journey
that didn't include me

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:25.638 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I was just a
momentary distraction.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.506
After a few minutes,

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.542
she sort of just
moved away from me

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.543
and swam toward the boat.

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:34.147
And I watched her glide into
the shadows and then disappear

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.516
into that late day light.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.984
She was gone.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.186
And once again I found
myself, sort of just,

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:42.455 align:start size:84% position:16%
drifting alone in that
emerald green sea,

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:45.057 align:start size:84% position:16%
feeling like I was
waking up from a dream

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:47.994
and wondering if it
was all really true,

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.730 align:start size:97% position:3%
if this had really happened,
this first encounter.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.034 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now the first encounter
that I had with a wild shark

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:57.269
as I said happened when
I was about 20 years old.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.406 align:start position:0%
That was four years after I
became a certified scuba diver.

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:04.277
My very first C card right here.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.878
I was about 16 years old.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.181
Kinda stunning actually
how little I've changed

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.415
since I was 16.

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:15.354 align:start size:97% position:3%
But I became a diver because
I had this deep desire

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:18.991 align:start position:0%
to explore the ocean and to
photograph animals like sharks.

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.928
That was a big reason why
I wanted to become a diver.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:26.398 align:start position:0%
And until I had that first
experience with the blue shark,

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:28.835 align:start size:97% position:3%
these animals seemed almost
like mythical creatures to me,

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.302
like a unicorn.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:32.538 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'd read about them but until
you actually are in their

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.107 align:start size:84% position:16%
presence, it doesn't
really seem real.

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:38.010 align:start size:88% position:13%
So that first experience
with the blue shark,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.114 align:start size:88% position:13%
had me completely
hooked, no pun intended.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.483 align:start size:81% position:19%
I really knew that
I needed more,

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:44.750
that I wanted more.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.052
There was something
about these animals

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:48.954
that captivated me,
that fascinated me

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:51.224
and I knew I had to get
back out into the sea

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.424
as often as I could.

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:54.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
Just brief moments even
with these animals.

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.429
They're difficult to photograph

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.597
and it takes a lot to get
out there and see them but,

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:01.367
I knew that if I could just get
out there a little bit more,

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
maybe I could
satisfy that desire.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.505 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think part of what
attracted me to these animals

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.641 align:start size:97% position:3%
was the fact that many
species of sharks off course

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.510
are powerful predators.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.844
Big apex predators.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:14.013 align:start size:84% position:16%
And there's an
attraction to that.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:16.949
I wanted to experience
that for myself up close.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.018
For those of you who
have dived with sharks,

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:20.686 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think you can attest
to the fact that,

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:24.924
there is this seductive
blend of grace and power

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.026
that sort of exudes
from these animals.

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.996 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's palpable when
you're in their presence.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:34.667 align:start size:97% position:3%
But as a photographer, I
also became somewhat obsessed

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.570
with sharks from a
visual perspective.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.074 align:start size:94% position:6%
Throughout millions of
years, nature has sculpted

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:44.376 align:start size:97% position:3%
these animals to be perfect,
for life in the sea.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:46.746
These very hydrodynamic bodies.

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.782 align:start size:97% position:3%
For me they became a subject
that I just wanted to

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:52.918 align:start position:0%
constantly photograph and always
wanted to try to showcase.

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:55.287
I wanted to get that
ultimate shark photo.

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:58.090 align:start size:94% position:6%
To really show their
beautiful shape and form.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.592 align:start size:94% position:6%
And there's many
different types of sharks

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:02.194
so it was a lofty goal.

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:03.629
About a decade after I made

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.065 align:start size:84% position:16%
that very first
blue shark picture,

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.601
I had that very first encounter
in 1982 in the mid nineties,

00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:12.838 align:start size:97% position:3%
I made this photo of another
blue shark near my home

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:15.007
in New England and I
went into the water

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:17.909 align:start size:94% position:6%
that particular day
wanting to make a picture

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:22.515
that really showed
and accentuated their
exquisite contours.

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:26.051
This was an animal that
truly has been sculpted

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:28.921 align:start size:84% position:16%
and has that beautiful
long slender body

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:31.323
and those beautiful
big pectoral fins

00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:33.191
that help it glide
through the ocean.

00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was a bright sunny
day but in order to make

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.963 align:start size:94% position:6%
that photograph I selected
a very high aperture

00:06:37.963 --> 00:06:40.366 align:start size:84% position:16%
to turn the background
sort of black

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:43.135 align:start size:88% position:13%
and just lit the dorsal
side of the animal

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:44.570
as it passed below me.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.772 align:start size:97% position:3%
That little red thing
streaming off the dorsal fin

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:48.841
is actually a parasitic copepod

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.710 align:start size:97% position:3%
a little pelagic hitchhiker
that was adding a dash

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.847 align:start size:94% position:6%
of red color to the
otherwise blue background.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:57.350 align:start size:94% position:6%
So as my work evolved
and continued with sharks

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.253
I continued to focus on
these forms and shapes,

00:07:01.253 --> 00:07:03.221 align:start size:84% position:16%
looking at individual
body parts.

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:06.425
The dorsal fin of a lemon shark.

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:10.096
In this case adorned
with a trio of remoras,

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.597
these parasite fish.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:16.068
Or the giant unusual head of
a great hammer head shark.

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:18.638
Very bizarre looking animal
that almost looks prehistoric

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:21.507 align:start size:97% position:3%
but scientists actually tell
us that these are animals

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.243 align:start size:94% position:6%
that are more evolved than
other species of sharks

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:27.112 align:start size:84% position:16%
because their nostrils
have separated out

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:29.448 align:start size:84% position:16%
to either side of
that giant hammer head

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:33.418
and they sort of have
stereoscopic smell.

00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:35.688
They're a little bit of a
one upmanship in the game

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:37.990
of evolution in the ocean.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.559 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I also sort of
developed this fascination

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:41.994
with shark tails.

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:45.097
Most photographers off course
wanna photograph the mouth

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.599
or the front end
of the shark but,

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.801 align:start size:94% position:6%
I became really attracted,
sort of hypnotized

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.035
by the tails.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:51.570
Many species like
this tiger shark

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.806 align:start size:84% position:16%
or Makos and Great
Whites which we'll see

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.542 align:start size:81% position:19%
shortly have these
exquisite tails

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.844
and a really powerful tail

00:07:58.844 --> 00:08:00.779
and you know now with
digital photography

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:03.616
I had the luxury of being
able to shoot more frames,

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:06.084
not relegated to 36
on a roll of film

00:08:06.084 --> 00:08:08.253
so I could experiment more and
take these kinds of pictures

00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:11.456
and sort of satisfy this
weird obsession I have

00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:13.659
with shark tails.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.662
But one of the other things
that was important to me,

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:19.898 align:start size:97% position:3%
one of the things that I
tried to do with photography

00:08:19.898 --> 00:08:22.268 align:start size:84% position:16%
was to make pictures
that allowed us

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:26.005
or allowed animals like
sharks to sort of display

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.341
their exceptional biology.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.377 align:start size:97% position:3%
Sharks have evolved over
hundreds of millions of years,

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:33.912
they haven't really changed in
hundreds of millions of years

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:37.082
because they're perfect for
their life in the ocean.

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:39.384
But I wanted to make
images that would allow

00:08:39.384 --> 00:08:40.986
lets say the text in a story

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:42.521
to talk about some
of these features,

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:43.990
like their eyes.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.659 align:start size:94% position:6%
Most sharks have eyes that
are exceptionally good

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.193
in dark water.

00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:50.830
We know that a cat can see
really good in dark light

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.433
but sharks can see twice
as good as the cat can.

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:57.969
And these animals have
skin that is made up of

00:08:57.969 --> 00:08:59.805
millions of tiny little teeth,

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.174 align:start size:94% position:6%
they're called dermal
denticles but they're very

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:05.811
hydrodynamic and help the
animal efficiently swim

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:07.279
through the ocean
and I don't know

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.981
if you can see in the photo
but they've also evolved

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:12.150
these little dots on their
nose, on their snout there.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.520
These are called ampullae of
Lorenzini and they're a nerve

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.356
ending that allows the shark
to detect electrical impulses

00:09:18.356 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start size:88% position:13%
in the water like the
beating heart of a fish.

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.195
So if they're hunting
in very murky water

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.463
where eye sight doesn't work,

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.765
they can use those
ampullae of Lorenzini

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:29.734
to hone in on their prey
so just amazing predators

00:09:29.734 --> 00:09:31.203
and being able to make pictures

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:34.073 align:start size:97% position:3%
that allowed the text to talk
about that was important.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.375 align:start size:94% position:6%
And in terms of evolution
I also wanted to show

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:39.111
that you know, a shark is
not as a shark as a shark,

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:42.982
that they've all developed
and evolved morphologically

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.618
for the environment that
they happen to inhabit.

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:48.019 align:start size:84% position:16%
And even with things
like their teeth,

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:49.889
they're not all the same at all.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:53.659
This is a sand tiger shark
that I photographed in Japan

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:56.328 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you can so those sort
of long slender teeth

00:09:56.328 --> 00:09:58.564
that the sand tiger has
which are very different

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.499
than a regular tiger shark.

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.535
This is a tiger shark
and you can see those

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:05.771
sort of triangular
serrated teeth here

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.072
that the tiger shark has

00:10:07.072 --> 00:10:09.708 align:start size:88% position:13%
which are used for
chumping into their prey

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:11.843 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is often things
like sea turtles,

00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:14.313 align:start size:88% position:13%
sorry for the sea turtle
fans in the audience.

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.281
But they're very different.

00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:20.019 align:start position:0%
So making these kinds of
pictures helped, I think readers

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:24.189 align:start size:97% position:3%
and helped give some
dimension to these animals.

00:10:24.189 --> 00:10:27.926
And I also wanted to photograph
species like the whale shark

00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:29.695
which doesn't have teeth at all

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:31.864 align:start size:88% position:13%
or the teeth that it
has are very very small.

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.599
This is a plankton feeder.

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:37.569
Not a predatory shark but the
biggest fish in the ocean.

00:10:37.569 --> 00:10:39.939 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is one that I
photographed in Mexico

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.340
and was sort of entranced

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.842 align:start size:81% position:19%
by this living
wreath of bait fish

00:10:43.842 --> 00:10:45.076
that was encircling its head

00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:47.513
as I was free diving
alongside of it there

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:49.982 align:start size:97% position:3%
that day in these coastal
waters that were very green.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:54.020 align:start position:0%
I actually saw my very fist
whale shark in western Australia

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.888
back in 1995.

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:59.157
Giant animal and I can remember
we were using spotter planes

00:10:59.157 --> 00:11:00.926
to go out and sort of find them

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:02.694
and then when they found one
they would radio to the boat

00:11:02.694 --> 00:11:04.062
and tell us where it was

00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:05.864 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we'd position ourselves
way in front of it

00:11:05.864 --> 00:11:08.967 align:start position:0%
and I would slip into the water
and just sort of wait there

00:11:08.967 --> 00:11:11.036 align:start size:88% position:13%
snorkeling for this
animal that materialized

00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:15.307
out of the blue and it was like
swimming next to a dinosaur.

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.209 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's the closest
thing I could imagine.

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:20.246
Just silently emerges and
then sort of fades off

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.781
into the gloom.

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:26.151 align:start size:97% position:3%
But despite my own personal
fascination and love

00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:29.087
of sharks I realized
that these are animals

00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:32.490
that for many people
are something to fear,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.959
something that they don't like.

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:36.395
There's still the old adage
that the only good shark

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:39.898
is a dead shark and sharks
have been portrayed as demons

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.667
something that must be killed.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.936
This has certainly been true
in modern times off course

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:45.804
with films like Jaws.

00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:48.473
Even though Jaws sort
of demonized sharks,

00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:51.576
I have to say I do love that
film, but for other reasons.

00:11:51.576 --> 00:11:54.080
But we were sort of demonizing

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:58.016
and villainizing these
animals long before Jaws,

00:11:58.016 --> 00:11:59.517
the book or the movie came out.

00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:03.588
This is a painting that was
done by John Singleton Copley

00:12:03.588 --> 00:12:07.293
in 1778 that's called
Watson and the Shark

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:10.962
and it shows this monster like
shark about to eat this woman

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:12.798 align:start size:94% position:6%
that's fallen in the
ocean and all these people

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:16.101
are being terrorized and I
think for a very long time

00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:17.970
sharks have been
portrayed as these

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.406
sort of shadowy one
dimensional monsters

00:12:21.406 --> 00:12:23.408 align:start size:81% position:19%
that don't have
any depth to them.

00:12:23.408 --> 00:12:24.843 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're just out there
waiting to eat us

00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:27.846 align:start size:84% position:16%
the second we put
our toe in the ocean

00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:30.149 align:start size:81% position:19%
and the reality
off course is that

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.484 align:start size:97% position:3%
although they are predators
and have the potential

00:12:32.484 --> 00:12:34.319
to do harm to humans,

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:36.288
we're definitely
not on the menu.

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:39.257 align:start size:88% position:13%
These are actually
rather complex animals,

00:12:39.257 --> 00:12:41.793
science is only beginning
to fully understand them,

00:12:41.793 --> 00:12:43.863 align:start size:84% position:16%
but they're very very
complex creatures

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:47.399
and they play a vital role
in the health of the ocean.

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.402 align:start size:94% position:6%
So as I worked on new
stories for the magazine,

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:53.071 align:start size:94% position:6%
I wanted to produce images
that would allow people

00:12:53.071 --> 00:12:56.275
to see sharks in new
ways, in new light,

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:59.811
and help change some of these
misconceptions that exist.

00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:01.880
Whenever possible I
wanted to make images

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.149 align:start size:88% position:13%
that showed sharks
within their environment

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:06.051
because what we've
learned over time

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:08.954 align:start size:94% position:6%
is that healthy ecosystems
in the ocean depend

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:11.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
on healthy populations
of predators,

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.559 align:start size:84% position:16%
particularly
animals like sharks.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.894 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is an image that I made
of a Black Tip Reef Shark

00:13:15.894 --> 00:13:19.664 align:start size:97% position:3%
in a place called Millennium
Atoll out in the middle

00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:21.366
of the central South Pacific.

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:24.102
One of these places that
because of its remoteness

00:13:24.102 --> 00:13:26.704
has remained largely unspoiled

00:13:26.704 --> 00:13:28.540
and it's a very sharky place.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.776 align:start size:97% position:3%
The biomass of predators like
sharks is very high there

00:13:31.776 --> 00:13:33.111
and there's a direct correlation

00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:35.714
between the number of sharks

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:38.450
and the health of
the coral reefs.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.887 align:start position:0%
This is science that Enric
Sala and his Pristine Seas team

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:43.322
who I think might
be here tonight,

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:44.889
have sort of proven.

00:13:44.889 --> 00:13:48.327 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I saw it not only in these
places but in other places.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was on an assignment
for the magazine

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.464
a number of years
ago in New Zealand

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:53.966
doing a story on marine reserves

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:56.501 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I was in Fiordland,
this very shadowy,

00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:57.936
sort of Lord of the Rings place.

00:13:57.936 --> 00:13:59.838 align:start size:84% position:16%
And diving in the
temperate water there.

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:02.074
And I was photographing
macro life on the wall,

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:03.642 align:start size:84% position:16%
these colorful
little tiny animals.

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:05.945
And I looked up and in
the distance saw this

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:08.814 align:start size:94% position:6%
Sevengill Shark a very
prehistoric looking animal

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:10.048
sort of coming at me

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:12.784
so I swapped my macro
rig for a wide angle

00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:13.985
that my assistant was holding

00:14:13.985 --> 00:14:15.888 align:start size:84% position:16%
and was able to
make a single frame.

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.389
But again the correlation

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.858
is between healthy
shark populations

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:22.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
and healthy oceans, it's
a direct correlation

00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:23.928
and that's what I've learned.

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:26.064
So whenever possible,
I wanna make images

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:29.601
that sort of speak
to that relationship.

00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:31.770 align:start size:81% position:19%
It was the same
everywhere I went.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.906
You'd go to places that
saw dead coral reefs

00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:37.943 align:start size:97% position:3%
in parts of the Caribbean lets
say and you just didn't see

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:39.411
many sharks.

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:42.113 align:start size:94% position:6%
Or I went to the Bahamas,
places in the Bahamas

00:14:42.113 --> 00:14:44.149 align:start size:84% position:16%
where the reefs
were pretty healthy

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:46.484
and there were lots
of sharks around

00:14:46.484 --> 00:14:48.353
so you could see it,
it was quite evident.

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:50.288
And in my work as it evolved,

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:52.290 align:start size:97% position:3%
I also wanted,
particularly in the stories

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.626
for National Geographic, I
wanted to try to show readers

00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:57.228
a little bit more of
the lives of sharks,

00:14:57.228 --> 00:14:59.330
a little bit more
of the life cycle.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.935 align:start size:97% position:3%
Particularly focusing for a
period of time on baby sharks,

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.370
on shark pups.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.606 align:start position:0%
Because at the time I made
this photo of a lemon shark pup

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:10.341 align:start size:94% position:6%
in Bimini in the Bahamas,
I hadn't really seen

00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:12.077
a lot of images of
this kind of thing

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:15.514 align:start size:94% position:6%
but it's a very important
part of the equation.

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:19.050 align:start size:94% position:6%
Most folks just wanna look
at the big scary sharks

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.652
with the jaws and the
teeth and the blood

00:15:20.652 --> 00:15:22.921
and that kind of thing but,
this is an important part

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.456
of the equation.

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:27.859
Lemon shark pups have their
babies in mangrove nurseries

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:30.495
in these very shallow
places where trees grow

00:15:30.495 --> 00:15:31.997
out of the water.

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:33.531 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it's a place where big
predators can't get in.

00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:35.801
And the lemon sharks live
for the first two to three

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:38.136
years of their lives
in these nurseries

00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:40.472 align:start size:94% position:6%
where they feed and
eventually get big enough

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.473 align:start size:84% position:16%
to go out and
compete on the reef.

00:15:42.473 --> 00:15:46.511 align:start size:88% position:13%
But this was a fairly
new born lemon shark pup

00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:48.480
that was maybe only
12 inches in length

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.981
swimming in about a
foot deep of water.

00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:51.917
I spent days laying
in that mangrove

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.886
trying to get the sharks
to build up their courage

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:56.154 align:start size:88% position:13%
and come close and
after I left this place,

00:15:56.154 --> 00:15:58.023
I'd learned that some
of these mangroves

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.191
had been bulldozed
so that a golf course

00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:02.227
could be made for a resort.

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:05.230 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is the only shark
nursery for a 150 miles around

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.799 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it's critical habitat
so these are vital.

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:10.268
So having images like this
within the context of a story

00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:12.403
I think helps people to
understand the importance

00:16:12.403 --> 00:16:14.105
of protecting places like this.

00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:16.942 align:start size:97% position:3%
And whenever possible I
also wanted to show behavior

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:19.511 align:start size:94% position:6%
with sharks, it's a little
hard to do sometimes

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:22.481
but we're working on a story
about the Mesoamerican Reef,

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:25.717 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's the second largest
barrier reef in the world.

00:16:25.717 --> 00:16:28.186 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was able to photograph
Caribbean reef sharks

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:30.055
predating on lion fish.

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.958
Now as you may know lion
fish are invasive species

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.059
in the Atlantic ocean.

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:36.328
They've sort of just exploded

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.831
and there haven't really
been any great solutions

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.265
to eradicating them.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.733 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's some places
where divers will go down

00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:45.337 align:start size:97% position:3%
and try to spear them and
it's had some low level impact

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:49.074
but in Roatan in Honduras
there was a shark biologist

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:51.276
that over a couple of years
had been trying to train

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:54.312
the local Caribbean reef
sharks to acquire a taste

00:16:54.312 --> 00:16:57.082 align:start size:97% position:3%
for these, he'd initially
spear them and feed em to them

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:59.218
and over time they began to
naturally predate on them

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:00.718 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it was controlling
the population,

00:17:00.718 --> 00:17:02.320
they were beginning to go down

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.689
and naturally predate on that.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.223
So that was important too.

00:17:05.223 --> 00:17:08.760
But at the end of the day,
I mostly really hope that

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.096
by showing sharks as
something beautiful,

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.498 align:start size:88% position:13%
as just beautiful
animals, making pictures

00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:14.866
that would intrigue the reader

00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:16.534
and making them wanna know more

00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:18.970
might dispel some of that fear.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.839
Again that shadowy, looking
at pictures like Copley,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.210
Copley that just make
them look like monsters

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.711
isn't gonna help anything.

00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:28.647
But if we can show these
animals as more beautiful,

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:29.948
maybe not quite dolphins,

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:32.951 align:start size:88% position:13%
but certainly
something to marvel at.

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:36.721
And while working on a story
about sharks of the Bahamas

00:17:36.721 --> 00:17:38.156
a few years for the Magazine.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:41.894 align:start size:94% position:6%
I spent 18 days in winter
time in the Bahamas

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.796 align:start size:97% position:3%
trying to get a photo of the
elusive great hammer head

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:47.466 align:start size:97% position:3%
that we see here but,
because of the rough weather

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.268 align:start size:81% position:19%
that we had at
that time of year,

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:51.770 align:start size:94% position:6%
I only had two days where
I could actually work

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.806 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I made this frame on the
very last night at sunset

00:17:54.806 --> 00:17:57.876
when this big fourteen foot
male sort of just swirled in

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.344
just below the surface.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:03.481 align:start size:97% position:3%
But the idea was that my hope
is that a photo like this

00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:06.518
might engage people or
readers in the magazine,

00:18:06.518 --> 00:18:08.453 align:start size:97% position:3%
they wanna read the caption
and hopefully the story

00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:11.956 align:start position:0%
and learn that hammer head
populations in the last 20 years

00:18:11.956 --> 00:18:15.494
or so in the Atlantic ocean
have declined about 89%.

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:18.063
These are animals that we
don't know very much about,

00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:21.065 align:start size:97% position:3%
we don't know where they
travel to or from necessarily,

00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:22.300
we don't know where they mate,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.835
we don't know where
they have their pups.

00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:25.537
And we're loosing them faster
than we can learn about them

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.405 align:start size:84% position:16%
so, to be able to make
beautiful pictures

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:31.109
or engaging images of sharks
I think is a big part of it.

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:34.212 align:start size:84% position:16%
The fact is almost
every species of shark

00:18:34.212 --> 00:18:36.514 align:start size:84% position:16%
out there in the world
is in real trouble,

00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:38.683
certainly all the
predatory species

00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:40.485
and they really
do need our help.

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:44.689
So as my career evolved,
I wanted to turn my camera

00:18:44.689 --> 00:18:46.291
toward some of the darker side

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
of what was happening
to sharks as well

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:50.195 align:start size:88% position:13%
because I felt it was
necessary to show people

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.564
what was happening
to these animals

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:54.098
and the global slaughter

00:18:54.098 --> 00:18:55.900
that was occurring
around the world.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
A lot of sharks
are killed for food

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:00.205
but the truth is
this is wildlife

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:03.208 align:start size:94% position:6%
and every single year
right now on planet earth,

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:05.943
more than a 100 million
sharks are being killed.

00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:07.379
I mean think about that number.

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:09.280
A 100 million sharks.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.117 align:start size:84% position:16%
We can't kill a 100
million apex predators

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
and expect any
ecosystem to be healthy

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.421 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that's certainly
the case here so,

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.823 align:start size:84% position:16%
as I worked on these
kinds of stories,

00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:21.860 align:start size:97% position:3%
I sort of got away from trying
to make beautiful pictures

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.961
and approached it more
like war photography.

00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:26.998
I wanted to make images that
would grab people's attention

00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:29.634
so it was dead sharks
being cut up on a beach

00:19:29.634 --> 00:19:32.604 align:start size:84% position:16%
or a dead Mako
shark in a gill net.

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:35.973
And showing another Mako here
on the beach being finned.

00:19:35.973 --> 00:19:38.276
You know most of those
sharks, the 100 million

00:19:38.276 --> 00:19:39.544
or whatever the actual number is

00:19:39.544 --> 00:19:40.912
maybe more than a 100 million.

00:19:40.912 --> 00:19:43.182 align:start size:84% position:16%
Most of those are
killed for their fins

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.751 align:start size:94% position:6%
for the soup fin business,
in the shark fin soup

00:19:46.751 --> 00:19:48.186
that's very popular in Asia.

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:49.120
And that's what's
happening here,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.622
they fetch a very high price,

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:53.391 align:start size:97% position:3%
so that's the first thing
that the fisherman goes for.

00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:57.729
And as I was working on
this story, I wanted,

00:19:57.729 --> 00:19:59.297
it was a story about
the global fish crisis,

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:01.299 align:start size:97% position:3%
the problems of overfishing
and shark fishing

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:02.767
was a big component of that.

00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:06.204 align:start size:97% position:3%
I really wanted an image that
would create some empathy

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:07.505
for these animals.

00:20:07.505 --> 00:20:08.974
I think this picture
might have done it,

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:11.509 align:start position:0%
but it was actually one morning
when I jumped in the water

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:15.714
in the sea of Cortez
came along a gill net,

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:18.116
where this Thresher shark
had just recently died

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.884
and its eye was still open

00:20:19.884 --> 00:20:22.187 align:start size:94% position:6%
and because it's a pelagic
animal, it had these

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:23.989
great big pectoral
fins like we saw

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:26.891 align:start size:94% position:6%
on the blue shark earlier
and as I framed it up

00:20:26.891 --> 00:20:28.927 align:start size:94% position:6%
in my camera's view finder
it sort of struck me

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:31.162
as a crucifixion and
I thought that maybe

00:20:31.162 --> 00:20:34.733 align:start size:88% position:13%
that would give some
empathy to these animals

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.002 align:start size:94% position:6%
that really are in
trouble and need our help.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:40.271
It became the lead picture
in that cover story in 2007

00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:42.173 align:start size:88% position:13%
but it's gone on to
have a life beyond that.

00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:45.377 align:start size:84% position:16%
Being used by a
number of conservation
organizations as well

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:46.845
to sort of beat that drum

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:48.813 align:start size:94% position:6%
and help people understand
the plight of sharks.

00:20:48.813 --> 00:20:51.916
So all of this sort of
prelude brings me to

00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:54.853 align:start size:97% position:3%
the work that I recently
did for National Geographic,

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:58.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
these series of four stories
about some of the top

00:20:58.022 --> 00:21:00.625
predatory species of sharks.

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:03.061
As Greg mentioned, we ran
three of them this summer

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:04.662
in June, July and August

00:21:04.662 --> 00:21:07.298
and we have one story
yet to be published,

00:21:07.298 --> 00:21:10.101
a story on Mako sharks
that will be upcoming.

00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:13.071 align:start size:97% position:3%
And you know I think my
hope was that by doing that

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:14.873 align:start size:84% position:16%
as I mentioned
earlier consecutively,

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:18.209
readers would come to see
these animals as different,

00:21:18.209 --> 00:21:20.745
as to some degree
having personality

00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:24.649
and as being something that
we can, not only respect

00:21:24.649 --> 00:21:26.217
but really marvel at.

00:21:26.217 --> 00:21:29.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
I don't have any illusions
that sharks or fish

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.189 align:start size:81% position:19%
which is what they
are off course

00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:33.291
will ever be held
in the same regard

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:36.094
that a fury mammal, I think
we have a national affinity

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:39.230
to terrestrial animals,
particularly cute animals

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.066
that live in the forest but,

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:44.035
I do think that if we
can show these animals

00:21:44.035 --> 00:21:45.570
as miracles of evolution

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.639
then maybe we can
get some respect

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:50.007 align:start size:94% position:6%
and if we get the
respect then appreciation

00:21:50.007 --> 00:21:52.577
and move that dial a little
bit in terms of conservation,
