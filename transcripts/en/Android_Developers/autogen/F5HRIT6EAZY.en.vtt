over the years the needs of developers

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740
over the years the needs of developers
 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.860
over the years the needs of developers
have evolved substantially and we've had

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
have evolved substantially and we've had
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.130
have evolved substantially and we've had
to evolve along with them and so play

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
to evolve along with them and so play

game services has since expanded to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
game services has since expanded to
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.420
game services has since expanded to
offer things like video recording and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
offer things like video recording and
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.030
offer things like video recording and
predictive analytics and tools to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
predictive analytics and tools to
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.650
predictive analytics and tools to
support live operations and another way

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
support live operations and another way
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.330
support live operations and another way
we've had to evolve is we needed to

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
we've had to evolve is we needed to
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.650
we've had to evolve is we needed to
start bringing our tools to the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660
start bringing our tools to the
 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.840
start bringing our tools to the
different products that our partners

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
different products that our partners
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.300
different products that our partners
here and in particular what we observed

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
here and in particular what we observed
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.300
here and in particular what we observed
after a number of conversations with

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310
after a number of conversations with
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400
after a number of conversations with
large developers and small developers

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
large developers and small developers
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.620
large developers and small developers
that day developers typically fell into

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630
that day developers typically fell into
 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.229
that day developers typically fell into
one of two camps they either had their

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239
one of two camps they either had their
 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.180
one of two camps they either had their
own game engine that that was that was

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
own game engine that that was that was
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.190
own game engine that that was that was
built in C++ or they used a game engine

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200
built in C++ or they used a game engine
 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.290
built in C++ or they used a game engine
oftentimes a unity or a cocos2d

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300
oftentimes a unity or a cocos2d
 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.729
oftentimes a unity or a cocos2d
so just a quick show of hands how many

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
so just a quick show of hands how many
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.009
so just a quick show of hands how many
you have your own game engine that

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019
you have your own game engine that
 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.720
you have your own game engine that
you've built in C++ specifically how

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730
you've built in C++ specifically how
 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.160
you've built in C++ specifically how
many you have something that your own

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170
many you have something that your own
 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.990
many you have something that your own
game engine not built in C++ but another

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000
game engine not built in C++ but another
 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.270
game engine not built in C++ but another
language didn't think so all right that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280
language didn't think so all right that
 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.640
language didn't think so all right that
is not a real thing it turns out and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650
is not a real thing it turns out and
 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.199
is not a real thing it turns out and
then how many use a game engine of some

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
then how many use a game engine of some
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.560
then how many use a game engine of some
sort okay that's the vast majority of

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570
sort okay that's the vast majority of
 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.170
sort okay that's the vast majority of
the audience and that makes sense and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
the audience and that makes sense and
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.620
the audience and that makes sense and
which is why when we looked at what our

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
which is why when we looked at what our
 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.600
which is why when we looked at what our
partners were doing we we realized we

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610
partners were doing we we realized we
 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.250
partners were doing we we realized we
absolutely had to have support for game

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260
absolutely had to have support for game
 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.289
absolutely had to have support for game
engines so we we actually have a unity

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299
engines so we we actually have a unity
 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.130
engines so we we actually have a unity
plug-in that is a open source project

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
plug-in that is a open source project
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.530
plug-in that is a open source project
that we maintain on github and you can

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790
simplified developer experience so
 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.760
simplified developer experience so
developers can focus on the fun and

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770
developers can focus on the fun and
 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.740
developers can focus on the fun and
engaging part of the game and a few

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750
engaging part of the game and a few
 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.540
engaging part of the game and a few
months ago they gave me a sneak preview

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550
months ago they gave me a sneak preview
 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.670
months ago they gave me a sneak preview
of their integration with Play game

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680
of their integration with Play game
 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.580
of their integration with Play game
services and I was blown away at how

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590
services and I was blown away at how
 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.380
services and I was blown away at how
simple it was I had to do a double-take

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390
simple it was I had to do a double-take
 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.320
simple it was I had to do a double-take
because the integration looked so easy

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330
because the integration looked so easy
 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.470
because the integration looked so easy
and and this is how it works for them so

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480
and and this is how it works for them so
 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.600
and and this is how it works for them so
you first have to go into the Play

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610
you first have to go into the Play
 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.180
you first have to go into the Play
Developer console and grab an ID this is

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190
Developer console and grab an ID this is
 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.120
Developer console and grab an ID this is
a very easy thing to do and then you go

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130
a very easy thing to do and then you go
 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.430
a very easy thing to do and then you go
into the default management console and

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440
into the default management console and
 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.140
into the default management console and
copy and paste it in there somewhere and

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150
copy and paste it in there somewhere and
 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.600
copy and paste it in there somewhere and
then once you've done that very small

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610
then once you've done that very small
 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.390
then once you've done that very small
bit of work you can then in a single

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400
bit of work you can then in a single
 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.200
bit of work you can then in a single
line of code integrate sign in with Play

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210
line of code integrate sign in with Play
 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.780
line of code integrate sign in with Play
game services so it's almost

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790
game services so it's almost
 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.000
game services so it's almost
instantaneous and when they showed it to

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010
instantaneous and when they showed it to
 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.030
instantaneous and when they showed it to
me it was something that I believe all

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040
me it was something that I believe all
 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.430
me it was something that I believe all
game engines should ultimately aspire to

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440
game engines should ultimately aspire to
 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.290
game engines should ultimately aspire to
be able to accomplish it should take

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300
be able to accomplish it should take
 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300
be able to accomplish it should take
less than an hour to integrate and they

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310
less than an hour to integrate and they
 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.260
less than an hour to integrate and they
really bring that vision to fruition and

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270
really bring that vision to fruition and
 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.550
really bring that vision to fruition and
we're excited to see them launch their

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560
we're excited to see them launch their
 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.950
we're excited to see them launch their

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.990
year so there's a lot of other territory
we could cover but I'm going to focus on

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000
we could cover but I'm going to focus on
 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.240
we could cover but I'm going to focus on
three things that Play games can do to

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.150
ended at 11:59 59 on a Sunday we've
heard many developers actually have to

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160
heard many developers actually have to
 

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.580
heard many developers actually have to
have someone come into the office and

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:50.590
have someone come into the office and
 

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.220
have someone come into the office and
like hit a button to turn off their

to do this and in fact there is and it
 

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.130
to do this and in fact there is and it
is game parameters management just to be

using the player stats API to tailor
 

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.940
using the player stats API to tailor
game experiences for different player

game experiences for different player
 

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.270
game experiences for different player
segments so we launched the player stats

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:12.280
segments so we launched the player stats
 

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.240
segments so we launched the player stats
API last year and we've continued to

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.250
API last year and we've continued to
 

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.580
API last year and we've continued to
invest in a number of new predictions to

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:17.590
invest in a number of new predictions to
 

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.840
invest in a number of new predictions to
make the player stats API even more

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:19.850
make the player stats API even more
 

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.850
make the player stats API even more
powerful we launched with some basic

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:21.860
powerful we launched with some basic
 

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.100
powerful we launched with some basic
stats like sessions percentile spend

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.110
stats like sessions percentile spend
 

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.350

percentile as well as with some
predictions the probability that someone

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040
predictions the probability that someone
 

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.370
predictions the probability that someone
is likely to churn as well as spend and

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380
is likely to churn as well as spend and
 

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.230
is likely to churn as well as spend and
we have two new predictions coming out

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240
we have two new predictions coming out
 

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.840
we have two new predictions coming out
in the next few weeks one of them is a

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:34.850
in the next few weeks one of them is a
 

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.340
in the next few weeks one of them is a
prediction of how much someone is likely

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.350
prediction of how much someone is likely
 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.650
prediction of how much someone is likely
to spend in the next 28 days and the

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:38.660
to spend in the next 28 days and the
 

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.660
to spend in the next 28 days and the
other is the likelihood that someone

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:40.670
other is the likelihood that someone
 

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.759
other is the likelihood that someone
will become a high spender a 95th

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:42.769
will become a high spender a 95th
 

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:45.069
will become a high spender a 95th
percentile spender or above and we

00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079
percentile spender or above and we
 

00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:47.230
percentile spender or above and we
couldn't be more excited to see what

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240
couldn't be more excited to see what
 

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.850
couldn't be more excited to see what
creative things you'll be able to do

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:48.860
creative things you'll be able to do
 

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.059
creative things you'll be able to do
with these new predictions but I thought

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:52.069
with these new predictions but I thought
 

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:53.350
with these new predictions but I thought
I'd go through a couple of different

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360
I'd go through a couple of different
 

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.389
I'd go through a couple of different
examples of what people are doing and

00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399
examples of what people are doing and
 

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:57.460
examples of what people are doing and
sort of the the enthusiasm we're seeing

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:57.470
sort of the the enthusiasm we're seeing
 

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.960
sort of the the enthusiasm we're seeing
from the gaming community and so a

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:58.970
from the gaming community and so a
 

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.509
from the gaming community and so a
developer game resort felt that the

00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519
developer game resort felt that the
 

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:02.800
developer game resort felt that the
player sets a pit was one of the most

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:02.810
player sets a pit was one of the most
 

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.290
player sets a pit was one of the most
exciting things that's recently happened

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:05.300
exciting things that's recently happened
 

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.180
exciting things that's recently happened
for game developers particularly for

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.190
for game developers particularly for
 

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.490
for game developers particularly for
small developers that don't have the

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:09.500
small developers that don't have the
 

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.439
small developers that don't have the
resources to do this type of work and

00:14:11.439 --> 00:14:11.449
resources to do this type of work and
 

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:13.300
resources to do this type of work and
that's a common sentiment amongst many

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.310
that's a common sentiment amongst many
 

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.009
that's a common sentiment amongst many
of the smaller and indie developers that

power that we have is something that is
 

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.210
power that we have is something that is
very difficult to do independently and

very difficult to do independently and
 

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.730
very difficult to do independently and
we give that capability for free through

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:24.740
we give that capability for free through
 

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.670
we give that capability for free through
a Play game services integration and

what game resort is planning to do with
the API is to use spend prediction to

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:31.670
the API is to use spend prediction to
 

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.290
the API is to use spend prediction to
show whether or not a user so I'm sorry

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:35.300
show whether or not a user so I'm sorry
 

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.639
show whether or not a user so I'm sorry
to determine whether or not a user will

to determine whether or not a user will
 

00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:40.480
to determine whether or not a user will
show ads or see ads I should say and in

show ads or see ads I should say and in
 

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.710
show ads or see ads I should say and in
fact this other developers already

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720
fact this other developers already
 

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.179
fact this other developers already
launched such an integration so

00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:43.189
launched such an integration so
 

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:45.189
launched such an integration so
developer underwater apps has a really

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199
developer underwater apps has a really
 

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:47.139
developer underwater apps has a really
exciting integration of the player stats

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:47.149
exciting integration of the player stats
 

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:49.689
exciting integration of the player stats
API they integrated player stats into

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:49.699
API they integrated player stats into
 

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:51.939
API they integrated player stats into
their game tap ventures and use the

00:14:51.939 --> 00:14:51.949
their game tap ventures and use the
 

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:54.249
their game tap ventures and use the
spend prediction signal to determine if

00:14:54.249 --> 00:14:54.259
spend prediction signal to determine if
 

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:56.889
spend prediction signal to determine if
users should see ads as I was describing

users should see ads as I was describing
 

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:59.110
users should see ads as I was describing
and if a user was predicted to spend

00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120
and if a user was predicted to spend
 

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.590
and if a user was predicted to spend
they saw no ads at all and if a user was

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:02.600
they saw no ads at all and if a user was
 

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.900
