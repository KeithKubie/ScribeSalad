MALE SPEAKER: Once you've
built a quality app

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.770
and published it on
Google Play, you've

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.080
got to start letting
people know about it.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.230
Users have lots of
apps to choose from,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.740
so you need to work to
make yours stand out.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.980
Here are 10 tips you should
follow to get more users

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.400
to install your app.

Optimize your Play
Store listing.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.940
Your listing will most
probably be prospective users'

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.170
first introduction to your app.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.540
So, make it compelling.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.480
Start with an eye catching
icon and add graphics that

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.140
convey the value of your app.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.940
Make your description
apt and succinct.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.070
Use the store listing
experiments feature

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.500
to test the graphics and text
that drive the most downloads,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.563
and localize your text,
images and videos.

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:48.600
Your listing needs to pop.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.620
Take your app global.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.980

So, localizing your
app can quickly

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.470

page of the Developer Console

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.910
or enterprises?

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.520
