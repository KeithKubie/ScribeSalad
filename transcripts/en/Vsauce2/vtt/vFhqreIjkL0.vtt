00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.929
The geography cone is a species of predatory
sea snail that has particularly potent venom

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.349
indigenous to the reefs of the Indo-Pacific,
and it's the most deadly of over 500 species

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.669
of cone snails. There is no known anti-venom,
and treatment includes simply keeping someone

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.269
alive until the toxins wear off. It has been
nicknamed the "Cigarette Snail" because its

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.009
believed that a person stung by one would
have enough time to smoke a cigarette before

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.890
dying.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.030
What The FAK: The facts and knowledge on Deadly
Animals.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.390
A single bite delivered by the Inland Taipan
can kill up to 250,000 mice and has strong

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.240
enough venom to kill 100 adult men, and it
has has the ability to kill someone within

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.990
45 minutes.&nbsp;Found in Australia, it claims
the top spot as the most venomous snake, but,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.100
luckily, it's shy, making human bites nearly
non existent. Hospitals equipped with anti-venom

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.690
have kept the death toll to zero known deaths
from this particular snake, nicknamed the

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.720
"Fierce Snake" because of the potency of the
venom, and not the behavior.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.549
The Stonefish is one of the most venomous
fish known in the world. They are found in

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.119
the Indo Pacific Ocean but can also be found
in Florida and the Caribbean. It has thirteen

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.270
stout spines in the dorsal fin which can inject
a highly toxic venom that causes intense pain,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.569
tremendous swelling, temporary paralysis and
even death if not treated quickly. They are

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.509
able to live out of the water for up to 24
hours and they blend into the background often

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.020
looking like an encrusted rock or lump of
coral so they are commonly stepped on making

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.200
stonefish anti venom the second most administered
in Australia.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.569
The Tsetse Fly is a bloodsucking fly found
in Africa that transmits the parasite causing

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.389
what is commonly known as Human Sleeping Sickness.
It can drink twice its weight in blood at

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:56.049
every meal, and once an infected fly bites
you the infection quickly spreads through

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.469
your blood. It is fatal if untreated and between
300 and 500,000 people are estimated to suffer

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.469
from the disease. The flies are hard to control
and, unlike most biting flies where only the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.160
female feeds on blood, both males and females
are blood suckers.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.080
The Box Jellyfish developed its powerful venom
to instantly stun and kill prey so their struggle

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.360
to escape wouldn't damage the delicate tentacles.
It has venom considered to be among the most

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.820
deadly in the world, and it is said to be
so painful that many victims die from going

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.580
into shock and drowning after being stung.
They are found primarily in the coastal waters

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.830
off northern Australia and throughout the
Indo Pacific. Each tentacle has around 5,000

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.930
stinging cells and, depending on the location
of the sting, can cause severe symptoms, including

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.630
cardiac arrest. Vinegar is said to inactivate
the remaining stinging cells left in the skin,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.710
and many Australian beaches have a bottle
stored on the beach next to warning signs.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.520
The Box Jellyfish has a tiny relative found
in the same area that causes severe pain and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.420
is nearly invincible. Called Irukandji, the
name refers to any species that causes the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.030
same symptoms- the exact amount of species
that can cause them is still unknown. Though

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.710
it is not as deadly as the larger Box Jellyfish,
the pain is excruciating and there is no anti-venom.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.010
Symptoms include lower back pain, muscle cramps,
sweating, nausea, and can last up to a week.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.150
Many patients require large doses of morphine
to get them through the pain, but there are

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.070
actually few known deaths from these little
guys.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.420
The Brazilian Wandering Spider held the Guinness
world record for "Most Venomous Spider" in

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.090
2007, and is still believed to hold that title.
They originated in Brazil but are found throughout

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.950
South and Central America. Brazilian Wandering
Spider is actually a generic name for eight

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.170
species that belong to the same genus. It
wanders all over the place searching for prey

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.300
and does not wait in ambush like a majority
of spiders. It is not afraid of humans, and

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.760
shows a defensive posture by standing on its
back legs and will attack when needed. Its

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.690
bite can be one of the most excruciating of
all spider bites because it has very large

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.860
fangs. Oh yeah, it also causes men to have
long lasting and painful erections.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.040
The Blue Ringed Octopi are tiny and the most
deadly of all cephalopods. Their common name

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.940
comes from the bright blue rings that come
to life when threatened. Though humans are

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.780
rarely bitten, there is no anti-venom and
life-saving efforts have to be put into place

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.150
until the toxins wear off. If bitten you'll
feel nauseous, possibly go blind, lose sense

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.560
of touch, speech, and the ability to swallow,
and within 3 minutes paralysis sets in and

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.500
your body goes into respiratory arrest. Constant
CPR is needed to keep the heart pumping until

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.320
the body is able to breath on its own. And
it carries enough poison to kill 26 adults...So...don't

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.710
touch it.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.280
Before the advent of the anti-venom the Black
Mamba bite was 100% fatal. Most snake's venom

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.630
travels slowly through the blood allowing
time for them to get treatment, but the Black

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.780
Mamba venom starts within 20 minutes and can
be fatal in only six hours. They are found throughout

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.810
most countries in sub Saharan Africa, can
reach up to 14 ft in length, and travel up

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.480
to 12 MPH. They generally avoid humans, but,
if threatened, they are fast, highly aggressive,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.060
and often raise a third of their bodies off
of the ground, then strike repeatedly if the

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.490
attacker persists.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.900
The creature that causes the most deaths among
humans is pretty small, really annoying, and

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.790
not nearly as intimidating as the others.
The Mosquito causes millions of deaths world-wide

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.520
every year from transmitting malaria, yellow
fever, encephalitis, and west nile virus.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.310
I'm gonna leave you with this Scorpion, considered
one of the deadliest in the world, whose toxins

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.070
are being used to fight brain cancer.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.760
