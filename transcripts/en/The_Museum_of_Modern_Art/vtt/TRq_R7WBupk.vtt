 Captions will
appear

00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:44.480
 here. Good night. We're 
delighted to

00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:47.223
have you with us tonight, 
welcome to our

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:51.078
digital audience, as well. We're
 coming

00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:56.697
together on a very topical 
discussion. In our

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.392
world, despite the advances of 
technology and

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:04.589
commerce and enlightened 
thought, more people

00:06:04.925 --> 00:06:09.182
are displaced by conflict than 
ever before in

00:06:09.548 --> 00:06:13.996
recorded history.
 The figures from the United 

00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:17.961
Nations refugee
report that was released last 

00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:20.284
week are
overwhelming. 65 million people 

00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:22.196
have been
forced from their homes by 

00:06:22.197 --> 00:06:24.629
political violence
and unrest and that's not 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.218
counting people who
are displaced by natural 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.720
disaster. The
largest number come from Syria 

00:06:30.721 --> 00:06:33.934
and Iraq, but
those places are hardly alone in

00:06:34.263 --> 00:06:38.379
 feeding this
Exodus. There's a surge of 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.103
migrants coming
from the Congo, smallo, South 

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:48.229
Sudan, Nigeria,
Afghanistan, Haiti, and Colombia

00:06:48.747 --> 00:06:52.072
.
 25 million people are taking 

00:06:52.073 --> 00:06:53.962
refuge outside
of their country and the largest

00:06:53.963 --> 00:06:56.248
 part of this
flood are not coming to rest in 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.517
Europe as the
press might have you believe, 

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.480
but in Turkey
and Lebanon and Jordan and 

00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:05.622
Ethiopia. Along
the way in seeking safety, 1 in 

00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:11.344
20 people
die. And nearly 100,000 children

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.510
 have
attempted the journey on their 

00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:16.135
own. This is
the most staggering global 

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:20.298
crisis we have
seen since WWII, and it's an 

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:22.944
existential one.
One that calls into question the

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:28.704
 adequacy of
many of our long-held thoughts 

00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:32.808
and ideas, our
ideas about welcome, about 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.640
citizenship, about
nation, and borders, about 

00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:41.048
Europe itself.
 And that seems clear with the 

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:43.846
shock of
yesterday's news that Great 

00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:48.406
Britain elected
to leave the European Union, 

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:52.105
motivated in
large part by a fear of open 

00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:57.691
borders and
untramieled immigration, but of 

00:07:57.692 --> 00:08:01.091
course this
is not just Europe's problem. It

00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:03.961
 is ours,
too, and I don't just mean 

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:06.356
economic
implications of Brexit. I'm 

00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:08.636
thinking about
the way that we are subject to 

00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:15.928
the same
forces. It's been made clear in 

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:18.422
Donald
Trump's xenophobic proclamations

00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:22.627
 or this
week's Supreme Court decision 

00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:28.219
about illegal
searches that justis society  

00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:32.521
       SO

00:08:33.723 --> 00:08:42.763
otomey proclaimed:
It's been quite a week. In a 

00:08:42.764 --> 00:08:47.025
civil society,
artists and other creative 

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.305
producers play a
critically important role in 

00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:52.394
helping guide us
through these complex situation,

00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:59.291
 they
function as    s  

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.180
 sensors. And that's what 
tonight's

00:09:05.317 --> 00:09:07.317
conversation is about. It's part
 of our

00:09:07.353 --> 00:09:09.674
 Citizens and Borders initiative
 which is a

00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:12.555
series of discrete programs that
 are

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:18.330
organized by curators and other 
program

00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:26.614
administrators are that offer on
 displacement            

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:33.097
displacement. : It's organized 
by

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:39.934
 S Cormier and
Jean-Paul Comey it's going to be

00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:43.079
 up until
October 10th. Another addition 

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.360
to our
citizens border is an exhibition

00:09:46.507 --> 00:09:49.737
 that will be
opening on October 1st, it's 

00:09:49.738 --> 00:09:52.426
organized by Anderson in the 
department of

00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:54.873
architecture and design and will
 explore

00:09:54.874 --> 00:09:56.874
architecture in relationship to 
global

00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:01.914
refugee emergencies.
 So tonight's event is 

00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:04.700
cosponsored by the
council on foreign relations, 

00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:07.454
which is
committed to global literacy, 

00:10:07.455 --> 00:10:11.024
and together
with the CFR, we welcome and 

00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:13.721
extraordinary
group of individuals to our 

00:10:13.722 --> 00:10:20.148
stage. The great
artist Bouchra Khalili herself, 

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:22.218
philosopher
and professor of political 

00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:25.673
science and great
champion of open borders, Joe 

00:10:25.674 --> 00:10:32.384
Carens, a
specialist on Islamic law and 

00:10:32.385 --> 00:10:34.385
political
movements, and I'm afraid that I

00:10:34.524 --> 00:10:38.247
 have some
bad news, as well, which is the 

00:10:38.248 --> 00:10:42.571
extraordinary
writer and activist, Samar 

00:10:42.572 --> 00:10:44.960
Yazbek can't join
us because of visa difficulties.

00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:48.557
 She travels
on an official refugee status. 

00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:51.839
She happens a
French passport with an official

00:10:52.241 --> 00:10:54.630
 refugee
status and encountered 

00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:56.489
difficulties and we
weren't able to work through 

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.281
them in time,
but she's very eager to join us 

00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:01.217
tonight to
address this audience and we're 

00:11:01.218 --> 00:11:03.807
keen to have
her, so we'll have her for a 

00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:06.065
while. Part of
the program, via Skype, and then

00:11:06.595 --> 00:11:08.188
 we'll bring
her back to the museum in the 

00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:10.764
early fall when
we can secure her visa.

00:11:10.765 --> 00:11:13.546
 So that's a great 
disappointment, but I'm

00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:15.738
very glad she'll be able to join
 us via

00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:19.172
technology.
 And the run of the program will

00:11:19.487 --> 00:11:21.920
 be that
everyone will come to stage, 

00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:24.483
Bernard will
begin the conversation with 

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:29.978
Samar on Skype. discussion will 
be about 50 minutes, then

00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:33.982
there will be time for Q &amp; A, 
about 20

00:11:34.746 --> 00:11:37.666
minutes of Q &amp; A, you have cards
 in your

00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:39.831
program and you can write any 
questions that

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:42.192
come up during the conversation 
on your

00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:44.511
cards, and you can also send us 
questions

00:11:44.786 --> 00:11:48.273
with the hashtag citizens 
borders and you can

00:11:48.532 --> 00:11:50.805
comment on the event that way, 
as well. So

00:11:50.806 --> 00:11:53.503
thank you all for joining us, 
we're delighted

00:11:53.655 --> 00:11:55.655
to have you and I'm looking 
forward to

00:11:56.571 --> 00:11:59.223
tonight's event.
 [applause]

00:12:16.216 --> 00:12:21.834
  [applause]
   Thank you.

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:35.105
 Thank you very much for the
introduction, and for the 

00:12:35.106 --> 00:12:39.693
invitation. We have
Samar here with us. And also 

00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:41.795
being an
academic, I got the books.

00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:46.451
   [laughter]
   And Samar has two wonderful 

00:12:46.452 --> 00:12:51.156
books that we'll
be discussing today, among other

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:57.226
 issues, the
first is." A woman in the 

00:12:57.227 --> 00:12:59.879
crossfire" which is
a book about her experience at 

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.270
the beginning
of the Syrian uprising and the 

00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:08.095
second is "The
crossing" which is the journey 

00:13:08.096 --> 00:13:11.940
out of Syria
because of the war, so hello Sam

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:17.286
     Samar.
 &gt;&gt; So I will begin the question

00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:26.266
 by asking
you, the role of the artist in 

00:13:26.267 --> 00:13:31.175
talking about
these conflicts, in you know, 

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:34.501
being a witness
to these conflicts, can you tell

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:39.483
 us something
about that role and in 

00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:42.618
particular, drawing
from your own experiences?

00:14:03.153 --> 00:14:06.517
(translator
speaking.)

00:14:12.715 --> 00:14:15.927
 Translator:  I believe that art
 is against

00:14:16.368 --> 00:14:19.601
death and against war.

00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:30.083
 Regarding that tragic
situation now in Syria

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:35.119
,

00:14:38.091 --> 00:14:40.639
 it is a situation
that was very important to all 

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.207
the
identities, the different 

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:46.550
aspects of the
identity of the artist.

00:14:54.862 --> 00:14:58.202
 It could be like
different like aspects. It could

00:14:58.203 --> 00:15:00.644
 be like
political activist and it could 

00:15:00.645 --> 00:15:03.675
be like an
activist or it could be like a 

00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:06.350
witness for
the truth.

00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:25.063
(Samar speaking).
  Translator:  One of the most 

00:15:25.064 --> 00:15:27.584
important things
that came to me at the beginning

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:30.688
 of the
peaceful demonstrations in 

00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:33.872
Syria, around like
five years ago ...

00:15:41.158 --> 00:15:45.771
 (Samar speaking in Arabic)

00:15:45.772 --> 00:15:46.728
Arabic).
  Translator:  I was at the 

00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:49.150
front line at the
beginning of all of these 

00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:52.333
demonstrations and
I was really very keen to try to

00:15:52.716 --> 00:15:55.394
 convey the
really true picture right from 

00:15:55.395 --> 00:15:58.314
the beginning
to the media.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.319
(Samar speaking in Arabic).
  Translator:  Even when I moved

00:16:08.491 --> 00:16:11.658
 like -- when I
went like to Paris and then I 

00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:16.754
went back again
to the north in 2012 ...

00:16:23.053 --> 00:16:30.251
 Samar speaking             
 Prep (Samar speaking).

00:16:30.252 --> 00:16:33.192
  Translator:  As a writer, and 
as a cultured

00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:37.755
person, also, I was eager just 
to be a part

00:16:37.894 --> 00:16:40.933
of this change.

00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:52.570
 (Samar speaking).
  Translator:  And lass in that 

00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:56.271
case,                      Also 
in that case I was just

00:16:56.272 --> 00:16:58.228
trying to document everything 
that was going

00:16:58.229 --> 00:17:00.918
on in the north and also to 
establish a civil

00:17:03.252 --> 00:17:07.927
establishment.
 (Samar speaking).

00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958
 Translator:  I was there in all
 of these

00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:17.233
areas that was under like 
bombardment from

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.861
the Assad regime.

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:38.022
 And I was in the front line
in all of these battlefields 

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:42.229
where there was
also this presence of the ISIS, 

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:47.199
also, and
after that I went back to Paris.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.407
 (Samar
speaking).

00:17:56.383 --> 00:17:59.009
 Translator:  And I have like 
really horrible

00:17:59.214 --> 00:18:01.214
life stories about all of these 
people that

00:18:01.758 --> 00:18:08.639
really lost their lives.
 And they are the silent, like 

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.372
they are
silent, all of these factors, 

00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:14.111
and they have
no -- no voice for them. They 

00:18:14.112 --> 00:18:16.435
were really
silent.

00:18:16.436 --> 00:18:19.321
 Samar speaking) 

00:18:25.303 --> 00:18:29.278
.
  Translator:  And this is one 

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:34.992
of the roles of
the artist during like wars or 

00:18:34.993 --> 00:18:38.159
like dramatic
changes in history. And this is 

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.658
at least from
my perspective.

00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:48.282
 If I may, one of the issues 
that actually

00:18:48.645 --> 00:18:51.467
unites a lot of the work that's 
being

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.232
presented here is the rejection 
of the

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.516
typical or the stereotypical 
framing of the

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:02.885
conflict, whether in your case 
it's the

00:19:03.038 --> 00:19:05.731
sectarian way in which Syria is 
described as

00:19:05.965 --> 00:19:10.349
explaining all the problems, or 
in the case

00:19:11.374 --> 00:19:14.781
of Bouchra, you know, the 
stereotypical idea

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.378
that we have of the refugee is 
also

00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:23.226
interrogated in your work. And 
is put into

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.084
question. And I would like us 
perhaps to talk

00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:30.279
about how the artist actually, 
you know,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:36.221
shifts the focus on what the 
problem is as it

00:19:36.404 --> 00:19:43.897
is defined, for example, in the 
media.

00:19:49.518 --> 00:19:52.705
(Translator speaking to Samar.)

00:20:13.527 --> 00:20:17.999
 (Samar speaking)

00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:28.575
.
Translator:  After like in the 

00:20:28.576 --> 00:20:32.931
situation of
Syria, after like it was like 

00:20:32.932 --> 00:20:34.982
that way for

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.332
part of that field ...

00:20:46.418 --> 00:20:51.602
 it's very important
for the artist himself to be 

00:20:51.603 --> 00:20:55.539
part, one of the
tools of the change.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:00.500
 Samar speaking.

00:21:13.816 --> 00:21:16.523
 Translator:  But in my 
situation, of course,

00:21:16.702 --> 00:21:20.276
the arts, like all of the arts 
was really

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.130
retreating in my situation 
whatever was going

00:21:24.203 --> 00:21:27.960
on in Syria was a little bit 
retreating.

00:21:29.005 --> 00:21:31.326
 (Samar speaking).

00:21:35.537 --> 00:21:38.183
  Translator:  This relies on --
 I think it is

00:21:38.376 --> 00:21:41.023
for each artist and what is the 
relation

00:21:41.165 --> 00:21:48.797
between him and the society.
 (Samar speaking)

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.703
.
Translator:  It was like really 

00:21:56.704 --> 00:22:02.522
we should not
fight for this, the fear, like, 

00:22:02.523 --> 00:22:07.294
the fear case
of the Syrian people.

00:22:07.295 --> 00:22:10.162
 (Samar speaking).

00:22:17.077 --> 00:22:19.517
 Translator:  We, as artists, we
 were part of

00:22:20.232 --> 00:22:23.868
this, like the demand for 
democracy, and the

00:22:24.782 --> 00:22:26.782
demanding for peace and we just 
were part of

00:22:26.857 --> 00:22:35.267
it as an artist.
 (Samar speaking

00:22:37.275 --> 00:22:39.275
)

00:22:43.499 --> 00:22:45.748
.
Translator:  As I said, like 

00:22:45.749 --> 00:22:48.856
also as a
writer, also with so many 

00:22:48.857 --> 00:22:52.514
identities, I
should be also like, I should 

00:22:52.515 --> 00:22:53.905
have a part of
the change that's going to 

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:58.396
happen in Syria,
about the change in Syria.

00:22:58.397 --> 00:23:01.668
 (Samar speaking)

00:23:08.211 --> 00:23:09.275
.
Translator:  That will we should

00:23:09.276 --> 00:23:12.200
 not really
limit the function of the art, 

00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:14.775
because this
is not like really -- limiting 

00:23:14.776 --> 00:23:17.482
is no good,
like, we should not really limit

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.397
 the role of
the art.

00:23:21.592 --> 00:23:24.768
 (Samar speaking)

00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:34.790
.
Translator:  One of the most 

00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:37.262
important
things, really, is to try and 

00:23:37.263 --> 00:23:40.362
convey the
truth and to be the voice of all

00:23:40.663 --> 00:23:43.953
 of the
victims.

00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:47.408
 (Samar speaking).

00:23:56.993 --> 00:23:59.918
  Translator:  Because I am 
believing of course

00:24:00.082 --> 00:24:03.916
about the word of media and also
 the Syrian

00:24:04.477 --> 00:24:07.299
regime of course conveyed the 
wrong image of

00:24:07.438 --> 00:24:12.402
what's going on in Syria.
 Samar speaking

00:24:23.132 --> 00:24:24.735
.
Translator:  I was just to be 

00:24:24.736 --> 00:24:28.964
part of that,
just to be bring justice to all 

00:24:28.965 --> 00:24:30.593
of the
victims.

00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.952
   &gt;&gt; Should you see your role 
in similar

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.007
terms, that you're a witness to 
events that

00:24:35.008 --> 00:24:37.424
you're trying to reframe how the
 media talks

00:24:37.607 --> 00:24:40.409
about refugees, for example? How
 do you see

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:45.130
what you're doing?

00:24:45.131 --> 00:24:48.982
   &gt;&gt; I mean I absolutely agree 
with what Samar

00:24:49.158 --> 00:24:51.806
just said, and at the same time,
 I stick with

00:24:52.207 --> 00:24:54.093
my own position that is quite 
different,

00:24:54.094 --> 00:24:56.566
because I work within a 
different context,

00:24:56.964 --> 00:24:59.157
I'm not Syrian, and my 
experience is

00:24:59.359 --> 00:25:02.035
completely different, and an 
artist also

00:25:02.326 --> 00:25:08.839
works with one's own life and 
own experience.

00:25:09.028 --> 00:25:12.324
So I won't define my work or 
myself as an

00:25:12.672 --> 00:25:15.008
artist as a witness, but rather 
as someone

00:25:15.251 --> 00:25:18.214
who tries to ask a question, to 
give the form

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:21.193
to that question, and rather 
than speaking

00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:25.837
for the others, giving that 
opportunity to

00:25:26.136 --> 00:25:27.764
individuals who are often 
silenced to speak

00:25:27.765 --> 00:25:30.552
for themselves, and with their 
own words. But

00:25:30.768 --> 00:25:33.298
at the same time, it's also what
 Samar was

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.525
saying about providing with 
different images,

00:25:36.727 --> 00:25:38.878
and you started your question 
with the

00:25:39.318 --> 00:25:44.117
comparison, with the media. The 
media often

00:25:44.118 --> 00:25:48.844
produce images to illustrate the
 discourse.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.424
My position is somehow the 
complete opposite

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:54.627
of that. It's whether -- how one
 can ask a

00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:58.145
question, rather than 
illustrating a

00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:03.091
solution, or a predefined or a 
preconceived

00:26:03.092 --> 00:26:07.414
discourse.
 So I don't see myself as 

00:26:07.415 --> 00:26:11.415
someone proposing
something that is complete, but 

00:26:11.416 --> 00:26:15.229
rather asking
the question through an 

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.291
audience, and
inviting the audience to reflect

00:26:17.502 --> 00:26:21.761
 on the
pictures that are shown and the 

00:26:21.762 --> 00:26:24.545
words that
are said and not giving one 

00:26:24.546 --> 00:26:28.397
solution, but
rather encouraging a dialogue 

00:26:28.398 --> 00:26:30.417
and a debate in
a public space, because a museum

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.812
 is also a
public space, it's a space for 

00:26:32.813 --> 00:26:36.395
the public and
consequently it can be a civic 

00:26:36.396 --> 00:26:40.142
space, as
well. So that's also the reason 

00:26:40.143 --> 00:26:44.537
why I do not
define myself as an activist but

00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:48.300
 rather as a
citizen. Which is a different 

00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:51.282
position, but
try to look at images as 

00:26:51.283 --> 00:26:56.405
something that can
create a debate, a dialogue, in 

00:26:56.406 --> 00:27:00.558
other ways of
saying, and suggest other 

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:03.301
perspectives, but
at the same time, not imposing 

00:27:03.302 --> 00:27:05.905
them, but
rather, suggesting them to the 

00:27:05.906 --> 00:27:09.032
public and
inviting the public to exercise 

00:27:09.033 --> 00:27:12.483
its freedom
of reacting to an artwork and 

00:27:12.484 --> 00:27:14.255
reflecting for
themselves through that artwork 

00:27:14.256 --> 00:27:16.674
and
eventually speaking of it with 

00:27:16.675 --> 00:27:21.139
others. So the
impact on reality is not direct,

00:27:22.167 --> 00:27:24.167
 but

00:27:26.923 --> 00:27:33.053
 it par
dissipates in the public debate.

00:27:33.315 --> 00:27:36.830
 But I also
work with very specific 

00:27:36.831 --> 00:27:41.750
questions with a very
singular trajectory that cannot 

00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:43.316
become
examples to the media, often 

00:27:43.317 --> 00:27:45.589
when they give
one minute or two minutes to 

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.003
someone to
express himself or herself, that

00:27:48.182 --> 00:27:50.985
 person is
supposed to illustrate one 

00:27:50.986 --> 00:27:56.795
specific case. But
I don't believe that there are 

00:27:56.796 --> 00:28:00.929
examples, that
individuals trajectories are 

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.405
examples. They
are what they are, they speak 

00:28:02.406 --> 00:28:06.967
for themselves,
and at the same time they are 

00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:09.309
universal.
 &gt;&gt; There is definitely a 

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.610
universality and I
know, Joe, you got to see the 

00:28:12.611 --> 00:28:14.742
installation
earlier. And the story that 

00:28:14.743 --> 00:28:19.093
seems to be
universal are people from so 

00:28:19.094 --> 00:28:21.925
many different
countries all trying to 

00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:24.961
delineating their own
itinerary ies on this map and 

00:28:24.962 --> 00:28:28.514
all the ethical
issues that arise. I mean some 

00:28:28.515 --> 00:28:32.725
of them end up
almost enslaved in country, in 

00:28:32.726 --> 00:28:34.406
several
different countries and what 

00:28:34.407 --> 00:28:37.527
would he would
normally think as a journey that

00:28:37.689 --> 00:28:39.821
 would take
10 hours and a flight takes 

00:28:39.822 --> 00:28:41.791
three years, four
years, sometimes, to complete.

00:28:41.792 --> 00:28:44.530
 &gt;&gt; Yeah.
 &gt;&gt; I wonder what your sort of 

00:28:44.531 --> 00:28:47.637
response,
given the work you've done on 

00:28:47.638 --> 00:28:50.274
refugees, on
citizenship, on borders, how 

00:28:50.275 --> 00:28:52.201
that -- how that
installation spoke to you.

00:28:52.202 --> 00:28:56.658
 &gt;&gt; Well, I found it very 
powerful. And for

00:28:57.275 --> 00:29:00.770
precisely the reasons that 
Bouchra just said,

00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:03.509
the kind of specificity, the 
tracking of the

00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:07.498
individuals, so it's a -- doing 
the sort of

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.156
work that Bouchra does as an 
artist is

00:29:11.288 --> 00:29:13.288
different from the sort of work 
that I do as

00:29:13.374 --> 00:29:15.863
a philosopher. We paint pictures
 with words

00:29:16.312 --> 00:29:18.447
and not like novelists, but 
there is a way in

00:29:18.803 --> 00:29:21.191
what you do as a philosopher is 
try to

00:29:21.683 --> 00:29:23.763
construct a vision of the world 
and say isn't

00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:26.819
it like this? So it's an appeal 
to a debate

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.772
but it's an attempt to use 
reason and

00:29:28.773 --> 00:29:31.840
argument, so in that sense it's 
a -- I think

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.392
there's less -- I do try to tell
 some stories

00:29:36.547 --> 00:29:38.657
and I actually think of them as 
examples, so

00:29:38.658 --> 00:29:40.658
there are some tensions here, 
because I'm

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.850
trying to seek generalization, 
so in a way,

00:29:42.901 --> 00:29:45.305
what I'm doing is quite 
different from

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.837
Bouchra, because I do want to 
generalize. If

00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:52.475
one engages in a debate, then 
one wants to

00:29:52.476 --> 00:29:55.126
have an answer. So a question 
has to be posed

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.715
and I think she's quite good at 
challenging

00:29:57.894 --> 00:30:02.975
the questions. But then a new 
must be

00:30:03.123 --> 00:30:06.868
question must be posed and I'm 
good at also

00:30:07.434 --> 00:30:09.980
subverting the questions and I 
think

00:30:10.126 --> 00:30:13.463
Bouchra's work does a good job 
at that.

00:30:13.464 --> 00:30:15.464
 &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And I know that 
the medium

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:19.447
that you chose --          chose
 --

00:30:19.448 --> 00:30:23.237
 [mumbling]
 The medium that you chose is 

00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:27.038
the map and you
don't see.

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:29.039
 &gt;&gt; 

00:30:35.352 --> 00:30:39.864
     so I was wondering about 
the, you

00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:44.772
know, the choices that you made,
 where, for

00:30:44.773 --> 00:30:48.205
instance, you choose not to show
 their faces,

00:30:48.411 --> 00:30:51.354
and you chose the map. And I 
know from an

00:30:51.498 --> 00:30:53.115
article that was written about 
your work

00:30:53.116 --> 00:30:56.085
where you had shown or you had 
discussed this

00:30:56.356 --> 00:31:02.489
wonderful map, Medieval Islamic 
map which

00:31:02.636 --> 00:31:05.175
shows Europe in the south and 
Africa in the

00:31:05.536 --> 00:31:09.941
north, so a total inversion. Why
 the map? Why

00:31:10.088 --> 00:31:15.260
did you choose the map as this, 
or

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.210
cartography as a way of talking 
and

00:31:18.211 --> 00:31:23.808
describing the questions and the
 eye continue              

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:26.043
itinerary.
 &gt;&gt; I think my answer will be 

00:31:26.044 --> 00:31:28.482
quite long.
   [laughter]

00:31:28.483 --> 00:31:32.638
   &gt;&gt; There are basically -- I 
would say three

00:31:33.075 --> 00:31:35.075
reasons. The first one is what I
 have

00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:40.228
witnessed myself when I was a 
teenager in

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.326
Morocco. It's quite ironic to 
think of it

00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:50.712
today on the Brexit day, but I 
was in Morocco

00:31:50.713 --> 00:31:55.284
when the agreement was signed 
and this had

00:31:55.664 --> 00:31:59.310
immediate consequence on most 
Africans,

00:31:59.458 --> 00:32:01.458
because before then, it was easy
 to go to

00:32:01.951 --> 00:32:04.539
Europe. There was no need for a 
visa. And

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.574
this completely changed at the 
moment when

00:32:06.575 --> 00:32:10.221
Europe was discussing the no 
border for

00:32:10.777 --> 00:32:13.893
Europe. It's not for the others.
 So suddenly

00:32:14.115 --> 00:32:16.863
we became excluded from that 
area, from a

00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:22.751
precise geographical area. For 
us in 1991 the

00:32:22.879 --> 00:32:25.988
problem was not in getting a 
visa, it was not

00:32:26.213 --> 00:32:28.773
having a passport. Because 
having a passport

00:32:28.911 --> 00:32:32.007
was a privilege. It was at the 
discretion of

00:32:32.152 --> 00:32:35.806
the state, who could decide who 
could have a

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:40.588
passport and who could not. From
 '91 it

00:32:40.589 --> 00:32:42.645
became the opposite. It was 
extremely easy to

00:32:43.139 --> 00:32:46.349
have a passport and extremely 
difficult to

00:32:46.608 --> 00:32:48.783
have a visa. So I guess my 
interest in

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:51.723
geography started also with 
this. With the

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.881
contemplation of ancient Islamic
 tradition of

00:32:57.603 --> 00:32:59.603
map-making because that was also
 what I was

00:32:59.671 --> 00:33:02.595
in contact with, but also with 
my own

00:33:02.776 --> 00:33:04.776
experience of living in a 
country where

00:33:04.901 --> 00:33:07.014
suddenly we were banned to cross
 borders. Why

00:33:07.917 --> 00:33:11.576
the distance between Morocco and
 Spain is 14

00:33:12.539 --> 00:33:20.222
kilometers, and not to mention 
the history of   

00:33:20.383 --> 00:33:23.012
with Spain, if we were to go 
back in history.

00:33:23.203 --> 00:33:25.203
So I guess the interest started 
with this.

00:33:25.252 --> 00:33:29.305
With the question of perception,
 and the set

00:33:29.306 --> 00:33:31.990
of complications to the 
perception when I

00:33:31.991 --> 00:33:33.991
started to live myself as an 
immigrant in

00:33:34.524 --> 00:33:39.625
France. So I had somehow the 
contra view or

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.372
of being in that place that was 
refused to us

00:33:43.795 --> 00:33:45.927
before, and living there as 
someone who was

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.957
not a citizen still. Even though
 I could

00:33:49.524 --> 00:33:53.525
speak French fluently, because 
of course the

00:33:54.522 --> 00:33:57.409
colonial history had an impact 
on the

00:33:58.396 --> 00:34:01.379
independence until today. French
 is still a

00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:05.519
prominent language in Morocco. 
So it was as

00:34:06.541 --> 00:34:10.681
if I was not living in a 
completely unknown

00:34:11.647 --> 00:34:13.647
country. There was a connection 
between those

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.760
places, but still I was not a 
citizen. I was

00:34:15.902 --> 00:34:21.631
a foreigner. And I --      I -- 
when I became an artist

00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:25.138
of course I also started to work
 with this,

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:27.490
with my own experience, my own 
perception of

00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:30.204
the question. And being an 
artist when I

00:34:30.348 --> 00:34:33.643
start working on a project, I 
also start

00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:35.787
somehow formulating a question 
and how to

00:34:35.788 --> 00:34:39.589
give a visual shape to the 
question. And that

00:34:39.783 --> 00:34:43.539
is an image. It's a convention. 
It's an

00:34:43.795 --> 00:34:49.413
image. We all know map from our 
books, etc.,

00:34:49.958 --> 00:34:52.794
it's a familiar picture. But 
what about that

00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:57.193
picture        
pick if that picture is 

00:34:57.194 --> 00:34:59.827
challenged by real
experiences? What about if that 

00:34:59.828 --> 00:35:02.114
picture
becomes a sort of surface on 

00:35:02.115 --> 00:35:09.543
which a sort of
contra map can be drawn? So for 

00:35:09.544 --> 00:35:13.262
me it was an
idea was very simple. I want to 

00:35:13.263 --> 00:35:15.541
show
something to someone. How can I 

00:35:15.542 --> 00:35:17.776
show it?
Because eventually when one 

00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:20.199
works with video
or film it's always about 

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.123
showing something
to someone. It doesn't mean that

00:35:22.124 --> 00:35:25.003
 showing that
thing, you will say it means 

00:35:25.004 --> 00:35:28.667
this, or this is
what the picture is about. But 

00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:31.312
you show
something and you expect an 

00:35:31.313 --> 00:35:34.229
answer. And
that's also why I chose a map, 

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:40.462
because the
map is also in a sense datic, 

00:35:40.463 --> 00:35:42.517
because it
shows something and when you 

00:35:42.518 --> 00:35:47.550
show a hand
drawing on a map it's also a 

00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:49.686
performative
gesture. You're showing 

00:35:49.687 --> 00:35:52.862
something. So the
idea of working with the map was

00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:55.621
 somehow
natural, because of my own 

00:35:55.622 --> 00:36:01.692
commitment with
geography, conception, but also 

00:36:01.693 --> 00:36:04.222
cinematic in
a sense that in one long shot I 

00:36:04.223 --> 00:36:06.740
had the shot
and the contra shot. There was 

00:36:06.741 --> 00:36:11.068
no need for
technical editing. The editing 

00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:14.310
was already
there because of the different 

00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:20.438
layers that
are combined. That's a, yeah, 

00:36:20.439 --> 00:36:22.904
visual shape.
And of course the voice plays 

00:36:22.905 --> 00:36:26.420
also a
prominent aspect, because it's 

00:36:26.421 --> 00:36:34.405
not -- I mean
it cannot be defined as: Because

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.496
 it's
completely synchronized, but 

00:36:37.497 --> 00:36:39.837
that sound is
also an image, and that's how 

00:36:39.838 --> 00:36:43.055
the position of
the viewer becomes extremely 

00:36:43.056 --> 00:36:44.084
important,
because there is something that 

00:36:44.085 --> 00:36:45.863
is being
shown, and there is something 

00:36:45.864 --> 00:36:52.930
that is being
narrated, and they are all the 

00:36:52.931 --> 00:36:56.437
peculiarities               
peculiaruleis

00:36:56.585 --> 00:36:59.679
of one voice. Because every 
specific voice

00:37:00.419 --> 00:37:04.221
has a different brain, there are
 accents.

00:37:04.487 --> 00:37:07.308
Three of the videos are Arabic 
and there are

00:37:07.488 --> 00:37:11.608
different Arabic, so for an 
Arabic speaker

00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:14.130
it's also challenging to realize
 how diverse

00:37:14.512 --> 00:37:19.196
the Arabic is in a region that 
is depicted as

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.489
completely homogeneous, which is
 not true.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.072
And I can give more and more 
details on why

00:37:25.448 --> 00:37:27.958
every single thing is extremely 
specific, but

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:30.119
at the same time, very

00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:35.908
 simple.
 &gt;&gt; The story of the * you know,

00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:39.101
 of the
intimate stranger, you know, in 

00:37:39.102 --> 00:37:42.918
the case of
the Moroccan or the north 

00:37:42.919 --> 00:37:45.954
African who comes
to Europe and speaks French but 

00:37:45.955 --> 00:37:49.018
is still
having to be made into someone, 

00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:52.045
an othering,
this is a story that also comes 

00:37:52.046 --> 00:37:54.264
out in your
work that you see these norms 

00:37:54.265 --> 00:37:56.794
when they're
constructed, often there's 

00:37:56.795 --> 00:37:59.895
something very
contrived and arbitrary about 

00:37:59.896 --> 00:38:02.012
them and you
have this wonderful story, I 

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.145
mean tragic
story, actually, in the chapter 

00:38:04.146 --> 00:38:07.652
on refugees,
where it's a story of Jewish 

00:38:07.653 --> 00:38:10.740
refugees from
the Holocaust who are not 

00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:13.226
allowed into the
United States, and then the ship

00:38:14.162 --> 00:38:17.324
 is sent back
and presumably most of them 

00:38:17.325 --> 00:38:20.455
perish in Europe.
And the arguments that were 

00:38:20.456 --> 00:38:24.707
being made at the
time about these people, which I

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.297
 mean there's
almost an immediate and direct 

00:38:27.298 --> 00:38:31.590
echo to how
we, you know, listen to people 

00:38:31.591 --> 00:38:35.381
who are
talking about Muslims or talking

00:38:35.607 --> 00:38:40.881
 about people
from the global south. There's 

00:38:40.882 --> 00:38:45.747
something so
familiar about that voice from 

00:38:45.748 --> 00:38:48.757
the '30s and
now again today, and I know that

00:38:48.758 --> 00:38:50.705
 you were
telling me earlier in your work,

00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:52.706
 that it
seems that the situation is only

00:38:52.778 --> 00:38:55.542
 getting
worse as you've been studying 

00:38:55.543 --> 00:38:59.471
these issues
over the last several decades. 

00:38:59.472 --> 00:39:02.203
Why do you
think that is? I mean not just 

00:39:02.204 --> 00:39:06.401
why is it
getting worse but why are these 

00:39:06.402 --> 00:39:09.589
echoes, these
trajectories so similar? Why is 

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.961
it that we
never seem to learn to change 

00:39:11.962 --> 00:39:18.010
how we talk
about these others?

00:39:18.011 --> 00:39:24.009
 &gt;&gt; I wish I had an answer to 
that. I do

00:39:24.764 --> 00:39:27.462
think it is -- so first of all 
I'm not a

00:39:28.178 --> 00:39:29.684
complete pessimist. I think 
these things

00:39:29.685 --> 00:39:33.746
shift and you do sometimes find 
an opening,

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.050
and a willingness to understand.
 And I

00:39:36.325 --> 00:39:38.325
actually think a lot of these 
things are

00:39:38.769 --> 00:39:41.319
contagious, that it just depends
 on a set of

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.962
circumstances and who makes the 
argument. I

00:39:43.963 --> 00:39:45.963
mean we just went through an 
election in

00:39:46.225 --> 00:39:48.550
Canada in which there was a 
right-wing party

00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:51.799
that was taking the kind of 
conventional,

00:39:52.826 --> 00:39:55.474
anti-refugee and a kind of 
mainstream but

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.486
liberal party and said we should
 take in more

00:39:59.487 --> 00:40:01.487
refugees and they loved it. So 
it's an appeal

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.520
to a certain kind of identity 
and that's what

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.565
I thought in the book in the 
section on

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:08.770
refugees, so if you ask people 
in North

00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:11.154
America, Canada, the United 
States about the

00:40:12.081 --> 00:40:14.081
history of the Holocaust, 
everyone would say

00:40:14.139 --> 00:40:16.771
that was terrible, we failed, 
this was a

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.896
terrible moral failure and exact
ly right, the

00:40:20.897 --> 00:40:21.909
language when you looked at how 
people

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:23.388
justified that at the time, how 
is it that

00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:26.147
they explained to themselves, it
 was already

00:40:26.548 --> 00:40:29.355
to exclude Jewish refugees, why 
to deny them

00:40:29.976 --> 00:40:33.317
visas, why to accuse them of 
being smugglers,

00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:35.935
if they have this much money, 
they can't

00:40:35.936 --> 00:40:37.972
really be in need. And all of 
the same

00:40:38.974 --> 00:40:40.974
arguments, they're dangerous, 
some of them

00:40:41.849 --> 00:40:43.849
may be communists. Some of them 
are actually

00:40:44.363 --> 00:40:46.446
Nazis, but they're pretending to
 be Jewish.

00:40:46.603 --> 00:40:50.003
All of the same arguments that 
you hear today

00:40:50.004 --> 00:40:52.398
were the arguments that were 
made at that

00:40:52.399 --> 00:40:54.560
time and my hope is that by 
drawing attention

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:57.231
to that, people will come to see
 that there's

00:40:57.583 --> 00:40:59.298
something problematic about the 
discourse

00:40:59.299 --> 00:41:01.381
that is dominating the 
discussion of refugees

00:41:01.689 --> 00:41:05.843
today, and I do think it's 
contingent, that

00:41:05.844 --> 00:41:08.017
if enough people see it and hear
 it, we have

00:41:08.224 --> 00:41:10.256
both of these forces out there. 
You saw that

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:12.601
in Germany, right? There was a 
very positive

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.526
response to the refugees, and 
then some

00:41:15.527 --> 00:41:17.658
negative things and it's not 
predetermined.

00:41:17.815 --> 00:41:20.240
It's not fixed. And it matters 
what people

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:22.715
say.
 &gt;&gt; Although the legal 

00:41:22.716 --> 00:41:25.344
structures and the
legal norms seem not to have 

00:41:25.345 --> 00:41:28.591
been updated to
deal with this reality, or at 

00:41:28.592 --> 00:41:33.769
least the
 intensity of the refugee crisis

00:41:33.956 --> 00:41:34.927
 that we're
seeing today.

00:41:34.928 --> 00:41:37.011
 &gt;&gt; Right.
 &gt;&gt; And one of your pleas in the

00:41:37.587 --> 00:41:39.913
 book is to
actually lessen that.

00:41:40.357 --> 00:41:42.644
 &gt;&gt; Yes and no. I think if you 
had said what

00:41:43.121 --> 00:41:45.121
would be

00:41:46.708 --> 00:41:49.041
 the right frame to admit 
refugees,

00:41:46.708 --> 00:41:48.375
you would have a much more 
expansive

00:41:48.376 --> 00:41:53.795
definition. And I deed you
            indeed you see some 

00:41:53.796 --> 00:41:56.354
progress.
It has been expanded to exclude 

00:41:56.355 --> 00:41:59.513
persecution
on the basis of gender, 

00:41:59.514 --> 00:42:03.864
sexuality. Those were
not envisaged when they wrote 

00:42:03.865 --> 00:42:06.387
the rules. But
in other ways it's been narrowed

00:42:06.865 --> 00:42:08.378
 and
constrained. And I do have to 

00:42:08.379 --> 00:42:11.431
say that I
would not, as a -- if I were 

00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:13.649
recommended to
policymakers, I wouldn't 

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.726
recommend opening up
the definition now, because in 

00:42:16.727 --> 00:42:18.727
this climate
what would happen is it would be

00:42:19.219 --> 00:42:23.262
 narrowed
further still, so ... although 

00:42:23.263 --> 00:42:26.317
the definition
as it currently is imperfect, if

00:42:26.503 --> 00:42:28.275
 you tried to
make it better, it would 

00:42:28.276 --> 00:42:29.903
probably make it
worse. So there's a difference 

00:42:29.904 --> 00:42:31.520
what you think
in principle and what actions 

00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:33.358
you take in the
world. You have to think about 

00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:35.359
the
consequences of the actions.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.427
 &gt;&gt; And are you still engaged in
 some of

00:42:38.873 --> 00:42:41.396
these issues around -- I know 
that you know,

00:42:41.664 --> 00:42:43.664
you don't really like to talk 
about the work

00:42:43.746 --> 00:42:45.773
you're doing, but are you still 
engaged in

00:42:46.806 --> 00:42:51.089
some of these questions, big 
questions about

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.184
identity, borders, citizenship, 
belonging?

00:42:54.185 --> 00:42:58.337
 &gt;&gt; Somehow I always considered 
that my work

00:42:58.585 --> 00:43:01.128
was not necessarily about 
refugees or

00:43:03.299 --> 00:43:06.839
migrations, it was whether sort 
of

00:43:07.192 --> 00:43:09.339
integration and what this means 
to be a

00:43:10.166 --> 00:43:11.751
citizen. Including when the law 
doesn't give

00:43:11.752 --> 00:43:14.842
you the right to be a citizen. 
Is it still

00:43:15.222 --> 00:43:19.518
possible to consider society 
where anyone can

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.957
be a citizen or in more simple 
words, can we

00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:26.554
consider citizenship not as an 
exclusive

00:43:26.892 --> 00:43:29.328
club, which membership is your 
ID card, but

00:43:29.656 --> 00:43:30.953
something completely different 
that would be

00:43:30.954 --> 00:43:35.354
a commitment to society. And 
that would be

00:43:35.867 --> 00:43:41.862
the only condition that would be
 demanded by

00:43:41.863 --> 00:43:46.897
a state that recognized someone 
as a citizen.

00:43:47.085 --> 00:43:50.178
But to go back to your previous 
questions, if

00:43:50.387 --> 00:43:55.511
you ask a question of 
alternative forms of

00:43:55.512 --> 00:43:59.409
citizenship, you also integrate 
to society

00:43:59.677 --> 00:44:02.516
the state, and what it means 
today, and I

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.234
guess the process is also 
integrate the

00:44:06.235 --> 00:44:10.901
nation state and what it means, 
and the

00:44:10.902 --> 00:44:15.452
Brexit somehow is a sort of 
victory of the

00:44:15.808 --> 00:44:18.754
most conservative conception of 
what is a

00:44:18.961 --> 00:44:22.632
nation state, as opposed to the 
Europe union

00:44:22.633 --> 00:44:24.981
that was supposed to be not an 
addition, but

00:44:25.986 --> 00:44:31.445
a sort of combination of nation 
states that

00:44:31.446 --> 00:44:33.446
somehow go over various 
conceptions of

00:44:33.635 --> 00:44:37.872
belonging to the point of 
bringing the

00:44:37.873 --> 00:44:40.901
opposite of Europe citizenship, 
but that

00:44:41.726 --> 00:44:43.726
depends on everything that could
 be more

00:44:43.911 --> 00:44:46.153
inclusive somehow and what we 
are seeing

00:44:46.154 --> 00:44:48.154
today is also the failure of 
that. The

00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:52.726
failure of that utopia, so maybe
 my work is

00:44:53.765 --> 00:44:59.276
eventually about dysutopia or 
citizenship not

00:45:00.026 --> 00:45:02.141
being to nation states, but to 
other forms of

00:45:03.568 --> 00:45:05.593
belonging, and I guess that's 
the reason why

00:45:05.785 --> 00:45:08.449
these last few years, I went 
back to the

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.463
history of

00:45:14.848 --> 00:45:19.503
 -- ... because there was a time
when the nation state was not 

00:45:19.504 --> 00:45:21.977
defined as a
horizon of independence, but 

00:45:21.978 --> 00:45:31.945
more a set of
perception of the world as a 

00:45:31.946 --> 00:45:35.939
coalition of a
political utopia, and that was 

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:41.565
enough to
consider that I can support a 

00:45:41.566 --> 00:45:44.527
Vietnamese in
his independence or somebody 

00:45:44.528 --> 00:45:51.325
from South
Africa, etc., etc., and of 

00:45:51.326 --> 00:45:53.465
course I
understood that I had an impact 

00:45:53.466 --> 00:45:55.793
on that,
because I understood that I was 

00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:58.945
confused by
the way it was pictured in the 

00:45:58.946 --> 00:46:03.446
media as the
face of revolution. As the 

00:46:03.447 --> 00:46:09.322
history of
revolution, needed modern and 

00:46:09.323 --> 00:46:10.871
western
technology to become possible. 

00:46:10.872 --> 00:46:14.883
But there's a
very long history of 

00:46:14.884 --> 00:46:17.620
revolutionary thinking
and progressive thinking in the 

00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:20.932
area, so I
have dedicated the last few 

00:46:20.933 --> 00:46:25.739
years in somehow
investigating that history, and 

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.785
articulate ing
different moments in the history

00:46:30.141 --> 00:46:33.992
 of the
region when that utopia was 

00:46:33.993 --> 00:46:36.131
somehow
implemented or discussed. At 

00:46:36.132 --> 00:46:40.722
least discussed
in a very concrete way. And to 

00:46:40.723 --> 00:46:43.433
answer your
question, I'm currently working 

00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:47.924
actually on
two projects, one that will be 

00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:50.655
the closing
shop somehow and the investigate

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.860
 and the
history of utopia

00:46:55.839 --> 00:47:01.357
 but more -- it actually
starts with a French writer and 

00:47:01.358 --> 00:47:03.358
the

00:47:06.522 --> 00:47:13.128
 ... And
another project about theater 

00:47:13.129 --> 00:47:16.320
and community,
and again, what would be at 

00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:20.571
stake is the
question of belonging. And a 

00:47:20.572 --> 00:47:23.916
community. What
is a community. And what is a 

00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:29.248
community that
aims to achieve equality? And of

00:47:29.399 --> 00:47:32.984
 course this
results in many problems, 

00:47:32.985 --> 00:47:35.627
including
decisionmaking and etc. when 

00:47:35.628 --> 00:47:39.123
you're in a
group, if you want to be an 

00:47:39.124 --> 00:47:41.240
equal in the way
you function, you have to invent

00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:45.423
 ways of
making decisions so I'm giving 

00:47:45.424 --> 00:47:46.623
here specific
examples of this to give you an 

00:47:46.624 --> 00:47:50.771
idea of why
it is together. And it will be a

00:47:50.985 --> 00:47:53.783
 film that
will be produced in a theater 

00:47:53.784 --> 00:47:55.784
with nonact

00:47:58.048 --> 00:48:00.505
ors.
And involving different people 

00:48:00.506 --> 00:48:05.119
from different
backgrounds. But it also 

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.576
originates in a real
story.

00:48:07.577 --> 00:48:11.126
 &gt;&gt; In a real story?
 &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I cannot say more 

00:48:11.127 --> 00:48:12.049
than that.
   [laughter]

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:15.286
   &gt;&gt; Can I say something more 
about Bouchra's

00:48:15.485 --> 00:48:17.485
projects that I found really 
moving and

00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:22.329
effective? So in my book I say 
that the

00:48:23.028 --> 00:48:25.028
modern nation state, the rich 
western modern

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:29.885
states, are like -- it's a form 
of feudalism,

00:48:30.638 --> 00:48:34.246
really, to be born in a rich 
western modern

00:48:34.402 --> 00:48:36.409
state is to be born in know 
built in the

00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:41.384
middle ages and to be born 
anywhere else

00:48:41.621 --> 00:48:44.117
world -- even though lots of us 
are not

00:48:44.118 --> 00:48:46.118
mobility. And to be born into 
the poor states

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:49.939
is like to be born into the 
peasant states.

00:48:50.256 --> 00:48:52.322
And it's that way because then 
your life

00:48:53.336 --> 00:48:55.467
chances are so dependent on 
where you're

00:48:55.668 --> 00:48:58.097
born, and one of the things that
 comes out in

00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:01.852
the mapping project is you can 
see these are

00:49:01.977 --> 00:49:04.230
just ordinary people, you know 
that the

00:49:04.736 --> 00:49:06.563
immigrants get constructed as 
threats and

00:49:06.564 --> 00:49:09.450
dangerous and trying to take 
stuff from us,

00:49:09.451 --> 00:49:12.596
and you can see -- and it's -- 
the simplicity

00:49:12.772 --> 00:49:14.772
of it because you don't know a 
lot about the

00:49:14.816 --> 00:49:17.095
story, you just have a map 
tracing, but this

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.515
voice saying, well I went from 
here, and I

00:49:19.516 --> 00:49:22.116
was looking for work and so I 
went there, so

00:49:22.406 --> 00:49:24.141
these are just ordinary people, 
trying to

00:49:24.142 --> 00:49:26.142
find jobs, trying to make a life
 for

00:49:26.737 --> 00:49:28.866
themselves and that comes out I 
think very

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.254
vividly in the way in which all 
these

00:49:31.255 --> 00:49:34.237
different stories reflect that 
and they then

00:49:34.406 --> 00:49:37.533
call into question the 
legitimacy of

00:49:37.534 --> 00:49:40.693
exclusion. So why do we get to 
say no to

00:49:40.694 --> 00:49:42.541
these people? Why are we 
entitled to what we

00:49:42.542 --> 00:49:45.044
have in the United States and 
Canada and in

00:49:45.275 --> 00:49:47.770
these European states? Why do we
 get to keep

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.089
them out? What is the foundation
 for that and

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.090
that's what I think kind of 
comes out in your

00:49:52.221 --> 00:49:54.221
project.
 &gt;&gt; I absolutely agree with your

00:49:54.554 --> 00:50:00.238
 comment and
I hoped that this would be 

00:50:00.239 --> 00:50:03.959
understood when
explaining the work, because 

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.127
again what I
tried to reflect on this 

00:50:08.128 --> 00:50:11.669
conception of
citizenship that originates in 

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.983
the conception
of nation state, meaning again 

00:50:16.984 --> 00:50:20.793
the
citizenship as a sort of VIP 

00:50:20.794 --> 00:50:24.587
area in a big
club, that the club is the world

00:50:24.742 --> 00:50:27.735
 and there's
the VIP area, and that's the 

00:50:27.736 --> 00:50:34.250
area where you
have the open part and the 

00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:36.938
others are at the
door and they cannot get in. And

00:50:37.353 --> 00:50:41.752
 to continue
your own idea with peasantry.

00:50:41.753 --> 00:50:44.896
 &gt;&gt; No, no, right.
 &gt;&gt; And I became more and more 

00:50:44.897 --> 00:50:46.925
sensitive to
this, of course as someone who 

00:50:46.926 --> 00:50:49.612
was born as a
subject of the king and not as a

00:50:50.273 --> 00:50:53.528
 citizen,
because that's technically what 

00:50:53.529 --> 00:50:57.985
we were in
the early 2000s, and when I 

00:50:57.986 --> 00:51:02.723
lived in France
with a residency permit, I was 

00:51:02.724 --> 00:51:04.724
excluded from
the club in many, many different

00:51:04.896 --> 00:51:06.191
 aspects,
even though I was going to the 

00:51:06.192 --> 00:51:08.517
same schools
as the others. I was given the 

00:51:08.518 --> 00:51:11.863
same
education, I was speaking the 

00:51:11.864 --> 00:51:14.191
same language,
sharing the same culture, etc. 

00:51:14.192 --> 00:51:16.074
etc. etc.
etc., and of course this was 

00:51:16.075 --> 00:51:20.725
also reflected
in the daily discourse of French

00:51:21.279 --> 00:51:26.641
 politicians
as an example. So why should we 

00:51:26.642 --> 00:51:30.946
be surprise ed
that she is so popular, because 

00:51:30.947 --> 00:51:35.752
she's the one
claiming citizenship in an 

00:51:35.753 --> 00:51:38.440
exclusive club and
this should be the privilege of 

00:51:38.441 --> 00:51:42.134
the French
only, and therefore also giving 

00:51:42.135 --> 00:51:45.586
legitimacy to
a conception of French 

00:51:45.587 --> 00:51:48.362
citizenship that
somehow absolutely contradicts 

00:51:48.363 --> 00:51:50.953
the principle
of the French Revolution.

00:51:50.954 --> 00:51:53.732
 &gt;&gt; Right.
 &gt;&gt; I was rereading the article 

00:51:53.733 --> 00:51:57.595
3, I think of
the French constitution of 1793,

00:51:57.596 --> 00:52:00.428
 which was
probably the most progressive 

00:52:00.429 --> 00:52:02.315
ever written in
that country and there's one 

00:52:02.316 --> 00:52:05.219
sentence,
absolutely beautiful that says, 

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:08.241
"Every alien
who

00:52:12.479 --> 00:52:17.159
 each man or orphan is (much). 
That's

00:52:17.546 --> 00:52:21.119
enough. It's not about being 
born in France

00:52:21.527 --> 00:52:23.330
or spending five years or ten 
years or

00:52:23.331 --> 00:52:26.367
whatever, it's about being a 
human being. And

00:52:26.616 --> 00:52:29.162
France can give you French 
citizenship to

00:52:29.551 --> 00:52:37.640
someone who has demonstrate ed 
great humanistic

00:52:38.712 --> 00:52:42.503
things. Someone living in 
Morocco, or Syria,

00:52:42.504 --> 00:52:44.937
or I don't know, can become 
French. So the

00:52:45.156 --> 00:52:49.387
question can be also asked in 
that way, why

00:52:50.148 --> 00:52:54.729
are so-called progressive 
democratic

00:52:55.269 --> 00:52:57.269
countries became nation state on
 the basis of

00:52:57.323 --> 00:53:03.392
very open conception of 
citizenship, and why   

00:53:03.393 --> 00:53:06.142
why -- and the complete 
opposite. Somehow you

00:53:06.659 --> 00:53:08.659
answered the question before, 
when you

00:53:08.759 --> 00:53:12.966
mentioned that the 
instrumentation of

00:53:13.974 --> 00:53:16.219
citizenship for a short-term 
political agenda

00:53:16.355 --> 00:53:21.470
by politicians in many western 
countries

00:53:21.471 --> 00:53:24.416
there's a wonderful play by a 
French

00:53:24.696 --> 00:53:27.550
historian on the history of 
French

00:53:29.364 --> 00:53:31.364
citizenship. It's extraordinary.
 How it was

00:53:32.231 --> 00:53:37.583
instrumentalized in the late 
17th and 18th

00:53:37.584 --> 00:53:40.317
Century and one understands that
 there is a

00:53:40.567 --> 00:53:43.192
sort of opportunistic agenda in 
granting

00:53:43.818 --> 00:53:46.304
citizenship to foreigners and 
suddenly making

00:53:46.566 --> 00:53:49.229
it more difficult to the exactly
 same people,

00:53:50.254 --> 00:53:55.144
and even worse than WWII.

00:53:58.477 --> 00:54:00.884
 &gt;&gt; I mean there is something --
 there is

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.668
something to be said for what's 
happening in

00:54:05.022 --> 00:54:09.206
Europe, in particular. The 
instrument          

00:54:09.207 --> 00:54:11.207
instrumentalization, and the 
description of

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:14.380
the immigrant and the refugees 
in particular,

00:54:14.381 --> 00:54:21.212
as a real threat to national 
identity, to the

00:54:26.015 --> 00:54:28.594
collective itiy. Speaking from 
the Middle East,

00:54:28.736 --> 00:54:31.963
you see countries like Turkey, 
Lebanon,

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.936
Jordan, even Saudi Arabia has 
taken in

00:54:35.413 --> 00:54:40.693
several hundred thousand 
Syrians, and these

00:54:41.722 --> 00:54:43.722
Syrian

00:54:45.194 --> 00:54:47.194
 refugees are not necessarily 
treated

00:54:47.386 --> 00:54:50.658
well, but they're not -- the 
state doesn't

00:54:50.824 --> 00:54:55.718
use them as a foil to construct 
a sense of

00:54:56.745 --> 00:54:59.289
identity, an exclusive sense of 
identity in

00:54:59.741 --> 00:55:01.823
opposition to that. And it's 
curious that

00:55:02.028 --> 00:55:04.599
that's not the case in the 
Middle East, given

00:55:04.755 --> 00:55:07.694
that they're taking in many more
 than Europe

00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:14.323
is.
 &gt;&gt; So this is a, for me, you 

00:55:14.324 --> 00:55:17.311
know, laya
mentioned it in the opening and 

00:55:17.312 --> 00:55:20.159
you just
brought it up again. If you look

00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:22.991
 at the
debate that people say we can't 

00:55:22.992 --> 00:55:25.628
take them in
Europe or the United States, 

00:55:25.629 --> 00:55:29.180
10,000 that
would be too many, and Lebanon 

00:55:29.181 --> 00:55:32.372
has over a
million refugees, so this idea 

00:55:32.373 --> 00:55:35.408
that it's too
many, we can't manage, what is 

00:55:35.409 --> 00:55:37.726
it that people
imagine who say that is going to

00:55:38.743 --> 00:55:42.101
 happen to
these refugees? Do they think 

00:55:42.102 --> 00:55:45.396
they should die
and if not, who should take care

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.810
 of them and
why should Lebanon take care of 

00:55:49.811 --> 00:55:53.156
them or
Turkey or Jordan. So there's 

00:55:53.157 --> 00:55:56.087
some confusion
with the implications. So if 

00:55:56.088 --> 00:55:58.765
you're saying
this, why does that imply for 

00:55:58.766 --> 00:56:01.614
what should
happen to these refugees? Who is

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:04.054
 responsible?
And why do we assume that these 

00:56:04.055 --> 00:56:06.375
states, as
you say, these states in the 

00:56:06.376 --> 00:56:09.741
Middle East,
which are not a model, they are 

00:56:09.742 --> 00:56:11.679
often
undemocrattive and they are 

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.452
oppressive in
many ways, but they are the ones

00:56:15.631 --> 00:56:17.463
 who are
admitting them and taking care 

00:56:17.464 --> 00:56:20.084
of them and
the rich liberal democratic 

00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:21.860
states are
excluding them. So I think 

00:56:21.861 --> 00:56:23.986
that's a deep
puzzle and contradiction in the 

00:56:23.987 --> 00:56:27.063
values that
we claim to profess.

00:56:27.064 --> 00:56:33.452
   &gt;&gt; That's absolutely true.
 &gt;&gt; But I think -- I mean I 

00:56:33.453 --> 00:56:35.935
suspect that the
answer to that why that is has 

00:56:35.936 --> 00:56:38.478
to do with
politics. It doesn't have to do 

00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:41.286
with --
 &gt;&gt; The answer has to do with 

00:56:41.287 --> 00:56:44.300
privilege,
right? That what people feel 

00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:46.080
that we will
have to give up some of the 

00:56:46.081 --> 00:56:48.843
privileges that
we enjoy and that is true, so if

00:56:49.214 --> 00:56:52.519
 you accept
this model of feudalism, then 

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.665
mobility has to
give up some of its privileges. 

00:56:55.666 --> 00:56:58.414
Any yes, we
cannot enjoy all the privileges 

00:56:58.415 --> 00:57:02.010
that we have
in a just world. In a just 

00:57:02.011 --> 00:57:04.353
world, people
won't need to leave home to find

00:57:04.748 --> 00:57:06.372
 work,
because the opportunities will 

00:57:06.373 --> 00:57:10.261
be more widely
distributed. But then there's 

00:57:10.262 --> 00:57:12.105
kind of refusal
to acknowledge our role in 

00:57:12.106 --> 00:57:15.025
maintaining this
present order. Notice even in 

00:57:15.026 --> 00:57:17.439
your comments,
you know, we presuppose, and 

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.784
that's one of
the things that Bush      

00:57:22.785 --> 00:57:28.553
Bouchra's mapping project
underlies. We proceed           

00:57:30.812 --> 00:57:33.911
 presuppose a state. We take 
those

00:57:34.273 --> 00:57:36.718
as given entities. But there's a
 way in which

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.282
one of the things that one want 
to do is

00:57:39.637 --> 00:57:41.922
problem advertise that. And what
 if we wanted

00:57:42.266 --> 00:57:44.357
to define organizing the world 
into states,

00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:47.189
what is the story we tell as to 
why that's

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:50.892
good for everybody? Not just 
good for us. You

00:57:50.893 --> 00:57:53.287
have to say it's good for 
everybody, right?

00:57:53.425 --> 00:57:55.535
There has to be some story and 
there isn't a

00:57:55.777 --> 00:58:02.738
good story to tell about that.
   &gt;&gt; And that would be through 

00:58:02.739 --> 00:58:05.915
geopolitics.
And we have learned this last 

00:58:05.916 --> 00:58:09.807
year that also
conducted to what is going on in

00:58:10.411 --> 00:58:13.848
 Syria and
other areas of the region when 

00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:18.757
you think of
acknowledging the situation. To 

00:58:18.758 --> 00:58:23.243
acknowledge
that the consequences of gee    

00:58:23.244 --> 00:58:25.569
 geo political
agendas that are contemplated 

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:29.984
and operated in
very specific areas lead to the 

00:58:29.985 --> 00:58:32.267
disasters
that we have been seeing in 

00:58:32.268 --> 00:58:37.046
Iraq, actually
for months and months and 

00:58:37.047 --> 00:58:44.500
months. We won't
speak only since 2003, because 

00:58:44.501 --> 00:58:48.215
between 2001
and 2003, a lot of refugees were

00:58:48.431 --> 00:58:50.632
 leaving out
of the consequence of the war. 

00:58:50.633 --> 00:58:55.430
And I met a
lot of them in Istanbul in 200

00:58:58.849 --> 00:59:03.261
6, 7, so
speaking of equality is also 

00:59:03.262 --> 00:59:07.460
speaking of
geopolitics, and it's a true, 

00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:13.574
and extension
form, and that opportunistic

00:59:17.514 --> 00:59:22.262
 and cynical, and the 
consequences to the neighboring

00:59:22.263 --> 00:59:28.091
area, because that also what 
happens, just to

00:59:28.245 --> 00:59:32.145
give an example.
 &gt;&gt; So I have a couple of 

00:59:32.146 --> 00:59:35.489
questions. One has
to do with, you know, the 

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:39.076
individual that you
know, spoke to, and how you got 

00:59:39.077 --> 00:59:41.735
them to tell
their stories or the mechanics 

00:59:41.736 --> 00:59:47.256
of it. But
before I get into that, I'm 

00:59:47.257 --> 00:59:51.196
wondering about
the, again, in a way your 

00:59:51.197 --> 00:59:54.248
interrogation, your
questions are also a 

00:59:54.249 --> 00:59:57.036
representation of this
situation, that I know they were

00:59:57.528 --> 01:00:00.851
 done before
the Arab Spring, but really, 

01:00:00.852 --> 01:00:03.638
they could have
been done after the Arab Spring,

01:00:03.894 --> 01:00:05.734
 they would
have been done almost any time, 

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.610
because the
story of these people trying to 

01:00:07.611 --> 01:00:12.972
leave, you
know, is decades old. Even from 

01:00:12.973 --> 01:00:18.347
the regions
where -- that they come from. So

01:00:18.632 --> 01:00:21.494
 in terms of,
you know, in a sense giving them

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:24.329
 voice,
representing them, there's 

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.259
something to me at
least that the artist does, and 

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.163
certainly in
your case, it's almost 

01:00:31.164 --> 01:00:35.618
Christian, you know?
You almost put your finger on on

01:00:35.955 --> 01:00:40.121
 a problem
that exists, and told the story 

01:00:40.122 --> 01:00:41.983
of the
problem in a way that hasn't 

01:00:41.984 --> 01:00:44.100
been told by
anyone else. Certainly not by 

01:00:44.101 --> 01:00:48.427
the media.
There's something almost, you 

01:00:48.428 --> 01:00:52.477
know, as I said
prescient. You could tell that 

01:00:52.478 --> 01:00:54.359
this was a
problem that's very major in the

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.360
 world today,
and you could tell that story in

01:00:56.477 --> 01:01:00.341
 a way that I
think is much more effective 

01:01:00.342 --> 01:01:03.874
than other ways
of telling it that are -- that 

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:08.477
we hear about,
typically from the media. And so

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:13.912
 the role of
the artist in that telling, if 

01:01:13.913 --> 01:01:16.447
you can maybe
say something about whether you 

01:01:16.448 --> 01:01:19.939
think you,
you know, you put your finger on

01:01:20.378 --> 01:01:22.357
 something in
any particular way, how is it 

01:01:22.358 --> 01:01:25.820
that you even
came up with this idea? Did you 

01:01:25.821 --> 01:01:27.590
notice it
from Morocco and it was 

01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:30.106
something you
experienced yourself? You wanted

01:01:30.648 --> 01:01:32.868
 to reproduce
it through these individuals, as

01:01:32.869 --> 01:01:33.683
 well, or was
it something else?

01:01:33.684 --> 01:01:38.689
 &gt;&gt;  
 &gt;&gt; Again, I can't make a short 

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:39.245
answer to
this.

01:01:39.246 --> 01:01:43.906
 &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to ask you just 
deep questions.

01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:47.616
   [laughter]
   &gt;&gt; Even when I was in the art

01:01:47.801 --> 01:01:54.349
 school in
Paris, I was working on the 

01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:58.444
question of
being, of not being a citizen 

01:01:58.445 --> 01:02:04.044
and being
somehow excluded to the margin 

01:02:04.045 --> 01:02:06.490
of society,
because you don't hold the right

01:02:07.343 --> 01:02:09.560
 paper.
 &gt;&gt; Right, mm-hm.

01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:12.752
 &gt;&gt; I guess it's something to 
which I have

01:02:13.453 --> 01:02:16.763
always been very attentive. My 
own situation

01:02:16.965 --> 01:02:19.741
was different because I was a 
student, and I

01:02:20.191 --> 01:02:23.300
moved with my parents, and I was
 very lucky,

01:02:23.543 --> 01:02:28.712
because often it's also a 
complete conflict.

01:02:28.898 --> 01:02:31.480
The first time I went to France 
I was 3

01:02:32.496 --> 01:02:40.120
months old and    . So when I 
applied for a permit,

01:02:40.262 --> 01:02:42.262
they said that I already came, 
there was a

01:02:43.044 --> 01:02:45.618
connection. It makes things 
easier. But what

01:02:46.019 --> 01:02:49.925
about if a different law was 
written two days

01:02:50.936 --> 01:02:54.386
before. It was -- at that time 
it was easier.

01:02:54.387 --> 01:02:56.823
Today it would be impossible. It
 would never

01:02:57.575 --> 01:02:59.614
happen. But 20 years ago, it was
 possible for

01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:04.923
someone like me, who did not 
face that many

01:03:05.112 --> 01:03:12.056
difficulties in getting a 
residency permit.

01:03:12.344 --> 01:03:14.793
But it was more difficult to 
apply for

01:03:15.855 --> 01:03:18.636
residency, which was a another 
story. To go

01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:20.943
back to your question, I cannot 
answer it in

01:03:21.325 --> 01:03:23.767
a simple way, because I cannot 
say I have

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:26.110
experienced this myself the same
 way. It's

01:03:26.207 --> 01:03:31.706
not true. What I have experience
 ed is

01:03:31.969 --> 01:03:36.237
witnessing in my own 
environment, and every

01:03:36.238 --> 01:03:40.417
single Moroccan knew a lot of 
people who

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.630
crossed the strait of

01:03:47.368 --> 01:03:56.323
 Gilbrat lter. And it
created a culture with songs, 

01:03:56.324 --> 01:04:00.999
jokes, music.
It is almost a

01:04:04.732 --> 01:04:08.786
 subculture because it was
massive in the early '90s until 

01:04:08.787 --> 01:04:10.787
the early
2000s.

01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:16.076
 &gt;&gt; So the journey, right?
 &gt;&gt; Yeah, leaving? Leaving.

01:04:16.077 --> 01:04:18.359
 &gt;&gt;  
 &gt;&gt; We said burning.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.184
 &gt;&gt; Burning?
 &gt;&gt; Yeah, because you burn the 

01:04:23.185 --> 01:04:29.535
--        the -- air abic.
Or he's a burner. He burned last

01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:32.002
 month.
That's what we used to hear 

01:04:32.003 --> 01:04:37.779
almost every day.
Hamad, he burned last night. So 

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:40.714
that was
really in our environment. So of

01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:44.817
 course this
creates another perception of 

01:04:44.818 --> 01:04:48.216
crossing
borders illegally, not to 

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:51.995
mention the history
of immigration that is 

01:04:51.996 --> 01:04:54.275
completely linked to
it and the authority of 

01:04:54.276 --> 01:04:59.640
immigration is very
strong. Because there's a huge

01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:07.174
 from Morocco,
all over the world and these 

01:05:07.175 --> 01:05:10.571
also participate
in that structure that I tried 

01:05:10.572 --> 01:05:12.592
to describe
before. I'm not sure actually if

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.645
 I'm
answering your question, but I'm

01:05:15.937 --> 01:05:18.460
 trying to
connect very complex things 

01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:22.612
together that
somehow enrich that work in 

01:05:22.613 --> 01:05:25.858
particular. But
to say it in more simple words, 

01:05:25.859 --> 01:05:30.867
I worked with
what I knew. And I worked also 

01:05:30.868 --> 01:05:33.660
with what I
researched, because there is 

01:05:33.661 --> 01:05:38.543
also a lot of
research behind it which I 

01:05:38.544 --> 01:05:46.632
conducted out of,
let's say, -- because I like 

01:05:46.633 --> 01:05:49.913
making my
homework, I know a bit what I'm 

01:05:49.914 --> 01:05:53.591
talking
about, and of course I was also 

01:05:53.592 --> 01:05:56.038
dealing with
different cultures, it was 

01:05:56.039 --> 01:06:00.003
important to have
a sort of precise knowledge of 

01:06:00.004 --> 01:06:05.055
specific
situations, and the visa effect 

01:06:05.056 --> 01:06:07.839
I described
it before, so it gives you an 

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.461
idea of how all
those things combine. But it's 

01:06:11.462 --> 01:06:16.117
also the same
methodology I used for all of my

01:06:17.852 --> 01:06:19.852
 projects.
I'm always working with things I

01:06:20.425 --> 01:06:23.536
 have
experienced with or know about 

01:06:23.537 --> 01:06:29.145
in my
environment, including the ones 

01:06:29.146 --> 01:06:32.854
--   : But it was
also stories I heard when I was 

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:39.290
a kid.
African national Congress, 

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:46.893
headquarters were
located in Morocco in 1962, so I

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:49.367
 always
worked with things that I knew 

01:06:49.368 --> 01:06:51.598
about in my
environment and I researched, 

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:54.710
too, and
somehow all of this becomes a 

01:06:54.711 --> 01:07:00.476
sort of --
stays in my head, but it's not 

01:07:00.477 --> 01:07:04.920
only more
important when I'm on the south,

01:07:05.086 --> 01:07:09.411
 when it's
happening. And to answer your 

01:07:09.412 --> 01:07:15.607
other question
about how it happened that I met

01:07:15.608 --> 01:07:21.541
 so many
individuals who told me their 

01:07:21.542 --> 01:07:24.963
stories, it's
just that we talk a lot together

01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:27.801
. So the
videos are not based on 

01:07:27.802 --> 01:07:36.343
interviews, there's
no questions being asked. It was

01:07:36.606 --> 01:07:38.406
 very long
conversations and I think 

01:07:38.407 --> 01:07:40.466
throughout those
conversations there was also a 

01:07:40.467 --> 01:07:44.189
form of
empowerment that was developing,

01:07:44.565 --> 01:07:46.590
 because they
were somehow becoming the author

01:07:46.943 --> 01:07:49.618
 of their own
story. It was not being told by 

01:07:49.619 --> 01:07:52.266
someone else.
It was being told by themselves,

01:07:52.624 --> 01:07:58.331
 so, yeah,
there was also a form of 

01:07:58.332 --> 01:08:00.601
camaraderie.
 &gt;&gt; So I'd like to remind the 

01:08:00.602 --> 01:08:02.439
audience that
you can ask questions and I 

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.212
think there are
cards amongst you that have been

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:09.433
 distributed
so please do so. Write out your 

01:08:09.434 --> 01:08:11.280
questions,
and Bouchra, I know you wanted 

01:08:11.281 --> 01:08:12.281
to show a few
slides.

01:08:12.282 --> 01:08:14.458
 &gt;&gt; Not necessarily. I mean we 
can keep

01:08:15.639 --> 01:08:17.807
talking. I also find it very 
nice just to

01:08:17.808 --> 01:08:20.719
have this conversation.
 &gt;&gt; It's really up to you.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.032
 &gt;&gt; No, I'm totally OK.

01:08:29.328 --> 01:08:31.550
 &gt;&gt; All right, you had mentioned
 earlier that

01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:34.597
you didn't think that social 
media, the

01:08:35.087 --> 01:08:37.780
internet, you know, Facebook, 
etc., all of

01:08:38.043 --> 01:08:42.445
these things, had really played 
such an

01:08:42.579 --> 01:08:44.925
important role, I think in the 
context of the

01:08:44.926 --> 01:08:47.158
Arab Spring.
 &gt;&gt; I haven't said that.

01:08:47.159 --> 01:08:51.325
 &gt;&gt; Oh, OK, well, but you said 
that you know

01:08:51.326 --> 01:08:53.840
they were revolutionary ideas 
and connections

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.000
that predated social media. I 
wonder, though,

01:08:59.023 --> 01:09:04.608
how you think these technologies
 are -- and

01:09:04.845 --> 01:09:07.965
this question is for you, as 
well -- how

01:09:08.272 --> 01:09:12.025
these technologies may or may 
not alter the

01:09:12.026 --> 01:09:14.676
stories of some of these people 
who are, you

01:09:15.273 --> 01:09:19.027
know, who are refugees, whether 
-- I mean I

01:09:19.185 --> 01:09:22.266
know that if I recall correctly 
in some of

01:09:22.463 --> 01:09:24.463
your -- in your installation, 
there were

01:09:24.944 --> 01:09:26.944
accounts of people saying, you 
know, I was

01:09:27.077 --> 01:09:29.077
able to call my mother, I was 
able to, you

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:34.022
know, maybe, you know, face time
 with her or

01:09:34.522 --> 01:09:36.962
whatever, so in what ways do 
these

01:09:37.452 --> 01:09:40.251
technologies make a difference? 
I mean, are

01:09:40.566 --> 01:09:44.617
they, for instance, you know, 
helping in any

01:09:44.618 --> 01:09:49.531
way to make less imposing the --
 you know,

01:09:49.781 --> 01:09:51.906
the power of the nation state, 
the

01:09:51.907 --> 01:09:53.907
overwhelming sort of 
oppressiveness of the

01:09:54.088 --> 01:09:56.714
nation state? Do you find that 
in any way

01:09:56.861 --> 01:10:01.510
they play a role, or not?
 &gt;&gt; 

01:10:07.273 --> 01:10:10.834
way to say is I
do think that the phenomenon of 

01:10:10.835 --> 01:10:12.703
migration, of
course it's an old phenomenon, 

01:10:12.704 --> 01:10:16.551
but it has
been accelerate ed by technology

01:10:16.799 --> 01:10:20.159
 and that's not
just kind of a communication 

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.643
technology,
though that is part of it, 

01:10:22.644 --> 01:10:24.523
because now
everybody understands the 

01:10:24.524 --> 01:10:26.496
possibilities out
there. There's this global 

01:10:26.497 --> 01:10:28.284
communication and
people have pictures and they 

01:10:28.285 --> 01:10:30.188
have
understandings and they have 

01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:32.324
communications
and networks, and so this sense 

01:10:32.325 --> 01:10:34.343
that there's
a possibility to move if you 

01:10:34.344 --> 01:10:37.946
want to, is I
think enhanced by technology, 

01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:39.880
and of course
then the physical possibilities 

01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:48.353
of moving are
enhanced by id modern means of 

01:10:48.354 --> 01:10:50.543
transportation.
So globalization and the way 

01:10:50.544 --> 01:10:52.520
that connects
people together, economically, 

01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:56.076
socially,
culturally, that certainly has 

01:10:56.077 --> 01:10:58.494
an impact in
challenging and then making 

01:10:58.495 --> 01:11:00.670
people nervous
about their understanding of 

01:11:00.671 --> 01:11:02.988
what their
community is and membership in 

01:11:02.989 --> 01:11:08.404
the community
and outsiders, so yeah, I think 

01:11:08.405 --> 01:11:11.243
so.
 &gt;&gt; In connection with the Arab 

01:11:11.244 --> 01:11:14.728
Spring, of
course the social media were 

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:18.174
extremely
important, because I mean one of

01:11:18.977 --> 01:11:22.077
 the
vocations is to allow 

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:28.647
communities to exist or
to invent other communities, 

01:11:28.648 --> 01:11:30.562
strategically
speaking it's extremely 

01:11:30.563 --> 01:11:36.643
important in Syria
and other countries, maybe not 

01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:39.947
as important
in Tunisia, because the 

01:11:39.948 --> 01:11:48.372
demonstrations were
so immense and -- so if there 

01:11:48.373 --> 01:11:56.582
are maybe
producing the sort of own

01:11:59.076 --> 01:12:02.729
 pistmology, it is
in the conception of the 

01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:04.390
community. It
doesn't need to be present in 

01:12:04.391 --> 01:12:09.745
one space. That
can exist and be effective 

01:12:09.746 --> 01:12:12.426
virtually. In a
virtual space and that has an 

01:12:12.427 --> 01:12:16.541
impact on the
reality. Maybe that connection, 

01:12:16.542 --> 01:12:20.928
in that way,
from the virtual community to 

01:12:20.929 --> 01:12:23.416
the physical,
political community that becomes

01:12:24.426 --> 01:12:26.426
 visible

01:12:28.422 --> 01:12:30.422
, so

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.670
 to give you an example of maybe
 2014 work

01:12:51.686 --> 01:12:53.847
based on the

01:12:58.245 --> 01:13:02.085
 ... that really happened, but
that was never documented, and 

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:05.083
well, what
surprised me a lot is when I 

01:13:05.084 --> 01:13:12.232
started seeing
in demonstrations in Morocco, 

01:13:12.233 --> 01:13:17.339
pictures and
seeing in Paris a few weeks ago,

01:13:17.478 --> 01:13:19.898
 the look
forward, there was a 

01:13:19.899 --> 01:13:22.087
demonstration against
racism and for equality, and 

01:13:22.088 --> 01:13:26.284
there are
pictures of

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:36.100
: And this is a result of the
reconnection of community. You 

01:13:36.101 --> 01:13:37.775
know.
 &gt;&gt; We have a number of 

01:13:37.776 --> 01:13:40.698
questions, by the
way, from the audience, so I'll 

01:13:40.699 --> 01:13:48.798
start with
one but    , and this is a 

01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:54.283
question of: Do you see
 the artist as being necessarily

01:13:54.943 --> 01:13:56.967
 progressive.
 &gt;&gt; That's a very good question.

01:13:57.121 --> 01:14:01.837
 I think hi
history has shown that not 

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:04.472
artists are
progressive. I don't believe 

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:07.626
that an artist
has to be necessarily 

01:14:07.627 --> 01:14:11.360
progressive or being a
good artist or that you're a 

01:14:11.361 --> 01:14:14.603
good artist it's
because you are progressive. No,

01:14:14.775 --> 01:14:19.179
 not really.
Great artists, whom I personally

01:14:19.779 --> 01:14:23.925
 admire as
 artists, not as human beings, 

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:27.482
that are not
progressive.

01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:39.481
 Their art has been regarded as
great art but they are not 

01:14:39.482 --> 01:14:45.635
progressive.
 &gt;&gt; So the first question is -- 

01:14:45.636 --> 01:14:52.345
the power of
between today's issues with the 

01:14:52.346 --> 01:14:54.608
refugees and
the crisis and the Holocaust 

01:14:54.609 --> 01:14:59.055
exist but
there's an underlying 

01:14:59.056 --> 01:15:01.276
difference. Today's
refugees come from political 

01:15:01.277 --> 01:15:05.307
belief systems,
but    

01:15:05.577 --> 01:15:09.320
that seek to dominate others.

01:15:12.364 --> 01:15:18.916
 The excessive
accommodation of refugees 

01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:23.177
demands are
suicidal. How do you balance?

01:15:23.336 --> 01:15:26.388
 &gt;&gt; One of the problems with 
this sort of

01:15:26.887 --> 01:15:29.027
question is one asks what is the
 empirical

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:31.229
evidence and if one looks at the
 facts over

01:15:31.649 --> 01:15:34.829
the last, recently hundreds of 
thousands of

01:15:35.183 --> 01:15:37.926
refugees admitted to the United 
States over

01:15:38.089 --> 01:15:44.677
the past 20, 30 years, and four 
incidents of

01:15:45.025 --> 01:15:49.939
terror, so there's just no 
reason to believe.

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.719
Bouchra's story captures it 
nicely, the vast

01:15:53.154 --> 01:15:56.350
majority of refugees, what do 
they want? They

01:15:56.601 --> 01:15:58.370
want their children to be safe. 
They want to

01:15:58.371 --> 01:16:00.448
find a place where they can live
 a life, grow

01:16:00.829 --> 01:16:04.220
up with their kids, have a job, 
and live a

01:16:04.875 --> 01:16:07.917
normal life. And so the idea 
that somehow --

01:16:08.158 --> 01:16:11.503
so some from oppressive regime, 
but the fact

01:16:11.661 --> 01:16:13.835
that the -- the idea that they 
would then

01:16:14.264 --> 01:16:19.569
want to reinstitutionalize those
 oppressive

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.580
regimes is without foundation. 
Not to say

01:16:23.527 --> 01:16:25.685
nobody, but almost nobody and 
the idea that

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:30.615
we should exclude all these 
people for the

01:16:30.616 --> 01:16:32.616
possibility of the one or the 
two is just

01:16:33.014 --> 01:16:35.014
inhumane.
 &gt;&gt; I absolutely agree with you,

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:44.417
 too, because
if one makes leaving an 

01:16:44.418 --> 01:16:49.735
oppressive regime to
reinstitute an oppressive regime

01:16:49.736 --> 01:16:51.564
 as well,
they are not refugees, they have

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:54.561
 a plan.
 &gt;&gt; I saw something somebody had

01:16:54.864 --> 01:16:57.205
 said, you
know, people do not put their 

01:16:57.206 --> 01:16:59.708
kids in boats,
unless you know being on a boat 

01:16:59.709 --> 01:17:02.181
is less
dangerous than being on the 

01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:05.672
land. People are
not fleeing to dominate others. 

01:17:05.673 --> 01:17:08.352
They're
fleeing to save their lives, so 

01:17:08.353 --> 01:17:09.835
it's just
unreasonable to construct them 

01:17:09.836 --> 01:17:13.177
in that way.
 &gt;&gt; And to give an example that 

01:17:13.178 --> 01:17:18.050
is probably
not absolutely relevant for all 

01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:20.168
the
situations that are occurring 

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:23.164
today with
regards to the migration crisis,

01:17:23.909 --> 01:17:28.979
 but as an
example, in north Africa, -- 

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.878
again I speak of
what I know from experience.

01:17:31.879 --> 01:17:36.628
 &gt;&gt; Leaving the country without 
a visa was

01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:38.629
also

01:17:42.955 --> 01:17:46.439
 against the regime, but also 
there are

01:17:47.226 --> 01:17:49.239
millions of people who could 
travel freely

01:17:49.384 --> 01:17:52.021
and to make a life of their own 
where they

01:17:52.427 --> 01:17:55.658
wanted to live. So there is also
 a form of --

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.258
I won't call it a political 
statement at all.

01:17:58.442 --> 01:18:02.962
Because that's not the case. But
 as you said,

01:18:03.219 --> 01:18:06.809
no one risks their life and the 
life of their

01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:11.913
kids to implement an oppressive 
regime, as

01:18:11.914 --> 01:18:15.253
well, it is simply not to become
 a

01:18:15.645 --> 01:18:19.604
millionaire or whatever, but to 
have a decent

01:18:19.605 --> 01:18:23.979
life, and a life where respect 
is guaranteed,

01:18:24.973 --> 01:18:29.178
but also liberty, and that's 
also the

01:18:29.179 --> 01:18:34.599
difference between us being like
 in Lebanon

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:41.615
or Jordan or Turkey, and being 
in Germany,

01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:44.170
mostly Germany and Europe. In 
one cases there

01:18:44.351 --> 01:18:47.716
are many restrictions to the 
liberties in

01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:50.597
being a refugee, and that's also
 the reason

01:18:50.887 --> 01:18:56.017
why, if you take the risk to or 
if you are

01:18:56.259 --> 01:18:58.259
willing to risk your life 
because it's a

01:18:59.205 --> 01:19:02.385
matter of survival, liberty is 
also somehow

01:19:02.565 --> 01:19:03.667
at stake.
 &gt;&gt; Absolutely.

01:19:03.668 --> 01:19:07.156
 &gt;&gt; Can I say one other quick 
thing? Jews

01:19:07.293 --> 01:19:09.684
were just leaving to assimilate.
 But that way

01:19:09.841 --> 01:19:14.614
of phrasing it forgets all of 
the

01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:17.618
anti-Semitic

01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:22.508
 tropes. It was precisely that
this false construction that 

01:19:22.509 --> 01:19:25.846
they were bent
on domination, and I think that 

01:19:25.847 --> 01:19:27.899
again these
tropes are repeated today, but 

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.527
now with
respect to others.

01:19:31.528 --> 01:19:35.427
 &gt;&gt; We have one more question 
here and I'm

01:19:35.579 --> 01:19:39.254
going to add to it a little bit.
 So did you

01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:41.921
have to choose between which 
refugee stories

01:19:42.121 --> 01:19:44.466
to tell and display, and if so, 
how did you

01:19:44.609 --> 01:19:48.567
choose? And I'm adding to it, I 
recall, was

01:19:48.786 --> 01:19:52.491
it one woman or maybe more? At 
least one was

01:19:52.714 --> 01:19:55.257
a woman, and could you speak a 
little bit

01:19:55.504 --> 01:20:00.262
about the difference between the
 males versus

01:20:00.391 --> 01:20:02.536
the females in the story, in the
 narrative?

01:20:02.843 --> 01:20:05.272
Because I imagine being a woman,
 I think it

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:08.833
was a Somali woman in that case.
 I mean the

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.240
experience of traveling must 
have been

01:20:11.529 --> 01:20:13.529
harrowing. It's harrowing for 
all of them,

01:20:14.004 --> 01:20:15.938
but that much more so for her. 
If you could

01:20:15.939 --> 01:20:21.500
say something about that.
 &gt;&gt; Well, actually, there was no

01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:24.896
 casting.
There are no videos that were 

01:20:24.897 --> 01:20:27.412
filmed that are
not being shown there. All of 

01:20:27.413 --> 01:20:34.415
them are there.
And I have not selected, because

01:20:35.412 --> 01:20:38.966
 it was not
what was at stake. What was at 

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:42.803
stake was
meeting an individual and going 

01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:45.988
back            not going back 
to

01:20:45.989 --> 01:20:47.941
the media question. It is 
somehow the

01:20:47.942 --> 01:20:50.242
opposite of looking for a good 
example.

01:20:50.543 --> 01:20:52.543
Because there are no good 
examples. Every

01:20:53.141 --> 01:20:56.839
single life deserves or every 
single story

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:02.093
deserves to be told. Because 
they are

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:11.853
universe al. So, no, they are 
all there.

01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:16.730
Speaking of the video with the 
woman from

01:21:17.723 --> 01:21:25.927
Somalia, I think of course I was
 very

01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:31.906
 touched
by her, but she's a very strong 

01:21:31.907 --> 01:21:36.302
woman,
extremely strong. But she was 

01:21:36.303 --> 01:21:42.534
also protected
by other Somali men, and going 

01:21:42.535 --> 01:21:45.139
back to the
previous question and the answer

01:21:45.363 --> 01:21:53.719
 you gave to
it, those also in Europe a very 

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:58.866
popular --   :
Called

01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:06.236
 Arabs had a plan to invade 
Europe and

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:08.990
to submit Europe to Islam. That 
woman was

01:22:09.536 --> 01:22:14.075
protected by older men, not very
 older, but

01:22:15.199 --> 01:22:17.199
old y and they made sure that

01:22:20.232 --> 01:22:30.001
 ... She was not
a or not -- was in a group. And 

01:22:30.002 --> 01:22:32.937
she was the
only woman and she was perfectly

01:22:34.126 --> 01:22:39.171
 safe among
those men. So there was no

01:22:45.714 --> 01:22:55.552
 the Arab
conception of woman that is: Or 

01:22:55.553 --> 01:22:57.672
whatever,
absolutely not. She was, yeah, 

01:22:57.673 --> 01:22:59.399
in a community
of mep.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.453
 &gt;&gt; Another one is what has 
changed in the

01:23:03.619 --> 01:23:06.678
refugees' visibility in the 
media or

01:23:06.679 --> 01:23:11.679
elsewhere since you made this 
work in 2008 to

01:23:12.928 --> 01:23:21.373
2011? That's       
 &gt;&gt; That's a very good question.

01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:30.338
 Actually, I
think it will speak of 

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:36.655
visibility, but the
challenge should be specified. 

01:23:36.656 --> 01:23:41.478
Was the
migration crisis discussed every

01:23:43.497 --> 01:23:46.926
 single day,
but it is also discussed by the 

01:23:46.927 --> 01:23:49.663
politicians
in Europe and also here. I heard

01:23:50.688 --> 01:23:55.227
 that Donald
Trump made some comments on his 

01:23:55.228 --> 01:23:58.673
views on
migration. Can we call it 

01:23:58.674 --> 01:24:04.357
visibility? I'm not
sure. What is certainly 

01:24:04.358 --> 01:24:08.986
visibility            visible is
 certain

01:24:09.467 --> 01:24:13.306
discourses but it doesn't mean 
that they are

01:24:14.162 --> 01:24:16.904
visible, that there are 
individuals that are

01:24:17.097 --> 01:24:23.330
suffering the conditions of 
being forced to

01:24:28.065 --> 01:24:30.738
live is visible. And therefore 
one can also

01:24:30.909 --> 01:24:37.978
ask another question, at what 
point is she

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.806
visible, too? Because speaking 
of the

01:24:40.807 --> 01:24:43.294
visibility of the refugees, is 
-- doesn't

01:24:43.452 --> 01:24:46.599
answer the question of why are 
they forced to

01:24:47.619 --> 01:24:55.665
expose this very hard life that 
can last for

01:24:55.666 --> 01:24:58.298
literally years for some of 
them. And so I'm

01:24:58.851 --> 01:25:03.525
not sure if -- let's say 
humanitarian

01:25:04.288 --> 01:25:09.375
comments are enough to make 
visible the

01:25:09.376 --> 01:25:11.622
question of ownership, because 
again the

01:25:11.917 --> 01:25:14.150
question of what is at stake is 
again

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:16.528
equality. Until that point are 
we ready to

01:25:16.955 --> 01:25:21.405
accept an other that can be 
radically other?

01:25:21.963 --> 01:25:25.722
That can be undergo a certain 
type of

01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:28.526
otherness that is not popular in
 the country

01:25:29.552 --> 01:25:33.694
or whatever. Whatever they have 
in mind the

01:25:33.935 --> 01:25:37.806
very specific concepts in 
Germany and France,

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.944
which I am aware because I have 
lived in

01:25:39.945 --> 01:25:42.054
those places and this also 
affects the

01:25:42.931 --> 01:25:46.826
visibility or nonvisibility of 
the

01:25:50.464 --> 01:25:52.956
individual's liberty. I'm not 
sure if I'm

01:25:52.957 --> 01:25:55.613
answering the question. It's a 
very difficult

01:25:55.908 --> 01:25:57.896
question to answer because 
advicibilities

01:25:57.897 --> 01:26:00.603
means many, many different 
things. I think

01:26:01.506 --> 01:26:05.932
for me what should be visible is
 their own

01:26:06.418 --> 01:26:09.051
views and the perspective of the
 individuals

01:26:09.052 --> 01:26:11.247
who are experiencing this crisis
 in their

01:26:11.431 --> 01:26:20.403
life that really impacts their 
life, and how

01:26:20.548 --> 01:26:23.705
are we willing to shape our 
perspective on

01:26:24.157 --> 01:26:27.352
otherness but also on equality.
 &gt;&gt; I mean I'll just say that 

01:26:27.353 --> 01:26:30.701
thinking that
Bush     

01:26:31.466 --> 01:26:33.639
Bouchra's project is to render 
people visible

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.640
who are not, right? That's what 
the mapping

01:26:36.526 --> 01:26:38.638
journey does, it makes it 
possible to see

01:26:38.783 --> 01:26:41.678
people in a certain kind of way 
who normally

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.490
are just unseen. So they're 
visible in one

01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:53.686
sense as objects, as threats, as
depersonalized others, and then 

01:26:53.687 --> 01:26:56.005
you have a
project that helps you make them

01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:57.526
 see them as
human beings.

01:26:57.527 --> 01:26:59.527
 &gt;&gt; We have a question, I think 
this one is

01:26:59.916 --> 01:27:03.726
addressed to you. So this 
question says,

01:27:04.327 --> 01:27:06.290
commitment to society as a basis
 of

01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:08.575
citizenship is a lovely idea. On
 the flip

01:27:09.549 --> 01:27:12.377
side, the anxiety or suspicion 
about refugees

01:27:13.391 --> 01:27:15.391
and

01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:18.862
 economic migrants comes from a 
suspicion

01:27:18.863 --> 01:27:21.590
of whether they're committed to 
this notion

01:27:21.759 --> 01:27:25.286
of a society. Do we need to 
think of these

01:27:25.842 --> 01:27:27.786
categories separately when 
considering

01:27:27.787 --> 01:27:31.219
immigration? I guess the 
category of

01:27:31.981 --> 01:27:33.694
immigrant versus economic 
migrant.

01:27:33.695 --> 01:27:39.211
 &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I guess I would be 
answering

01:27:39.413 --> 01:27:42.162
that question distinguish two 
levels of

01:27:42.808 --> 01:27:45.417
thought. So if you are asking as
 a kind of

01:27:45.731 --> 01:27:47.471
practical policy matter today, 
should we try

01:27:47.472 --> 01:27:51.923
to distinguish between economic 
migrants and

01:27:51.924 --> 01:27:53.924
refugees, I think it does make 
sense to

01:27:54.407 --> 01:27:56.018
distinguish between those who 
have an urgent

01:27:56.019 --> 01:27:59.691
need for safety, for their basic
 need for

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:02.327
safety and protection of human 
rights to gain

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:05.616
entry, between others who have a
 life and

01:28:06.006 --> 01:28:07.545
they're trying to better 
themselves. Those

01:28:07.546 --> 01:28:10.873
are not the same situations and 
we do need to

01:28:11.048 --> 01:28:13.281
make distinctions. But it's also
 important to

01:28:13.461 --> 01:28:15.350
step back -- and that's in the 
kind of

01:28:15.351 --> 01:28:17.421
context where we're accepting 
the existing

01:28:17.772 --> 01:28:19.699
background framework in place, 
but it's also

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:22.090
important to step back and 
criticize that

01:28:22.689 --> 01:28:24.228
framework. I guess one of the 
things that I'm

01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:26.229
trying to get people to think 
about is that

01:28:26.506 --> 01:28:28.639
the fundamental background 
structure of the

01:28:28.892 --> 01:28:30.961
way we've organized the world 
and to see that

01:28:31.281 --> 01:28:34.786
that is deeply unjust, in a just
 world,

01:28:35.495 --> 01:28:36.939
this -- this difference would 
disappear,

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.083
because people would not feel 
the need to

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:42.788
leave, either because they were 
being driven

01:28:42.962 --> 01:28:45.078
out as refugees or because they 
had a need to

01:28:45.405 --> 01:28:48.507
move elsewhere for economic 
reasons. There's

01:28:49.425 --> 01:28:52.143
no reason in principle why we 
couldn't

01:28:52.144 --> 01:28:54.218
organise the world in a just way
 so that

01:28:54.569 --> 01:28:55.843
people have decent opportunities
 at home.

01:28:55.844 --> 01:28:57.707
Then if they wanted to move, 
they could have

01:28:57.708 --> 01:28:59.996
the freedom to move if they 
wanted to. Most

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.121
people probably wouldn't, 
because most people

01:29:02.122 --> 01:29:04.197
want to live where they grow up,
 where they

01:29:04.198 --> 01:29:07.116
have family, where they have 
cultural roots.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:10.229
That's the way most people want 
to live but

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:12.411
then some people want to move 
for one reason

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:15.115
or another, and their movement 
would not be a

01:29:15.379 --> 01:29:17.779
problem if so many didn't have 
urgent other

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.725
needs to move. So I think that's
 what's at

01:29:19.726 --> 01:29:21.726
the heart of the

01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:25.902
 problem.
 &gt;&gt; I make a distinction between

01:29:26.154 --> 01:29:28.986
 economic
migrants and --

01:29:28.987 --> 01:29:31.736
 &gt;&gt; Well, I think there is a 
continuum. That

01:29:32.475 --> 01:29:34.475
you recognize that there are 
people who are

01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.649
being bombed, so if they don't 
get to leave,

01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:41.128
they will die. And other people 
-- so if we

01:29:41.388 --> 01:29:43.066
look in the United States, for 
example. Most

01:29:43.067 --> 01:29:45.344
of the people who come from 
Mexico to the

01:29:45.345 --> 01:29:48.775
United States, who I think ought
 to receive

01:29:49.192 --> 01:29:52.345
legal status after they're 
regularized. But

01:29:52.482 --> 01:29:55.272
in most cases they would not die
 living in

01:29:56.026 --> 01:29:59.045
Mexico, they would simply have a
 more limited

01:29:59.206 --> 01:30:01.765
life and they're coming to seek 
a better life

01:30:02.004 --> 01:30:04.004
for themselves and their 
children. Which I

01:30:04.097 --> 01:30:06.648
think is a perfectly reasonable 
thing for

01:30:07.114 --> 01:30:09.828
them to be but their need to be 
outside their

01:30:10.099 --> 01:30:12.725
country of origin isn't as 
urgent and dire as

01:30:12.931 --> 01:30:15.642
the needs of some people who 
really can't

01:30:15.987 --> 01:30:17.987
survive without it. So I think 
we have to

01:30:18.407 --> 01:30:24.755
recognize that function amount. 
       ality? You don't?

01:30:24.756 --> 01:30:27.413
   [laughter]
   &gt;&gt; Can we say one more 

01:30:27.414 --> 01:30:29.705
question?
 &gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:30:29.706 --> 01:30:31.706
 &gt;&gt; 

01:30:36.436 --> 01:30:39.403
I started a story that is 
actually about

01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:43.440
citizenship. The first one in 
Paris, the

01:30:44.468 --> 01:30:47.980
second one in Italy, and the 
third here. And

01:30:48.454 --> 01:30:51.695
the third was about articulation
 between

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:56.196
labor and citizenship. And the 
whole case,

01:30:56.437 --> 01:31:00.938
it's a video about, is structure
 around

01:31:01.971 --> 01:31:06.048
somehow public speech given by 
-- that is

01:31:06.668 --> 01:31:10.551
defined today by undocumented 
workers. A few

01:31:10.859 --> 01:31:13.712
of them from Mexico, and 
defining other forms

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.407
of citizenship based on their 
belonging to

01:31:16.544 --> 01:31:21.906
the workforce. One of them 
specifically says

01:31:22.377 --> 01:31:25.153
that I find personally very 
powerful. Even

01:31:26.104 --> 01:31:28.792
though he's undocumented, he 
considers that

01:31:28.944 --> 01:31:32.996
he belongs to the, to think 
community,

01:31:33.338 --> 01:31:35.338
because his political 
consciousness grew up

01:31:35.363 --> 01:31:37.256
here.
 &gt;&gt; I agree with that, though. 

01:31:37.257 --> 01:31:40.240
But in saying
that I think you have to 

01:31:40.241 --> 01:31:42.571
distinguish, it
doesn't mean that the people who

01:31:42.981 --> 01:31:46.069
 have come
here and settled here as 

01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:48.146
undocumented workers
are not members or don't belong 

01:31:48.147 --> 01:31:51.159
or don't have
a right to stay, which I think 

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.160
they do, they
have a right to get legal status

01:31:53.518 --> 01:31:55.766
 and to get
citizenship. It just has to do 

01:31:55.767 --> 01:31:58.902
with the
urgency of people who are now 

01:31:58.903 --> 01:32:00.723
outside. What
is the relative urgency of 

01:32:00.724 --> 01:32:03.564
people who are
outside, I think we can 

01:32:03.565 --> 01:32:05.841
distinguish between
different conditions. But the 

01:32:05.842 --> 01:32:07.773
people who are
already here, they are members 

01:32:07.774 --> 01:32:09.502
from my point
of view and they ought to be 

01:32:09.503 --> 01:32:10.315
accepted. I
agree with that.

01:32:10.316 --> 01:32:13.112
 &gt;&gt; Good. Maybe one last 
question, so this

01:32:13.317 --> 01:32:16.768
again is a question that says, 
why isn't

01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:18.970
there more focus directed on the
 people or

01:32:19.436 --> 01:32:21.436
leaders who are responsible for 
creating

01:32:22.119 --> 01:32:25.652
refugees rather than the rev    
 refugees themselves?

01:32:25.653 --> 01:32:28.246
In other words, on the systems 
that produce

01:32:28.863 --> 01:32:30.554
this.
 &gt;&gt; Well, again, I think that 

01:32:30.555 --> 01:32:33.477
you know, the
story of -- one of the arguments

01:32:33.891 --> 01:32:37.653
 you heard in
the 1930s was, you know, 

01:32:37.654 --> 01:32:39.631
admitting Jewish
refugees will not solve the 

01:32:39.632 --> 01:32:42.533
problem of
Hitler, and that's true. It 

01:32:42.534 --> 01:32:45.866
wouldn't. And so
of course, the problem is the 

01:32:45.867 --> 01:32:50.685
leaders and the
oppressive regimes that are 

01:32:50.686 --> 01:32:52.387
generating these
refugees, but the question is 

01:32:52.388 --> 01:32:54.281
what are you
going to do with the people that

01:32:54.282 --> 01:32:56.668
 are You can't finesse that 
problem and

01:32:57.078 --> 01:32:59.302
there's nothing to be gabbed by 
making -- do

01:32:59.528 --> 01:33:04.827
you want Syrian toes bombed by 
Assad and is

01:33:04.828 --> 01:33:08.522
that going to do something to 
remove Assad

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:12.922
from power? I don't think so.
 &gt;&gt; Please join me in thanking 

01:33:12.923 --> 01:33:15.372
our panel.
