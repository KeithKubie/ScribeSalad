1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,140
Jocko, I've just finished about
face the book. Amazing book,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,830
interested how you modeled your style
on Hackworth though hack was a renegade

3
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:14,190
and always bending the rules to
break into the breaking point.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,770
But in extreme ownership,
you talk about, for example,

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:21,771
not pushing back on higher command when
it came to Iraqi troops have listened to

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,380
podcasts too, but was hoping
you could go into it a bit more.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,590
Yeah. So I guess that's
a good question. Hack.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,450
He was kind of considered a renegade,
but, but also he was also a total company.

9
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:40,590
Man. You gotta realize that there's that
dichotomy there. There's a guy that hack,

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,920
loved the army,
he loved the army.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,980
He wanted his uniform would
look super squared away.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,340
He followed all the rules
and regulations that,

13
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:55,170
and he supported the leadership all
the time when the leadership was right.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,280
And that's what makes him a good renegade,
in my opinion.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,390
And I was very much the same way.
I was all about the navy.

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,870
You know, I was all about the
games as a matter of fact, tone.

17
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:10,410
You know what Tony used to
say? Uh, it was a little thing.

18
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,260
We got going into you
bruiser that spread around.

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,100
But of course it came from Tony First,
which was all navy all the time.

20
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,000
We'd just be joking
about, you know, I think,

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,160
I don't know what originally caused it,

22
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:28,161
but like guys would make fun of me because
I would wear like jungle boots or Dan

23
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:31,920
or boots out too on liberty with
a clear of like old jeans. Yeah.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,870
Cause when you're, when you're like that
kind of old just raised in the teams,

25
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,790
you don't even know any
different and you're like,

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,850
oh well I'm going out and I need to wear
shoes. Cool. Where's my jungle boots?

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,510
That's what you end up like and
you're into it. You're not like,

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,450
you think it's good. You think it's
normal. Like this is the way things are.

29
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,930
And so I supported the teams and
hacks supported the army of course.

30
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,980
But this is the thing,

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,610
if the leadership was wrong or there
was something being passed down that was

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,360
wrong and it was a big wrong,
like if it was a little,

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,300
I wouldn't be like, Oh man, this is crap.

34
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:10,920
They're making us wear different parish
shorts now. Cause like that would happen,

35
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,750
like some new commanding officer would
come in and change some thing. Right.

36
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,610
And some we go to do that where it's like,
dude, be quiet, you know, just be quiet.

37
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,250
Do you know they're giving you new
shorts where the new shorts, you know,

38
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:26,400
oh they're telling us we can't wear
baseball hats anymore. Cool. Don't worry.

39
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:30,000
Baseball hats. And some guys
would go up there. It's who cares?

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,430
It's like they don't care what
I'm wearing on my head. You know,

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,400
like oh you want to issue a different
ball caps are find whatever.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,480
But then if it was a larger issue then
or obviously if it was something that was

43
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,380
like actually wrong,

44
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,530
like criminally wrong or morally wrong
or something like that, then yeah,

45
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,570
I'd be like, no, we can't do that.

46
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,290
So the reason that I didn't push back
on Iraqi troops in working with Iraqi

47
00:02:55,951 --> 00:03:00,010
troops when we got to Ramadi
was because as I looked at it,

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,050
I realized that it was the
right thing to do. And yes,

49
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,550
it was going to be more dangerous.
And yes,

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,550
a definitely took us
out of our comfort zone.

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
But as I explained in extreme ownership,

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,820
if we didn't train those people up,

53
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,030
if we didn't train the Iraqi soldiers
and take them out and get them fighting

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,490
and get them squared
away on the battlefield,

55
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,540
then Americans would have
been doing it forever.

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,750
So it was the correct call was to do that.

57
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,790
Now I've, I've talked
about the same, same thing.

58
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,860
When they told us our ratio,

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,580
they gave us a ratio of how many Iraqis
we had to have for every one Iraqi we

60
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:43,070
had to have, I don't know what their,
I forget what the number was, seven or,

61
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,290
or for every one seal we had
to have seven Iraqi soldiers.

62
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,150
They said that something like that.

63
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,740
I forget what the numbers were and I said,
no,

64
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,080
that doesn't make sense to us because
sometimes we only have 10 guys to go out

65
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,300
and there's no way I'm sending only one
seal with 10 Iraqi soldiers not doing it.

66
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,390
Need a corpsman,

67
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,790
need to radiomen need machine
gunner need a leader like that.

68
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,740
That's what I need.
So,

69
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,520
and when I pushed back because I didn't
push back against ball caps and because

70
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,420
I didn't push back against
some stupid uniform change,

71
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,540
they were like, oh yeah, well
that actually makes sense Jocko.

72
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,820
We don't want you to go on
the field with only one seal.

73
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,830
So I would clearly push back if it
was something that didn't make sense.

74
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,650
Same thing with like the martial arts
training that they had us doing in the,

75
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:33,820
in the late nineties and early
two thousands. It was not good.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,900
And I was told everyone, hey, this
is not smart. This is not good.

77
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,810
This training is dumb. We need to do
other training that's better. Uh, and,

78
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,330
and same thing, you know, things go, oh,

79
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:51,100
like here's another like stupid example,
they wouldn't want to issue a platoon.

80
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,060
The radio was you were going to take on
deployment because they didn't want you

81
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,300
to break them or whatever.
And so the issue,

82
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,370
not enough radios for everyone.

83
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:03,160
And so now everyone doesn't know how to
operate the radios and you're basically

84
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,280
operationally testing the radios while
you're going through your workup.

85
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,570
So I said, hey, this is garbage issue,
everyone radios, if that's how we operate,

86
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,360
that's how we need to train.
Gotcha.

87
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,710
So in the training they
wouldn't issue the radios. Yeah,

88
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,980
there was a time period where
we low on radio and they said,

89
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,720
we're going to keep these radios for
deployment. It's, that doesn't make sense.

90
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,620
I got a good idea by more
radios. Uh, so, you know,

91
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,270
those were things I pushed back on it.

92
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,480
And you are always pushing back on the
type of training that was going to happen

93
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:32,620
and who was going to be, how you're
going to run the training. So, um,

94
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,780
when something,
when it made sense to push back,

95
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,150
I pushed back just like Hackworth did.

96
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:43,390
Now Hackworth did it on a massive scale
because he eventually pushed back on the

97
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,340
way the war in Vietnam was being run.

98
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,240
And had I been smart enough and the war
didn't take the shift that it took and

99
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:55,360
we didn't move towards counter insurgency
and we didn't make those adjustments

100
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:59,870
that the, that Colonel Mcfarland
implemented in Ramadi. Maybe.

101
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,020
Maybe. I doubt it. Maybe I would
have been smarter to say, Hey,

102
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,130
we're not running this war,
right.

103
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,590
We need to do something different
and run up the chain of command. But,

104
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,480
but at the time, you know, Colonel
Mcfarland made great decisions. He led,

105
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,330
he had a great plan, a great strategy,
so I was a hundred percent onboard. Um,

106
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,840
but if you don't Hackworth,
that didn't happen.

107
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,230
They were not fighting correctly
against the Vietnamese and,

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,750
and they were taking massive casualties
for a hill that two days later they'd

109
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,500
give back. And so he was saying, what
are you doing? And, and the other thing,

110
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,180
you know,
when he took over the hardcore battalion,

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,260
they were fighting for
months and they had,

112
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,430
they literally killed almost no editing.
I think it was zero.

113
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,900
I think it was actually zero enemy.

114
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,520
And yet they had taken all kinds of
casualties themselves. And so he's saying,

115
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,730
this is wrong, this is
wrong. So I think that's,

116
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,650
that's what being a leader is. You support
the stuff, you support the command.

117
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,280
Yes,

118
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,490
of course you support the command when
it makes sense and as long as it makes

119
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:01,040
sense. And normally it's gonna
make sense. You know what I mean?

120
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,570
Normally it's to make sense,
not like the,

121
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,420
the admirals and the generals are
saying, hey, how can we lose this war?

122
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:08,060
Let's come up with a stupid strategy.
No, they're doing the best they can.

123
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,030
So it's not like it's a regular
occurrence. I mean, like I said,

124
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,510
when I was working for Carter,
Colonel Mcfarland, he was a smart guy.

125
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,320
He was a brilliant guy that had a great
strategy of I'm like, okay, awesome.

126
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm here to support. Um, and, and
I'll tell you when I did, and this is,

127
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:23,810
I think this is important,

128
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,700
is that even though I was kind of a
renegade and hours more rebellious when I

129
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:32,750
was a kid, obviously I was, uh, I was
young when I got the seal teams then. So,

130
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,930
you know, we would push the, all those
things that I said, oh, we gotta do this.

131
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,230
That was me when I was at e four
in the seal teams. You know,

132
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,530
where do we go do that? We should
just be able to do whatever we want.

133
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,560
We were just stupid.
But as I got older,

134
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,310
I realized that you need to,
you know,

135
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,660
come across as a renegade quote unquote,
to come across as a big rebel.

136
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,510
That doesn't, well, immediately when
you go and push back on something,

137
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,420
everyone just dismisses you. Oh yeah,
Jocko. He's just a loud mouth. He just,

138
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,400
he just pushed back against
everything he doesn't want.

139
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:04,310
He's wanting to do everything his
way. No. You want them to say, Oh wow,

140
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,420
hold on a second. If Jocko is
pushing back against this, then this,

141
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,510
this must be something wrong here because
he doesn't push back against stuff.

142
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,670
He tells the line all the time,
so we should listen to them.

143
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,470
That's what you want to build.

144
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,650
That's what I did my best to build and
that's how I think it would be comparable

145
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,280
to the way Hackworth led
and the way that I try to,

146
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,960
obviously I know Hackworth,
but I stole as much as I could from him.

147
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,780
And the weird thing is, I'll tell you
this, I always say I stole from him,

148
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,130
but it wasn't like I was sitting
there reading the book and go,

149
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,550
I'm going to do what he did here.
I think it was just absorbed.

150
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:45,380
And even even the naming of task
unit bruiser like when I did it,

151
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,920
I wasn't thinking this
is what Hackworth did,

152
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,380
but it was real obvious that
that's where I got it from.

153
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,290
Like I didn't think I'm going to rename
this and you were going to turn this

154
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,040
thing around based order
would not turn it around,

155
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,280
but we're gonna build this based
on no, I was like, you know what,

156
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:02,460
we're not going to be Task Unit
Bravo cause that sounds lame.

157
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,060
Or It'd be tasking bruiser because
that sounds awesome. You and,

158
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,630
and then later, you know, as I look
back I'm like, Oh God, that's what,

159
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,910
that's exactly what Hackworth did.
I obviously stole it from him. Yeah.

160
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,710
So appreciate it hack.
But that's what I'd say be a renegade.

161
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,520
But that's should be,
that should be in the background.

162
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,190
That should be in the back of your mind,
in the front of your mind. Should be, hey,

163
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:25,910
I'm a, I'm a supporter of
what's happening. Yeah.

164
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,440
Kind of like the willingness to be a rent
or any gate if you have to. Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,020
If you have to,
and believe me,

166
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:37,910
I've known all kinds of good
seals that were to renegade. Yeah.

167
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,190
Just like I'm rns. Yeah. They're just
straight up, hey, I'm a renegade. And,

168
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,810
and you know that just, it the only
guys that could get away with that.

169
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,670
Well guys that were so ultimately
operationally squared away. Yeah.

170
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,760
That people go, yeah, you know, he's
kind of a maniac, but dude, he's really,

171
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,230
really good and really tactically
sound and all that. And they could,

172
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,550
they make that happen.
Now as you get more and more senior,

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,690
the homie don't play like that
before or after a certain point,

174
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,630
it's done and you got to get,
you've got to play the game.

175
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,850
That's what you gotta do. As you get
more senior, you gotta play the game.

176
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,950
And from like your subordinates viewpoint,
if if they looked at me and go,

177
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:18,720
oh, jock was just playing the game.
He's just doing, yes, I am. Yes I am.

178
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,340
Because this way it gives me more ability
to control everything that's going to

179
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:26,490
impact you. People that
work for me. So yes,

180
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:29,730
I'm going to play the game so you
don't have to. You're welcome.
