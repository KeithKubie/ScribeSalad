Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience mean easy to live with. But it's interesting that this is like this game of like, okay, let's look at watches. There's no real improvement in performance, right? I mean they're beautiful and, but I mean the performance difference between now and 10 years ago is not clear. Yeah. In a mechanical watch. No, I mean it's their watch. There's artistry and there's technological complication. I mean it's, there's complication for the sake of complications. So they'll have watches like to use a car example, imagine a car. Okay. And from the outside it looks roughly like a normal car, right? Four, four wheels on the driver's seat, right? It has one engine and it has four transmissions coming off of that engine, all of which come back together to make it the car. One wheel drive. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:57          right. Imagine that applied to a watch. So it'll be like one main movement that goes out into four gear trains and then comes back into just an hour and a minute hand. Well, why would you sync up for gear trains when you could do the same thing with one? And it's like, well, because we can, it would be like building a car with two engines. Like that's not smart, but you do it just be like, Hey, I built a fucking car with two engine Les, you're talking about like the NSX engine. We, you're the front engine for the electric. Exactly. Exactly. But I think what I'm getting at is that with computers and with cars, those are the one thing that you expect an improvement every year. Yeah. Just that nobody's going to accept the old way. Like you can't just build unless you're singer and you making something custom. Well that's that the singer is what that example is, what the mechanical watch kind of industry is.

Speaker 1:          01:52          You know, they, they position it as a luxury item from a time gone by sort of thing. You know? Whereas actually if you want to talk about innovation, this right here is a grand Seiko, which has a movement called a spring drive movement in it. And it is one of the most advanced and unique mechanical movements available in a watch today. So this is a Seiko, it's a grand Seiko, which is, so the difference is uh, it's like, think about a Lexus. Think about Alexis. A Seiko is a Lexus, not a Toyota. This is a Lexus LFA. This is a grand Seiko is built in a different factory from the regular Seikos. It's built by hand, completely by hand, all hand finished, hand polished. It's built of exotic materials. It has a cool movement. Dude. You should sell watches or watch podcasts, but watching, listen, it's on YouTube, but you see I have what is called the display back on this.

Speaker 1:          02:51          So you can see the movement in the back and how high the level of finishes. And you've got Sapphire, titanium and um, so the spring drive movement is without getting crazy crazy nerdy about it. Is, is actually a true innovation in mechanical watchmaking. So run the chronograph, it's on the front. The top button not here at you watch the, the sweep of the chronograph hand, the big second hand, you get a perfectly smooth sweep. The smoothest possible sweep that there could be. It is, it is, it is, it is. How much does the watch like this worth? Around 10,000 yeah. Mazing yeah. God. But it's watch $300. Well that's cause you know G shocks are the shit dude. 300 bucks. G shocks are awesome as far as like I'm a light. No, but it hasn't, but it's polished so that it can see it in the dark date.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Motherfucker. Look dude, G shocks are dope. A G shock is a watch guys tool watch like highly functional, durable. Um, a G shock is a total watch. Guys watch, you can get G shocks that are like $5,000. You know what? Yeah, they have dude, Jamie look up a $5,000 G shock. That's um, that right there. Hold that up. That's Sean Warren Ward's own design. That's cool. It's amazing as I think it's based on the Duesberg. Yeah. Duesenberg gauge cluster. The watch is called the doozy and it's, it's got a complication on it called the jump. Our complication. So the, it's a basically just a black face almost looks like a bathroom scale and it's got two windows hours on top minutes on the bottom and the minutes sweep by slowly. Whereas the hours do not suite by slowly at 59 and 59 seconds. The hours click over right fast.

Speaker 1:          04:41          So it's a jump power as opposed to a slow moving hour. Now he designed the look or did he design the internals? He designed the look, the face, the complications and he worked with a Swiss watch maker to design an actual unique movement to use for this watch. He designed the case and that's crazy. It is awesome. And that watch is 12 grand. I was making 50 of them. I believe it. He tried to use the face in that a Vantaa black shit. What does that Phantom black is the darkest, the blackest black that has ever existed. Oh, I saw they painted a building with it. It looks like a negative space, dude. Get a picture of to black. It doesn't look real and it's the most black that that, that that's something painted in Vantaa black. Whoa. It's so black that it absorbs all light and you can't even wait. Can you paint a car in that you could accept in the environmentally? It's not. It's not a good thing. Fuck the penguins. Oh, whoever's going to die apparently to me black G wagon. Oh fucks bro. I need my G wagon. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:52          has the Vantaa has Vantaa black and of course it does and it's, you'll see it's $95,000 and the Vantaa black is just the black background. When you said $95,000 my balls hurt. Me and my balls go like this. They went, bro. They got watches that are $1 million. There's $1 million. You can buy $1 million watches right now. 300 bucks. G shock dude. There's a watch called the Jacob astronomy that is like wearing like a Sapphire fishbowl on your fucking hand. I swear. It's the craziest shit you've ever seen. It's so ridiculous. It's like Liberace. The oil sheet, Zay and Jamie top right picture there. See this as a gold case. That's a Sapphire case. The whole thing. What if you bump into something, it's shattered on your hands. That's so stupid. Well, glass was not glass. It's Sapphire Cinderella motherfucker. The whole case is milled from a block of Sapphire.

Speaker 1:          06:51          The whole case can go fuck itself. Seriously. It's $1 million you deserve. You deserve that thing to break. That's crazy looking. It's hilarious, right? That's $1 million watch. Earth is the earth. The, the planets are spinning around, spin around and you can find a video of it moving. It's nuts. Look at the stars. Oh, it's kinda like a roll of you drove your rolls Royce. It would match our watch. You'd be like, Whoa, Whoa. You could coordinate this guy with your star field ceiling dude. That is a small earth. That's crazy. And it's, it literally has the continents and silver and then some blue star thing. What is the water made out of? You think it's gotta be like, I so idea anodized something, but then there's a diamond, a son on the other side of my God, there's a ball at diamond ball that spins or some of them have different, different, uh, stuff on them too, that that's just one ball or you have to be to be sporting $1 million water.

Speaker 1:          07:48          That one's got up, that one's got a central, let me check the time on my million dollar mother fucking watch. It's crazy. Right? That's crazy. There's some rich people doing some really, really weird rich people things right now. That seems preposterous. That thing with all the diamonds in the bucket diamonds, that's like some steam, punk, futuristic, but like, it's weird. Even more so than you know, cars. It's like, cause a car, it's like, okay, you got a thousand dollar car cut $10,000 car, $100,000 Carmen. Like when you use the zoom in really close, that's the computer version because that's not, Oh, it's CGI, but that is pretty much what you get astrological signs there. Oh my God. What is that the red made out of? That's like Amber something. Oh, probably Ruby. The sons a Ruby. It's probably Ruby. The sun's probably a yellow diamond mother fucker.

Speaker 1:          08:43          That is incredible. I don't get it, but I get it. I know you must've. I'm able to appreciate that someone is making a machine that fits in a little fishbowl on your wrist. Look at that it again and look. I mean look on top of the crazy artistry of this and the ridiculous price and the jewels and all that stuff. The mathematics of that machine work. That is not, that's not just like that for nothing. That does like moon phase. You know the what sat astrological sign. It is. There is an actual function. Look at that one with the dredge dragon in it. You gotta be fucking kidding me. It looks like something to come out of a little kid's gumball. It's so crazy. Right? Go scroll up. That's amazing. Looking. Scroll up to the other images though that they had those three watches together.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Look at you ever. Look how good those things look. I mean, that is, that is a crazy thing to have on your arm. It's so crazy, right? But that's $1 million. And if you see someone wearing one in person, it's, it's big. It's, it's like, it's like the size of, you know that that Ganny lid coffee mug in your hands. It's so big. There's really, people are there actually, I mean you'd be shocked at what people are doing with certain, with machinery and watt and mechanical watchmaker wouldn't be mercies. It's like the fight against friction is the whole thing, right? You've got this tiny little spring and you need to get as much power out of it as possible. So they engineer these like micro grams of friction out of this stuff. So they they let's not ER work the fuck is that star Trek? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:18          And uh, Whoa. That's pretty, yeah, I think it was the lid liquids closed. It looks like an egg star Trek communicator. Now how much does something like that go for, let's call it 50 or 60 Oh, sorry. I was going to, yes, I was going to get higher. I was going to get 75 I think you can get different versions of it that are, don't hold me to the price. It's expensive, but what do you think it cost Jamie? Take 75 yeah, that's what I was saying. 75 let's top the top article should have it. The hoe dinky article usually has the price. If you scroll down to the bottom of that article, it should have it. That's it closed right there. So you can read the time when it's closed. So that on that watch it's eight 27 Oh yeah. And what does it look like when it's closed?

Speaker 1:          11:00          Go, go up. That's close, right? That's closed. Yeah. And then that's another version of different tops. Yeah, the clear top or the the or the metallic one. And then there's a carbon back and that's a pretty watch. Yeah, it's pretty looking. If you scroll all the way down, it should say the price. No, 68,000 there you go. Fucking expensive. It's, there's some wild stuff. There's a company called H, Y. T that is, that makes watches that have a liquid that moves around and it tells you the time based on like almost like a thermometer. The liquid goes up to this level. There's a watched by a company called Devin, D. E. V. O. N. it's a belt driven watch where you have like a series of conveyor belts on your wrist. There's the HYC. So the green, the green liquid goes around the dial. Ah, yeah. It's like a nuclear ooze that like flows through the dial.

Speaker 1:          11:55          Yeah. So it, it changes depending upon the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that, that GU like it flows. Go back to the one with the green goo on the top left there. So all my light fills up around the dial and then it is when it goes all the way around. Is it a minute? Ain't no, it's an hour. That belief. Amazing. It's awesome. Right? That's amazing. You looked down and that's how you know where it is in the hour. And then it had a, it had a typical hour hand. Yeah. And then this one, it flows around the skull. Dude. This something like that costs a hundred grand or something. Geez. Actual Rose is actually sponsored by them. Believe it or not. It works. Right? It's on brand for him. I think this is about a hundred grand. So when you say sponsored, like what do they do to get axle to wear?

Speaker 1:          12:40          He wears one. Yeah. I follow these dumb watch spotter Instagram accounts. They sell for upwards of 50,000 so I think it's more than that. But yeah, 50 or 75 yeah, they're expensive man. It's David Cross selling watches. 285,000 days. Three particular ultra light high-end model. Which one's that one? But it's there's, you know, there's some materials in this stuff there. They use crazy forged carbon there. Well I'm 95 grand used for a skull one. Yep. Ooh, let me see that. That's pretty, Oh bear real crazy. I mean it's, you can get lost in this stuff. I mean the machinery of it and the materials. Do you think the, the liquid is that goes around that fuck? I dunno. They may have a different picture with a different liquid. So that's how the minutes go. Yeah. And then there was an allies, so crazy the press that, let's see, here's the liquors, the liquid going so cool.

Speaker 1:          13:41          That is fucking dope. I just, I love the fact that people are so creative, they can figure out how to do things like this on something like a watch. So you look at the look of the red dude going around the skull. Ah, isn't that awesome? Oh my God. I'm in love with it. It's so cool. It's amazing. I'm in love with this. And then look, it goes back, it goes back, but it goes back quick. It goes back quick and resets. Oh wow. Yeah. Eyes fill up when it goes back. Oh, you gotta be kidding. Oh my God. That's some really next level. Like there's bellows and pumps and it's like pumping like liquid around dude. Right. I had no idea. Yeah, I know. I did. People were doing this dude. People are doing crazy things that is fucking bad. Like on a more, so that's really crazy. It's like, so I have a watch that is called the perpetual calendar, which is like a traditional complicated watch. So it does day of the week, date of the month, month of the year, four digit year moon phase. Power reserve. Okay. And the time obviously, and it has all of those functions. And if you, if you keep the watch running, you know it's mechanical, you've got to keep it wound up. If you keep it wound and running, it will be accurate for all of us.
