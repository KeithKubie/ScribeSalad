00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:10.633
While touring the remains of
ancient Alexandria, Egypt,

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:13.983
there are a few things that
present-day explorers should look for.

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:17.062
First, as you travel along 
the Great Harbor,

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:20.923
keep your eyes open 
for large columns and statues.

00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:25.923
Across the bay to your left is the island
where the Great Lighthouse once stood.

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.043
And as you make your way through
the palaces of the Royal Quarter

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:32.323
and reach the area where
the Library of Alexandria once stood,

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:35.321
keep your eyes open for sharks.

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:38.040
Because if you visit this section
of Alexandria,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.685
you'll be fifteen feet deep
in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:44.845
Though people are most familiar
with Plato's fictional Atlantis,

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.453
many real underwater cities 
actually exist.

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:50.192
Places like Alexandria,

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:51.823
Port Royal, Jamaica,

00:00:51.823 --> 00:00:54.334
and Pavlopetri, Greece.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.385
Sunken cities are studied by scientists

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:58.754
to help us understand the lives
of our ancestors,

00:00:58.754 --> 00:01:00.811
the dynamic nature of our planet,

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:03.913
and the impact of each on the other.

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:07.113
Water is essential for life,
food sources, and transport,

00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:11.423
so many cities have been built
along coast lines and river banks.

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:14.623
However, these benefits also come
with risks

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:19.254
because natural forces that can sink
a city are at their doorstep.

00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:22.394
Take, for instance, an earthquake.

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:27.973
June 7, 1692 seemed like a normal morning
in Port Royal, Jamaica,

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:31.124
then one of the richest ports 
in the world,

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.545
but when a massive earthquake struck,

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:38.064
two-thirds of Port Royal immediately
sank to its rooftops.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.514
Today, many buildings 
and elements of everyday life

00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:45.086
remain surprisingly intact 
on the sea floor, frozen in time.

00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:49.483
That includes a 300-year-old pocket watch
that stopped at 11:43,

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:53.624
the moment Port Royal slipped
beneath the Carribean.

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:56.896
And during the winter of 373 BCE,

00:01:56.896 --> 00:02:00.665
the Greek city of Helike was struck
by an earthquake so strong

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:04.915
that it liquefied the sandy ground
upon which the city was built.

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:07.145
Minutes later, a tsunami struck the city,

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:12.355
and Helike and its inhabitants
sunk downwards into the Mediterranean Sea.

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:16.216
Centuries later, Roman tourists would sail
on the lagoon that formed

00:02:16.216 --> 00:02:19.226
and peer down at the city's remains.

00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:21.726
Earthquakes are sudden, 
unpredictable disasters

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:24.434
that have drowned cities in an instant.

00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:26.416
Luckily, however, throughout history,

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:30.796
the majority of sunken cities were not
submerged by a single cataclysmic event,

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:34.416
but by a combination 
of more gradual processes.

00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:37.886
For instance, Pavlopetri,
the oldest known sunken city,

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:42.058
was built on the southern coastline
of Greece 5,000 years ago.

00:02:42.058 --> 00:02:44.150
It's an example of a city
that was submerged

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.233
due to what is called 
isostatic sea level change.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.967
18,000 years ago when the Ice Age ended,

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:55.547
glaciers began melting and the sea level
rose globally until about 5,000 years ago.

00:02:55.547 --> 00:02:59.808
Isostatic sea level change isn't caused
by that melt water,

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:02.886
but rather the Earth's crust slowly
springing back

00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:05.215
from the released weight of the glaciers,

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:09.186
making some places rise,
and others sink.

00:03:09.186 --> 00:03:12.118
The ground around Pavlopetri
is still sinking

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:14.985
at an average rate 
of a millimeter per year.

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:18.295
But the ancient inhabitants were able
to move gradually inland

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:19.677
over several generations

00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:24.111
before they finally abandoned the city
about 3,000 years ago.

00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.386
Today, divers swim over the streets
of Pavlopetri

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:29.238
and peer through ancient door jams

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:32.850
into the foundations of houses 
and community buildings.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.441
They learn about the people who lived
there by observing what they left behind.

00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:40.518
Natural geological events,
such as earthquakes and tsunamis,

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:42.372
will continue to shape our continents,

00:03:42.372 --> 00:03:45.218
just as they have for millions of years.

00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:49.288
As increased global warming melts
our polar ice caps at accelerated rates

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:50.578
and sea levels rise,

00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:52.398
we will be forced to adapt,

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.019
like Pavlopetri's inhabitants.

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.040
Undoubtedly, over the coming centuries,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.499
some of the coastal areas 
that we live in today

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.858
will eventually be claimed 
by the water, too -

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.840
cities like Venice,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.808
New Orleans,

00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:05.710
Amsterdam,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.658
Miami,

00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:08.189
and Tokyo.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.139
Imagine what future civilizations
will learn about us

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.930
as they swim around the ancient ruins
of the cities that we live in today.
