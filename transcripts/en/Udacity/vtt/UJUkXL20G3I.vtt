00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here I've written a slightly more complicated grammar

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that actually describes part of Python.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We can make assignment statements--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
stmt is a common abbreviation for statements--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by assigning to an identifier an expression value.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Using the rules for identifier and number and +, - and =

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that we've established previously, I've written down 4 possible utterances.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The question for you, multiple, multiple choice,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is which of these are statements according to this grammar?

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
