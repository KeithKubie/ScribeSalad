[ music ]

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.937
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:09.937 --> 00:00:11.477
Tonight is.. what?

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:15.328
Family movie night!

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:17.612
Very good, what are we going to watch tonight?

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:18.659
What is this?

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.290
Nemo!

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.613
OK let's go.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.458
What happened to the mommy?

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.309
He didn't.. he got ate, maybe.

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:31.063
She did.

00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:33.323
[ Destin laughs ]

00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:34.632
She really did.

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:38.027
(Destin) Did you enjoy Finding Nemo?

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:38.805
Yeah.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.935
I have something to tell you.

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:40.772
What?

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:42.528
The movie is wrong.

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:43.659
Why?

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.259
The movie is wrong, did you know that?

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.105
No.

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:50.591
Mommy and daddy actually found Nemo in real life, didn't we.

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:51.501
We did.

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:52.818
Do you wanna see?

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:53.524
Yep.

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:54.818
OK lemme show you.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:01:00.032
[ scuba breathing ]

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.154
Oh!

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:09.424
It's Nemo!

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.921
A clown fish.

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:14.941
Doesn't he live in the anemone?

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.763
Doesn't he live inside the anemone?

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:20.427
Tell me about him.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:35.046
These are your anemone fish. They're not the same species as the one in Finding Nemo, but again they live within the anemone and they basically use the anemone for protection.

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:37.993
There's a couple of really cool things about them.

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:43.796
Is the biggest one will be the female, and the little one's the male.

00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:51.383
Now if the big one dies, like it does in Finding Nemo, the little one which is the male will turn into a female,

00:01:51.383 --> 00:01:57.203
so what should have happened in Finding Nemo is Marlin at the end should have become Mrs Marlin,

00:01:57.203 --> 00:02:01.534
but he didn't, because that would just muck around with kids brains way too much.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:06.369
But the neat thing is they live in these anemones but they don't get stung.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.234
Now the anemone is related to corals, they have these stinging organelles with venom,

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:15.464
and what happens is we think the anemone fish pick up mucous.

00:02:15.464 --> 00:02:22.271
The mucous covers the outside of them and the anemone thinks the anemone fish is part of the anemone,

00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:25.123
so they don't sting it. So it's a symbiotic relationship.

00:02:25.123 --> 00:02:31.712
The anemone protects the fish, the fish come out and protect things that try and eat the anemone.

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:36.200
Now these guys lay eggs, so they'll lay eggs every 2 or 3 weeks.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.625
The male, which is the little one, will come out and protect them, they'll hatch and away they'll go again.

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:50.974
Really really cool animals, but remember the big one is always the female, the little one's the male, if the big one dies, the male turns into a female.

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:53.110
Seriously cool animals.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.808
(Destin) Sweet, that's awesome.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.442
Did you guys hear what he said?

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:01.956
No, I can't understand. They're in scuba gear.

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.117
What?

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:06.098
They're in scuba.. There's so much [ fsssssh ].

00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:08.575
That's me breathing underwater. So here's how it works.

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:14.415
All anemone fish are boys when they're born, but one of these fish is more aggressive than the other ones.

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:18.521
In fact he's so mean that he becomes a mommy fish.

00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.937
[ laughs ]  Yeah, yeah.. that mean Mommy

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:30.122
That's right, OK so this mommy fish pesters the daddy fish so much that she stresses him out, that he starts shaking, he gets scared,

00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:34.045
and he stays in the anemone and he watches the baby eggs. Did you know that?

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:35.362
Yep.

00:03:35.362 --> 00:03:37.867
But, did you know what happens in real life?

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:50.891
Something strange. If the mommy fish dies, then she doesn't stress out the daddy fish any more and the daddy fish has this unique thing that'll happen to his body and he'll turn into a mommy fish.

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:55.169
[ laughs ]

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.466
Did you know that?

00:03:56.466 --> 00:04:01.012
[ laughing ] No no no bite.. mommy pish... no bite.

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:09.358
That's right, so a mommy fish is actually a daddy fish that turned into a mommy fish, did you know that?

00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:10.862
Woooah!

00:04:10.862 --> 00:04:11.802
Isn't that crazy?

00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:14.251
Nom! [ How he says yes ].

00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:22.625
So if the movie was correct, Marlin the daddy would turn into a mommy fish. [ laughs ]

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.664
Now you know.

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:26.110
It would be pretty funny if that happened in the movie.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.884
It'd be strange wouldn't it.

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:29.248
Awkward.

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:36.114
OK to sum it up, Nemo is what's called a sequential hermaphrodite, meaning he can change his gender half way through his life, which is pretty impressive.

00:04:36.114 --> 00:04:40.479
But not as impressive as the book that the character Nemo came from.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.418
The original one.

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:43.054
You know what that's called buddy? The one we listened to?

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:45.119
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.720
That's right, where did we listen to that together?

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.792
In the car.

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:53.875
That's right. We listened to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. It's something we downloaded from Audible which is a sponsor for Smarter Every Day.

00:04:53.875 --> 00:05:01.684
So if you're interested in helping Smarter Every Day, go download 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by going to audible.com/smarter. You will not regret it.

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:06.231
It's a fantastic book, science fiction written in the 1860s, it's impressive.

00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:09.410
I recommend the one read by James Frain, it's fantastic.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.989
