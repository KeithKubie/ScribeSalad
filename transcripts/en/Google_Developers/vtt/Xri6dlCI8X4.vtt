STEVE BAZYL: Hi everyone, and
welcome to this week's Google

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.185
Developers Live for
Google Drive.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.910
I'm Steven Bazyl and today I
want to talk to you about a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.200
topic which hasn't affected
everyone who's using the Drive

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.580
SDK, but there is a certain
segment of the developer

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.760
audience that this is
really important to.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.369
And specifically I want to talk
about a feature that used

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.010
to be in the Documents List API
that was removed when we

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.960
changed that over to
the Drive API.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.580
And this is the presence of
email addresses in the

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.190
permissions feed.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.260
This change was made when we did
the Drive API basically to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.520
protect user privacy.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.320
There are some cases where that
potentially could leak

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.350
information to collaborators on
a document such as, I share

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.380
a file with you and a
few other people.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.600
I know your email address, but
those other people on the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.494
document may not know
you, they may not

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:05.860
know your email address.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.260
And since they have access to
the file, they can use the API

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.900
to read information and we
don't want to leak that

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.630
information.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.420
There's also some other
cases where--

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.450
in the future we may do things
like allow somebody to share a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.220
doc to Google+ circle.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.320
And that's cases where you may
have people in your circles

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.890
who you never knew their email
address in the first place.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.260
And so email as a primary
identifier for the users in

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.060
terms of permissions
over the years has

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.360
become just less important.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.880
That said, there are some really
important cases where

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.900
that information is useful.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.560
And this is particularly
for enterprise cases.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.620
There are a lot of applications
that do auditing,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.620
data loss prevention.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.650
Even if you're just building
a collaboration app and you

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.350
happen to have some social
features in your application

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.690
and your app uses email
addresses, being able to map

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.680
the ACLs and the collaborators
on a document to your users

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.530
via email is actually pretty
useful in a lot of

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.470
circumstances.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.420
So it's been out of the Drive
SDK for a while, but we've

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.230
heard a lot of these different
use cases from developers and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.210
have started to restore some
of those features.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.430
Before anyone gets too happy,
there are going to be some

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.370
restrictions when this
is fully rolled out.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.980
There are cases when we will
be able to give you back an

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.700
email address for a collaborator
in the API.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.570
And this is actually already
available in the Drive SDK.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.420
So specifically, if the user's
profile, in fact, their Google

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.290
profile permits you as a viewer
to see their email

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.320
address, the Drive API will
honor that setting and return

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.580
back the email address
for that user.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.700
And of course, you can
always see your own

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.990
email address as well.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.860
For collaborative apps, project
management, this is

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.170
actually a pretty reasonable
setting.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.100
It respects user privacy
while still giving you

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.120
some of those features.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.630
And there's another feature I'll
talk a little bit about

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.720
more that you can use to close
some of those gaps where if

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.840
you already know somebody's
email address but they choose

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.230
not to share it, there
actually is a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.210
way to handle that.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.480
We'll talk about that in
just a few minutes.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.290
And there's some other cases
where we can return email

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.520
addresses as well.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.690
Not all of these are live in
production, but things like

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.030
collaborators within an
organization, a Google Apps

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.560
domain, for example.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.400
If the domain administrator
chooses to enable that, we can

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.490
share out some details.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.120
Again, that's not something
that's live today, but ability

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.590
to return email addresses is
there and it will become more

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.690
visible to applications as some
of those policy pieces

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.828
are put into place.

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:53.510
An interim piece as well is even
though we can't return

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.500
back to the full email address
of user, we will always return

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.320
back the domain portion.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.760
So this is not a unique
identifier for the user, but

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.410
for cases such as data loss
prevention or you're doing

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.020
auditing for a Google Apps
domain, it does give you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.910
information about whether or not
that collaborator is part

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.110
of your organization or somebody
who's outside.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.420
And I'll actually
show you this.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.910
I'm going to set you over
to the APIs console.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.340
And I just did a query here for
a document that I shared

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.920
out of my account.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.190
And it has two collaborators
on it.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.410
One as myself as the owner.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.930
And we can see here does return
back an email address,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.840
in this case, because
I can obviously

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.880
see my email address.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.080
I've taken advantage of Chrome
DevTools to sanitize this, but

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.900
my email address is not
all that secret

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.960
to begin with anyway.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.620
But then we can see another
collaborator here, which is

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.010
just my corporate account
at gooigle.com.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.110
And in this case, because I
haven't set my email address

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.890
to be visible by this account,
we don't see an email address.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.170
But we still see that this is
an account that is owned by

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.130
google.com and at least
gives me some idea of

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.220
who that person is.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.350
And again, you can use this
for auditing, data loss

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.550
prevention, and so on.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.590
So there's this ID field.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.230
So one of the things with the
permission IDs is these are

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.760
actually stable identifiers that
identify the target of

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.450
the permission, not necessarily

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.450
that permission itself.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.120
So this ID, this permission ID,
is actually an obfuscated

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.390
ID for my google.com account.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.330
And so basically for any
document I'm always going to

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.520
appear with that
particular ID.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.700
Likewise, for my personal
account, any time I'm

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.700
referencing a permission,
it will always

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.500
have that ID as well.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.710
So these are actually stable
identifiers that you can use

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.790
and store in your database to
map those to known accounts.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.760
So if you have a bunch of
people, you're building a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.400
collaboration app, as they
connect to Drive, you can

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.290
query the about feed or you can
look at a file that you

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.510
create and pull off the
permission ID and save that.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.910
So then that way any time that
you're trying to understand

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.630
what exactly the ACLs mean,
you can then just look up

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.680
those IDs against
your database.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.420
So there's one case that's not
caught by this feature alone,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.025
which is suppose you have a
set of users and you know

00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:24.040
their email addresses.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.920
So when they signed up you
collected it, they were happy

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.290
to share that with you.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.550
And maybe not all of
those users have

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.790
connected your app to Drive.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.290
Or even if they did, you may not
be able to get their email

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.060
addresses from that.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.240
There's actually a way that
given a known email address

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.160
you can actually look up
that permission ID.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.320
This is, again, not a feature
that is in prod yet, but

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.730
should be in the next couple
days to a week or so.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.280
But there's a new API method.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.420
This is Drive dot permissions
dot get ID for email.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.620
And it allows you to take a
known email address and

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.700
convert that into one of these
stable permission IDs.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.170
So in this case I just looked
up my corporate account.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.750
Again, I share my email address
pretty widely, so I'm

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.390
not hiding here.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.500
But what we got back down here
at the bottom is this ID.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.360
So you can see here it's
1251 blah, blah, blah.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.330
If we go back to the permission
on that file that

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.270
was shared to me, we can see the
ID here is that same ID.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.250
So basically this gives you a
one way path to take a user

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.010
where you know their email
address, can look up their ID,

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.880
and then use that as a way to
augment the information you

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.880
get back from our permissions
collection.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.110
If you're thinking about a data
loss prevention product

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.760
where you really need to have
these emails, you basically

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.740
use this as a way to backfill
information.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.150
So for the email addresses
that you know are trusted

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.340
collaborators with your
organization, you can go in a

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.230
background process, look up all
these email addresses and

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.490
find their IDs and save those.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.770
And if you were to encounter a
document where there was a

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.370
user who the domain portion was
outside your organization,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.790
the ID didn't map to anything
that your application knew

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.580
about, that would be a flag that
you would raise, and then

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.060
you can go and ask the document
owner, who is this

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.750
person that you shared with?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.830
Give me more information about
them and then you can take

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.780
appropriate actions.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.450
But the tools are there now,
at least mostly there, to

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.120
restore a lot of the use cases
that were previously possible

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.150
with the Documents List API
while still balancing those

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.320
against the need to protect the
privacy of users for those

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.600
who choose not to share
their email

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.419
addresses with other people.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.130
So hopefully for those that
this has really been a hot

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.920
topic for, and there are a
handful of developers that

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.320
have been asking for some
improvements here for a long

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.890
time, hopefully this will get
you back on track to where you

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:54.745
need to be.

00:08:54.745 --> 00:08:58.230
We certainly always welcome
your feedback on these

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.660
features and whether
or not these

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.630
actually meet your needs.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.480
But we're pretty confident
that this strikes a nice

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.340
balance between the needs
for applications and

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.440
administrators to understand who
documents are shared with

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.650
while still balancing
privacy needs.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.500
So that's all for today.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.270
We'll be back next
week as always.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.240
And if you do have any questions
on this, feel free

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.260
to reach out on our Google
Drive Developers

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.016
community on Google+.

00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:30.030
You can also ask questions on
