let's start by looking at connectivity

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:01.770
let's start by looking at connectivity
 

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.549
let's start by looking at connectivity
in order to optimize for unreliable or

00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559
in order to optimize for unreliable or
 

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.799
in order to optimize for unreliable or
intermittent connectivity ensure that

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:06.809
intermittent connectivity ensure that
 

00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:09.370

cached data let's talk about devices

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:27.530
cached data let's talk about devices
 

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.380
cached data let's talk about devices
many devices in emerging markets have

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:30.390
many devices in emerging markets have
 

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.650
many devices in emerging markets have
smaller lower resolution screens in

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:33.660
smaller lower resolution screens in
 

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.510
smaller lower resolution screens in
order to ensure a seamless user

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520
order to ensure a seamless user
 

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.790
order to ensure a seamless user
experience across devices use

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:37.800

let's talk about data cost the first

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:00.210
let's talk about data cost the first
 

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.450
let's talk about data cost the first
cost your users will incur will be

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460
cost your users will incur will be
 

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.070
cost your users will incur will be
related to the cost of installation of

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080
related to the cost of installation of
 

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.620
related to the cost of installation of
your app and therefore it's important to

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:06.630
your app and therefore it's important to
 

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.590
your app and therefore it's important to
keep a tight focus on reducing the apk

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600
keep a tight focus on reducing the apk
 

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:09.890
keep a tight focus on reducing the apk
size

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900

ideally well below 10 megabytes in order

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:14.040
ideally well below 10 megabytes in order
 

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.730
ideally well below 10 megabytes in order
to accomplish this you should reduce the

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740
to accomplish this you should reduce the
 

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.580
to accomplish this you should reduce the
number and size of images within the apk

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:19.590
number and size of images within the apk
 

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.190
number and size of images within the apk
using tools like WebP II and scalable

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200
using tools like WebP II and scalable
 

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.640
using tools like WebP II and scalable
vector graphics or SVG you can shrink

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:25.650
vector graphics or SVG you can shrink
 

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.680
vector graphics or SVG you can shrink
the code size of your apk using tools

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:27.690
the code size of your apk using tools
 

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.980
the code size of your apk using tools
like ProGuard which remove unused code

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:30.990
like ProGuard which remove unused code
 

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.790
like ProGuard which remove unused code
and finally you can consider multi apk

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:34.800
and finally you can consider multi apk
 

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.940
and finally you can consider multi apk
as an option to create apks split by

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:37.950
as an option to create apks split by
 

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.610
as an option to create apks split by
