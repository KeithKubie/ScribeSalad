similar ideas but the changes they make

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:12.570
similar ideas but the changes they make
 

02:01:12.570 --> 02:01:14.420
similar ideas but the changes they make
are just enough to make it so it's not

02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:14.430

02:01:14.430 --> 02:01:15.950
are just enough to make it so it's not
really distracting and you're still

02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960
