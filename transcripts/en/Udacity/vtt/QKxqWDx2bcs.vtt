00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Which of these yields the "group" behavior

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
we were expecting from the radio buttons?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Do we give them all the same "id" attribute,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the same "name" attribute,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the same "group" attribute--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or do we include all the s in a element?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You can go ahead and try this out on your own

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and see what you find.
