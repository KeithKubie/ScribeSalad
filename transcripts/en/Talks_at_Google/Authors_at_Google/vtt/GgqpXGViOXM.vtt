CHRISTINA: Welcome everybody
to today's Authors at Google

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.050
event.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.610
We are delighted to have
Louisa Lim join us today.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.700
And Louisa Lim is an NPR
correspondent and a former BBC

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.710
correspondent from Beijing.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.879
Louisa's written
an amazing book.

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.420
I finished it over
the past few days,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.580
and I strongly, strongly
recommend reading it,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.670
as I'm sure you'll want to do
after you've heard her talk.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.130
And it's called "The
People's Republic of Amnesia,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.190
Tiananmen Revisited."

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.920
We're delighted to
have her here today.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.600
Thank you.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:38.890
LOUISA LIM: Thank you
so much Christina,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.080
and thank you, Kirstie,
for organizing this talk.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.790
I'm so happy to
be here at Google.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.920
I've heard tell of the
fabled Google headquarters.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.660
So it's a great
privilege to be here.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.260
And I'm going to
talk about my book,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290
"The People's
Republic of Amnesia."

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.050
It's really about the
legacy of Tiananmen

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.060
and the events of 1989, how
those events changed China,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.500
and then how China went on
to change those events as it

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.890
rewrote its own history.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.745
It's about amnesia, which one
very famous Chinese author, Yan

00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:19.370
Liangke, called a state
sponsored sport in China.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.440
And my book is
about the people who

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.350
refused to take part in
that state-sponsored sport

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.640
and what happened to them.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.850
And the story of how
I wrote my book really

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.160
started with this woman.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.300
She is a mother.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.470
Her name is Tan Deying.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.880
And I met her as I was
working on a completely

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.250
different assignment for NPR.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.500
I was a radio correspondence
for NRP in China,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.820
and I was in Chengdu more than
1,000 miles away from Beijing

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.870
when I met this woman.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.200
And she told me how she, all
these years for two decades,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.480
she'd been searching
to find out what

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.230
had happened to her son who
died in 1989 in Chengdu.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.830
And I was pretty
surprised, because I

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.190
didn't know that anything
had happened in Chengdu.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.110
And so I started
asking her questions.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.600
And then the more
that she told me

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.150
the more that I wanted to find
out about this untold story.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.140
And so I started to look for
eyewitnesses for the events

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.040
that she was describing.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.950
And then I started to look
for photographs, for video,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.790
for diaries, newspaper reports
from Chinese newspapers

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.270
at the time, diplomatic
cables from the US records

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.670
and other countries'
diplomatic backwards.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.790
And by the end of
this process, I'd

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.560
pieced together this story that
had never really been properly

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.270
told before of
another crackdown,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.300
not just the killings in Beijing
that we all know about but,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.930
killings that happened 1,000
miles away on the other side

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.900
of the country.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.510
And it was a story
that I actually

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.320
did not know that
I was going to tell

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.240
until I started to talk to her.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.570
But it really made me wonder.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.470
The central question that
I was addressing was,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.930
how is it that something
that happened within living

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.770
memory can be forgotten?

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.090
Because, after all, this
was only 25 years ago.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.940
And there were so
many people in Chengdu

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.330
and elsewhere who
saw those events.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.810
So how can that be forgotten?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.170
And the first thing
that I realized

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.400
was that memory
really is surprisingly

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.190
dependent on geography.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.340
So when we in the West think
about Tiananmen Square,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.390
we often think
about this picture.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.270
Raise your hands if
you've seen this before.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.770
OK.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.030
Raise your hand if you haven't
seen this picture before?

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.190
So 100% and people in this
room know this picture,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.830
that moment when Tank Man,
as he's come to be known as,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.740
stood in front of
a line of tanks

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.000
on the boulevard, the Avenue
of Everlasting Peace, that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.590
leads to Tiananmen Square.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.260
I think perhaps
fewer people have

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.079
seen the raw footage
of that moment, which

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.844
is also incredibly powerful.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.030
In fact, there was a British
playwright, Lucy Kirkwood, who

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.480
wrote a play about this moment.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.330
The play's called "Chimerica."

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.820
And she wrote, "this is
a picture of the moment

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.760
that China exchanged democracy
for an economic miracle,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:49.820
for the opportunity to work,
live, spend, progress."

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.730
So that static
shot is that moment

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.630
the we associate in the
West with June the 4th,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.290
and with the events that
happened in Tiananmen Square.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.150
But actually
there's an awful lot

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.810
that is also forgotten about
that moment, even in the West.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.180
In fact, this didn't even
happen on June the 4th.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.720
It happened on June the 5th,
the day after the killings

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.632
in Tiananmen Square.

00:05:14.632 --> 00:05:18.490
And the fact that he
climbed up onto the tank

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.800
and he exchanged words with
the soldier inside the tank

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.000
is also forgotten.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.700
And we don't know what he said,
but the reports at the time

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.600
say that he said.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.830
"leave my people alone."

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.250
We also do not know
who this man is.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.090
We do not know what happened
to him after this moment.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.630
At the very end of
this footage, you

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.770
can see three people on bicycles
coming to whisk him away.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.360
And it's not clear if they're
supporters sheltering him,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.300
or people coming to
detain and arrest him.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.060
But that moment, that
particular moment,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.860
is really what we in
the West associate

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.450
with Tiananmen Square.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.490
And I think there's a lot
about what happened in '89

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.250
which is forgotten in the West.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.660
Because this wasn't a moment
that happened in a vacuum.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.490
It was the culmination of
seven weeks of a student

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.710
and popular movement.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.610
And that movement began
in the middle of April

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.934
when the Communist
Party leader Hu

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:34.100
Yaobang who had been there,
when he died suddenly of a heart

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.910
attack.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.610
He had been the head
of the Communist Party,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.260
but he had been removed
after student demonstrations

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.410
a couple of years before.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.780
But the students liked
him a great deal.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.020
He was seen as a
liberal, as a reformer,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.800
and they felt a great
deal of sympathy for him.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.240
So when he died, they all
came out on the streets

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.610
and they began mourning him.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.500
And very, very
quickly, the mourning

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.140
turned into protests
calling for freedom,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.750
for democracy, a free
press, an end to corruption,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.256
and other demands like this.

00:07:12.256 --> 00:07:15.380
The protests spread
around the country,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.250
and they continued to build.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.530
And then towards the end of
April, for the first time,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.230
the government came out
and said its position,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.870
which was that these
protests were turmoil,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.630
and that they should end.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.870
For the students, they saw
this editorial as a sign

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.470
that the government would
go after them no matter

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.770
what they did.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.820
So they continued to protest.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.010
And by May the 4th, there
were a million people

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.630
on the streets protesting.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.310
In the middle of
May, the students

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.110
began a six day
long hunger strike.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.840
And as all of this was going on,
there was also a power struggle

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.510
at the highest levels
of the Communist Party.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.380
This was the last appearance
by Zhao Ziyang, who

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.820
was the Communist Party
leader at the time,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.830
and he was the loser
in that power struggle.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.370
He turned up at 5 o'clock in
the morning on Tiananmen Square,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.070
saying to the students,
"we have come too late."

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.469
And after that, he spent the
next 15 years, until his death,

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:22.260
under house arrest.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.820
So that was the moment at which
the hardliners in government

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.810
took control.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.850
And they declared
martial law the next day.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:39.230
And they sent troops in to
try and clear the Square.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.970
This was the first attempt
the troops had made,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.950
and this is also something
that was forgotten,

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.890
that that first attempt was
not actually successful.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.830
These troops came in, and
as they were coming in,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.750
just crowds and crowds of people
swarmed around the lorries.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.060
They lay down in
front of the wheels,

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.180
and they stayed there, sometimes
for three days and three

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.800
nights.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.030
And the troops were just
effectively marooned

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.979
in a sea of people, and
they had to withdraw

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:11.520
and they went back
to their barracks.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.650
And the student saw
this as a great victory.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.150
But as we know now, it was
only a temporary victory.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.670
And on the night of June
the 3rd to June the 4th,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.920
the troops were sent
in again, this time

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.260
in great numbers with
the order to take

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.740
the Square at all costs.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.380
Even now, we don't know
how many people died.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:43.372
The first numbers that the
government put out said 241.

00:09:43.372 --> 00:09:45.330
But there were estimates
that were much higher.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.890
The Red Cross at the time
went around the hospitals

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.120
and said 2,600 people.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.940
They had counted 2,600 bodies.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.110
But those estimates were later
withdrawn after complaints

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.330
from the Chinese.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.130
So there's still a lot that is
unknown in the West, even about

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.810
those events.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.630
But this is that
image that remains.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.000
And I think in the
West it's really become

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.660
part of our popular culture.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:23.390
It's become a meme which is so
used so much that it's really

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.660
readily understood without
any kind of explanation.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.710
So here are some
examples that I found.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.190
There's Obama's
first trip to China.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:38.840
He's seen as a squeegee guy
begging the PLA for a handout.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.830
In the same year,
Iran had protests

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.630
where the students were
using social media to protest

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.000
against election results.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.702
And you can see the
mullahs in the tanks

00:10:49.702 --> 00:10:50.660
saying he's twittering.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.890
And he's there on his
BlackBerry tweeting away.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:01.002
Then two years ago, when Edward
Snowden fled to Russia, again,

00:11:01.002 --> 00:11:05.350
this same image occurred.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:10.450
And I think that it really has
entered our popular culture.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:17.810
If there was any doubt about
it, here it is on the Simpsons.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.200
And just one last example.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.400
It's hard to
believe that anybody

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.340
could've thought that
this was a good idea,

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.640
but here is a Tank Man
advert that was shot

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.325
for the Peach Bowl in the US.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.320
Yep.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.830
It was really-- that was a
true, real ad for Chick Filet.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.790
So I think this really
shows the kind of role

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.030
that that picture has played
in our popular culture.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:56.940
And when I was starting to think
about the legacy of Tiananmen

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.190
in China, what I
wanted to know was

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.970
how familiar young
Chinese people

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.230
would be with this picture.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:11.660
After all, nowadays there are
650 million Chinese people

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.600
online.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.547
And although the internet
is very heavily censored,

00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:16.880
there's a lot that gets through.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.340
It's quite a leaky system,
and a lot of young people

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.760
know how to circumvent
the censorship.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.850
So one of the
experiments that I did

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.580
was to take this picture,
the picture of Tank Man,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.720
around four Beijing
universities.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.160
And they were the
four universities

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.920
that were most instrumental
in 1989 in the protests.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.490
And I asked students do
you recognize this image?

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.480
And if they said
yes, I would double

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.968
check with them to see if they
really did know what it was.

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:52.950
And I remember in this room
100% of people knew this image.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.830
I was really surprised to
find only 15% of the students

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.040
that I talked could
identify this image.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.690
And you may ask, well, how can
you tell if people are lying?

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.190
And that was something
that I didn't

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.140
know when I started whether
I would be able to tell.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.020
And it was really
surprising to me

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.520
that you can
immediately tell because

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.930
of the power of the image.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:21.050
Those students who knew
what that image was,

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.604
they have this
physical reaction.

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:25.270
They would look at
the picture, and they

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.190
would shy away from it.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.710
Some of them gasped.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.790
One of them said, oh my god.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.530
And it was clear if
they knew what it was.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.820
I mean, there was one
young man who even said,

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.720
I do not know what this image
is, but it's too controversial

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.120
and I can't talk
to you about it.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.510
So he knew.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.726
Whilst the 85 students I
spoke to who couldn't identify

00:13:48.726 --> 00:13:50.350
the image, when they
looked at it, when

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.939
they looked at the Tank Man
picture, they would lean in.

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:55.230
And they would point to things.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.510
And they would ask questions.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.950
So I was asked is
it South Korea?

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.220
Is it Kosovo?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.360
One student pointed
at the lamppost, which

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.780
is really distinctive-- they're
only in Tiananmen Square--

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.200
and said well, it really
looks like Tiananmen,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.320
but it can't be.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:23.450
So it was clear that although
the censorship is leaky,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.400
that it is actually
working when it comes

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.040
to a large proportion
of people in China

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.540
and young people in China.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.220
Those students who did
know what the picture was,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.790
often they would defend the
behavior of the government.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:45.210
And they would say things
like China's economic progress

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.790
in the last 30 years was only
possible because of the actions

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.350
that the government took
in Tiananmen Square.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.380
So it was really a
retrospective justification

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.030
for the killings based on
the economic performance

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.320
at the last 25 years.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.680
And that's really the
government's line as well.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.470
And it's a line which
a lot of Chinese people

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.690
both believe in and agree with.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:19.200
So actually 19 of
the students that I

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.450
spoke to believe that it was a
military parade, this picture.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.220
Because they just couldn't
conceive of any other reason

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.120
why there would be tanks
running down that road.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.160
So that was one of the
things that I discovered.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.470
And the other thing
that I discovered

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:39.350
was how nervous it
made me walking around

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.220
university campuses with
this Tank Man picture.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.850
And I was really
surprised by that.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.320
Because at that stage I'd
been a journalist in China

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.310
for more than 10 years.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.060
And let's be honest.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.160
I had a license.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.920
I had a literal license, a
journalist card in my pocket

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.070
which allowed me to go and
ask sensitive questions.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.800
And yet, I was really nervous.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.770
I was convinced I was
going to be detained.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.110
I was sweating.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.385
My hands were clammy.

00:16:06.385 --> 00:16:09.870
And then I realized how much
I myself had internalized

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.970
the censorship that just walking
around with a photograph asking

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.740
questions was making me
really paranoid and scared.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.420
And I also realized if I, who
had a license to be doing this,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.710
if I was so nervous,
what was it like

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.210
for ordinary Chinese people
who I was talking to you?

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.380
So it really made me think.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.650
And I started to wonder, well,
why don't young Chinese people

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.930
know what's happened?

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.980
Of course, the censorship
is one of the reasons.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.190
If you search on
Google for Tiananmen,

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.790
you will get immediately
pictures of Tank Man.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.580
You'll get the Wikipedia
article about the protests,

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.310
and a whole lot more.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:59.350
If you use the Chinese
search engine Baidu,

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.530
you get pictures
of Tiananmen Gate

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.030
and tourist
information about it.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.170
Nothing else.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.329
If you look in
textbooks, there's

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:15.690
nothing about the events
of 1989, except in one.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.339
There's a textbook that
I could find any allusion

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:23.230
to it was an undergraduate
history textbook.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:29.590
And it was 529 pages long,
and it had four pages

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.160
on the events of 1989.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.890
And even that very,
very short account

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.660
contained what one French
professor, Michel Bonnin,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:45.480
called a monumental historical
untruth-- basically, a lie.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.220
But if you were a
young Chinese person,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.350
it would be difficult to
conceive of that your textbooks

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.920
actually had lies in them.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.450
That's not something
that you would expect.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.170
As I said, there are
ways of circumventing

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.370
this kind of censorship.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.500
And in particularly on social
media, we see a lot of that.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.820
So for example, June
the 4th was blocked.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.270
So netizens started
talking about May the 35th.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.560
Then May the 35th, these
words were blocked.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.080
So they started talking
about April the 65th.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.540
And then that was blocked.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.510
And then every year,
you have this kind

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.391
of escalating censorship,
where more and more words are

00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:27.890
blocked.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.080
So in the last few
years, words that

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.770
have been developed on
social media in China

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.130
around the anniversary
include "today," "tomorrow,"

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.500
"nostalgia," "when spring turns
to summer," and even the word

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.670
"sensitive word" was blocked.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:50.190
Then last year, they even
started blocking numbers.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.320
So people who were
trying to send money

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.870
using mobile messaging apps,
if the amount that they were

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.680
trying to have send had a 64 or
an 89 in it, that was blocked.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.100
So you can see the way in
which censorship impedes

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.490
not just discussion,
but commerce,

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.350
and innovation, and education,
and all kinds of other things.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:23.740
So the censorship is such
that this picture, which

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.480
was a picture of young
Chinese students in 1989

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.470
with gunshot wounds being
rushed to a hospital.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.040
This actually appeared in
2009 in a state-run newspaper

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.610
in Beijing, "The Beijing News."

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.270
And at the time, there
was a lot of discussion.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.320
It was part of an article.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.940
It was a profile of
the photographer,

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.356
and there was a
lot of discussion.

00:19:47.356 --> 00:19:49.680
Maybe the newspaper's trying
to send a coded message.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.330
What's going on?

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.890
Later on, it turned out that
in fact what had happened

00:19:54.890 --> 00:20:00.540
was nobody who worked at
the newspaper, not the page

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.060
editor, or the photo editor,
or the section editor,

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.260
so not even the censor--
nobody actually recognize what

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.430
this picture was and realized
that it was sensitive enough

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:14.600
to censor.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.670
So to me, that's actually
a sign of both the success

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.350
and the failure of
Chinese censorship.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.710
It's been so successful that
the institutional memory of June

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.780
the 4th is beginning to fade.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.280
And people no longer realize
that it needs to be censored.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.500
It's not just the Chinese
press that has difficulty

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.740
reporting on these things.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.010
I mean, they're
basically banned.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.390
You almost never get
reports in the Chinese press

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.960
about June the 4th.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.160
But the Western
press in China too

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.870
does find itself having trouble
reporting on these things.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.710
And I'm just going to show
you one last clip which

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.950
was from the year 2009,
the 20th anniversary.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.830
And normally, if, as a TV crew,
when the anniversary comes

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.910
around, you want to go
down to Tiananmen Square,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.960
and you want to shoot your
piece to camera saying

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.630
it's the anniversary and
security's really tight.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.790
Blah-blah-blah.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.460
And you have to
apply for a permit.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.980
And you get given this
permit, which gives you,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.360
say, 20 minutes on the Square.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.860
And you have handlers,
government minders watching you

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.360
always.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.610
And it's very
tightly controlled.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.010
But you're allowed to do that.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.280
But in 2009, for some
reason, the government

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.040
decided to unroll
its new strategy

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.650
to deal with Western press
reporting on the anniversary.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.730
I like to call it the Umbrella
Man of Tiananmen Square.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.210
So this is not the behavior
of a government that

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.640
is at peace with its own past.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.180
And actually, I
should say-- last year

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.610
on the 25th anniversary,
the government,

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.210
the authorities decided to
stop pussyfooting around.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.500
And they basically just visited
journalists in their offices

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.930
and said, you will not
report on the anniversary.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.240
You will not go to
Tiananmen Square.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.030
If you do, there
will be consequences

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.480
which we are not going to
share with you at this moment.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.720
Those reporters who did
go to Tiananmen Square

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.820
found that they were often
stopped and searched.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.500
They were pulled
in for questioning.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.470
They were detained temporarily.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:30.030
So it's interesting that
over time the reporting

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.480
on the events that
happened 25 years ago

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.150
hasn't become any easier.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:40.420
In fact, it's become a
great deal more difficult.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.310
And in my book, I
profile a number

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:48.430
of people whose
lives were changed

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.740
by the events of '89, the
people, as I told you,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.080
who refuse to forget.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.420
Among them is this
woman who is the mother

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.670
of a 19-year-old boy who died
in 1989 taking photographs

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.970
of the troops.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.040
And she was one of
the mothers that

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.000
started the Tiananmen Mothers,
which is a support group,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.880
a lobbying group.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.000
It became the first
political grassroots lobbying

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.960
group in China.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.980
And last year on the
25th anniversary,

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:27.360
she was part of this
commemoration symposium, which

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.610
was held in Beijing in
someone's apartment.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.380
15 people took part in that.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.000
This is their
commemorative photo.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.060
And within days of
that photo being taken,

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.850
five of those people
had been detained,

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.560
and all the rest had been
hauled in for questioning.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.090
And some of them
ended up being charged

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.690
with creating a
public disturbance,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:59.350
even though this was a meeting
in somebody's apartment

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.510
behind closed doors.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.440
To this day, one of them,
lawyer Pu Zhiquiang, here,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.560
is still in custody, facing
charges of incitement

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.791
to subversion.

00:24:13.791 --> 00:24:18.660
And another person who I
profile in my book is this man.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.400
His name is Chen Guang.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.620
And in 1989, he was a
17-year-old soldier.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.940
He was one of the
martial law troops that

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.850
was sent to clear the Square.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:36.470
Afterwards, he quit the Army,
and he became an artist.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.610
He went to art school.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.660
And ever since then,
almost will the art

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:45.260
he's created has a link to 1989,
to the events of Tiananmen.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.220
He cannot really show or
sell his art in China.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:55.760
Last year at the anniversary,
he put on this art performance

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.030
where he was in this
deserted art studio,

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:05.440
and he had painted dates on
the walls, starting in 1989

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.570
and ending in 2014.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:14.320
And then he took white paint,
and he whitewashed the walls.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.280
He said history is like a blank.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.780
It has been wiped out.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.650
And for that act, he
was detained by police,

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:27.150
and spent six weeks
in police custody.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:27.650
Actually.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.600
Last year, more than 150 people
were arrested, or detained,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.950
or placed on the house
arrest in the clampdown,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.220
which was the worst in years.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.980
And they included people
like a Buddhist monk

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:45.210
who was giving a lecture on
Buddhism in a Shangri-La Hotel.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:50.220
And he was also arrested for
incitement to subversion.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.010
There was a factory worker,
a young factory worker

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.980
who visited Tiananmen
Square and took a selfie,

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.620
making the V sign like this.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.780
And he was also detained for
creating a public disturbance.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.010
Because back in 1989, the
students went like this.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.930
So to me, this idea of
history being wiped out,

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.850
I could see it happening
in front of me.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.250
But nowhere was this more
true than in Chengdu, the city

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.130
that you can see in
the middle of the map

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.870
there, more than 1,000
miles from Beijing.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.130
Because this was a story that
had never really been property

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.640
told before.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.320
But in Chengdu, there was
also these huge demonstrations

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.840
in the streets in April and May.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:52.930
Students from many local
universities, these workers

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:58.150
from the meteorological
university, some government

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.450
work units came to protest.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.210
And protesting was so
normal that instead

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.340
of asking each other
have you eaten yet,

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.200
people used to greet
each other by saying,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.570
have you protested yet?

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.530
The students and the
protesters also in Chengdu

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.350
occupied square right
in the middle of town.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:22.340
beneath the feet of this
massive Chairman Mao statue,

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:28.570
and they launched their own
hunger strike and settled in.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.690
On June the 4th in Chengdu,
the square was cleared,

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.120
but it was cleared
quite peacefully.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.840
And that's when things
started to go differently

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.590
than they had in Beijing.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.140
Because the square in Chengdu
was cleared peacefully.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.010
But after it was cleared,
people in Chengdu

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.730
began to hear what had
happened in Beijing.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.730
And they came out on the
streets again to protest,

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.160
this time against the
brutality in Beijing.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.710
And this was taken on the
morning of June the 4th

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.760
in Chengdu.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.430
And you can see the signs
that they're carrying

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.390
read June the 4th massacre.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.610
7,000 dead and injured.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:11.390
This one says, we are
not afraid to die.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:15.480
In Chengdu, the
authorities, of course,

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.720
moved in again this time with
water cannon and tear gas.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.240
And the people started throwing
rocks and stones, bricks,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.830
anything, bottles--
anything they

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.290
could find at the authorities.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.660
This was the paramilitary
armed police.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.470
And there were
basically three days

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.170
of running battles in Chengdu.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.650
You can see here from this
shot, which I blew up.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.460
You can see at the front
how the authorities dealt

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.930
with protesters in Chengdu.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.845
They didn't open fire at them.

00:28:52.845 --> 00:28:57.310
They Instead use batons, and
they beat the protesters.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:01.440
And they targeted
them around the heads.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.960
And these were
pictures sent to me

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.125
by eyewitnesses who were
there at the time, who

00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:10.420
were inside the hospitals taking
pictures of what they had seen.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.780
You can see from
the preponderance

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.370
of head injuries the way the
authorities dealt with it.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.330
These protests and the
crackdown were so big

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:31.550
that the government could
not cover it up in Chengdu.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.470
They had to admit to
what had happened.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.680
They actually put out their
own version of events.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.950
This was a propaganda
book that was put out.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:46.610
Within a month, 760,000
copies were printed.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.400
And in this book, they
admitted that people had been

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.100
killed during that crackdown.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.120
They said that eight people
died, two of them students.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.040
1,800 people were injured.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.775
They said mostly policemen.

00:30:04.775 --> 00:30:07.240
But then as I started
to look into this more,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.580
I was really shocked to
discover that in fact that

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.060
wasn't the worst
thing that happened

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.590
in Chengdu at the time.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:21.580
After that incident,
the people of Chengdu

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.110
were so angry that
they retaliated

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:27.700
against the government by
burning down or vandalizing

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.270
government properties.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:33.690
And that includes police
cars, fire engines,

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:34.830
government offices.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.850
And this was a
government-run market, which

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.920
took up an entire city block.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.100
And it was burnt down
as an act of protest.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.450
I used US diplomatic cables
as one of the sources,

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:55.670
because the US had a Consulate
General in Chengdu at the time.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.820
And it was actually
at the center

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.550
of what I'm about
to tell you about,

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.230
the next incident that I'm
about to tell you about,

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.350
which happened in this
hotel, the Jinjiang

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:14.160
Hotel, which was the smartest
hotel in Chengdu at the time.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.810
And it still exists, and
it's quite swanky nowadays.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:22.000
But the US Consulate General,
he had his office there,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.730
and he also lived
in that building.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.640
And at that time, a lot of
the foreigners in Chengdu

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.110
had been evacuated and were
staying in this building.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.020
So they were witnesses
to the incidents

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.650
that I'm going to
describe to you.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.520
So it was on the night of
June the 5th to June the 6th.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.000
There were huge
demonstrations in the square,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.740
and the police were
trying to clear them.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.870
And then there was
this incident where

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:01.360
the shop which sold
foreign alcohol

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.560
and cigarettes on the
ground floor of this hotel

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.290
was ransacked.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:10.110
And then the police came
in to restore order.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.400
And they marched all
the protesters out

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.990
and had them kneeling in rows
in the courtyard at that hotel.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.480
So all the foreigners
who had rooms

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.750
in the front of that
hotel were witnesses

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.560
to what happened next.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.500
They saw dozens and
dozens of people

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.740
detained, kneeling in the
courtyard, their hands wired

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.560
behind their backs.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.090
Two witnesses said their
hands were wired in such a way

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.920
that their arms would
need to be broken.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.540
Then they saw-- they watched as
plainclothes policemen walked

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.910
along between the
rows of people.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.310
And they watched as
an order was given,

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.370
and the plainclothes policemen
took these iron rods and batons

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:03.200
and smashed the protesters one
by one, smashed their heads in.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.720
Two trucks pulled
in, and the bodies

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.410
were thrown into the
trucks like garbage,

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:17.250
like sacks of potatoes, like
slabs of meat, like carcasses.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.450
Those are different descriptions
from four different witnesses.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.700
And I was amazed
that most of them

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.640
did not know that anybody
else had seen the same sights

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.090
that they had seen.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.750
One of them said I don't
remember anyone screaming.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.140
There was no noise, just
the bodies piling up

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.810
on top of each other.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.240
They were definitely
lifeless bodies.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.030
I imagined if anyone
was alive, they

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.030
would not survive in that pile.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.040
So I needed to know
what had happened

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.800
in that hotel on that day.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.030
So I went back to
the Chinese sources

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.584
to see if there was
any mention of this.

00:33:57.584 --> 00:33:59.375
And I was surprised to
find that there was.

00:33:59.375 --> 00:34:02.820
There was a great deal
written about this incident.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.250
And the Chinese sources
said 70 people--

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.600
seven zero-- were detained
in that hotel on that day.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.639
And the Chinese newspapers even
talked about the police's use

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.840
of violence against protesters.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.620
So the big question was
were all of those people

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.909
killed in plain view of all
the watching foreigners?

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:27.719
And the honest truth is,
I don't know for sure.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.290
I can't give you an answer.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.569
Too many years have passed.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.600
And we just don't know for sure.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.929
What I do know is
those eyewitnesses

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.420
believe they
witnessed an atrocity.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.610
Many of after leaving China,
they were evacuated out

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.739
and they went to
Amnesty International.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:47.949
They went to rights groups.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.440
They went to the newspapers.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.670
They went to their
media, and they tried

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.980
to tell what they had seen.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.690
But what had happened in Beijing
was so much bigger and so much

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.090
more dramatic, .

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.730
And there were no
pictures to this,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.420
so nobody listened to them.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:13.640
I did find picture is in the
Chinese propaganda, which

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.040
very closely tracked
the kinds of stories

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.230
that I was being told of
people being beaten up

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.550
over the head, of people
being loaded into trucks,

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:30.610
of people being rounded
up, having their hands

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.950
tied together, being
thrown face down

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.670
on the floor, and
this kind of thing.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.490
But then I went
back to Tan Deying,

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.580
the woman who I told you
about at the beginning.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:49.690
And I mean, I always had her
story at the back of my mind.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.530
Because she had been
trying for all these years

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.410
to find out what had
happened to her son.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.930
And she discovered that he'd
been riding his bicycle home.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.510
He'd been detained by police.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.030
She'd been told
by someone he was

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:04.840
detained with that he was
beaten to death by police.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.410
And so for 25 years, she
tried to get an answer as

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.780
to exactly what had happened.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.590
She went to Beijing five times.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.520
Each time, she was
caught and sent back.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.150
She was locked in
an iron cage twice.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.070
For two years, two
full years, she

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:24.490
had a police car stationed
in front of her house.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:26.150
But she went on.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.150
And after 11 years,
her persistence

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.940
had a very surprising
result. She

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.100
was given by the
local police chief

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.420
a photograph of
her son's corpse.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.060
And you could see very clearly
from this single photograph

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.290
that he had been beaten.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.220
His face was swollen.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.550
His nose was swollen.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.810
There were bruises.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:52.580
It was quite clear that violence
had been used against him.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:58.270
In 2006, she was given a
payment of almost $9,000.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.990
It's the first
payment that's ever

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.970
been made in connection
with a 1989 death.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.060
Although it was called
a hardship allowance

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.750
rather than any kind
of compensation.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.260
And so I thought if
anybody was going

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:18.085
to know about what happened
back then, it would be her.

00:37:18.085 --> 00:37:21.910
So I went to her, and
I asked her, well,

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.440
were there others like you?

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.000
Are there others
like you out there

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.790
who lost their children
in Chengdu in 1989,

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.040
and or who just don't know
what happened to them?

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.320
And she looked me in the
eye, and she said, even

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.140
if I knew I wouldn't tell you.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.900
And that was when I
realized if this woman who

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.060
had been through
so much, who had

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.380
risked so much, if even if
she could not talk openly

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:57.770
about what happened in
1989, then who would?

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.910
That was also when I
realized another thing,

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:05.230
that forgetting is not something
that's imposed from above.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:10.365
It's something that people
have being co-opted into.

00:38:13.142 --> 00:38:16.060
They've cooperated with this.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.450
Because it's simply not
convenient to remember what

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.680
happened in 1989.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.400
There's no benefit at all.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.790
In fact, there's a
very, very major cost

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:29.940
to any kind of active
acts of memory.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.610
So people simply do
not want to remember.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.430
It's easier to turn away, to
forget, to never talk about it,

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.030
to pretend nothing happened.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.080
And I'm just going to
tell you one last story.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.380
This is about an artist
whose name is Sheng Qi.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.670
And he was not in
Tiananmen Square in 1989.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.510
He had gone back
to his hometown.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:57.550
But he was very sympathetic
to the students,

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:01.530
and when he heard
what happened in 1989

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.450
he said it was as
if he had gone mad.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.970
This kind of madness seized him.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:14.560
And as an act of protest,
he took a meat cleaver

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.970
and he hacked off his
own little finger.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:23.480
And he used that in
his art for years.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.090
This is artwork called "Myself."

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:32.540
And he's holding up a picture
of himself as a young boy.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:37.300
But now 25 years has
passed, and he has

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.390
a young son, a 13-year-old son.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.520
And so we were just chatting,
and I just asked him, well,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.711
what do you tell
your child about what

00:39:46.711 --> 00:39:47.710
happened to your finger?

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.480
And he kind of looked
a little embarrassed.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.180
And then he said,
well, you know,

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.830
normally I tell him that
I left it on the bus.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:02.060
And I suppose surely, of
course he doesn't believe that.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.270
And he said, well, I know
he doesn't believe it,

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:09.220
but I'm always thinking
of some kind of story.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.600
Because he's still a little
kid, and I want to protect him.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.140
And that's how people feel.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.100
They feel their children need
protecting from the truth

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.722
in order to survive
and to thrive.

00:40:22.722 --> 00:40:24.180
And there are people
who say, well,

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.470
does it really
matter anymore what

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:31.790
happened in Beijing, or Chengdu,
or anywhere else in 1989?

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:36.095
Because China's now the
world's second largest economy.

00:40:36.095 --> 00:40:39.670
It's pulled hundreds of millions
of people out of poverty.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.580
Does it really make
any difference?

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.540
And my answer would be,
yes, it does matter.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.510
It matters because
history does matter.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:50.080
And history matters so much
to the Chinese government

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.015
that they're willing to
spend all this money, all

00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:57.410
this manpower, muzzling
people like these mothers

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.976
who simply want to find out
what happened to their children.

00:41:01.976 --> 00:41:03.350
So I would say
that the cover-up,

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:06.200
it's not just at the top.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.740
After all, memory is that
most personal of spaces.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.480
It's inside your own head.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.240
But people have allowed
themselves to be co-opted.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:24.020
They've colluded with this
idea that memory is political.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.720
And they've allowed
themselves to be party

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.300
to state-sponsored amnesia.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.590
I'm going to end by paraphrasing
the words of one dissidents who

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:39.500
said, "a massive secret has
become like a massive vacuum.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.310
The crimes of the
state are slowly

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:44.310
being replaced by
the crime of silence.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:48.500
And that is a crime in which
almost everyone is complicit."

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.023
Thank you.

00:41:50.023 --> 00:41:52.378
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:59.390
CHRISTINA: We've got a
few minutes for questions.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:00.310
So you probably
could get one or two

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.194
in if anyone would like
to ask the questions.

00:42:02.194 --> 00:42:04.360
Louisa, if I can just ask
you to repeat the question

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.027
once it's asked.

00:42:05.027 --> 00:42:05.735
LOUISA LIM: Sure.

00:42:05.735 --> 00:42:06.700
CHRISTINA: Thank you.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.390
LOUISA LIM: So any questions?

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.830
Yes.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:14.190
AUDIENCE: Did you
experience any difficulties

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.590
or any interference
while you were

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.480
doing your research for your
investigations in the book?

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.540
LOUISA LIM: Well, I was
working as a journalist for NPR

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:29.700
at the time, so I went to quite
extraordinary and probably

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:34.580
unnecessary lengths to try
to cover up what I was doing.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.610
I mean, I was working
as a journalist,

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.980
but I was on the side
writing this book.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.220
So I did take a
lot of precautions.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:47.870
I never talked about the book
at home or in the office.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.420
Because I lived and worked in
a diplomatic compound which was

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.470
widely believed to be bugged.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.707
I never emailed about it.

00:42:53.707 --> 00:42:55.040
I never talked on the telephone.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.160
So if I wanted to interview
someone, I would never say,

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.860
oh I'm writing a
book about this.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.230
I would just say I'm
a foreign journalist.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.900
Can I come and see you?

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.350
And then I got increasingly
more paranoid as time passed.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.170
So I would write-- I
had a computer that

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.220
had never been online.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.220
And at night, I would lock
it in a safe in my bedroom

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.610
and wonder if I was going
a little too paranoid.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:21.150
So I mean, I experienced
interference, but only

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:26.030
the kind of interference
that journalists experience

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.310
as part of their work in China.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:33.770
It can be quite tough to do
your job, but it's normal.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.900
You get used to
it after a while.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:42.690
And because I think
my press handlers,

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.515
they didn't really
know what I was doing.

00:43:45.515 --> 00:43:50.490
I mean, after the book
came out-- I mean,

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.640
I never had any
comeback, but I do

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.370
know that the Economist Magazine
wrote a very nice review.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.080
There was this
double page review.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.640
And when that issue of the
Economist arrived in China,

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.320
every page that
mentioned my book

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.490
had been ripped out one by one.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.590
So it's old-school censorship.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:08.495
They noticed.

00:44:08.495 --> 00:44:09.914
Yes.

00:44:09.914 --> 00:44:12.896
AUDIENCE: So are they
trying to forget or are they

00:44:12.896 --> 00:44:15.667
trying to [INAUDIBLE] what were
the consequences of Tiananmen?

00:44:15.667 --> 00:44:16.375
What has changed?

00:44:16.375 --> 00:44:18.860
Has there been any change?

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.012
Have they had an
impact or no impact?

00:44:22.012 --> 00:44:22.720
LOUISA LIM: Yeah.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.990
I mean, Tiananmen is a huge
turning point for China.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.300
It had a massive impact in
every way-- politically,

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:36.360
economically, socially-- because
after Tiananmen, the government

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.510
policies changed.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:39.550
There was no more
political liberalization,

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.360
and there hasn't
been since then,

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:47.970
whilst there was this decision
to do economic reform and not

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.360
political reform.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.990
So you know politically
it was a turning point,

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.690
but there were all kinds of
other ramifications as well.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:58.015
AUDIENCE: Basically they
tightened their control

00:44:58.015 --> 00:44:59.240
as well, didn't they?

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.030
LOUISA LIM: Yeah.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:03.410
I mean, before
Tiananmen, there had been

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.340
moved towards political change.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:09.490
And afterwards, there
have been no more moves

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:11.530
toward political change since.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.070
So yeah, control was
tightened, but there were also

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.140
other ramifications as well.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.510
So after Tiananmen, the
leadership, Deng Xiaoping,

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:24.260
decided that it had happened
because young people didn't

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.550
understand what China had
been like pre-Communists,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:33.260
so he brought in this huge
program of patriotic education.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:38.110
And we're seeing the
results of this even today

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:42.300
in this young generation of
more nationalistic Chinese.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:48.590
Because at school now they are
subject to this quite intensive

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:51.450
program of patriotic education.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:55.340
And that is also a direct
response to Tiananmen.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.030
I mean, another
thing that changed

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.360
was the security situation.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.380
The leadership decided that
something like Tiananmen

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.530
should never to happen again,
could never happen again.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:11.760
So they really beefed up the
internal security forces.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.930
So now China spends more
on its internal security

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:18.510
than it does on its army,
on its national defense.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.760
And that is also a direct
response to Tiananmen.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.510
Because in '89, they saw how
students around the country

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.360
mobilized, how they
all rose up together.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.140
And they decided that
protests must be localized

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.430
and must be squashed
before protesters join up

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.090
in the same way again.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:45.218
So it was a massive turning
point for China in every way.

00:46:45.218 --> 00:46:45.718
Yes?

00:46:48.366 --> 00:46:50.970
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned a lot about how

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.200
the people in China
at the time are moving

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.050
toward amnesia or silence.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.700
But what about the diaspora?

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.570
Do you find that
people who leave

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.470
China are more open to talking
about it, or learning about it,

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.410
or understanding it?

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.410
Or do they also
still have that fear

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.120
from when they were in
China about talking about it

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.800
or that kind of thing?

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.820
LOUISA LIM: It's a mix.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:11.740
It's a mix.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.360
I mean, increasingly
we're seeing

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.660
large numbers of Chinese
students studying overseas.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.470
I mean, in the US, Chinese
students are now the biggest

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.780
overseas student body.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:26.800
So we are seeing more and
more young Chinese overseas.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.930
And I've given a lot of talks
at universities in the US.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:36.380
And I've found that you do get
young Chinese that come along,

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:40.070
and they're really fascinated.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:41.720
They've never heard
any of this before,

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.990
and it's really shocking
and also quite paralyzing.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:50.680
Because I'm often asked, what
am I supposed to do about this?

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.930
What can I, as a
single individual do?

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.240
So there is that
response on the one hand.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.070
But on the other hand, a lot
of the students that leave

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:02.494
are the elite.

00:48:02.494 --> 00:48:04.160
They're the students
who've been through

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.890
this patriotic education,
who've tested well at school.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.390
And in order to get
into university,

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.010
you take these exams.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:16.530
And there's a significant
political component

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:23.110
which involves knowing the
right stances on history.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:29.160
So these tend to be the
elite, the well educated,

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.640
those that espouse the
government position.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.840
So you do gets students that
leave China, that go overseas.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.200
And when they hear these other
views of Chinese history,

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.324
they become very defensive.

00:48:39.324 --> 00:48:42.470
And they argue,
and they say this

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.720
is all a Western conspiracy.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.930
Why should we believe you?

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:50.450
This is not what our
history books say.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.950
And the US, certainly, there's
been a number of scandals

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.760
that I write about in my book
where Chinese students have

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.990
really pushed back extremely
strongly, leading to fears,

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.050
actually, about academic
freedom in the US.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:07.030
So I think there's
a mixed reaction.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.450
And it's still hard to
tell, but I think, actually,

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:15.680
this is one of the repercussions
of the post-Tiananmen patriotic

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.890
education that young Chinese are
quite proud of their country,

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.140
and often do not want to
hear critical views of it.

00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:27.422
Yes?

00:49:27.422 --> 00:49:29.907
AUDIENCE: And so having
uncovered the atrocities

00:49:29.907 --> 00:49:32.889
that happened in Chengdu, do
you think it's likely that those

00:49:32.889 --> 00:49:35.390
happened all around China?

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:36.110
LOUISA LIM: No.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:40.700
I think there was violence
that happened in other cities,

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:44.050
In Xi'an and a couple
of other cities,

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:47.240
but it was much smaller scale.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.340
There were deaths that
happened in other cities,

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.510
but it was much earlier on.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:54.950
It was in mid-April, and I
believe it was smaller scale.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:57.300
It's possible that
things happened elsewhere

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.730
that we don't know about.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.675
But I don't believe
that it was widespread.

00:50:01.675 --> 00:50:03.050
I certainly don't
believe that it

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:06.432
happened in dozens of places.

00:50:06.432 --> 00:50:08.887
CHRISTINA: And there's
time for one more question.

00:50:08.887 --> 00:50:11.342
AUDIENCE: A little bit
more future-looking.

00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:14.934
Mr. Xi and all the elites
are now at this beach resort

00:50:14.934 --> 00:50:18.886
working on the 13th [INAUDIBLE]
on such and such a date.

00:50:18.886 --> 00:50:20.302
Economists believe
that innovation

00:50:20.302 --> 00:50:22.510
is high on the agenda.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:27.351
Do you feel at some point
that would ultimately

00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:29.432
lead to less government?

00:50:29.432 --> 00:50:32.041
Do you think there's an overlap
between the economic reforms

00:50:32.041 --> 00:50:35.520
towards the politic reforms?

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.005
And do you see in the
future some sort [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:38.005 --> 00:50:41.152
of political reforms that
haven't happened maybe

00:50:41.152 --> 00:50:42.700
could happen?

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.880
LOUISA LIM: Sorry, I completely
forgot to repeat the questions.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.135
He asked what I see
in China's future.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:59.360
I would say that we
overseas, I think

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.780
we fail quite
badly in predicting

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.570
what will happen in China.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.590
If you look at Xi Jinping,
the current president,

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:10.000
there's not a single person, no
China watchers, no academics,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.610
no policymakers--
nobody predicted

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:16.720
that he would come in and take
this nationalistic hard line

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.490
and launch a massive clampdown.

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.720
In fact, everybody was
talking about, oh, maybe he's

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.570
a closet reformer.

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.360
And that turned out
to be quite wrong.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.530
So I think often
in the West, we're

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.610
quite guilty of
wishful thinking when

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.930
it comes to looking
at China predictions.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:39.320
But also I think that
we know less about China

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.250
than we think we do.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.780
So I'm quite reluctant
to make predictions.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.800
But I do not see
any kind of signs

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.574
of any political liberalization
coming anytime soon.

00:51:53.574 --> 00:51:55.490
If you look at what's
happening on the ground,

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:56.700
it's the opposite.

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:01.200
This clampdown that
we saw that started,

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.380
it got bad just around the time
of the anniversary last year.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.820
And everybody said, oh,
after Tiananmen things

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.550
will get better.

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.700
After the anniversary,
things will get better.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.990
But they didn't get better.

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:14.110
They got worse.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:19.570
And since then, we've seen a
raft of legislation introduced

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:27.470
on national security, against
terrorism, cracking down

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:31.010
on non-governmental
organizations.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:33.640
Those would make it
very difficult for NGOs,

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.280
for civil society to develop.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.050
Recently, there was a
very intense crackdown

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:45.030
on human rights lawyers,
rights defenders.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.240
And more than 200
rights defenders

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.430
were rounded up in just a
very short period of time.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.010
Most of them have been
released, but quite a lot

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:57.430
of prominent ones are
still completely missing.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:02.820
So I don't see any--
any positive signs when

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:07.320
it comes to political reform.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.860
On the economic front
as well, I think

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:13.990
we're entering this period
of extreme uncertainty

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:18.800
where the controls are
being lifted slightly

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.220
on the renminbi, but this
has only just happened

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.010
within the last few days.

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:27.890
So it's difficult to tell how
far that's going to happen,

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:30.540
and whether this is actually
a move towards liberalization,

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.700
and why this is happening.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:44.240
I think that the next few months
will be absolutely key to it

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.410
the rest of this term.

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:51.410
But so far as well, if
you look at the moves that

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.050
have been taken in
the South China Sea,

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:56.700
the Chinese have been very
aggressively expanding

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:01.220
their territory building
islands, this kind of thing.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:06.280
And it doesn't look as
if any kind of reform

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:11.260
will be taken in the way that
we in the West view as reform.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.140
The stance that
seems to be happening

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.800
is much more kind of hard
line nationalist stance.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.490
But you never know.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.320
You never know.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.460
We've been wrong in
the past about China.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.460
AUDIENCE: Appreciate it.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.335
CHRISTINA: Excellent.

00:54:26.335 --> 00:54:28.760
Please join me in thanking
Louisa for her excellent talk.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.510
