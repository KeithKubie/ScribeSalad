It's really neat to look at all my ancestry, maternal, paternal

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:07.223
lines. Even my possible Neanderthal connections. but if I actually had my

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:10.851
mom, my dad, my brother, sister, my cousins. If I had them

00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:15.953
all participate in 23andMe, would I be able to see our interrelationships?

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:17.755
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really shows up strongly in our

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.390
DNA, that's right. For instance, if we compare Leticia

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.340
to her mother, father, and brother, we can see

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.580
which segments of her chromosomes match with which parent.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.870
We would expect Leticia to share 50% of her genetic material

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.360
with each, with her mother, father and brother. But the 50% will

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.010
look different for her parents compared to what she shared with her

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.400
brother. Can you tell which of these comparisons is with Leticia's brother?
