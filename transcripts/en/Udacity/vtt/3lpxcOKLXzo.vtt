00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's relatively easy to get some reasonable values for the time constants,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but it's pretty hard to estimate the heating value.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There's just something that we can do with this curve.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The reasonable value for this upper equilibrium is 1200 K.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Just from the color of the flames, the wood should be burning at this temperature.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, let's say that the ambient temperature is 300 K, the time constant for the heat loss is 2 minutes,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the time constant for burning is half an hour, and we've got a wood density of 100 kg/mÂ².

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
From this data, compute the value of h--the heating value

00:00:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and enter that as an integer number of K/kg/mÂ².
