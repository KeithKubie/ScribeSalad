explain a little bit how themes works on

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419
explain a little bit how themes works on
 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.170
explain a little bit how themes works on
the backside and our framework so let's

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180
the backside and our framework so let's
 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.939
the backside and our framework so let's
get started how exactly does nothing

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949
get started how exactly does nothing
 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.319
get started how exactly does nothing
work when you actually are using a theme

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:05.329
work when you actually are using a theme
 

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:07.329
work when you actually are using a theme
how does what happens in the back end

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:07.339
how does what happens in the back end
 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.309
how does what happens in the back end
actually makes it change the visual look

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319
actually makes it change the visual look
 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.619
actually makes it change the visual look
and feel well as my boy Shia would say

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629
and feel well as my boy Shia would say
 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.309
and feel well as my boy Shia would say
it's magic while I would love to say

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319
it's magic while I would love to say
 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.540
it's magic while I would love to say
this because that would be the easy way

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550
this because that would be the easy way
 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.939
this because that would be the easy way
out I'm not going to do that so let's

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949
out I'm not going to do that so let's
 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.029
out I'm not going to do that so let's
take a look at it a little bit so we

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039
take a look at it a little bit so we
 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.290
take a look at it a little bit so we
lovers a thing called the runtime

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300
lovers a thing called the runtime
 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.809
lovers a thing called the runtime
resource overlay Roo for short this was

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:25.819
resource overlay Roo for short this was
 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.159
resource overlay Roo for short this was
something that introduced by Sony a

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169
something that introduced by Sony a
 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.600
something that introduced by Sony a
couple years ago and it's actually an AO

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610
couple years ago and it's actually an AO
 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.619
couple years ago and it's actually an AO
SP right now

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629
SP right now
 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.749
SP right now
so we Andy masse actually I'm gonna put

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759
so we Andy masse actually I'm gonna put
 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.949
so we Andy masse actually I'm gonna put
him on the spot again this guy started

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:32.959
him on the spot again this guy started
 

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.029
him on the spot again this guy started
the foundation before I started here so

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039
the foundation before I started here so
 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.379
the foundation before I started here so
he actually started working on the RO

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389
he actually started working on the RO
 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.959
he actually started working on the RO
before I ever had a chance but we

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969
before I ever had a chance but we
 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:38.889
before I ever had a chance but we
leveraged something it's already named

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:38.899
leveraged something it's already named
 

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.420
leveraged something it's already named
SP it made sense right we don't want to

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430
SP it made sense right we don't want to
 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.610
SP it made sense right we don't want to
reinvent the wheel so we took that and

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620
reinvent the wheel so we took that and
 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.989
reinvent the wheel so we took that and
went a little step further to make it

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:43.999
went a little step further to make it
 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:45.530
went a little step further to make it
work with our theme engine

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540
work with our theme engine
 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.700
work with our theme engine
so what does ro do well it replaces

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710
so what does ro do well it replaces
 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.500
so what does ro do well it replaces
resources at runtime hence the name so

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510
resources at runtime hence the name so
 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.020
resources at runtime hence the name so
it does that by mapping resources from a

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030
it does that by mapping resources from a
 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.610
it does that by mapping resources from a
theme to the application so whenever we

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620
theme to the application so whenever we
 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.140
theme to the application so whenever we
want to get a resource from an

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150
want to get a resource from an
 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.390
want to get a resource from an
application it'll find the theme version

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400
application it'll find the theme version
 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.580
application it'll find the theme version
and give that back to us and so this

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590
and give that back to us and so this
 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.230
and give that back to us and so this
magic is really happening down at the

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240
magic is really happening down at the
 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.540
magic is really happening down at the
native layer we're doing this is in the

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550
native layer we're doing this is in the
 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.220
native layer we're doing this is in the
order of microseconds so we can fetch

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230
order of microseconds so we can fetch
 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.990
order of microseconds so we can fetch
these themed resources really quick so

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000
these themed resources really quick so
 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.730
these themed resources really quick so
we don't see an impact to the user so to

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740
we don't see an impact to the user so to
 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.810
we don't see an impact to the user so to
understand what's going on here we have

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820
understand what's going on here we have
 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.980
understand what's going on here we have
to have a little background on what

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990
to have a little background on what
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.340
to have a little background on what
resources are so what are resources in

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350
resources are so what are resources in
 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.320
resources are so what are resources in
application so they're not these

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330
application so they're not these
 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.190
application so they're not these
resources sorry what they are resources

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.200
resources sorry what they are resources
 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.540
resources sorry what they are resources
are just assets that application can

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550
are just assets that application can
 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.550
are just assets that application can
access besides the code it's got access

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560
access besides the code it's got access
 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.470
access besides the code it's got access
to things like what are called draw

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480
to things like what are called draw
 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.240
to things like what are called draw
bowls these can be bitmaps that can be

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250
bowls these can be bitmaps that can be
 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.040
bowls these can be bitmaps that can be
vector drawables which were introduced

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050
vector drawables which were introduced
 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.590
vector drawables which were introduced
in lollipop they can be shapes colored

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600
in lollipop they can be shapes colored
 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.730
in lollipop they can be shapes colored
drawables there's a plethora of

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740
drawables there's a plethora of
 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.260
drawables there's a plethora of
drawables that are accessible to an

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270
drawables that are accessible to an
 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.230
drawables that are accessible to an
application and themes can also

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240
application and themes can also
 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.940
application and themes can also
interchange these drawable so it can be

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:46.950
interchange these drawable so it can be
 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.070
interchange these drawable so it can be
a lot more flexible if I draw was a

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080
a lot more flexible if I draw was a
 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.990
a lot more flexible if I draw was a
bitmap we can turn into a vector draw we

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000
bitmap we can turn into a vector draw we
 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.610
bitmap we can turn into a vector draw we
can turn it into an animated draw bolt

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620
can turn it into an animated draw bolt
 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.560
can turn it into an animated draw bolt
so it becomes something much more than

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:54.570
so it becomes something much more than
 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.780
so it becomes something much more than
it originally was

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790
it originally was

there's layouts layouts to find the UI

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710
there's layouts layouts to find the UI
 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.250
there's layouts layouts to find the UI
to the for the application so this tells

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:01.260
to the for the application so this tells
 

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.110
to the for the application so this tells
where the views are in the in the layout

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120
where the views are in the in the layout
 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.630

where buttons are and stuff like that

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:05.640
where buttons are and stuff like that
 

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.190
where buttons are and stuff like that
there's XML which is usually just

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.840
colors dimensions they can be used for
padding text size and stuff like that

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:29.850
padding text size and stuff like that
 

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.060
padding text size and stuff like that
the strings the text that you see on

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.070
the strings the text that you see on
 

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.860
the strings the text that you see on
your buttons and in the UI is usually

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:33.870
your buttons and in the UI is usually
 

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.700
your buttons and in the UI is usually
defined in this XML values as well as

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:36.710
defined in this XML values as well as
 

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.560
defined in this XML values as well as
Styles now Styles is basically think of

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:39.570
Styles now Styles is basically think of
 

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.630
Styles now Styles is basically think of
it as a collection of attributes that

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640
it as a collection of attributes that
 

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.430
it as a collection of attributes that
determine how a theme or how an

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440
determine how a theme or how an
 

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.710
determine how a theme or how an
application looks or a UI element looks

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720
application looks or a UI element looks
 

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.600
application looks or a UI element looks
so we we've got this thing called a bag

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:47.610
so we we've got this thing called a bag
 

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.860
so we we've got this thing called a bag
that just takes all these attributes

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:48.870
that just takes all these attributes
 

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.410
that just takes all these attributes
puts them together and then displays

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420
puts them together and then displays
 

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.380
puts them together and then displays
those to the user so while we have

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:54.390
those to the user so while we have
 

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.090
those to the user so while we have
access to all these resources there's a

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.100
access to all these resources there's a
 

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.160
access to all these resources there's a
few that we do not allow the theme and

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.170
few that we do not allow the theme and
 

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.460
few that we do not allow the theme and
there

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:58.470
there
 

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.920
there
good reason for that layouts we don't a

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:00.930
good reason for that layouts we don't a
 

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.110
good reason for that layouts we don't a
lot of theme because applications update

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120
lot of theme because applications update
 

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.740
lot of theme because applications update
all the time

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:03.750
all the time
 

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.900
all the time
and if an application gets updated and

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:05.910
and if an application gets updated and
 

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.550
and if an application gets updated and
they add a new view or they change their

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560
they add a new view or they change their
 

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.620
they add a new view or they change their
layout if we theme that they're gonna

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:09.630
layout if we theme that they're gonna
 

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.990
layout if we theme that they're gonna
now try to get that part of the UI

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000
now try to get that part of the UI
 

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.490
now try to get that part of the UI
that's not there now because it's been

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.500
that's not there now because it's been
 

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.900
that's not there now because it's been
themed and they're gonna the apps gonna

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:14.910
themed and they're gonna the apps gonna
 

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.910
themed and they're gonna the apps gonna
crash so it looks bad and usually the

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920
crash so it looks bad and usually the
 

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.140
crash so it looks bad and usually the
user doesn't see the theme is the

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.150
user doesn't see the theme is the
 

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.210
user doesn't see the theme is the
culprit they see the application and the

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220
culprit they see the application and the
 

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.970
culprit they see the application and the
app is the culprit so we don't want

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:21.980
app is the culprit so we don't want
 

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.990
app is the culprit so we don't want
application developers to be blamed for

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000
application developers to be blamed for
 

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.520
application developers to be blamed for
stuff that our theme engine could be

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:25.530
stuff that our theme engine could be
 

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.290
stuff that our theme engine could be
doing so that's off-limits

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300
doing so that's off-limits
 

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.610
doing so that's off-limits
XML just doesn't make sense because

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620
XML just doesn't make sense because
 

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.380
XML just doesn't make sense because
that's generic to the application or

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:30.390
that's generic to the application or
 

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.820
that's generic to the application or
specific to the application so there's

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:31.830
specific to the application so there's
 

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.130
specific to the application so there's
no need to do that a raise a raise will

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140
no need to do that a raise a raise will
 

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.600
no need to do that a raise a raise will
usually a collection of values and those

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:35.610
usually a collection of values and those
 

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.690
usually a collection of values and those
values can be other resources like color

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:38.700
values can be other resources like color
 

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.460
values can be other resources like color
so those can be themed elsewhere so we

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.470
so those can be themed elsewhere so we
 

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.770
so those can be themed elsewhere so we
don't touch arrays we don't touch things

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:42.780
don't touch arrays we don't touch things
 

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.420
don't touch arrays we don't touch things
like boolean cuz billions can change

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:44.430
like boolean cuz billions can change
 

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.340
like boolean cuz billions can change
values true or false and a theme could

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:46.350
values true or false and a theme could
 

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.780
values true or false and a theme could
potentially enable something the

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:47.790
potentially enable something the
 

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.010
potentially enable something the
developer didn't want enabled because

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.020
developer didn't want enabled because
 

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.260
developer didn't want enabled because
they were using a boolean value and then

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.270
they were using a boolean value and then
 

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.180
they were using a boolean value and then
string strings we should be changing

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.190
string strings we should be changing
 

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.580
string strings we should be changing
text anyways an app theme could militia

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.590
text anyways an app theme could militia
 

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.290
text anyways an app theme could militia
be malicious and maybe fish and change

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300
be malicious and maybe fish and change
 

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.300
be malicious and maybe fish and change
text and they change the icon of an app

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310
text and they change the icon of an app
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.560
text and they change the icon of an app
and now they change the text to make it

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:00.570
and now they change the text to make it
 

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.820
and now they change the text to make it
look like a banking app or something

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:01.830
look like a banking app or something
 

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.200
look like a banking app or something
like that and then there's a whole

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.210
like that and then there's a whole
 

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.300
like that and then there's a whole
aspect of translations and locales I

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.310
aspect of translations and locales I
 

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.350
aspect of translations and locales I
mean if you theme a string you're

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360
mean if you theme a string you're
 

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.880
mean if you theme a string you're
basically gonna have to provide all the

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:07.890
basically gonna have to provide all the
 

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.680
basically gonna have to provide all the
translations for it too and it's poor

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:09.690
translations for it too and it's poor
 

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.510
translations for it too and it's poor
user experience so those those types of

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:11.520
user experience so those those types of
 

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.480
user experience so those those types of
things are off limits so now that we

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:14.490
things are off limits so now that we
 

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.340
things are off limits so now that we
understand what resources are there's a

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:16.350
understand what resources are there's a
 

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.480
understand what resources are there's a
couple way that an application actually

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.490
couple way that an application actually
 

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.720
couple way that an application actually
asks accesses these resources one of

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:20.730
asks accesses these resources one of
 

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.340
asks accesses these resources one of
those is via XML so here I've got an

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.350
those is via XML so here I've got an
 

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.570
those is via XML so here I've got an
example this is actually a vector

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580
example this is actually a vector
 

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.250
example this is actually a vector
drawable that was introduced in lollipop

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260
drawable that was introduced in lollipop
 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.430
drawable that was introduced in lollipop
this one happens to be of our

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440
this one happens to be of our
 

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.860
this one happens to be of our
CyanogenMod mascot Sid and if you look

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:30.870
CyanogenMod mascot Sid and if you look
 

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.150
CyanogenMod mascot Sid and if you look
here in the red there's a reference here

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160
here in the red there's a reference here
 

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.460
here in the red there's a reference here
called at color cyan that's a color we

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:34.470
called at color cyan that's a color we
 

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.080
called at color cyan that's a color we
defined elsewhere an application it's

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.090
defined elsewhere an application it's
 

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.340
defined elsewhere an application it's
one of those resources and so now

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:37.350
one of those resources and so now
 

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.290
one of those resources and so now
whenever this icon is drawn it's gonna

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300
whenever this icon is drawn it's gonna
 

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.880
whenever this icon is drawn it's gonna
fetch that color and it's gonna be drawn

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:40.890
fetch that color and it's gonna be drawn
 

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.160
fetch that color and it's gonna be drawn
in that now a theme could now change

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.170
in that now a theme could now change
 

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.900
in that now a theme could now change
that color and so Sid could be instead

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:44.910
that color and so Sid could be instead
 

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.510
that color and so Sid could be instead
of cyan he's now purple or maybe pink

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:47.520
of cyan he's now purple or maybe pink
 

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.890
of cyan he's now purple or maybe pink
you know depends on what the theme ur

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:48.900
you know depends on what the theme ur
 

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.440
you know depends on what the theme ur
want the other way we can access

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:51.450
want the other way we can access
 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.870
want the other way we can access
resources is via code so an application

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880
resources is via code so an application
 

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.720
resources is via code so an application
developer might want to access certain

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:55.730
developer might want to access certain
 

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.340
developer might want to access certain
resources so they can do that one

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:58.350
resources so they can do that one
 

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.630
resources so they can do that one
important thing is they need to import

00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640
important thing is they need to import
 

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.620
important thing is they need to import
this our Java class so Java has to let

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:03.630
this our Java class so Java has to let
 

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.420
this our Java class so Java has to let
Java know of what classes and stuff

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:05.430
Java know of what classes and stuff
 

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.410
Java know of what classes and stuff

you're going to be using in your code
 

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.120
you're going to be using in your code
you have to import it so this is a

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.130
you have to import it so this is a
 

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.650
you have to import it so this is a
specific class that gets generated at

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660

what's going on in the hood so I'm

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760
what's going on in the hood so I'm

actually gonna provide a little details
 

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.350
actually gonna provide a little details
for that for you but in this case we're

for that for you but in this case we're
 

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.120
for that for you but in this case we're
trying to get a string in a drawable via

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.130
trying to get a string in a drawable via
 

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.620
trying to get a string in a drawable via
code and we're accessing them using that

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:22.630
code and we're accessing them using that
 

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.990
code and we're accessing them using that
art class and for Strings we're using

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000
art class and for Strings we're using
 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.639
art class and for Strings we're using
our dot string and for drawable so we're

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:26.649
our dot string and for drawable so we're
 

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:28.590
our dot string and for drawable so we're
using our that drawable so it's an easy

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600
using our that drawable so it's an easy
 

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.590
using our that drawable so it's an easy
way to get those resources both in XML

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600
way to get those resources both in XML
 

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.470
way to get those resources both in XML
and to the application in code so now

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480
and to the application in code so now
 

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.579
and to the application in code so now
we're going to talk about resource IDs

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:35.589
we're going to talk about resource IDs
 

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:37.980
we're going to talk about resource IDs
and we did have a problem here earlier

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:37.990
and we did have a problem here earlier
 

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.110
and we did have a problem here earlier
getting access but SIDS is helping us

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120
getting access but SIDS is helping us
 

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.180
getting access but SIDS is helping us
out so we've got our idea we can get

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:42.190
out so we've got our idea we can get
 

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.990
out so we've got our idea we can get
past this now so resource IDs this is

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000
past this now so resource IDs this is
 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.320
past this now so resource IDs this is
the meat and potatoes of how resources

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.330
the meat and potatoes of how resources
 

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.240
the meat and potatoes of how resources
are provided to an application at

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.250
are provided to an application at
 

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.790
are provided to an application at
runtime now as I mentioned these

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800
runtime now as I mentioned these
 

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.769
runtime now as I mentioned these
resources like these are generated at

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:55.779
resources like these are generated at
 

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:58.530
resources like these are generated at
Build time from a tool called a apt and

generate the r.java for you so you can

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:06.310
generate the r.java for you so you can
 

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.400
generate the r.java for you so you can
access that via code and it also creates

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:08.410
access that via code and it also creates
 

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.110
access that via code and it also creates
this thing called a resource table that

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120
this thing called a resource table that
 

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.329
this thing called a resource table that
has all those IDs stored in it in a

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:12.339
has all those IDs stored in it in a
 

00:12:12.339 --> 00:12:13.920
has all those IDs stored in it in a
format that it can quickly access at

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:13.930
format that it can quickly access at
 

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.340
format that it can quickly access at
runtime so it's a very efficient system

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:16.350
runtime so it's a very efficient system
 

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.930
runtime so it's a very efficient system
the resource IDs are unique to the

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:18.940
the resource IDs are unique to the
 

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.880
the resource IDs are unique to the
application but they're not always the

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:20.890
application but they're not always the
 

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.710
application but they're not always the
same IDs across different applications

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720
same IDs across different applications
 

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.040
same IDs across different applications
it can vary so research like it's just

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.050
it can vary so research like it's just

resource ID that get tagged on so you

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:53.649
resource ID that get tagged on so you
 

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:55.050
resource ID that get tagged on so you
got a package ID that tells the system

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:55.060
got a package ID that tells the system
 

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.880

area where those types are it's got an

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839
area where those types are it's got an
 

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:15.120
area where those types are it's got an
entry index and that just tells it

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.130
entry index and that just tells it
 

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.680
entry index and that just tells it
really quickly where to go in memory to

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:16.690
really quickly where to go in memory to
 

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.050
really quickly where to go in memory to
fetch that resource for you so using

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.060
fetch that resource for you so using
 

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.180
fetch that resource for you so using
these three values it can quickly grab a

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.190
these three values it can quickly grab a
 

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.340
these three values it can quickly grab a
resource at runtime and bring it right

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:23.350
resource at runtime and bring it right
 

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.480
resource at runtime and bring it right
back to the application to be used

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.490
back to the application to be used
 

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.210
back to the application to be used
whether it's in

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:25.220
whether it's in
 

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.869
whether it's in
outs code so okay we've got resource IDs

00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:28.879
outs code so okay we've got resource IDs
 

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:31.449
outs code so okay we've got resource IDs
we have resources now how do we get the

00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:31.459
we have resources now how do we get the
 

00:13:31.459 --> 00:13:33.550
we have resources now how do we get the
theme to mix to work with all this right

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560
theme to mix to work with all this right
 

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.949
theme to mix to work with all this right
so there's a tool called ID map this is

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959
so there's a tool called ID map this is
 

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:38.019
so there's a tool called ID map this is
a built in with Android system it's a

00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:38.029
a built in with Android system it's a
 

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:39.999
a built in with Android system it's a
binary that runs at when the apps

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:40.009
binary that runs at when the apps
 

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:41.800
binary that runs at when the apps
installed when the theme is installed

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:41.810
installed when the theme is installed
 

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.110
installed when the theme is installed
and basically what it does is it creates

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.120
and basically what it does is it creates
 

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.139
and basically what it does is it creates
a mapping from the application to

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:47.149
a mapping from the application to
 

00:13:47.149 --> 00:13:50.199
a mapping from the application to
resources that map it to that one in not

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:50.209
resources that map it to that one in not
 

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:52.480
resources that map it to that one in not
theme so it's using those resource IDs

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:52.490
theme so it's using those resource IDs
 

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.499
theme so it's using those resource IDs
it basically goes through the theme

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:53.509
it basically goes through the theme
 

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:55.329
it basically goes through the theme
looks at all the different resources it

00:13:55.329 --> 00:13:55.339
looks at all the different resources it
 

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:57.220
looks at all the different resources it
has and first it it looks at the type

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:57.230
has and first it it looks at the type
 

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.329
has and first it it looks at the type
okay

00:13:58.329 --> 00:13:58.339
okay
 

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:00.189
okay
the type needs to match a drawable needs

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199
the type needs to match a drawable needs
 

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:01.869
the type needs to match a drawable needs
to match to a drawable a string to

00:14:01.869 --> 00:14:01.879
to match to a drawable a string to
 

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:03.040
to match to a drawable a string to
string so FAR's you can't make some

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.050
string so FAR's you can't make some
 

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.259
string so FAR's you can't make some
match you can't have a dimension being

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:05.269
match you can't have a dimension being
 

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:06.910
match you can't have a dimension being
mapped to a color so that stuff that's

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920
mapped to a color so that stuff that's
 

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.710
mapped to a color so that stuff that's
the first constraint the second one is

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720
the first constraint the second one is
 

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.910
the first constraint the second one is
the name of those resources have to

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920
the name of those resources have to
 

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.379
the name of those resources have to
match so before you saw in my example I

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:11.389
match so before you saw in my example I
 

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:13.689
match so before you saw in my example I
had like my app icon and stuff like that

00:14:13.689 --> 00:14:13.699
had like my app icon and stuff like that
 

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:16.179
had like my app icon and stuff like that
so those names need to match and once it

00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:16.189
so those names need to match and once it
 

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.499
so those names need to match and once it
finds that matching between those two

00:14:17.499 --> 00:14:17.509
finds that matching between those two
 

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:19.660
finds that matching between those two
values it'll say okay the applications

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:19.670
values it'll say okay the applications
 

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.639
values it'll say okay the applications
resource ID is this the things resources

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:21.649
resource ID is this the things resources
 

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:23.350
resource ID is this the things resources
ID is this so now it knows that whenever

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360
ID is this so now it knows that whenever
 

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.179
ID is this so now it knows that whenever
I asked for this guy it can just point

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:25.189
I asked for this guy it can just point
 

00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:26.470
I asked for this guy it can just point
directly to this one and fetch that

big piece of the visual landscape when a
 

00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:31.210
big piece of the visual landscape when a
user is interacting on your device so

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:31.220
user is interacting on your device so
 

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.519

however your imagination wants to be you
can sit there and go and create just a

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:43.940
can sit there and go and create just a
 

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.370
can sit there and go and create just a
whole different look for each one and

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:45.380
whole different look for each one and
 

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.250
whole different look for each one and
craft each one individually to have that

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:48.260
craft each one individually to have that
 

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.669
craft each one individually to have that
unique feel now let's say you don't want

00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679
unique feel now let's say you don't want
 

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:54.009
unique feel now let's say you don't want
to have to make a thousand icons because

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:54.019
to have to make a thousand icons because
 

00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:56.470
to have to make a thousand icons because
that's just a lot of work we offer the

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480
that's just a lot of work we offer the
 

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.720
that's just a lot of work we offer the
ability to compose icons using a couple

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:58.730
ability to compose icons using a couple
 

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.610
ability to compose icons using a couple
images and they'll be able to cover a

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:00.620
images and they'll be able to cover a
 

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.970
images and they'll be able to cover a
limitless unlimited amount sorry of icon

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:03.980
limitless unlimited amount sorry of icon
 

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.019
limitless unlimited amount sorry of icon
so what you see here is essentially

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:06.029
so what you see here is essentially
 

00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:07.969
so what you see here is essentially
sandwich of layers all right so we start

00:20:07.969 --> 00:20:07.979
sandwich of layers all right so we start
 

00:20:07.979 --> 00:20:09.680
sandwich of layers all right so we start
at the bottom with our little backplate

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:09.690
at the bottom with our little backplate
 

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.149
at the bottom with our little backplate
down here and what happens is you can

00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159
down here and what happens is you can
 

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:12.769
down here and what happens is you can
create this back plate and that's gonna

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:12.779
create this back plate and that's gonna
 

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:14.570
create this back plate and that's gonna
be the first thing that gets put into

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580
be the first thing that gets put into
 

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.310
be the first thing that gets put into
the canvas the next thing you're gonna

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320
the canvas the next thing you're gonna
 

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.580
the canvas the next thing you're gonna
see would be the icon that is provided

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:19.590
see would be the icon that is provided
 

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.469
see would be the icon that is provided
by the separate application so again

00:20:21.469 --> 00:20:21.479
by the separate application so again
 

00:20:21.479 --> 00:20:23.209
by the separate application so again
like Facebook that's the icon from

00:20:23.209 --> 00:20:23.219
like Facebook that's the icon from
 

00:20:23.219 --> 00:20:24.979
like Facebook that's the icon from
Facebook and then you can create this

00:20:24.979 --> 00:20:24.989
Facebook and then you can create this
 

00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:27.229
Facebook and then you can create this
masking layer so what a mask does is it

00:20:27.229 --> 00:20:27.239
masking layer so what a mask does is it
 

00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:30.200
masking layer so what a mask does is it
allows you to essentially create a space

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.210
allows you to essentially create a space
 

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.239
allows you to essentially create a space
that you only want to show so if you

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:32.249
that you only want to show so if you
 

00:20:32.249 --> 00:20:34.609
that you only want to show so if you
wanted like a star you could create the

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:34.619
wanted like a star you could create the
 

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:36.919
wanted like a star you could create the
star in the star inside is the only bit

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:36.929
star in the star inside is the only bit
 

00:20:36.929 --> 00:20:38.570
star in the star inside is the only bit
that's gonna show and then it's like you

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580
that's gonna show and then it's like you
 

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.489
that's gonna show and then it's like you
scissor out the rest of it so for in

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:40.499
scissor out the rest of it so for in
 

00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:41.719
scissor out the rest of it so for in
this one it looks like a fingerprint

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:41.729
this one it looks like a fingerprint
 

00:20:41.729 --> 00:20:42.769
this one it looks like a fingerprint
that's what's gonna see and I'll show

00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:42.779
that's what's gonna see and I'll show
 

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:44.359
that's what's gonna see and I'll show
you that in a second and then on the top

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:44.369
you that in a second and then on the top
 

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.549
you that in a second and then on the top
it would be an overlay so maybe you

00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559
it would be an overlay so maybe you
 

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:47.599
it would be an overlay so maybe you
could do something like you want to

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:47.609
could do something like you want to
 

00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:49.999
could do something like you want to
create like a divers helmet so you could

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:50.009
create like a divers helmet so you could
 

00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:51.440
create like a divers helmet so you could
have the background of the divers helmet

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:51.450
have the background of the divers helmet
 

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.690
have the background of the divers helmet
have that ink icon on the center part

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700
have that ink icon on the center part
 

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.219
have that ink icon on the center part
and then you could actually stamp the

00:20:55.219 --> 00:20:55.229
and then you could actually stamp the
 

00:20:55.229 --> 00:20:57.139
and then you could actually stamp the
visor over it and have this kind of

00:20:57.139 --> 00:20:57.149
visor over it and have this kind of
 

00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:58.820
visor over it and have this kind of
glassy look that would cover the top of

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:58.830
glassy look that would cover the top of
 

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.149
glassy look that would cover the top of
it giving you this really cool look so

00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159
it giving you this really cool look so
 

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.560
it giving you this really cool look so
you've made all of those layers how do

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:03.570
you've made all of those layers how do
 

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.479
you've made all of those layers how do
those work it's really really simple

00:21:05.479 --> 00:21:05.489
those work it's really really simple
 

00:21:05.489 --> 00:21:07.849
those work it's really really simple
within the icons component there's a

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:07.859
within the icons component there's a
 

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:09.829
within the icons component there's a
file called the app filter and with just

00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:09.839
file called the app filter and with just
 

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.659
file called the app filter and with just
these four lines right here we can

00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:11.669
these four lines right here we can
 

00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:13.519
these four lines right here we can
create this system where we have the

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:13.529
create this system where we have the
 

00:21:13.529 --> 00:21:15.619
create this system where we have the
icon backplate that we made earlier the

00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:15.629
icon backplate that we made earlier the
 

00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:17.749
icon backplate that we made earlier the
mask as well as the overlay and then

00:21:17.749 --> 00:21:17.759
mask as well as the overlay and then
 

00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:19.789
mask as well as the overlay and then
there's an additional attribute called

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799
there's an additional attribute called
 

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:22.039
there's an additional attribute called
the scale factor so you can actually

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:22.049
the scale factor so you can actually
 

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:25.279
the scale factor so you can actually
scale the stock icons up or down to fit

00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:25.289
scale the stock icons up or down to fit
 

00:21:25.289 --> 00:21:26.060
scale the stock icons up or down to fit
your needs

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.070
your needs
 

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.159
your needs
so if you want them to be up to fill out

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:28.169
so if you want them to be up to fill out
 

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:29.359
so if you want them to be up to fill out
the space that you're gonna be cutting

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:29.369
the space that you're gonna be cutting
 

00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:31.039
the space that you're gonna be cutting
out with the mask you can scale them up

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:31.049
out with the mask you can scale them up
 

00:21:31.049 --> 00:21:32.599
out with the mask you can scale them up
a bit like we've done here to make sure

00:21:32.599 --> 00:21:32.609
a bit like we've done here to make sure
 

00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:35.509
a bit like we've done here to make sure
that some of the edges are not still

00:21:35.509 --> 00:21:35.519
that some of the edges are not still
 

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:36.979
that some of the edges are not still
within the masking so what would that

00:21:36.979 --> 00:21:36.989
within the masking so what would that
 

00:21:36.989 --> 00:21:39.019
within the masking so what would that
look like on device well those layers

00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:39.029
look like on device well those layers
 

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:40.549
look like on device well those layers
that we just had two slides ago this is

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559
that we just had two slides ago this is
 

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:41.659
that we just had two slides ago this is
what they look like when they get

00:21:41.659 --> 00:21:41.669
what they look like when they get
 

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:44.119
what they look like when they get
composed together so for four images

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:44.129
composed together so for four images
 

00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:46.219
composed together so for four images
you're able to get a unique icon set

00:21:46.219 --> 00:21:46.229
you're able to get a unique icon set
 

00:21:46.229 --> 00:21:49.579
you're able to get a unique icon set
that will scale up to however many apps

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:49.589
that will scale up to however many apps
 

00:21:49.589 --> 00:21:50.930
that will scale up to however many apps
that a user has installed in their

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940
that a user has installed in their
 

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.450

we've talked about icons let's talk

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:01.349
we've talked about icons let's talk
 

00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:04.219
we've talked about icons let's talk
about overlays what's an overlay well so

00:22:04.219 --> 00:22:04.229
about overlays what's an overlay well so
 

00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:06.139
about overlays what's an overlay well so
for every package on the user's device

00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:06.149
for every package on the user's device
 

00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:09.320
for every package on the user's device
there's going to be resources that are

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:09.330
there's going to be resources that are
 

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.599
there's going to be resources that are
specific to that package so the theme is

00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:11.609
specific to that package so the theme is
 

00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:13.279
specific to that package so the theme is
able to break these down so you'll have

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:13.289
able to break these down so you'll have
 

00:22:13.289 --> 00:22:14.690
able to break these down so you'll have
your tree structure which will have the

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700
your tree structure which will have the
 

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.310
your tree structure which will have the
assets your overlays and then you're

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320
assets your overlays and then you're
 

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.200
assets your overlays and then you're
gonna be able to call out so every every

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.210
gonna be able to call out so every every
 

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.290
gonna be able to call out so every every
app has a package

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:19.300
app has a package
 

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.600
app has a package
so if it was you know the system UI

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:21.610
so if it was you know the system UI
 

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.800
so if it was you know the system UI
which is your pulldown bars

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:22.810
which is your pulldown bars
 

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.860
which is your pulldown bars
calm Android dot system UI and the same

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:25.870
calm Android dot system UI and the same
 

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.660
calm Android dot system UI and the same
thing for the phone and for Settings

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:27.670
thing for the phone and for Settings
 

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.920
thing for the phone and for Settings
each one of those is going to be a

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:28.930
each one of those is going to be a
 

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.510
each one of those is going to be a
separate overlay directory where you'll

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.520
separate overlay directory where you'll
 

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.270
separate overlay directory where you'll
be able to house the specific resources

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280
be able to house the specific resources
 

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.460
be able to house the specific resources
for that one so we'll dive into that

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:35.470
for that one so we'll dive into that
 

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.350
for that one so we'll dive into that
just a little further right now but I

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360
just a little further right now but I
 

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.660
just a little further right now but I
want to talk about common first now

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:39.670
want to talk about common first now
 

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.380
want to talk about common first now
common is a unique feature to our theme

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:43.390
common is a unique feature to our theme
 

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.630
common is a unique feature to our theme
engine that allows you to have a central

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640
engine that allows you to have a central
 

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.730
engine that allows you to have a central
location that's accessible to all of the

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:47.740
location that's accessible to all of the
 

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.280
location that's accessible to all of the
other application overlays within the

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:50.290
other application overlays within the
 

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:54.030
other application overlays within the
theme so if you're going to be using a

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:54.040
theme so if you're going to be using a
 

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.560
theme so if you're going to be using a
single color throughout your theme maybe

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.570
single color throughout your theme maybe
 

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.090
single color throughout your theme maybe
you want to make a blue theme what you

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.100
you want to make a blue theme what you
 

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.890
you want to make a blue theme what you
can do is you can include the blue color

00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:58.900
can do is you can include the blue color
 

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.840
can do is you can include the blue color
within your common overlay and then

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:00.850
within your common overlay and then
 

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.080
within your common overlay and then
reference that value in all the other

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:04.090
reference that value in all the other
 

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.400
reference that value in all the other
ones so instead of having to say like

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.410
ones so instead of having to say like
 

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.040
ones so instead of having to say like
your hex code is you know whatever it is

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.050
your hex code is you know whatever it is
 

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.390
your hex code is you know whatever it is
you don't have to put that in every

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400
you don't have to put that in every
 

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.160
you don't have to put that in every
specific overlay you can put it in one

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.170
specific overlay you can put it in one
 

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.020
specific overlay you can put it in one
location and then tweak that in the

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.030
location and then tweak that in the
 

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.850
location and then tweak that in the
future so you know you've been working

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:14.860
future so you know you've been working
 

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.290
future so you know you've been working
on this for a couple weeks and you

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:16.300
on this for a couple weeks and you
 

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.450
on this for a couple weeks and you
realize that that blue is just not

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:18.460
realize that that blue is just not
 

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.610
realize that that blue is just not
saturated right so all you have to do is

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:20.620
saturated right so all you have to do is
 

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.100
saturated right so all you have to do is
update in the one location and it'll

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.110
update in the one location and it'll
 

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.420
update in the one location and it'll
populate throughout the rest of the

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:24.430
populate throughout the rest of the
 

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.070
populate throughout the rest of the
theme and you won't have to worry about

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080
theme and you won't have to worry about
 

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.960
theme and you won't have to worry about
it after that and again this common

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:27.970
it after that and again this common
 

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.930
it after that and again this common
folder is magical it works with

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:30.940
folder is magical it works with
 

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.240
folder is magical it works with
everything drawable Styles colors

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:33.250
everything drawable Styles colors
 

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.550
everything drawable Styles colors
dimensions you can put anything that the

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:35.560
dimensions you can put anything that the
 

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.350
dimensions you can put anything that the
theme engine can cover you can put in

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360
theme engine can cover you can put in
 

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.670
theme engine can cover you can put in
there and that's gonna allow you to save

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:38.680
there and that's gonna allow you to save
 

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.470
there and that's gonna allow you to save
space in your theme because you're not

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480
space in your theme because you're not
 

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.940
space in your theme because you're not
gonna have to duplicate the same thing

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:41.950
gonna have to duplicate the same thing
 

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.740
gonna have to duplicate the same thing
over and over

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:42.750
over and over
 

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.050
over and over
so let's look up how an overlay might

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:46.060
so let's look up how an overlay might
 

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.960
so let's look up how an overlay might
get put together so here we have

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:47.970
get put together so here we have
 

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.330
get put together so here we have
settings so what are some of the items

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:51.340
settings so what are some of the items
 

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.460
settings so what are some of the items
on here well we have the action bar in

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:53.470
on here well we have the action bar in
 

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.200
on here well we have the action bar in
particular this action bar is actually

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.210
particular this action bar is actually
 

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.750
particular this action bar is actually
going to be controlled by a style within

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760
going to be controlled by a style within
 

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.530
going to be controlled by a style within
the app so we look here and so a big

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:01.540
the app so we look here and so a big
 

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.450
the app so we look here and so a big
part of creating a theme is actually

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:03.460
part of creating a theme is actually
 

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.420
part of creating a theme is actually
having to dive in and look how each

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:05.430
having to dive in and look how each
 

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.700
having to dive in and look how each
application is made up and luckily

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:08.710
application is made up and luckily
 

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.950
application is made up and luckily
enough most of the sources available

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960
enough most of the sources available
 

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.720
enough most of the sources available
right on github so you can go in and see

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:12.730
right on github so you can go in and see
 

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.120
right on github so you can go in and see
how settings is made how dialer is made

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.130
how settings is made how dialer is made
 

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.680
how settings is made how dialer is made
and so forth so for this one for the

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:16.690
and so forth so for this one for the
 

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.450
and so forth so for this one for the
action bar the theme this one what we're

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:18.460
action bar the theme this one what we're
 

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.310
action bar the theme this one what we're
going to do is the pre-existing style

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320
going to do is the pre-existing style
 

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.290
going to do is the pre-existing style
theme that action bar is part of the

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:22.300
theme that action bar is part of the
 

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.330
theme that action bar is part of the
settings because we want to have a

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:24.340
settings because we want to have a
 

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.400
settings because we want to have a
reusable action bar that we can use in

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:26.410
reusable action bar that we can use in
 

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:27.570
reusable action bar that we can use in
some other different styles we're

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:27.580
some other different styles we're
 

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.070
some other different styles we're
actually going to create our own style

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080
actually going to create our own style
 

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.440
actually going to create our own style
called Sinjin dot action bar and that's

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:31.450
called Sinjin dot action bar and that's
 

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.740
called Sinjin dot action bar and that's
going to allow us to cover all

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:32.750
going to allow us to cover all
 

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.960
going to allow us to cover all
different visual aspects of this so

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:34.970
different visual aspects of this so
 

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.840
different visual aspects of this so
we'll be able to change the background

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:36.850
we'll be able to change the background
 

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.850
we'll be able to change the background
normally this is an elevated action bar

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:39.860
normally this is an elevated action bar
 

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.770
normally this is an elevated action bar
but you can set that elevation value to

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:41.780
but you can set that elevation value to
 

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.510
but you can set that elevation value to
zero and be able to get that back down

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520
zero and be able to get that back down
 

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.890
zero and be able to get that back down
on the same plane as the rest of the

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:44.900
on the same plane as the rest of the
 

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.660
on the same plane as the rest of the
settings and so forth you don't even see

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:46.670
settings and so forth you don't even see
 

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.030
settings and so forth you don't even see
we make use of the common styles over

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.040
we make use of the common styles over
 

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.080
we make use of the common styles over
here so that's for the text rate up here

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.090
here so that's for the text rate up here
 

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.340
here so that's for the text rate up here
we actually have that put in the

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:54.350
we actually have that put in the
 

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.830
we actually have that put in the
comments so if I want to go into like

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840
comments so if I want to go into like
 

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.630
comments so if I want to go into like
the messaging app I can reference that

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640
the messaging app I can reference that
 

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.340
the messaging app I can reference that
same style and I'll know that my title

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:00.350
same style and I'll know that my title
 

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.840
same style and I'll know that my title
text is going to be the same across

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:01.850
text is going to be the same across
 

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.870
text is going to be the same across
every single app that I'm female what

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880
every single app that I'm female what
 

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.070
every single app that I'm female what
are some other aspects that we can do

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080
are some other aspects that we can do
 

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.020
are some other aspects that we can do
well so we have all of these icons right

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.030
well so we have all of these icons right
 

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.030
well so we have all of these icons right
here so in this case these are actually

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:10.040
here so in this case these are actually
 

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.370
here so in this case these are actually
vector drawables and we have those so

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:12.380
vector drawables and we have those so
 

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.780
vector drawables and we have those so
each one of these is going to be a file

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:13.790
each one of these is going to be a file
 

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.790
each one of these is going to be a file
that has all of the point data that

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:15.800
that has all of the point data that
 

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.620
that has all of the point data that
makes up the shape and you again you'll

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:17.630
makes up the shape and you again you'll
 

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.330
makes up the shape and you again you'll
see that we actually have that common

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:19.340
see that we actually have that common
 

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.430
see that we actually have that common
folder again so we have a color so each

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440
folder again so we have a color so each
 

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.690
folder again so we have a color so each
one of these is going to be using a

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:22.700
one of these is going to be using a
 

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.400
one of these is going to be using a
color and we just reference that in the

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:24.410
color and we just reference that in the
 

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.230
color and we just reference that in the
common folder and again so if you don't

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240
common folder and again so if you don't
 

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.490
common folder and again so if you don't
like the way that green looks anymore

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:27.500
like the way that green looks anymore
 

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.470
like the way that green looks anymore
you can change it one time and it's

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480
you can change it one time and it's
 

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.270
you can change it one time and it's
gonna work in all those files so you

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:31.280
gonna work in all those files so you
 

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.010
gonna work in all those files so you
don't have to go through you know 30

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:33.020
don't have to go through you know 30
 

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.870
don't have to go through you know 30
different image vector drawables and be

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880
different image vector drawables and be
 

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.280
different image vector drawables and be
like I didn't like that one let me

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:36.290
like I didn't like that one let me
 

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.380
like I didn't like that one let me
change the hex code again nope nice and

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:38.390
change the hex code again nope nice and
 

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.610
change the hex code again nope nice and
easy and simple with the common folder

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:39.620
easy and simple with the common folder
 

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.310
easy and simple with the common folder
what are some other things well let's

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320
what are some other things well let's
 

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.960
what are some other things well let's
look at how this is really composed so

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:43.970
look at how this is really composed so
 

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.030
look at how this is really composed so
this entire screen is going to be using

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:46.040
this entire screen is going to be using
 

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.040
this entire screen is going to be using
this style called theme that settings

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.050
this style called theme that settings
 

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.830
this style called theme that settings
base there's a lot of different things

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840
base there's a lot of different things
 

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.030
base there's a lot of different things
here so I know it looks a little but

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.040
here so I know it looks a little but
 

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.130
here so I know it looks a little but
once you start doing a lot it actually

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:54.140
once you start doing a lot it actually
 

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.120
once you start doing a lot it actually
starts to make sense so there's

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:55.130
starts to make sense so there's
 

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.470
starts to make sense so there's
different effects that you can control

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480
different effects that you can control
 

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.290
different effects that you can control
like the color background right so I'm

00:25:59.290 --> 00:25:59.300
like the color background right so I'm
 

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.910
like the color background right so I'm
pointing that to a common value theme

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:00.920
pointing that to a common value theme
 

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.040
pointing that to a common value theme
background so that way in every app I

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.050
background so that way in every app I
 

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.810
background so that way in every app I
can make my background color the same

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:04.820
can make my background color the same
 

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.430
can make my background color the same
because again I'm using that common

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440
because again I'm using that common
 

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.530
because again I'm using that common
folder I think you're gonna start to see

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:08.540
folder I think you're gonna start to see
 

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.050
folder I think you're gonna start to see
the theme here same thing with

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:11.060
the theme here same thing with
 

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.400
the theme here same thing with
everything else like the theme edge so

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.410
everything else like the theme edge so
 

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.720
everything else like the theme edge so
that's like when you do the over scroll

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:13.730
that's like when you do the over scroll
 

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.890
that's like when you do the over scroll
it does like a little bit of a color

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:14.900
it does like a little bit of a color
 

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.390
it does like a little bit of a color
that's something you can also control

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400
that's something you can also control
 

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.230
that's something you can also control
it's pretty much every aspect on the

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240
it's pretty much every aspect on the
 

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.240
it's pretty much every aspect on the
screen is tweakable within a theme and

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.250
screen is tweakable within a theme and
 

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.280
screen is tweakable within a theme and
you can really create this custom look

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.290
you can really create this custom look
 

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.680
you can really create this custom look
that just really just is different so

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:26.690
that just really just is different so
 

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.880
that just really just is different so
there's some other stuff too we've been

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:27.890
there's some other stuff too we've been
 

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.350
there's some other stuff too we've been
talking about colors what about

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360
talking about colors what about
 

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.080
talking about colors what about
dimensions so you can do things like the

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:32.090
dimensions so you can do things like the
 

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.450
dimensions so you can do things like the
elevation so normally in the lollipop

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:34.460
elevation so normally in the lollipop
 

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.300
elevation so normally in the lollipop
theme the all those categories are

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:37.310
theme the all those categories are
 

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.130
theme the all those categories are
actually lifted up as cards but for this

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:39.140
actually lifted up as cards but for this
 

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.570
actually lifted up as cards but for this
one we've actually set those against the

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:40.580
one we've actually set those against the
 

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.340
one we've actually set those against the
background so we did that by changing

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:42.350
background so we did that by changing
 

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.410
background so we did that by changing
the elevation value there's other things

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:44.420
the elevation value there's other things
 

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.650
the elevation value there's other things
like padding

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:45.660
like padding
 

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.230
like padding
and margins and you just tweak each one

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240
and margins and you just tweak each one
 

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.310
and margins and you just tweak each one
just a little bit and allows you get

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320
just a little bit and allows you get
 

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.990
just a little bit and allows you get
this different look so we go from this

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000
this different look so we go from this
 

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.470
this different look so we go from this
look back to the stock and then back to

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480
look back to the stock and then back to
 

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.850
look back to the stock and then back to
what we just stayed so you can see it's

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860
what we just stayed so you can see it's
 

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.650
what we just stayed so you can see it's
actually really different you can see we

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:57.660
actually really different you can see we
 

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.360
actually really different you can see we
can press each of the line items

00:26:59.360 --> 00:26:59.370
can press each of the line items
 

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.950
can press each of the line items
you know we've got different colors all

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960
you know we've got different colors all
 

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.990
you know we've got different colors all
the spacing is different and it really

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000
the spacing is different and it really
 

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.850
the spacing is different and it really
gives you just this unique look that

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860
gives you just this unique look that
 

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.430
gives you just this unique look that
you're able to achieve that you can you

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440
you're able to achieve that you can you
 

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.510
you're able to achieve that you can you
know if you don't like it anymore you

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520
know if you don't like it anymore you
 

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.830
know if you don't like it anymore you
can turn it off and you don't have to

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840
can turn it off and you don't have to
 

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.510
can turn it off and you don't have to
you know run any like a new ROM you

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520
you know run any like a new ROM you
 

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.340
you know run any like a new ROM you
don't have to like reset any settings

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:13.350
don't have to like reset any settings
 

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.610
don't have to like reset any settings
it's easy it's just switching it off and

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:15.620
it's easy it's just switching it off and
 

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.640
it's easy it's just switching it off and
so sometimes there's gonna be some

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:19.650
so sometimes there's gonna be some
 

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.260
so sometimes there's gonna be some
cross-pollination and when it comes to

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:21.270
cross-pollination and when it comes to
 

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.880
cross-pollination and when it comes to
elements that are something you have the

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:22.890
elements that are something you have the
 

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.040
elements that are something you have the
themes so in this instance majority of

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.050
themes so in this instance majority of
 

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.720
themes so in this instance majority of
what's on the screen is going to be

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:26.730
what's on the screen is going to be
 

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.950
what's on the screen is going to be
within the Settings app but there are a

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960
within the Settings app but there are a
 

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.530
within the Settings app but there are a
few things such as these switches and

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:30.540
few things such as these switches and
 

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.330
few things such as these switches and
that search icon which aren't going to

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340
that search icon which aren't going to
 

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.280
that search icon which aren't going to
be within the settings app for something

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:34.290
be within the settings app for something
 

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.630
be within the settings app for something
like that you're gonna also have the

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640
like that you're gonna also have the
 

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.910
like that you're gonna also have the
theme framework because controls like

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:37.920
theme framework because controls like
 

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.820
theme framework because controls like
radio buttons checkboxes all originate

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:40.830
radio buttons checkboxes all originate
 

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.070
radio buttons checkboxes all originate
within the android framework so you

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080
within the android framework so you
 

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.140
within the android framework so you
don't always get to do just one overlay

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.150
don't always get to do just one overlay
 

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.550
don't always get to do just one overlay
to get the home tire look sometimes

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:46.560
to get the home tire look sometimes
 

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.840
to get the home tire look sometimes
you're gonna have to go outside the box

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:47.850
you're gonna have to go outside the box
 

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.390
you're gonna have to go outside the box
and say well I also have framework so

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400
and say well I also have framework so
 

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.710
and say well I also have framework so
you need to consider how it's going to

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720
you need to consider how it's going to
 

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.600
you need to consider how it's going to
look in all the different ones that you

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:53.610
look in all the different ones that you
 

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.050
look in all the different ones that you
are theming so that was just really like

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:57.060
are theming so that was just really like
 

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.560
are theming so that was just really like
a big brief overview of what goes into

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:00.570
a big brief overview of what goes into
 

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.180
a big brief overview of what goes into
creating a theme there's a ton of styles

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:05.190
creating a theme there's a ton of styles
 

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.910
creating a theme there's a ton of styles
and colors and values that are out there

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:07.920
and colors and values that are out there
 

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.650
and colors and values that are out there
for you to tweak and it's really just

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:09.660
for you to tweak and it's really just
 

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.360
for you to tweak and it's really just
about diving in and seeing all those so

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:11.370
about diving in and seeing all those so
 

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.040
about diving in and seeing all those so
here's a couple things to keep in mind

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.050
here's a couple things to keep in mind
 

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.990
here's a couple things to keep in mind
should you want to get started and do

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000
should you want to get started and do
 

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.190
should you want to get started and do
this you want to try to reuse your

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200
this you want to try to reuse your
 

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.720
this you want to try to reuse your
styles and colors via that common folder

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:17.730
styles and colors via that common folder
 

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.850
styles and colors via that common folder
again this is unique to our theme engine

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860
again this is unique to our theme engine
 

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.860
again this is unique to our theme engine
and it's really useful for making sure

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:21.870
and it's really useful for making sure
 

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.090
and it's really useful for making sure
that you don't have to do more work in

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100
that you don't have to do more work in
 

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.440
that you don't have to do more work in
the future when it comes to tweaking

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:24.450
the future when it comes to tweaking
 

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.150
the future when it comes to tweaking
things and this even allows you to

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:26.160
things and this even allows you to
 

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.950
things and this even allows you to
create variants of a theme maybe you

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960
create variants of a theme maybe you
 

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.480
create variants of a theme maybe you
want to do a red version you really

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:29.490
want to do a red version you really
 

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.040
want to do a red version you really
liked it so if you set everything up

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.050
liked it so if you set everything up
 

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.470
liked it so if you set everything up
correctly using this common folder you

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480
correctly using this common folder you
 

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.330
correctly using this common folder you
can just go in tweak everything within

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340
can just go in tweak everything within
 

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.530
can just go in tweak everything within
there and have like a different color

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:36.540
there and have like a different color
 

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.680
there and have like a different color
available just like that vector

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:39.690
available just like that vector
 

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.750
available just like that vector
drawables these were recently introduced

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760
drawables these were recently introduced
 

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.660
drawables these were recently introduced
with lollipop API 21 and they are

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:44.670
with lollipop API 21 and they are
 

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.820
with lollipop API 21 and they are
fantastic if you're not familiar with

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:46.830
fantastic if you're not familiar with
 

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.590
fantastic if you're not familiar with
how Android handles different

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600
how Android handles different
 

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.570
how Android handles different
resolutions it creates these different

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580
resolutions it creates these different
 

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.010
resolutions it creates these different
buckets so you'll have like drawable

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020
buckets so you'll have like drawable
 

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.780
buckets so you'll have like drawable
hdpi that'll be for like an HD screen

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:53.790
hdpi that'll be for like an HD screen
 

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.880
hdpi that'll be for like an HD screen
you'll have drawable double xhdpi

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:55.890
you'll have drawable double xhdpi
 

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.670
you'll have drawable double xhdpi
that'll be for like a qHD and so what

00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:58.680
that'll be for like a qHD and so what
 

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.460
that'll be for like a qHD and so what
vector drawables

00:28:59.460 --> 00:28:59.470
vector drawables
 

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.169
vector drawables
do they allow you to create a single

00:29:01.169 --> 00:29:01.179
do they allow you to create a single
 

00:29:01.179 --> 00:29:03.240
do they allow you to create a single
image that you play some draw wall and

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.250
image that you play some draw wall and
 

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.340
image that you play some draw wall and
that's gonna scale up and down based on

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:05.350
that's gonna scale up and down based on
 

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.409
that's gonna scale up and down based on
your resolution needs allowing you to

00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:07.419
your resolution needs allowing you to
 

00:29:07.419 --> 00:29:10.919
your resolution needs allowing you to
create only one drawable and then have

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:10.929
create only one drawable and then have
 

00:29:10.929 --> 00:29:13.560
create only one drawable and then have
it look like pixel perfect on every

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:13.570
it look like pixel perfect on every
 

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:15.450
it look like pixel perfect on every
device otherwise you're gonna have to

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:15.460
device otherwise you're gonna have to
 

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.070
device otherwise you're gonna have to
sit there and make each version if you

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080
sit there and make each version if you
 

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.930
sit there and make each version if you
want it to look good you could opt to go

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:18.940
want it to look good you could opt to go
 

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.310
want it to look good you could opt to go
for a larger one and have it scaled down

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320
for a larger one and have it scaled down
 

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.930
for a larger one and have it scaled down
but this will give you the the most

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:21.940
but this will give you the the most
 

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.529
but this will give you the the most
crisp results framework styles now I did

00:29:25.529 --> 00:29:25.539
crisp results framework styles now I did
 

00:29:25.539 --> 00:29:27.210
crisp results framework styles now I did
mention that you have to do some things

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:27.220
mention that you have to do some things
 

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.129
mention that you have to do some things
in framework your controls there's no

00:29:29.129 --> 00:29:29.139
in framework your controls there's no
 

00:29:29.139 --> 00:29:30.210
in framework your controls there's no
other way to do that but there are

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:30.220
other way to do that but there are
 

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.399
other way to do that but there are
styles and frameworks such as like theme

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:32.409
styles and frameworks such as like theme
 

00:29:32.409 --> 00:29:34.529
styles and frameworks such as like theme
material themed material light you don't

00:29:34.529 --> 00:29:34.539
material themed material light you don't
 

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:35.999
material themed material light you don't
want to mess with those because those

00:29:35.999 --> 00:29:36.009
want to mess with those because those
 

00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:37.649

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:47.470
and change it in the framework what'll
 

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.169
and change it in the framework what'll
happen is you may get like a reddit app

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:49.179
happen is you may get like a reddit app
 

00:29:49.179 --> 00:29:50.669
happen is you may get like a reddit app
that's also using that and then you're

00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679
that's also using that and then you're
 

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:52.049
that's also using that and then you're
gonna end up with white text on a white

a hex color right there inside your
 

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.200

or something like that because otherwise
 

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.529

themers can't touch it and that's that

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:31.539
themers can't touch it and that's that
 

00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.720

we took a look at the standard lock

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:48.370
we took a look at the standard lock
 

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.280
we took a look at the standard lock
screen and said well what can we do with

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:50.290
screen and said well what can we do with
 

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:51.720
screen and said well what can we do with
it well we need to understand how it

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:51.730
it well we need to understand how it
 

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.930
it well we need to understand how it
works and what's well what's the

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:54.940
works and what's well what's the
 

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.090
works and what's well what's the
problems with it and so forth so first

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:57.100

even if it's for a brief moment like it
 

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.840
even if it's for a brief moment like it
should be fun it should be entertaining

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:36.850
should be fun it should be entertaining
 

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.130
should be fun it should be entertaining
it should be Lively

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:38.140
it should be Lively
 

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.800
it should be Lively
so this is where we come up with a live

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:40.810
so this is where we come up with a live
 

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.540
so this is where we come up with a live
lock screen it still has to be

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:42.550
lock screen it still has to be
 

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.860
lock screen it still has to be
functional that's that's there's no

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:43.870
functional that's that's there's no
 

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.090
functional that's that's there's no
doubt about that right we still have to

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:45.100
doubt about that right we still have to
 

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.380
doubt about that right we still have to
provide a lot of information that you

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:46.390
provide a lot of information that you
 

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.910
provide a lot of information that you
see on your normal lock screen or we're

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:47.920
see on your normal lock screen or we're
 

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.770
see on your normal lock screen or we're
accustomed to that but it doesn't have

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:49.780
accustomed to that but it doesn't have
 

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.900
accustomed to that but it doesn't have
to just stay at that point we want to be

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:51.910
to just stay at that point we want to be
 

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.510
to just stay at that point we want to be
dynamic it can be lively like that the

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:54.520
dynamic it can be lively like that the
 

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.300
dynamic it can be lively like that the
idea is the lock screen comes to life it

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:57.310
idea is the lock screen comes to life it
 

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.340
idea is the lock screen comes to life it
becomes something more than just that

00:32:59.340 --> 00:32:59.350
becomes something more than just that
 

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.930
becomes something more than just that
screen that you see when you turn your

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:00.940
screen that you see when you turn your
 

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.110
screen that you see when you turn your
phone on and with this the customization

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120
phone on and with this the customization
 

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.640
phone on and with this the customization
it's really limited by the theme

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:05.650
it's really limited by the theme
 

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.560
it's really limited by the theme
designers imagination I mean we're

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:07.570
designers imagination I mean we're
 

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.080
designers imagination I mean we're
trying to make this so that it's as open

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.090
trying to make this so that it's as open
 

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.760
trying to make this so that it's as open
as possible so that these guys can

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:11.770
as possible so that these guys can
 

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:15.450
as possible so that these guys can
create some awesome content and so when

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:15.460
create some awesome content and so when
 

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.620
create some awesome content and so when
you every time you turn your screen on

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:16.630
you every time you turn your screen on
 

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:17.940
you every time you turn your screen on
we want to be fresh and fun and

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:17.950
we want to be fresh and fun and
 

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.850
we want to be fresh and fun and
depending on how they implement these

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860
depending on how they implement these
 

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.290
depending on how they implement these
lock screens it can be different every

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:22.300
lock screens it can be different every
 

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.820
lock screens it can be different every
time that you turn it on it doesn't have

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:23.830
time that you turn it on it doesn't have
 

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.380
time that you turn it on it doesn't have
to stay the same

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:25.390
to stay the same
 

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.260
to stay the same
so we're trying to go from what's on the

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:28.270
so we're trying to go from what's on the
 

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.520
so we're trying to go from what's on the
left here to something that's on the

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:29.530
left here to something that's on the
 

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.730
left here to something that's on the
right where we've got vivid colors we're

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:32.740
right where we've got vivid colors we're
 

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.350
right where we've got vivid colors we're
gonna have animations we've got time

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360
gonna have animations we've got time
 

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.880
gonna have animations we've got time
we've got stuff that we need to see but

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:35.890
we've got stuff that we need to see but
 

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.830
we've got stuff that we need to see but
it's gonna be in a way that we enjoy

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840
it's gonna be in a way that we enjoy
 

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.110
it's gonna be in a way that we enjoy
looking at it

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120
looking at it
 

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.480
looking at it
so we were looking to the LifeLock scene

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:42.490
so we were looking to the LifeLock scene
 

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:43.530
so we were looking to the LifeLock scene
we were looking at a lot of different

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:43.540
we were looking at a lot of different
 

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.880
we were looking at a lot of different
technologies how can we do this and we

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:44.890
technologies how can we do this and we
 

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.919
technologies how can we do this and we
need to keep in mind who's our user in

00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:46.929
need to keep in mind who's our user in
 

00:33:46.929 --> 00:33:48.930
need to keep in mind who's our user in
this case for making a live lock scene

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:48.940
this case for making a live lock scene
 

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.190
this case for making a live lock scene
well that's theme designers that's guys

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200
well that's theme designers that's guys
 

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.440
well that's theme designers that's guys
that have done stuff like this but

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:52.450
that have done stuff like this but
 

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.850
that have done stuff like this but
they're not necessarily coders they

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:53.860
they're not necessarily coders they
 

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.799
they're not necessarily coders they
don't write code but they might have

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:55.809
don't write code but they might have
 

00:33:55.809 --> 00:33:57.450
don't write code but they might have
done something that similar code are

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:57.460
done something that similar code are
 

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.700
done something that similar code are
they're just coding that is flash and

00:33:59.700 --> 00:33:59.710
they're just coding that is flash and
 

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.100
they're just coding that is flash and
ActionScript so a lot of stuff we did we

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:02.110
ActionScript so a lot of stuff we did we
 

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.539
ActionScript so a lot of stuff we did we
actually went with a webview and we're

00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:03.549
actually went with a webview and we're
 

00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:05.669
actually went with a webview and we're
using a lot of frameworks and projects

00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679
using a lot of frameworks and projects
 

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:08.550
using a lot of frameworks and projects
that have been standardized and provide

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560
that have been standardized and provide
 

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.680
that have been standardized and provide
syntax similar ActionScript so we want

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:10.690
syntax similar ActionScript so we want
 

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.080
syntax similar ActionScript so we want
guys that are doing maybe flash

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.090
guys that are doing maybe flash
 

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.760
guys that are doing maybe flash
animations and stuff like that on webs

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:14.770
animations and stuff like that on webs
 

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.109
animations and stuff like that on webs
to be able to just jump right in the

00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119
to be able to just jump right in the
 

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:17.520
to be able to just jump right in the
barrier to entry we wanted it to be very

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:17.530
barrier to entry we wanted it to be very
 

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.629
barrier to entry we wanted it to be very
small so the reason we web G with a

00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639
small so the reason we web G with a
 

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.580
small so the reason we web G with a
webview is because we can use WebGL we

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:23.590
webview is because we can use WebGL we
 

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.619
webview is because we can use WebGL we
can use a canvas WebGL backed we can use

00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:25.629
can use a canvas WebGL backed we can use
 

00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:27.119
can use a canvas WebGL backed we can use
all these exorcising libraries that are

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:27.129
all these exorcising libraries that are
 

00:34:27.129 --> 00:34:29.310
all these exorcising libraries that are
a flashlight but not flash because flash

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320
a flashlight but not flash because flash
 

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.430
a flashlight but not flash because flash
is dead and just in case the hardware

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440
is dead and just in case the hardware
 

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.440
is dead and just in case the hardware
doesn't support it this is also going to

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:34.450
doesn't support it this is also going to
 

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:36.359
doesn't support it this is also going to
use a canvas for WebGL our I'm sorry

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:36.369
use a canvas for WebGL our I'm sorry
 

00:34:36.369 --> 00:34:38.520
use a canvas for WebGL our I'm sorry
html5 canvas so it's a normal canvas if

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:38.530
html5 canvas so it's a normal canvas if
 

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:39.990
html5 canvas so it's a normal canvas if
the device doesn't support it but if it

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000
the device doesn't support it but if it
 

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.340
the device doesn't support it but if it
does it's gonna be harder accelerated

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:41.350
does it's gonna be harder accelerated
 

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.080
does it's gonna be harder accelerated
and most of our demos we're doing 60

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.090
and most of our demos we're doing 60
 

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.399
and most of our demos we're doing 60
frames per second and once I show him

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:44.409
frames per second and once I show him
 

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.050
frames per second and once I show him
it's pretty awesome and that we can do

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:46.060
it's pretty awesome and that we can do
 

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.720
it's pretty awesome and that we can do
that one thing is though it needs to be

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:48.730
that one thing is though it needs to be
 

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.700
that one thing is though it needs to be
sandbox it's a lock screen right we

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:50.710
sandbox it's a lock screen right we
 

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.260
sandbox it's a lock screen right we
don't want to open up a security hole

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:52.270
don't want to open up a security hole
 

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.399
don't want to open up a security hole
where somebody can access your

00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:53.409
where somebody can access your
 

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.139
where somebody can access your
information or they can access the

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:55.149
information or they can access the
 

00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:57.210
information or they can access the
Internet right so even though it's a

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:57.220
Internet right so even though it's a
 

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.070
Internet right so even though it's a
webview there's no internet permissions

00:34:59.070 --> 00:34:59.080
webview there's no internet permissions
 

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.720
webview there's no internet permissions
we've kept the permissions down to the

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:00.730
we've kept the permissions down to the
 

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.490
we've kept the permissions down to the
bare minimum to facilitate what we need

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:02.500
bare minimum to facilitate what we need
 

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.050
bare minimum to facilitate what we need
to do for a lock screen without

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:04.060
to do for a lock screen without
 

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.980
to do for a lock screen without
compromising the security so we were

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:07.990
compromising the security so we were
 

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.820
compromising the security so we were
able to achieve this because Android in

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:10.830
able to achieve this because Android in
 

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.840
able to achieve this because Android in
newer versions of Android they

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:12.850
newer versions of Android they
 

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.730
newer versions of Android they
introduced a JavaScript interface API

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:14.740
introduced a JavaScript interface API
 

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.190
introduced a JavaScript interface API
this basically allows us to say hey we

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200
this basically allows us to say hey we
 

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.660
this basically allows us to say hey we
want to allow these methods to have

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:18.670
want to allow these methods to have
 

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.790
want to allow these methods to have
access in JavaScript but nothing else so

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800
access in JavaScript but nothing else so
 

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.260
access in JavaScript but nothing else so
we can actually lock this down and say

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:22.270
we can actually lock this down and say
 

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.180
we can actually lock this down and say
give them the api's that we want them to

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:24.190
give them the api's that we want them to
 

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.760
give them the api's that we want them to
have and just that there was a time in

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:26.770
have and just that there was a time in
 

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:27.750
have and just that there was a time in
Android where somebody could actually

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760
Android where somebody could actually
 

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.940
Android where somebody could actually
cleverly do some JavaScript and get into

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:29.950
cleverly do some JavaScript and get into
 

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.650
cleverly do some JavaScript and get into
any other class in Android that they

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:31.660
any other class in Android that they
 

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.300
any other class in Android that they
want access to and that was bad so

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:33.310
want access to and that was bad so
 

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.530
want access to and that was bad so
that's where the JavaScript interface

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:34.540
that's where the JavaScript interface
 

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.900
that's where the JavaScript interface
came into place so we we make use of

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:36.910
came into place so we we make use of
 

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.330
came into place so we we make use of
that and we use it for things like

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:39.340
that and we use it for things like
 

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.550
that and we use it for things like
creating unlock methods so it's a lock

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560
creating unlock methods so it's a lock
 

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.600
creating unlock methods so it's a lock
screen they're gonna have to unlock it

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:42.610
screen they're gonna have to unlock it
 

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.850
screen they're gonna have to unlock it
but the way they unlock it is still it's

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:44.860
but the way they unlock it is still it's
 

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.320
but the way they unlock it is still it's
up to the theme designer so it could be

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:46.330
up to the theme designer so it could be
 

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.600
up to the theme designer so it could be
swipe left to right draw a circle do

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:48.610
swipe left to right draw a circle do
 

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.610
swipe left to right draw a circle do
push a button who knows what that is and

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:50.620
push a button who knows what that is and
 

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.530
push a button who knows what that is and
so they just once the user performs that

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:52.540
so they just once the user performs that
 

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.270
so they just once the user performs that
action they can unlock it they can also

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280
action they can unlock it they can also
 

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.700
action they can unlock it they can also
unlock the common apps like MMS Browser

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:56.710
unlock the common apps like MMS Browser
 

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.680
unlock the common apps like MMS Browser
phone your camera things that you're

phone your camera things that you're
 

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.470
phone your camera things that you're
used to getting to from your lock screen

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480
used to getting to from your lock screen
 

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.760
used to getting to from your lock screen
in addition to that we provide some of

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:02.770
in addition to that we provide some of
 

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.850
in addition to that we provide some of
the basic data to that to the JavaScript

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:05.860
the basic data to that to the JavaScript
 

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.710
the basic data to that to the JavaScript
side we have the time the date now the

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720
side we have the time the date now the
 

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.060
side we have the time the date now the
time and date they're formatted in the

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.070
time and date they're formatted in the
 

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.470
time and date they're formatted in the
locale for the user so we return a

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480
locale for the user so we return a
 

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.760
locale for the user so we return a
string is already in the format that

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:11.770
string is already in the format that
 

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.560
string is already in the format that
they need if you have a 24 hour clock

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:13.570
they need if you have a 24 hour clock
 

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.090
they need if you have a 24 hour clock
you're gonna see a 24 hour clock on your

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:15.100
you're gonna see a 24 hour clock on your
 

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.830
you're gonna see a 24 hour clock on your
screen even if it's the live lockscreen

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:16.840
screen even if it's the live lockscreen
 

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.240
screen even if it's the live lockscreen
and if you're a different locale

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:18.250
and if you're a different locale
 

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.380
and if you're a different locale
different language it's gonna be

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:19.390
different language it's gonna be
 

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.720
different language it's gonna be
formatted in that format and then we

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:21.730
formatted in that format and then we
 

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.160
formatted in that format and then we
have things like battery level battery

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:23.170
have things like battery level battery
 

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.750
have things like battery level battery
are you charging so you can get stats

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760
are you charging so you can get stats
 

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.700
are you charging so you can get stats
like that so the theme could show

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:26.710
like that so the theme could show
 

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.350
like that so the theme could show
different animations based on battery

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:28.360
different animations based on battery
 

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.270
different animations based on battery
level they can get things like missed

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280
level they can get things like missed
 

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.800
level they can get things like missed
calls and so they should know different

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:31.810
calls and so they should know different
 

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.270
calls and so they should know different
text maybe a little bird flies in and

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280
text maybe a little bird flies in and
 

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.380
text maybe a little bird flies in and
says you haven't missed tweets something

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:34.390
says you haven't missed tweets something
 

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.620
says you haven't missed tweets something
like that so because it's a dynamic

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:37.630
like that so because it's a dynamic
 

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.330
like that so because it's a dynamic
lockscreen we need to have data that's

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:39.340
lockscreen we need to have data that's
 

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.340
lockscreen we need to have data that's
dynamic it needs to have some way to be

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:41.350
dynamic it needs to have some way to be
 

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:45.210
dynamic it needs to have some way to be
able to create this different contact on

the fly that changes with time date
 

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.510
the fly that changes with time date
weather so some of those things like I

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520
weather so some of those things like I
 

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.370

said there's battery in state and level

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:53.380
said there's battery in state and level
 

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.290
said there's battery in state and level
but there's also we provide weather so

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:55.300
but there's also we provide weather so
 

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.180
but there's also we provide weather so
we can give the the JavaScript side

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:57.190
we can give the the JavaScript side
 

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.580
we can give the the JavaScript side
here's the weather format in text gives

00:36:59.580 --> 00:36:59.590
here's the weather format in text gives
 

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.280
here's the weather format in text gives
them the condition the city they're in

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.290
them the condition the city they're in
 

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.170
them the condition the city they're in
but we also have some constants to find

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:04.180
but we also have some constants to find
 

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.210
but we also have some constants to find
we're using a Yahoo API right now for

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:06.220
we're using a Yahoo API right now for
 

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.500
we're using a Yahoo API right now for
the weather and so there's all these

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:07.510
the weather and so there's all these
 

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.000
the weather and so there's all these
different constants to say what type of

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.010
different constants to say what type of
 

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.380
different constants to say what type of
weather is it's a thunderstorm it's

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:10.390
weather is it's a thunderstorm it's
 

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.940
weather is it's a thunderstorm it's
snowing outside the theme could

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:11.950
snowing outside the theme could
 

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:13.590
snowing outside the theme could
potentially use that information and

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:13.600
potentially use that information and
 

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.300
potentially use that information and
change this to what they're showing you

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:15.310
change this to what they're showing you
 

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.650
change this to what they're showing you
on the screen so if it's thunderstorm

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:16.660
on the screen so if it's thunderstorm
 

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.760
on the screen so if it's thunderstorm
and lightning you could have some

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:17.770
and lightning you could have some
 

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.230
and lightning you could have some
animation of lightning going on and

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.240
animation of lightning going on and
 

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.660
animation of lightning going on and
maybe you have to swipe the lightning

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:21.670
maybe you have to swipe the lightning
 

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.920
maybe you have to swipe the lightning
bolt away or something like that but I

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:22.930
bolt away or something like that but I
 

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.200
bolt away or something like that but I
mean it provides a lot more dynamic

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:25.210
mean it provides a lot more dynamic
 

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:29.130
mean it provides a lot more dynamic

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:16.150
properties and it'll tween them from an
 

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.150
properties and it'll tween them from an
object so say you have an object X Y

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160
object so say you have an object X Y
 

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.980
object so say you have an object X Y
it'll move it to this new position and

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:19.990
it'll move it to this new position and
 

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.810
it'll move it to this new position and
you give it a time and it'll do that

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:21.820
you give it a time and it'll do that
 

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.490
you give it a time and it'll do that
transition for you all you do is say hey

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:23.500
transition for you all you do is say hey
 

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.600
transition for you all you do is say hey
I want you to go from here to here and

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:24.610
I want you to go from here to here and
 

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.430
I want you to go from here to here and
this time and it performs the animation

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440
this time and it performs the animation
 

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.090
this time and it performs the animation
without you having to do any other work

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:29.100
without you having to do any other work
 

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.440
without you having to do any other work
this works in conjunction with ease pack

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:31.450
this works in conjunction with ease pack
 

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.780
this works in conjunction with ease pack
which actually provides ways for that

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:33.790
which actually provides ways for that
 

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:35.400
which actually provides ways for that
animation to be smoothed out a lot

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:35.410
animation to be smoothed out a lot
 

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.900
animation to be smoothed out a lot
better so instead of being linear and

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:36.910
better so instead of being linear and
 

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.430
better so instead of being linear and
just quickly moving from one spot to the

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440
just quickly moving from one spot to the
 

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.620
just quickly moving from one spot to the
other it can ramp up its speed it could

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:40.630
other it can ramp up its speed it could
 

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.540
other it can ramp up its speed it could
bounce it can stretch it can do stuff

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:42.550
bounce it can stretch it can do stuff
 

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.980
bounce it can stretch it can do stuff
that makes the animation a lot more

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:43.990
that makes the animation a lot more
 

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.480
that makes the animation a lot more
lively and stuff that we're used to in

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:45.490
lively and stuff that we're used to in
 

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.070
lively and stuff that we're used to in
real life because things don't just move

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:47.080
real life because things don't just move
 

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.420
real life because things don't just move
and then stop at the position that I

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:48.430
and then stop at the position that I
 

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.110

usually slow down so ease pack helps

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.120
usually slow down so ease pack helps
 

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.290
usually slow down so ease pack helps
make that easier for the team designer

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:54.300
make that easier for the team designer
 

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.640
make that easier for the team designer
and then buzz like I said that place

this is an early stages but I'm gonna go

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:28.690
this is an early stages but I'm gonna go
 

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.240
this is an early stages but I'm gonna go
ahead and demo this is like this is the

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:30.250
ahead and demo this is like this is the
 

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.480
ahead and demo this is like this is the
first time we get to show this off and

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:32.490
first time we get to show this off and
 

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.859
first time we get to show this off and
this is really what laughs lock screens

I write code I can't do anything but I

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:03.670
I write code I can't do anything but I
 

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.730
I write code I can't do anything but I
realized I can do rectangles and I can

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:05.740
realized I can do rectangles and I can
 

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.180
realized I can do rectangles and I can
do rectangles really really good and not

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:09.190
do rectangles really really good and not
 

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.710
do rectangles really really good and not
only can I do rectangles really good but

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720
only can I do rectangles really good but
 

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.599
only can I do rectangles really good but
I realized if I put these rectangles in

00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:12.609
I realized if I put these rectangles in
 

00:43:12.609 --> 00:43:14.880
I realized if I put these rectangles in
a certain way I can make it look like a

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:14.890
a certain way I can make it look like a
 

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.430
a certain way I can make it look like a
city so I've got this little cityscape

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440
city so I've got this little cityscape

Y it and it'll animate back on when I

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:23.890
Y it and it'll animate back on when I
 

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.290
Y it and it'll animate back on when I
let my finger go that's using tween

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:25.300
let my finger go that's using tween
 

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.170
let my finger go that's using tween
light so this is the first demo so this

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:28.180
light so this is the first demo so this
 

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.240
light so this is the first demo so this
is mine this looks really like an

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:30.250
is mine this looks really like an

engineer did it everybody can I say and

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:32.230
engineer did it everybody can I say and
 

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.330
engineer did it everybody can I say and
then I can unlock just like a normal

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:33.340
then I can unlock just like a normal
 

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.530
then I can unlock just like a normal
lockscreen the next demo I came up with

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540
lockscreen the next demo I came up with
 

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.910
lockscreen the next demo I came up with
pixie Jas actually had a demo of using

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920
pixie Jas actually had a demo of using
 

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.710
pixie Jas actually had a demo of using
those WebGL filters as I mentioned in

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720
those WebGL filters as I mentioned in
 

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.290
those WebGL filters as I mentioned in
the tinting and stuff so I took their

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:43.300
the tinting and stuff so I took their
 

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.640
the tinting and stuff so I took their
concept and turned it into a live

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:44.650
concept and turned it into a live
 

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.140
concept and turned it into a live
Lakshmi their concept was this little

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:46.150
Lakshmi their concept was this little
 

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.670
Lakshmi their concept was this little
fish pond it was like a cartoonish

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680
fish pond it was like a cartoonish
 

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.020
fish pond it was like a cartoonish
little fish pond like I think I should

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.030
little fish pond like I think I should
 

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.410
little fish pond like I think I should
have that slide of it for you guys I

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420
have that slide of it for you guys I
 

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.210
have that slide of it for you guys I
mean a lock screen and so we get this so

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:54.220
mean a lock screen and so we get this so
 

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.820
mean a lock screen and so we get this so
now we have something that's vibrant and

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:56.830
now we have something that's vibrant and
 

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.680
now we have something that's vibrant and
actually animating so you see a lot of

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:58.690
actually animating so you see a lot of
 

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.750
actually animating so you see a lot of
motion on there but you still get some

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760
motion on there but you still get some
 

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.040
motion on there but you still get some
information right so I still got my

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:02.050
information right so I still got my
 

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.840
information right so I still got my
clock but it's it's fun to play with and

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:03.850
clock but it's it's fun to play with and
 

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.910
clock but it's it's fun to play with and
as I swipe my finger down it'll actually

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920
as I swipe my finger down it'll actually
 

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.500
as I swipe my finger down it'll actually
distort more so you get that little

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:07.510
distort more so you get that little
 

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.150
distort more so you get that little
distortion effect going that I was using

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160
distortion effect going that I was using
 

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.320
distortion effect going that I was using
their WebGL filters it was a

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:10.330
their WebGL filters it was a
 

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.599
their WebGL filters it was a
displacement effect so I can play around

00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:12.609
displacement effect so I can play around
 

00:44:12.609 --> 00:44:15.090
displacement effect so I can play around
with that and tweak it and when i unlock

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:15.100
with that and tweak it and when i unlock
 

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:19.349
with that and tweak it and when i unlock
it all does that one now we've been

00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359
it all does that one now we've been
 

00:44:19.359 --> 00:44:20.609
it all does that one now we've been
playing with this internally a couple

00:44:20.609 --> 00:44:20.619
playing with this internally a couple
 

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:21.870
playing with this internally a couple
weeks ago we've actually put this in our

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880
weeks ago we've actually put this in our
 

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.820
weeks ago we've actually put this in our
internal dog food builds where we test

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:23.830
internal dog food builds where we test
 

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.980
internal dog food builds where we test
our stuff internally and a lot of

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:25.990
our stuff internally and a lot of
 

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.210
our stuff internally and a lot of
engineers there are getting excited

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:27.220
engineers there are getting excited
 

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.140
engineers there are getting excited
