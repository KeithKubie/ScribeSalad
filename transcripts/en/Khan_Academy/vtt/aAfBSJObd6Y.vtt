00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.580
Let's start with this classic
system that I keep referring

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.210
to in our thermodynamics
videos.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.910
I have a cylinder.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.240
It's got a little piston on the
top of it, or it's got a

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.110
ceiling that's movable.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.890
The gas, and we're thinking of
monoatomic ideal gases in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.260
here, they're exerting pressure
onto this ceiling.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.220
And the reason why the ceiling
isn't moving all the way up,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.270
is because I've placed a bunch
of rocks on the top to offset

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.520
the force per area of
the actual gas.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.229
And I start this gas when
it's in equilibrium.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.700
I can define its macrostates.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.030
It has some volume.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.415
It has some pressure that's
being offset by these rocks.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:40.140
And it has some well-defined
temperature.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.890
Now, what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to place this system

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.830
here-- I'm going to place it
on top of a reservoir.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.280
And I talked about what a
reservoir was either in the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.040
last video or a couple
of videos ago.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.720
You can view it as an infinitely
large object, if

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.460
you will, of a certain
temperature.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.850
So if I put it next to-- if I
put our system next to this

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.930
reservoir-- and let's say I
start removing pebbles from

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.290
our system.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.060
We learned a couple of videos
ago that if we did it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270
adiabatically-- what does
adiabatically mean?

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.230
If we removed these pebbles
in isolation, without any

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.760
reservoir around, the volume
would increase, the pressure

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.700
would go down, and actually
the temperature would

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.420
decrease, as well.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.080
We showed that a couple
of videos ago.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.330
So by putting this big reservoir
there that's a lot

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.480
larger than our actual canister,
this will keep the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.000
temperature in our
canister at T1.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.530
You can kind of view a reservoir
as-- say I had a cup

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.230
of water in a stadium.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.710
And the air conditioner in the
stadium is at 60 degrees.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.880
Well, no matter what I do to
that water, I could put it in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.140
the microwave and warm it up,
but if I put it back in that

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.850
stadium, that stadium
is going to keep

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.480
that water at 60 degrees.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.610
And you might say, oh, won't
the reservoir's temperature

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.650
decrease if it's throwing
off heat?

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.980
Well, it would, but it's so much
larger that its impact

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.680
isn't noticeable.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.690
For example, if I put a cup of
boiling water into a super

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.360
large covered-dome stadium, the
water will get colder to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.140
the ambient temperature
of the stadium.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.770
The stadium will get warmer, but
it will be so marginally

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.560
warmer than you won't
even notice it.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.200
So you can kind of view
that as a reservoir.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.450
And theoretically, this
is infinitely large.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.870
So the effect of this is, as we
remove these little rocks,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.390
we're going to keep the
temperature constant.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.030
And remember, if we're keeping
the temperature constant,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.090
we're also keeping the internal
energy constant,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.130
because we're not changing
the kinetic

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.550
energy of the particles.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.130
So let me see what happens.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.320
So I keep doing that.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.220
And so I get to a point-- let
me see-- where my volume has

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.660
increased-- so let me delete
some of my rocks here.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.600
Delete some of the rocks.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.370
So some of the rocks are gone.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.230
And now my overall volume
is going to be larger.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.980
Let me move this up
a little bit.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.190
And then let me color
this in black.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.670
Oh, whoops.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.670
Let me color this in, just
to give an idea.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.632
So our volume has gotten
a bit larger.

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:21.320
And let me get my
pen correctly.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.620
So our volume has gotten larger
by roughly this amount.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.550
We have the same number
of particles.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.930
They're going to bump into
the ceiling a little less

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.200
frequently, so my pressure
would have gone down.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.390
But because I kept this
reservoir here, because this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.160
reservoir was here the whole
time during this process, the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.210
temperature stayed at T1.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.860
And that was only because
of this reservoir.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.000
And I want to make that clear.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.410
And also, just as review, this
is a quasi-static process,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.680
because I'm doing
it very slowly.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.340
The system is in equilibrium
the whole time.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.270
So let's draw what we have so
far on our famous PV diagram.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.570
So this is the P-axis.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.820
That's the V-axis.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.600
You label them.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.840
This is P.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.040
This is V.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.200
Let me call this-- I'm going
to do it in a good color.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.980
This is state A of the system.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.940
This is state B of the system.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.530
So state A starts at some
pressure and volume-- I'll do

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.960
it like that.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.450
That's state A.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.150
And it moves to state B.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.030
And notice, I kept the
temperature constant.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.910
And what did we learn in,
I think it was one

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.250
or two videos ago?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.020
Well, we're at a constant
temperature, so we're going to

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.170
move along an isotherm,
which is just

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.360
a rectangular hyperbola.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.310
Because when your temperature
is constant, your pressure

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.600
times your volume is going to
equal a constant number.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.530
And I went over that before.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.980
So we're going to move over--
our path is going to look

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.380
something like this, and I'll
move here, to state B.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.590
I'll move over here
to state B.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.800
And the whole time, this was at
a constant temperature T1.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.660
Now, we've done a bunch
of videos now.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.470
We said, OK, how much work
was done on this system?

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.160
Well, the work done on
the system is the

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160
area under this curve.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.680
So some positive work was-- not
done on the system, sorry.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.340
How much work was done
by the system?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.890
We're moving in this
direction.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.960
I should put the direction
there.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.980
We're moving from
left to right.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.900
The amount of work done
by the system is

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.500
pressure times volume.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.000
We've seen that multiple
times.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.180
So you take this area of the
curve, and you have the work

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.680
done by the system
from A to B.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.970
Right?

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.590
So let's call that
work from A to B.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.790
Now, that's fair and everything,
but what I want to

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.450
think more about, is
how much heat was

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.910
transferred by my reservoir?

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.550
Remember, we said, if this
reservoir wasn't there, the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.210
temperature of my canister
would have gone down as I

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.910
expanded its volume, and as
the pressure went down.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.760
So how much heat came into it?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.970
Well, let's go back to our basic
internal energy formula.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.020
Change in internal energy is
equal to heat applied to the

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.840
system minus the work
done by the system

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.360
Now, what is the change
in internal

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.120
energy in this scenario?

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.500
Well, it was at a constant
temperature

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.520
the whole time, right?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.330
And since we're dealing with a
very simple ideal gas, all of

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.340
our internal energy is due
to kinetic energy, which

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.640
temperature is a measure of.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.010
So, temperature didn't change.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.130
Our average kinetic energy
didn't change, which means our

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.680
kinetic energy didn't change.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.440
So our internal energy did not
change while we moved from

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.490
left to right along
this isotherm.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.970
So we could say our internal
energy is zero.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.180
And that is equal to the heat
added to the system minus the

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.610
work done by the system.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.340
Right?

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.996
So if you just-- we put the work
done by the system on the

00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:55.250
other side, and then switch the
sides, you get heat added

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.940
to the system is equal to the
work done by the system.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.740
And that makes sense.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.340
The system was doing some work
this entire time, so it was

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.360
giving energy to-- well,
you know, it was giving

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.530
essentially maybe
some potential

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.370
energy to these rocks.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.910
So it was giving energy away.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.340
It was giving energy outside
of the system.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.650
So how did it maintain
its internal energy?

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.530
Well, someone had to give
it some energy.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.610
And it was given that energy
by this reservoir.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.350
So let's say, and the convention
for doing this is

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.400
to say, that it was given--
let me write this down.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.820
It was given some energy Q1.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.830
We just say, we just put this
downward arrow to say that

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.610
some energy went into
the system here.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.820
Fair enough.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:46.050
Now let's take this state B and
remove the reservoir, and

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.700
completely isolate ourselves.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.400
So there's no way that heat can
be transferred to and from

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.150
our system.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.650
And let's keep removing
some rocks.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.375
So if we keep removing some
rocks, where do we get to?

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:59.820
Let me go down here.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.170
So let's say we remove a
bunch of more rocks.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.300
So let me erase even more
rocks than we had in B.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.870
Maybe I only have
one rock left.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.690
And obviously, the overall
volume would have increased.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.810
So let me make our piston go up
like that, and I can make

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.650
our piston is maybe
a lot higher now.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.720
And let me just fill in the rest
of our, just so that we

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.100
don't have some empty
space there.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.520
So if I fill that in right
there-- OK Let

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.510
me fill that in.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.510
And then I just use the blue--
I should be talking about

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.870
thermodynamics, not drawing.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.520
But you get the idea.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.420
And then I have some
more-- you know, I

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.670
shouldn't add particles.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.480
But my volume has increased
a good bit.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.200
My pressure will have gone down,
they're going to bump

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.610
into the walls less.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.290
And because I removed the
reservoir, what's going to

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.430
happen to the temperature?

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.910
My temperature is going
to go down.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.000
This was an adiabatic process.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.050
So an adiabatic just means
we did it in isolation.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.020
There was no exchange of heat
from one system to another.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.150
So let me just-- this arrow
continues down here.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.400
I'll say adiabatic.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.040
Now, since I'm moving from
one temperature to

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.960
another, this is at T2.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.920
So I will have moved to
another isotherm.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.550
This is the isotherm for T1.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.350
If I keep my temperature
constant, I

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.380
move along this hyperbola.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.560
And I would have kept moving
along this hyperbola.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.820
But now that we didn't keep our
temperature constant, we

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.250
now move like this.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.660
We move to another isotherm.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.660
So let's say I have another
isotherm at T2.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.990
It looks something like this.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.410
So let me draw like that.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:58.850
So let's say I have another-- it
should actually curve up a

00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.260
little bit.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.430
So let's say, everything at
temperature T2, depending on

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.450
its pressure and volume, is
someplace along this curve

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.530
that asymptotes up like
that, and then goes to

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.760
the right like that.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.940
Now, I would have moved down
to this isotherm, and my

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.400
pressure would have kept going
down, and my volume would have

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.560
kept going down.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.290
So this move, from B to state
C, will look like this.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.760
Let me do to it in
another color.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.190
Let me do it in the orange
color of this arrow.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.000
So it will look like this.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.540
And now we're at state C.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.200
Now, this was adiabatic.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.070
Which means, there is
no exchange of heat.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.010
So I don't have to figure out
how much heat got transferred

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.060
into the system.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.520
Now, there's something
interesting here.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.650
We still did do some work.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.670
We can take the area
under this curve.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.950
And we're going to leave it to
a future video to think about

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:01.010
where that work energy-- well,
the main thing is, is what was

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.880
reduced by that work energy.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.380
And, well, if you think
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.510
to leave it to future video.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.180
Our internal energy was
reduced, right?

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.580
Because our temperature
went down.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.120
So our internal energy
went down.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.250
We'll talk more about that
in the future video.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.720
So now that we're at state C,
and we're at temperature T2.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.670
Let's put back another
sink here.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.230
But this sink, what it's going
to have is a reservoir.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.150
So let me put two things
right here.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.650
So I'm going to add--
let me erase some of

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.190
these blocks in black.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.695
So now I'm going to
add blocks back.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.600
I'm going to add little
pebbles back into it.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.830
But I'm going to do it as
an isothermic process.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.220
I'm going to do it with
a reservoir here.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.520
But this reservoir here, it's
not going to be the same

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.170
reservoir that I put up there.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.290
I swapped that one out.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.910
I got rid of any reservoir
when I went from B to C.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.730
And now I'm going to swap
in a new reservoir.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.780
Actually, let me make it blue.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.010
Because it's going to be--

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.180
Because here's what's
happening.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.450
I'm now adding pebbles in.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.210
I'm compressing the gas.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.680
If this was an adiabatic
process, the gas would

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.960
want to heat up.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.730
So what I'm doing is, I need to
put a reservoir to keep it

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.750
at T2, to keep it along
this isotherm.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.840
So this is T2.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.320
Remember, this reservoir is
kind of a cold reservoir.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.200
It keeps the temperature down.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.520
As opposed to here.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.575
This was a hot reservoir.

00:12:38.575 --> 00:12:40.420
It kept the temperature up.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.370
So you can imagine.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.160
The heat generated in the
system, or internal energy

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.490
being generated in the
system-- well, no, I

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.590
shouldn't say that.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.140
The temperature of the system
will want to go up, but it's

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.230
being released, because it's
able to transfer that heat

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.550
into our new reservoir.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.910
And that amount of heat is Q2.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.970
So I move along this.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.700
This is right here.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.040
I'm moving along another
isotherm, I'm moving along

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.250
this isotherm.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:14.580
Until I get to state D.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.420
We're almost there.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.040
This is state D.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.720
So state D will be someplace
here, along this isotherm

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.670
right here.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.590
Maybe this is state D.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.720
And once again, you can make
the argument that we moved

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.400
along an isotherm Our
temperature did not change

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.040
from C to D.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.600
We know that our internal energy
went down from B to C,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.950
because we did some work.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.620
But from C to D, our temperature
stayed the same.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.290
It was at temperature-- let me
write it down-- T2, right?

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.520
Because we had this
reservoir here.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.460
It stayed the same.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.440
If your temperature stays the
same, then your internal

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.660
energy stays the same.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.100
At least for the system we're
dealing with, because it's a

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.080
very simple gas.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.710
It's actually the system you'll
deal with most of the

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.960
time, in an intro thermodynamics
course.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.550
So.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.640
Given our internal energy didn't
change, we can apply

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.490
the same argument that the heat
added to the system is

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.230
equal to the work done
by the system.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.650
Right?

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.580
Same math as we did up here.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.390
Now, in this case, the work
wasn't done by the system.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.820
The work was done
to the system.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.370
We compressed this piston.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.780
The force times distance
went the other way.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.660
So given that work was done to
the system, the heat added to

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.260
the system was negative,
right?

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.190
We're just applying
the same thing.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.910
If our internal energy is 0, the
heat added to the system

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.250
is equal to the work
done by the system.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.260
The work done by the
system is negative.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.110
Work was done to it.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.600
So the heat added to the system
would be negative.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.330
Or another way to think
about it is that the

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.030
system gave away heat.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.430
We put that with Q2.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.515
And where did it
give that heat?

00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:01.490
It gave it to this reservoir
that we put here, this kind of

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.510
cold reservoir.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.210
You could almost view
it as a-- well, it's

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.750
accepting the heat.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:06.890
OK.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.360
We're almost there.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.390
Now, let's say we remove this
reservoir from under our

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.720
system again, so it's completely
isolated from

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.080
everything else, at least
in terms of heat.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.830
And what we do is, we start
adding-- so state D, we still

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.275
had a few less pebbles.

00:15:23.275 --> 00:15:26.290
But we start adding more
pebbles again.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.985
We start adding more pebbles
to get it to state A.

00:15:29.985 --> 00:15:32.770
So let me change my
pebble color.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.710
So we start adding more
pebbles again to

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.620
get it to state A.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.530
So that's this process
right here.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.480
Let me do a different color.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.280
Let's say this is green.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.570
So as we add pebbles, that's
this movement right here.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.840
We're moving from one isotherm
up to another isotherm at a

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.800
higher temperature.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.520
And remember, this whole
time we went

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.330
this clockwise direction.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.240
So a couple of interesting
things are going on here.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.990
Because we're assuming an ideal
scenario, nothing was

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.070
lost of friction.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.610
This piston just moves
up and down.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.340
No heat loss due to that.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.510
What we can say is that we've
achieved-- we are back at our

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.250
original internal energy.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.960
In fact, this is one of the
properties of a state

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.520
variable, is that if we're at
the same point on the PV

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.550
diagram, the same exact
point, we have

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.860
the same state variable.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.610
So now we have the same
pressure, volume, temperature,

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.780
and internal energy as
what we started with.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.820
So we've done here is
completed a cycle.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.990
And this particular cycle, it's
an important one, it's

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.660
called the Carnot cycle.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.390
It's named after a French
engineer who was trying to

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.780
just optimize engines
in the early 1800s.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.030
So Carnot cycle.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.330
And we're going to study this
a lot in the next few videos

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.860
to really make sure we
understand entropy correctly.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.830
Because in a lot of chemistry
classes, they'll

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.760
throw entropy at you.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.060
Oh, it's measure of disorder.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.190
But you really don't know what
they're talking about, or how

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.810
can you quantify it, or
measure it anyway.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.910
And we really need to deal with
the Carnot cycle in order

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.650
to understand where the first
concepts of entropy really

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.390
came from, and then relate
it to kind of more

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.069
modern notions of it.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:19.099
Now, a system that completes
a Carnot cycle is called a

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:19.950
Carnot engine.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.869
So our little piston here that's
moving up and down, we

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.560
can consider this
a Carnot engine.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.800
You might say, oh, Sal,
this doesn't seem

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.560
like a great engine.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.040
I have to move pebbles
and all of that.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.670
And you're right.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.890
You wouldn't actually implement
an engine this way.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.280
But it's a useful engine, or
it's a useful theoretical

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.670
construct, in order for
understanding how heat is

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.110
transferred in an engine.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.520
I mean, if you think about
what's happening here, is this

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.680
first heat sink transferred some
heat to the system, and

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.690
then the system transferred a
smaller amount of heat back to

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.740
the other reservoir.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.290
Right?

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.940
So this system was transferring
heat from one

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.630
reservoir to another
reservoir.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.180
From a hotter reservoir
to a colder reservoir.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.890
And in the process, it was
also doing some work.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.880
And what was the work
that it did?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.500
Well, it's the area under this
curve, or the area inside of

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.020
this cycle.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:19.890
So this is the work done
by our Carnot engine.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.890
And the way you think about it
is, when you're going in the

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.770
rightward direction with
increasing volume, it's the

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.850
area under the curve is the
work done by the system.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.560
And then when you move in the
leftward direction with

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.350
decreasing volume, you subtract
out the work done to

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.520
the system, and then you're
left with just

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.170
the area in the curve.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.230
So we can write this Carnot
engine like this.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:48.280
It's taking, it's starting-- so
you have a reservoir at T1.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.420
And then you have your
engine, right here.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.360
And then it's connected--
so this takes Q1

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.350
in from this reservoir.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.230
It does some work, all right?

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.130
The work is represented by the
amount of-- the work right

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.010
here is the area inside
of our cycle.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.430
And then it transfers Q2, or
essentially the remainder from

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.190
Q1, into our cold reservoir.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.580
So T2.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.660
So it transfers Q2 there.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.420
So the work we did is really
the difference

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.820
between Q1 and Q2, right?

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.810
You say, hey.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.360
If I have more heat coming in
than I'm letting out, where

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.950
did the rest of that heat go?

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.590
It went to work.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.510
Literally.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:39.150
So Q1 minus Q2 is equal to the
amount of work we did.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.200
And actually, this is a good
time to emphasize again that

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.650
heat and work are not
a state variable.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.040
A state variable has to be the
exact same value when we

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.370
complete a cycle.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.610
Now, we see here that we
completed a cycle, and we had

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.650
a net amount of work done, or a
net amount of heat added to

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.110
the system.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.980
So we could just keep going
around the cycle, and keep

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.430
having heat added
to the system.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.440
So there is no inherent heat
state variable right here.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.660
You can't say what the
value of heat is at

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.740
this point in time.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.420
All you could say is what amount
of heat was added or

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.010
taken away from the system, or
you can only say the amount of

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.440
work that was done to, or
done by, the system.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.900
Anyway, I want to leave
you there right now.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.280
We're going to study
this a lot more.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.040
But the real important thing is,
and if you never want to

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.830
get confused in a thermodynamics
class, I

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.800
encourage you to even
go off on your

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.820
own, and do this yourself.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.120
Kind of-- you can almost take
a pencil and paper, and redo

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.430
this video that I just did.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.550
Because it's essential that
you understand the Carnot

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.530
engine, understand this
adiabatic process, understand

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.520
what isotherms are.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.790
Because if you understand that,
then a lot of what we're

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.760
about to do in the next few
videos with regard to entropy

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.320
will be a little bit more

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.140
intuitive, and not too confusing.
