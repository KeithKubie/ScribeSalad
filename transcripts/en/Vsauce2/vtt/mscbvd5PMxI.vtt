00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.720
The world's tiniest prison is located on Sark
Island of the United Kingdom. It was built

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.720
in 1856 and is still used for overnight stays,
but it can house only two inmates.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.850
What The FAK: The facts and knowledge on Prisons.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.949
San Pedro Prison is the biggest in Bolivia
and is home to about 1,500 inmates. But beyond

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.350
the thick wall and security gates, any resemblance
to a normal jail disappears. There are children

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.350
playing, markets, hairdressers, and even a
hotel; but no guards, uniforms, or metal bars.

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.710
Inmates have to pay their way while inside,
including paying for the cell that they live

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.879
in. The police do not go inside or interfere
as inmates are expected to resolve their own

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.780
problems through elected representatives.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.479
Leoben Minimum Security Prison in Austria
looks more like a high-end apartment complex

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:07.310
than a prison. It has an abundant amount of
natural light, a court-yard, and barred off

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.520
balconies. And, the average prisoner gets
their own kitchenette, comfortable furniture,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.770
and a TV. Inmates can also enjoy a game of
tennis, indoor soccer, a weight room, or romantic

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.010
conjugal visit suites.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.340
At the other end of the prison spectrum is
the US Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.410
Facility, or ADX, located in Florence, Co.
It was constructed in response to several

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.560
security breaches and correctional officer
injuries at other maximum security prisons.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.950
ADX is best known for housing inmates who
have been deemed too dangerous, too high-profile,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.260
or too great a national security risk such
as leaders of violent gangs, domestic and

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.530
foreign terrorists, and inmates at high escape-risk.
Cells have a desk, a stool, and a bed which

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.770
are almost entirely made out of concrete,
as well as a toilet that shuts itself off

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.170
if blocked, and a shower where the water runs
on a timer to prevent flooding.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.700
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.950
.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.920
Alcatraz is one of the most well known prisons
in the world. It was a maximum high security

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.249
federal prison located on Alcatraz Island
in the San Francisco bay, and operated from

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:23.249
1934-1963. It was designed to hold prisoners
who continually caused trouble at other federal

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.269
prisons, and held some of the most hardened
criminals in Americas history including Al

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.670
Capone and George "Machine Gun" Kelly. It
was believed to be inescapable and America's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.060
strongest prison. A total of 36 prisoners
made 14 escape attempts during its 29 years

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.060
of operation, but it was closed march 21st,
1963 due to high maintenance costs and a poor

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.590
reputation.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.590
Aranjuez Prison in Spain is the only one in
the world to house two-parent inmate families.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.200
The units come with cribs, Disney characters
on the walls, and have access to a playground.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.879
When the children turn 3 they have to leave
the prison to be looked after by family. They're

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.169
still debating on the success of the program
and the health of the children, so there are

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.200
no plans to expand the program.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.849
The Fortezza Medicea Restaurant opened in
2006 to the public as an alternative dining

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.849
experience. A 20-person team of inmates, made
up of robbers and convicted murderers, prepare

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:29.290
and serve 120 covers for diners who have undergone
strict security and background checks. All

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.329
guests are served with plastic plates and
cutlery inside of this prison restaurant.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.639
Bastoy Minimum Security Prison is located
on the small, scenic Bastoy Island, about

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.769
an hour from Oslo, Norway. The prison is organized
as a small, local community with about 80

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.159
buildings, roads, beach zones, a football
field, and agricultural land. The farming

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.609
is ecological, the prison handles most of
their own trash, and there is a constant focus

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.349
on minimizing CO2 emissions, and this progressive
prison has been criticized by some for being

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.739
more like a summer camp than a correctional
facility.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.819
One weekend in April, and every sunday in
October, Louisiana is home to the Angola Prison

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.209
Rodeo. Thousands enter the prison complex
to see the show that started in 1965. Black

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.010
and white striped cowboys compete in events
like the "convict poker", "wild cow milking",

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.600
and bull riding. You can hear inmate bands
playing, eat food made from old family recipes,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.470
and even buy arts and crafts made by the prisoners
themselves.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.780
Cebu Prison in the Philippines is famous for
its dancing inmates. It was an evolution of

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.160
the exercise program that turned into an internet
sensation. 1,500 prisoners are able to contribute

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.490
to the performances, and they do so at charitable
and cultural events, as well as live performances,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.670
after which spectators can have their pictures
taken with the inmates.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.750
Built in 1876 Spandau Prison was notable for
housing many Nazi war criminals after World

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.040
War 2. It was decided that the building should
come down to prevent a Nazi shrine from being

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.100
built. They chose 1987 because that is when
the prison's last inmate finally died at the

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.100
age of 93, and he'd been the only inmate since
1966. Rudolf Hess was guarded on a rotation

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.810
for those 21 years by allied guards of Americans,
French, Brits, and even Soviets because he'd

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.530
been sentenced to spend his life in prison,
and they wanted to make sure that he did...

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.470
I'm gonna leave you with this guy. He escaped
high security prisons twice. Who is he, and

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.720
what was his escape method of choice?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.940
