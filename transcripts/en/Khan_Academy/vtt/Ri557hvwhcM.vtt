00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.040
So not only can a magnetic field
exert some force on a

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.230
moving charge, we're now going
to learn that a moving charge

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.160
or a current can actually
create a magnetic field.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.010
So there is some type
of symmetry here.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.600
And as we'll learn later when
we learn our calculus and we

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.810
do this in a slightly more
rigorous way, we'll see that

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.010
magnetic fields and electric
fields are actually two sides

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.430
of the same coin, of
electromagnetic fields.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.880
But anyway, we won't worry
about that now.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.260
And I think it's enough to
ponder right now that a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.220
current can actually induce
a magnetic field.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.570
And actually, just
a moving electron

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.320
creates a magnetic field.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.110
And it does it in a surface of a
sphere-- I won't go into all

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.500
that right now.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Because the math gets a little
bit fancy there.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.600
But what you might encounter in
your standard high school

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.950
physics class-- that's not
getting deeply into vector

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.180
calculus-- is that if you
just have a wire--

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.820
let me draw a wire.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.780
That's my wire.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:10.030
And it's carrying some current
I, it turns out that this wire

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.230
will generate a magnetic
field.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.840
And the shape of that magnetic
field is going to be

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.960
co-centric circles
around this wire.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.730
Let me see if I can draw that.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.730
So here I'll draw it just like
how I do when I try to do

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.510
rotations of solids in
the calculus video.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.120
So the magnetic field would go
behind and in front and it

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.730
goes like that.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.130
Or another way you can think
about it is if-- let's go down

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.930
here-- is on the left
side of this wire.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.840
If you say that the wire's in
the plane of this video, the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.110
magnetic field is popping
out of your screen.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.500
And on this side, on the right
side, the magnetic field is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980
popping into the screen.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.000
It's going into the screen.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.400
And you could imagine
that, right?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.840
You could imagine if, on this
drawing up here, you could say

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.370
this is where it intersects
the screen.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.240
All of this is kind of
behind the screen.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.440
And all of this is in
front of the screen.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.460
And this is where it's
popping out.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.430
And this is where it's popping
into the screen.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.770
Hopefully that makes a
little bit of sense.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.180
And how did I know that it's
rotating this way?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.370
Well, it actually does come out
of the cross product when

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.950
you do it with a regular
charge and all of that.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.740
But we're not going to go
into that right now.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.670
And so there's a different
right hand rule

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.640
that you can use.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.130
And it's literally you hold
this wire, or you imagine

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.810
holding this wire, with your
right hand with your thumb

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.570
going in the direction
of the current.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.010
And if you hold this wire with
your thumb going in the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.790
direction of the current, your
fingers are going to go in the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.890
direction of the
magnetic field.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.030
So let me see if I
can draw that.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.830
I will draw it in blue.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.070
So if this is my thumb, my thumb
is going along the top

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.690
of the wire.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.045
And then my hand is curling
around the wire.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.700
Those are my knuckles.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.380
Those are the veins
on my hand.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.210
This is my nail.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.490
So as you can see, if I was
holding that same wire-- let

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.760
me draw the wire.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.490
So if I was holding that same
wire, we see that my thumb is

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.970
going in the direction
of the current.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.910
So this is a slightly new
thing to memorize.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.730
And what is the magnetic
field doing?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.840
Well, it's going in the
direction of my fingers.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.930
My fingers are popping out
on this side of the wire.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.760
They're coming out on this
side of the wire.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.560
And they're going in, or
at least my hand is

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.460
going in, on that side.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.490
It's going into the screen.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.570
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.070
Now, how can we quantify?

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.280
Well, before we quantify, let's
get a little bit more of

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.890
the intuition of what's
happening.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.730
It turns out that the closer
you get to the wire, the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.290
stronger the magnetic field, and
the further you get out,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.800
the weaker the magnetic field.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.510
And that kind of makes sense
if you imagine the magnetic

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.760
field spreading out.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.460
I don't want to go into too
sophisticated analogies.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.830
But if you imagine the magnetic
field spreading out,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.580
and as it goes further and
further out it kind of gets

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.705
distributed over a wider and
wider circumference.

00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:15.270
And actually the formula I'm
going to give you kind of has

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.870
a taste for that.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.450
So the formula for the magnetic
field-- and it really

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.110
is defined with a cross product
and things like that,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.920
but for our purposes we won't
worry about that.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.350
You'll just have to know that
this is the shape if the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.950
current is going in
that direction.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.880
And, of course, if the current
was going downwards then the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.550
magnetic field would just
reverse directions.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.640
But it would still
be in co-centric

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.220
circles around the wire.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.870
But anyway, what is the
magnitude of that field?

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.630
The magnitude of that magnetic
field is equal to mu-- which

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.240
is a Greek letter, which I will
explain in a second--

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.120
times the current divided
by 2 pi r.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.590
So this has a little bit
of a feel for what

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.280
I was saying before.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.430
That the further you go out--
where r is how far you are

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.410
from the wire-- the further you
go out, if r gets bigger,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.750
the magnitude of the magnetic
field is going to get weaker.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.650
And this 2 pi r, that
looks a lot like the

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.140
circumference of a circle.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.225
So that gives you
a taste for it.

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:20.730
I know I haven't proved
anything rigorously.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.730
But it at least gives you a
sense of, look there's a

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.450
little formula for

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.350
circumference of a circle here.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.400
And that kind of makes
sense, right?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.280
Because the magnetic
field at that point

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.770
is kind of a circle.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.940
The magnitude is equal at an
equal radius around that wire.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.770
Now what is this mu, this thing
that looks like a u?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.380
Well, that's the permeability
of the material

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.330
that the wire's in.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.990
So the magnetic field is
actually going to have a

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.820
different strength depending on
whether this wire is going

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.420
through rubber, whether it's
going through a vacuum, or

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.840
air, or metal, or water.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.400
And for the purposes of your
high school physics class, we

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.990
assume that it's going
through air normally.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.930
And the value for air
is pretty close to

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.310
the value for a vacuum.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.600
And it's called the permeability
of a vacuum.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.410
And I forget what
that value is.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.200
I could look it up.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.820
But it actually turns
out that your

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.010
calculator has that value.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.710
So let's do a problem,
just to put some

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.580
numbers to the formula.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.460
So let's say I had this current
and it is-- I don't

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.032
know, the current is equal
to-- I'm going

00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:22.780
to make up a number.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.740
2 amperes.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.320
And let's say that I just pick
a point right here that is--

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.670
let's say that that's
3 meters away

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.950
from the wire in question.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.980
So my question to you is what
is the magnitude in the

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.760
direction of the magnetic
field right there?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.140
Well, the magnitude is easy.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.650
We just substitute
in this equation.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.540
So the magnitude of the magnetic
field at this point

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.410
is equal to-- and we assume that
the wire's going through

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.270
air or a vacuum-- the
permeability of free space--

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.770
that's just a constant, though
it looks fancy-- times the

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.910
current times 2 amperes
divided by 2 pi r.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.345
What's r?

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:07.350
It's 3 meters.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.020
So 2 pi times 3.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.260
So it equals the permeability
of free space.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.510
So let's see.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.630
The 2 and the 2 cancel
out over 3 pi.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.350
So how do we calculate that?

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:24.040
Well, we get out our trusty
TI-85 calculator.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.510
And I think you'll be maybe
pleasantly surprised or

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.330
shocked to realize that-- I
deleted everything just so you

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.280
can see how I get there--
that it actually has the

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.640
permeability of free
space stored in it.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.220
So what you do is you go to
second and you press constant,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.330
which is the 4 button.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.560
It's in the built-in
constants.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.790
Let's see, it's not
one of those.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.430
You press more.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.040
It's not one of those,
press more.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.170
Oh look at that.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.700
Mu not.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.270
The permeability
of free space.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.120
That's what I need.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.190
And I have to divide
it by 3 pi.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.570
Divide it by 3-- and
then where is pi?

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.210
There it is.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.000
It's over the power sign.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.880
Divided by 3 pi.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.480
It equals 1.3 times 10 to
the negative seventh.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.940
It's going to be teslas.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.820
The magnetic field is going to
be equal to 1.3 times 10 to

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.270
the minus seventh teslas.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.290
So it's a fairly weak
magnetic field.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.220
And that's why you don't have
metal objects being thrown

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.520
around by the wires behind
your television set.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.650
But anyway, hopefully that gives
you a little bit-- and

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.289
just so you know how it
all fits together.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.700
We're saying that these moving
charges, not only can they be

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.909
affected by a magnetic field,
not only can a current be

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.870
affected by a magnetic field
or just a moving charge, it

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.270
actually creates them.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.840
And that kind of creates a
little bit of symmetry in your

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.270
head, hopefully.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.770
Because that was also true
of electric field.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.170
A charge, a stationary charge,
is obviously pulled or pushed

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.760
by a static electric field.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.910
And it also creates its own
static electric field.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.640
So it's always in the
back of your mind.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.180
Because if you keep studying
physics, you're going to

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.000
actually prove to yourself that
electric and magnetic

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.790
fields are two sides
of the same coin.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.150
And it just looks like a
magnetic field when you're in

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.930
a different frame of reference,
When something is

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.020
whizzing past you.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.650
While if you were whizzing along
with it, then that thing

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.350
would look static.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.830
And then it might look a
little bit more like an

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.820
electric field.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.230
But anyway, I'll leave
you there now.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.160
And in the next video I will
show you what happens when we

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.440
have two wires carrying current

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.660
parallel to each other.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.630
And you might guess that they
might actually attract or

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.560
repel each other.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.450
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
