up straight with your shoulders back
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.000
up straight with your shoulders back
it's a discussion of hierarchies and and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
it's a discussion of hierarchies and and
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.100
it's a discussion of hierarchies and and
their eternal nature right because my

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
their eternal nature right because my
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.810
their eternal nature right because my

it's mere fact that organisms that have

it's mere fact that organisms that have
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.910
it's mere fact that organisms that have
to cooperate and compete with other

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
to cooperate and compete with other
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.000
to cooperate and compete with other
organisms of their type inevitably

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
organisms of their type inevitably
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070
organisms of their type inevitably
arrange themselves into hierarchies and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
arrange themselves into hierarchies and
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040
arrange themselves into hierarchies and
that's been going on for so long which

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
that's been going on for so long which
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.799
that's been going on for so long which
is at least 300 million years that our

nervous systems have adapted to
hierarchies as if they're a permanent

serotonin is acutely sensitive to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
serotonin is acutely sensitive to
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.619
serotonin is acutely sensitive to
hierarchical distinctions and so that's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
hierarchical distinctions and so that's
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110
hierarchical distinctions and so that's
part of the proposition I laid that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
part of the proposition I laid that
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.549
part of the proposition I laid that
proposition forward was to say whatever

proposition forward was to say whatever
 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.950
proposition forward was to say whatever

West's patriarchy or capitalism it's
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330
West's patriarchy or capitalism it's
like that's a non-starter you're wrong

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
like that's a non-starter you're wrong
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.120
like that's a non-starter you're wrong
and not just a little bit wrong you're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
and not just a little bit wrong you're
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.890
and not just a little bit wrong you're
so seriously wrong that if you insist

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
so seriously wrong that if you insist
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020
so seriously wrong that if you insist

not grappling with the problem the
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.710
not grappling with the problem the
problem is if hierarchies are a problem

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
problem is if hierarchies are a problem
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.740
problem is if hierarchies are a problem
which they are the problem is way more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
which they are the problem is way more
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.609
which they are the problem is way more
serious than mere capitalism it's way

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
serious than mere capitalism it's way
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.770
serious than mere capitalism it's way
deeper and if you're actually interested

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
deeper and if you're actually interested
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.160
deeper and if you're actually interested
in rectifying the constantly the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
in rectifying the constantly the
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.780
in rectifying the constantly the
negative consequences of hierarchies

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
negative consequences of hierarchies
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.920
negative consequences of hierarchies
then you're gonna have to get a lot more

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
then you're gonna have to get a lot more
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.140
then you're gonna have to get a lot more
sophisticated than they're then you're

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
sophisticated than they're then you're
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.429
sophisticated than they're then you're
idiot Marxism so so so part of the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
idiot Marxism so so so part of the
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.550
idiot Marxism so so so part of the
elaboration of that argument is well

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
elaboration of that argument is well
 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.260
elaboration of that argument is well
hierarchies are inevitable because we

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
hierarchies are inevitable because we
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969
hierarchies are inevitable because we
have to solve complex problems and we

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
have to solve complex problems and we
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980
have to solve complex problems and we
have to solve them socially and when you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
have to solve them socially and when you
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780
have to solve them socially and when you
implement a solution to a complex

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
implement a solution to a complex
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.420
implement a solution to a complex
problem socially you produce a hierarchy

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
problem socially you produce a hierarchy
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.830
problem socially you produce a hierarchy
because some people are better at the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
because some people are better at the
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.719
because some people are better at the
implementation than others so there's a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
implementation than others so there's a
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.639
implementation than others so there's a
hierarchy of competence and then there's

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
hierarchy of competence and then there's
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.010
hierarchy of competence and then there's
a hierarchy of distribution of the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
a hierarchy of distribution of the
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.919
a hierarchy of distribution of the
Spoils and so and in both of those

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
Spoils and so and in both of those
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.830
Spoils and so and in both of those
hierarchies you get a disproportionate

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840
hierarchies you get a disproportionate
 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.460
hierarchies you get a disproportionate
clumping of resource

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
clumping of resource
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380
clumping of resource
at the top and dispossession at the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390
at the top and dispossession at the
 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.480
at the top and dispossession at the
bottom it's in the nature of hierarchies

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490
bottom it's in the nature of hierarchies
 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.380
bottom it's in the nature of hierarchies
so what's the left for the left is to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
so what's the left for the left is to
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.440
so what's the left for the left is to
remind those who are benefiting from the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
remind those who are benefiting from the
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.530
remind those who are benefiting from the
hierarchies that the hierarchy comes at

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
hierarchies that the hierarchy comes at
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.190
hierarchies that the hierarchy comes at
a cost and the cost is the clumping of

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
a cost and the cost is the clumping of
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.800
a cost and the cost is the clumping of
people at the bottom and that that's an

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
people at the bottom and that that's an
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.640
people at the bottom and that that's an
eternal cost and it's not trivial and so

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
eternal cost and it's not trivial and so
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.260
eternal cost and it's not trivial and so
that's what the left should be properly

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270
that's what the left should be properly
 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.240
that's what the left should be properly
focused on the Left should be providing

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
focused on the Left should be providing
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.910
focused on the Left should be providing
the voice of those who are dispossessed

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
the voice of those who are dispossessed
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.130
the voice of those who are dispossessed
by hierarchies and the right should be

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
by hierarchies and the right should be
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.360
by hierarchies and the right should be
saying yeah but the damn hierarchies are

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370
saying yeah but the damn hierarchies are
 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.490
saying yeah but the damn hierarchies are
necessary and they're not only necessary

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
necessary and they're not only necessary
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.090
necessary and they're not only necessary
but they're also productive then the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100
but they're also productive then the
 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.600
but they're also productive then the
left says yes but they tilt towards

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610
left says yes but they tilt towards
 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.310
left says yes but they tilt towards
tyranny and they can be occupied

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320
tyranny and they can be occupied
 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.199
tyranny and they can be occupied
inappropriately by people who are

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
inappropriately by people who are
 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.230
inappropriately by people who are
playing games of power fair enough the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240
playing games of power fair enough the
 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.940
playing games of power fair enough the
right has to take that into account the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950
right has to take that into account the
 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.340
right has to take that into account the
hierarchy can reach it reach it if I and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350
hierarchy can reach it reach it if I and
 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.980
hierarchy can reach it reach it if I and
is likely to do that and it can be taken

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990
is likely to do that and it can be taken
 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.420
is likely to do that and it can be taken
over by people who are corrupt and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
over by people who are corrupt and
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.870
over by people who are corrupt and
that's likely to happen and so but but

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
that's likely to happen and so but but
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.729
that's likely to happen and so but but
it's okay because the dialogue can work

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739
it's okay because the dialogue can work
 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.070
it's okay because the dialogue can work
out the the right can say well yeah we

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080
out the the right can say well yeah we
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.479
out the the right can say well yeah we
need the damn hierarchies and they need

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489
need the damn hierarchies and they need
 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.250
need the damn hierarchies and they need
to be buttressed and the left can say

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
to be buttressed and the left can say
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.910
to be buttressed and the left can say
yes but they have to be maintained

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920
yes but they have to be maintained
 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.280
yes but they have to be maintained
properly so they don't deteriorate and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
properly so they don't deteriorate and
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.440
properly so they don't deteriorate and
degenerate and and I think that's I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450
degenerate and and I think that's I
 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.360
degenerate and and I think that's I
think that's ancient wisdom I think the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370
think that's ancient wisdom I think the
 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.920
think that's ancient wisdom I think the
ancient Egyptians had figured that out

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
ancient Egyptians had figured that out
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.460
ancient Egyptians had figured that out
in their symbolic representations so now

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470
in their symbolic representations so now
 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.009
in their symbolic representations so now
when the left goes too far

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019
when the left goes too far
 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.140
when the left goes too far
it does something like say well how

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150
it does something like say well how
 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.090
it does something like say well how
about no hierarchies it's like no how

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100
about no hierarchies it's like no how
 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.110
about no hierarchies it's like no how
about not wrong because all that happens
