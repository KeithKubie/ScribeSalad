00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.660
Movies based on Marvel Comics have been popular
for quite some time now.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.830
Marvel Studios themselves, Fox, Sony Pictures
and various other movie studios have been

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.113
responsible for their production and distribution
over the years, but what they all have in

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:20.113
common is the fact that they contain popular
Marvel characters.On the whole, they've been

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:21.113
very good.

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:22.113
Movies based on Marvel properties have tended
to perform better both critically and commercially

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:23.113
than those based on DC properties, for example
- The Dark Knight Trilogy aside - but none

00:00:23.113 --> 00:00:26.070
of them are perfect by any stretch of the
imagination.If you look close enough, factual

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
errors, continuity errors, things being in
shot that shouldn't be, and various other

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.000
mistakes are prominent in them all.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.750
This video will take a look at some prime
examples.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.760
Here are ten Marvel movie mistakes the don't
want you to find.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.989
The Avengers
There's a fairly silly continuity error in

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.339
The Avengers and it occurs just after the
second engine goes down on the S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.399
Helicarrier, following the attack on it by
the mind-controlled Hawkeye and Loki's other

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.399
henchmen.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.339
The visual display in Iron Man's helmet shows
the altitude of the Helicarrier as being 15,000

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.300
feet and rapidly falling.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.070
However, a short time later, just after a
dying Phil Coulson shoots Loki with the Destroyer

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.489
gun, even though it has been falling since
the engine went down, the altitude on the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.490
Helicarrier's bridge shows it as being at
18,000 feet.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.330
Miraculously, it has somehow "fallen" upwards
by more than 3,000 feet in that time.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.650
Guardians of the Galaxy
In Guardians of the Galaxy, when Peter Quill

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.010
and Gamora first encounter one another and
get into a fight on the Nova Corps' home planet

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.970
of Xandar, Gamora grabs the Orb Infinity Stone
that Quill is carrying and runs away.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.280
Quill throws a laser-based lasso-type device
at her, which snares her legs and causes her

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.360
to trip over.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.140
She removes it and, immediately in the next
shot, it has completely vanished from the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140
ground.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.330
While you might want to argue that it was
a laser and could just have dissipated, It

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.600
also had mechanical components, so even if
the laser had vanished, the mechanical pieces

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.050
should still have been on the ground.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.270
Deadpool
In 2016's brilliantly irreverent Deadpool,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.250
after Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead
interruped the Merc with a Mouth's interaction

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.650
with the villainous Ajax on the bridge, Colossus
handcuffs himself to Deadpool in an attempt

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.710
to recruit him to the X-Men.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.310
Deadpool flat-out refuses and even goes as
far as to cut off his own left hand in order

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.380
to escape the Russian mutant's clutches.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.860
However, as Deadpool falls from the bridge
into a truck on the freeway below, it's actually

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.990
his right hand that's missing.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.470
The CGI guys got that one very wrong indeed.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.069
The Amazing Spider-Man
In The Amazing Spider-Man, after Peter Parker

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.810
is bitten by a radioactive spider during a
visit to Oscorp, he takes the subway to get

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.810
home.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.090
During the journey, he discovers he has developed
spider-like abilities, such as sharp senses,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.670
incredible reflexes, super-speed and the ability
to stick to things.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.810
Inadvertently, this gets him into a fight
and, at one point, a passenger uses Peter's

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.280
own skateboard to hit him.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.450
The passenger in question is a black gentleman
in a T-shirt, but a split second later he

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.620
appears to have inexplciably shapeshifted
into a white guy wearing a checkered shirt.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.400
X-Men: Days of Future Past
In X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is set

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.230
in 1973, there are a number of factual errors
that don't fit with the date in question.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.770
The most obvious one occurs when Magneto enters
the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.180
There's a groundskeeper lining a baseball
field there - but that stadium didn't host

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.040
baseball in 1973, as the Washington Senators
had moved to Texas to become the Texas Rangers

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.170
after the 1971 season.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.069
In 1973, the only team playing there regularly
was the NFL team the Washington Redskins,

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.740
so the only lining being done should have
been for a football field.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.350
Ant-Man
Although it's a fictional concept and we allow

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.760
for the suspension of disbelief, the principal
of size manipulation in Ant-Man is said to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.680
work on the basis of the space between molecules
altering - the space decreases for shrinking

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.380
and increases for enlarging.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.099
This means that objects will weigh the same,
regardless of their size.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.610
Scott Lang couldn't ride an ant, therefore,
and nor could Hank Pym walk around with a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.480
60 tonne tank in his pocket.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.989
Other errors of this nature include Darren
Cross lifting a full grown sheep between his

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.380
finger and thumb, and the supersized Thomas
The Tank Engine toy crushing a police car,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.989
which it would actually be far too light to
do any damage to.

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.250
Fantastic Four
Let's be honest, the entirety of 2015's awful

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.260
Fantastic Four reboot could quite easily be
an entry on this list, as it was a terrible

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.459
mistake to have ever made it, but we'd like
to be a bit more specific than that - so let's

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.459
go with a particularly well-known mistake
from within the movie.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.820
Due to the reshooting of several scenes in
the movie, Sue Storm's hairstyle, as well

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.120
as the texture, length and colour of her hair,
changes from scene to scene, and even at times

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.480
from shot to shot.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.870
This was because Kate Mara's hair had been
cut when she was called back for the reshot

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.200
scenes and she was actually forced to wear
a wig - which is actually kind of farcical.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.140
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance
Right at the very beginning of Ghost Rider:

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.139
Spirit of Vengeance, Idris Elba's Moreau - a
French priest in the movie - is riding on

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.230
a motorcycle with the license plate number
NC-5 753-T. That is clearly visible in close-ups.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.670
However, moments later, as he rides along
a stone road that leads to the monastery he

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.820
is heading to, before he passes two guards
at the monestary's entrance, we can see that

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.580
the screen has been flipped for some bizarre
reason, as the number plate we had just seen

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.850
is briefly written backwards on the screen.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.640
This was obviously either a mistake, or it
was done on purpose without realising that

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.750
the audience would be able to tell.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.980
Blade: Trinity
At the start of Blade: Trinity, Blade is framed

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.780
for the murder of a human by the vampire community
and he allows himself to be captured and arrested.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.740
After an interrogation proves futile, the
police prepare to hand Blade over to a group

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.330
of federal agents who, unbeknownst to them,
are vampires.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.680
He is rescued by Hannibal King and Abigal
Whistler but, during their escape, he heads

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.490
to a higher floor in the police station to
find his sword.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.940
He reemerges outside after crashing through
a window and landing dramatically on the concrete,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.430
followed by a lot of glass, which covers the
floor around him.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.090
However, in the next scene, once he stands
upright, the glass around him has weirdly

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.360
disappeared.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.040
Captain America: Civil War
Captain America: Civil War was fantastic - one

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.580
of the best movies of 2016 and the highest-grossing
one of the year so far - but there's a mistake

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.080
in the movie that was even in the trailer
and still made it to the final cut.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.600
When Spider-Man makes his big entrance at
the German airport where the movie's main

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.760
battle takes place, he flips through the air
and relieves Captain America of his shield

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760
using his webbing.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.550
However, mere moments later, when he lands
on top of the vehicle holding said shield,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.620
the webbing has mysteriously vanished from
it.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.050
Given how sticky that webbing is, there's
no way even Spidey himself could have removed

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.370
it that quickly.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.270
