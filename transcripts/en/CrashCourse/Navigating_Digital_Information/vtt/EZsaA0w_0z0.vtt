Hi I’m John Green, welcome to Crash Course
Navigating Digital Information.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.650
So, the internet is a place where you can
meet friends for life from halfway around

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.990
the world, you can keep in touch with your
loved ones, you can learn new languages and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.210
pick up new skills.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.859
It’s also a place where your mother can
tag you in an extremely detailed Facebook

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.100
post about the night of your birth that all
your friends can see.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.119
And it’s a place where you can accidentally
like your ex’s new boyfriend’s Instagram

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.321
selfie from three years ago.

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.060
God it would be hard to be a young person
on the Internet right now.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.620
I really admire your fortitude and resilience.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.280
These days, a lot of us are asking whether
the Internet is a net positive or a net negative

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.410
in our lives.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.080
But I tend to think that question might be
what the Buddhist Zen masters called, A question

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.110
wrongly put.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.160
Instead, the better question might be, “How
can I make the Internet a more positive force

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.000
in my life, and the lives of others?”

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.050
And part of the answer, I think, is that better
information leads to better decision making,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.320
which leads to a better world.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.350
So for the sake of our collective souls, let’s
improve our information sorting.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:14.060
INTRO
As you may remember from our first episode,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.920
we’ve teamed up with MediaWise, with support
from Google to bring you this series.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.720
Our friends at the Stanford History Education
Group -- or SHEG -- have done a lot of research

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
on how internet users evaluate the information
they find.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.189
They’ve tested middle school, high school,
and college students, history professors,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.570
and fact checkers, who were by far the best
at judging the reliability of information.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.009
Professional fact checkers work with news
organizations to verify facts.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.640
Sometimes that means they look over articles
before they’re published to ensure their

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.540
content is accurate and up to date.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.880
They might call up a source, for example,
to double check the spelling of their name.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.160
Once, there was a profile of me in the New
Yorker, and the fact-checker asked me questions

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.869
for OVER AN HOUR.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.460
And in the end, the piece contained no errors.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.780
Although, it did an illustration I found a
tad unflattering.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.600
To be fair, the illustration also contained
no errors.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.740
I just don’t think I like my face.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.830
Anyway, fact checkers also work for publications
whose sole purpose is to verify claims made

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.830
by public figures or on the internet, and
explain why they are or are not true.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.140
Snopes and Politifact are some of the more
well-known fact-checking sites.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.100
So, in the Stanford study, college students,
history professors, and fact-checkers were

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.630
all asked to look at two websites.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.090
One website belonged to the American Academy
of Pediatrics[1], or the AAP, the main professional

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.070
organization of pediatricians.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.489
The other site belonged to the American /College/
of Pediatricians, or the ACP.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.879
Now of course, they sound very similar, but
the ACP is actually an organization that broke

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.520
away from the AAP because the AAP supports
adoption by LGBTQ couples.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.220
The AAP is a large, well-respected professional
organization.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.019
My kids’ pediatrician is a member.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.130
The ACP, on the other hand, is a much smaller,
more ideologically-motivated interest group.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.720
But looking at the two sites, many of the
professors and students thought ACP’s site

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.730
was more credible.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.730
Why?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.019
Because they focused on the site itself.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.640
They spent time examining and reading the
website, noticing that there were footnotes,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.720
and checking out its design elements.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.810
One student said of ACP’s website, “I
can automatically see this source and trust

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.110
it just because of how official it looks...even
the font and the way the logo looks makes

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.200
me think this is a mind hive that compiled
this.”[2]

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.350
The ACP’s website may have looked official,
but when compared the the AAP’s website,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.000
its information was less reliable.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.890
AAP is the trustworthy group.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.470
So, the professors and students focused on
the websites themselves and how they /presented/

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.470
information to decide which was more credible.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.379
That meant they didn’t do a great job evaluating
the source itself.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.970
The fact-checkers on the other hand, did much
better.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.970
That’s because they consistently asked themselves
three questions while evaluating the sites:

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.970
1.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.239
Who is behind this information?

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.239
2.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.500
What is the evidence for their claims?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.500
And 3.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.540
What do other sources say about the organization
and its claims?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.380
These questions are a really useful framework
when you want to interpret the accuracy of

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.730
information you’ve encountered.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.720
Let’s begin with who’s behind the information:

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.900
First, we want to know who exactly is sharing
it with you.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.000
A friend on facebook?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.160
A stranger?

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.720
A news organization?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.130
Is it promoted post that a company paid to
insert into your feed?

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.250
An anonymous social media account?

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.800
And then we should ask ourselves WHY they
are sharing it.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.610
Each of those sharers mentioned could have
very different reasons for presenting information

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.890
in a particular way.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.500
I am, for instance, incentivized by my career
to say that I think teenagers should read

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.660
contemporary fiction, specifically contemporary
fiction written by me, and I am more likely

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.790
to share stories of people who benefited from
reading contemporary fiction.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.620
And even your personal friends have motivations
for sharing what they do online--they may

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.810
want to signal what kind of person they are
(or wish to be seen as), or they may want

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.780
to win over others to their worldview, or
they may be trying to get someone’s attention

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.780
with a subtweet.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.710
A journalist might be sharing information
because they think it’s important for their

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.380
readers to know, but, of course, that decision
is based on their own personal experiences.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.320
An advocate for a particular cause might be
sharing information to persuade others to

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.320
join that cause.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.810
Once you’ve established who is sharing information
with you and thought about why they might

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.710
be doing so, you get to the heart of the matter.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.710
The claim itself.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.490
Take a moment to identify what, if any, claims
are actually being made.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.949
It could be a factual claim or an opinion
statement.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.350
Reading is a useful skill is a factual claim.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.010
Reading The Fault in Our Stars will make your
life better, clear your skin, and improve

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.949
your wardrobe is an opinion statement.

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:49.949
And a true one.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.600
Next you’ll search for two things: whether
they’ve backed up that claim with evidence

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.350
and whether that evidence is from a reliable
source.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.320
Evidence could come in the form of a link
to the article or study they’re referencing.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.199
It could be a video or photo illustrating
what they’ve described.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.400
It could even be the name of someone who made
the claim in the first place.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.130
The next step is to look at the source of
this evidence.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.520
Is it a reputable source, like a trusted news
organization or an expert in the field?

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.650
Or is it from some random blog you’ve never
heard of?

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.610
Does it back up its claims with other sources
or explain how its information was gathered?

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.639
If you’ve never heard of the source of this
information, you can use a search engine to

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.780
discover what others say about it.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.919
The sheer /existence/ of evidence is not enough
to verify a claim.

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.960
The /absence/ of evidence, on the other hand,
is reason to be skeptical of its veracity

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.610
until you can verify it.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.690
And that brings us to the final and really
vital step: what do others say about this

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.690
claim?

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.830
Whenever you’re checking on the truth, you
can and should check multiple sources to see

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.699
what other information is out there.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.330
Check a search engine or a website known to
be an authority on the topic to see what others

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.620
have published about it.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.060
If a trustworthy source backs it up, great.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.770
If you can’t find evidence for that claim
or you find evidence to the contrary, then

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.120
you can be fairly certain it’s not true.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.389
So these three questions -- who’s behind
it, what’s the evidence, and what do others

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:16.400
say -- really kind of put information through
the ringer.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.010
Let’s try it out in the Thought Bubble.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:25.699
Here’s a tweet from Steve S. @steelseller002:
Each American uses 25 plastic straws daily.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:27.099
We should use metal ones!!!

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:28.099
All right.

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:31.639
Let’s begin by asking who’s behind this
information and what motivated them to post

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:32.639
it.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:37.360
His profile says his name is Steve S. His
handle is @steelseller002.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.130
So you search “Steve S., steel seller.”

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.550
It turns out, @steelseller002 /sells steel/.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.860
Perhaps he loves the environment and wants
to help reduce waste.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.919
He also might just want to sell more steel.

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.330
So now, you look at the evidence of this information.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.819
He didn’t give us any.

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.639
Even if he had provided a source, that wouldn’t
guarantee this is trustworthy -- claims should

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.389
be backed up by evidence, and not all evidence
is created equal.

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.569
But the absence of it is suspicious.

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:08.169
Finally, you want to look into what /other/
sources have to say about this claim.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:12.310
As we’ve established, some are more credible
than others, but all sources have their limits.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.460
So it’s important to seek multiple trustworthy
sources when fact-checking.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.050
You do a simple internet search: “Number
of straws used by Americans per day.”

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:25.889
The New York Times cites two research firms
that say America as a whole uses between 170

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.580
and 390 million straws per day.[3] That’s
a little over one per person per day at most.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.260
But search results from Time Magazine,
the Washington Post,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.630
and The Seattle Times cite another statistic:
500 million per day.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:41.440
Some publications, though, say that statistic
was compiled by a 9-year-old who polled straw

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.490
manufacturers.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:47.680
Regardless, that estimate is still fewer than
two straws per American per day.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.250
So we have no consensus.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:55.820
But from our research it seems somewhere between
170 and 500 million straws per day is more

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.820
accurate.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.470
Far fewer than Steve’s claim.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.470
Steve.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.800
Thank you, Thought Bubble.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.070
I just...we were just talking about the name
Steve, and whether anybody is named Steve,

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.339
and I asked Zulaiha if she knew anybody named
Steve, and she said, “I don’t anyone young

00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:10.360
named Steve.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.740
Just one guy in his late 20s.”

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.190
Oh God.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.540
Oh God, Father Time is coming for me.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.459
What were we talking about, Stan?

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:24.910
Right, checking with multiple sources made
us pretty skeptical of Steve’s claim.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.390
Typical for an old guy in his late 20s.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.959
Now, that doesn’t mean plastic straws should
be widely distributed, or that they don’t

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:36.330
have negative impacts,or that you can trust
@plasticseller002 on Twitter--but regardless

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.519
of how you feel about straws, we need to have
these discussions with real data and real

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.670
cost-benefit analyses.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.680
Better information makes for better decisions.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.390
You’re going to hear me say that a few times.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:54.120
Now I know that this seems like an absurd
amount of work to check the veracity of one

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.250
tweet out GAJILLIONZ of tweets.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:02.890
But there is no simple, magical way to have
an information feed that is always reliable.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.390
And so when you encounter information that
comes from sources you don’t already trust,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.290
you have to be suspicious of it.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.820
And even when it comes from sources you do
already trust, you have to be a little suspicious

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.839
of it.

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:19.750
Interrogating the information we come across
online is just so important.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.680
You cannot believe everything you read -- but
that doesn’t mean you should distrust everything

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.690
you read, either.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.160
This is actually its own problem.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.890
We’ve become so skeptical of widely believed
information, that we’ll believe any evidence

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.240
that counters that information, regardless
of whether it is accurate.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.649
There’s a very fine line between being skeptical
-- or, not easily convinced -- and being cynical,

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:44.840
or generally distrustful of everyone else’s
motives.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.579
A healthy dose of skepticism improves our
critical thinking and judgement.

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:52.410
But cynicism clouds our judgement with negativity
and suspicion.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.709
It’s really difficult for any of us, on
a minute-by-minute basis, to carefully vet

00:10:56.709 --> 00:11:02.190
the contents of every tweet or reddit post
we see while scrolling and swiping.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.770
But if we can carefully interrogate some sources,
we can find some that we regularly trust,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.040
which makes it easier to navigate the Internet
over time.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.080
Whenever your inner skeptic speaks up, your
fact-checking can begin by checking in with

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.300
your trusted sources.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.000
But of course, the problem with this is that
your inner skeptic may speak up mostly when

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.140
you see information that seems like it must
be wrong to you because it does not align

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.779
with your pre-existing worldview.

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:32.201
Here’s an example from my own life: I don’t
want to alienate anyone here, so I’ll use

00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:33.980
like, hypothetical examples.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:39.700
Let’s say there’s some horrible football
club named United Manchester FC.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.990
Watching one of their games recently, I shared
a tweet about how United Manchester FC are

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.930
awarded more penalty kicks than any other
team, and how it is blatantly unfair.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:54.209
And everyone agreed with me, because almost
everyone in my feed also reviles United Manchester

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.209
FC.

00:11:55.209 --> 00:12:00.209
It was only much later that I learned that
the football team I support has actually been

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:05.310
awarded more penalties over the past 25 years
than United Manchester.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:11.800
The disinformation did not trip up my inner
skeptic, because it seemed like the kind of

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.490
thing that would be true.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.910
So we shouldn’t /just/ wait for our inner
skeptic to tap us on the shoulder about information

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.430
we disagree with.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:24.730
We need to make a habit of quickly checking
out whatever we find interesting or shareable

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.420
or that makes us emotional.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.950
Because that is the kind of stuff that changes
our decisions, and also changes us.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:36.990
And so we have to train those internal falsehood
alarms to respond not just to potential misinformation

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.520
we disagree with.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.300
That’s why fact-checkers are so good at
this -- they have to check everything.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.630
But this work is like any other kind of training:
the more you utilize your information analyzing

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.380
muscles, the stronger they’ll get.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:56.250
So, we’ll continue to work out next time,
but, you know, not, like, with movement.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.560
Just...up here.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.170
I’ll see you then.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.519
For this series, Crash Course has teamed up
with MediaWise, a project out of the Poynter

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:06.459
Institute that was created with support from
Google.

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:08.050
The Poynter Institute is a non-profit journalism
school.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.970
The goal of MediaWise is to teach students
how to assess the accuracy of information

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.220
they encounter online.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.280
The MediaWise curriculum was developed by
the Stanford History Education Group based

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.080
on civic online reasoning research that they
began in 2015.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:27.649

MediaWise and fact-checking, you can visit
