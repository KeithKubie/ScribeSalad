00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:11.716
&gt;&gt;Student: So we're testing
if it's soluble now.

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:17.316
We'll test conductivity, density,
and then make a diamond table after.

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.846
&gt;&gt;Brenda: I feel really good about
what's happening in my classroom.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:22.536
The students are really engaged.

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:26.936
I don't have as many students off
task because they're really interested

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:29.126
in what's happening in the classroom.

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:36.246
&gt;&gt;Patrick: The vision of
Maloney High School is

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.736
to create student centered environments
where kids have more opportunities

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:41.986
to prove their learning,
to explore their learning.

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:44.686
We want students to be problem solvers.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.476
&gt;&gt;Brenda: To make your
lessons more student centered,

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:49.166
you want to think about
what your role is.

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:52.866
You as the teacher act more
as a facilitator or a coach,

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.146
rather than the person who
disseminates information.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.096
We have some student
centered learning tactics

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:01.216
that we want happening
in our classrooms.

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:04.456
They're a really great way for
teachers to plan their lessons.

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:06.706
&gt;&gt;Patrick: The first
approach is to find ways

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:09.306
that the lesson can engage
student to student discourse.

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:10.626
How can students work together?

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:12.786
&gt;&gt;Lindsey, group one, right there.

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.206
&gt;&gt;We want kids to be in groups
that will make them successful,

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.436
where students can not
only express their ideas,

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:19.706
but also learn from each other.

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:24.506
We're trying to get every single student
to have some hand in the learning.

00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:26.466
&gt;&gt;All right, so we'll do what
we usually do with the poem.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.586
We'll read it out loud together
first, and then you're going to react.

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:31.496
Did you like it, did you dislike it?

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:33.366
What do you think the poem is about?

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.306
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?"

00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:39.256
&gt;&gt;Ethan: Today we analyzed
sonnet eighteen from Shakespeare.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.946
Having a few students around
me is extremely helpful.

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:46.546
We'd analyze it and pick
apart even the smallest things

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:47.826
that I would never look at.

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:49.286
&gt;&gt;Mia: I don't get the middle, like--

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:52.196
&gt;&gt;Jake: The beauty of winter's
going to go away eventually,

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.316
like her beauty will never.

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:56.416
&gt;&gt;Mia: Anyone can interpret
a poem differently.

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:58.366
When you're in a small
group and you're just

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.336
with your peers, it's less intimidating.

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:03.376
It's like, okay, I can share my ideas
and not be afraid of being wrong.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:06.876
And when you're talking that way,
I feel like you understand it.

00:02:06.956 --> 00:02:08.556
&gt;&gt;Patrick: Student choice
and student ownership

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:11.586
over the work is also a curricular
element of student centered learning.

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:14.566
Step two of the lesson,
students were responsible

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.746
for deconstructing each scene
from act three of "Hamlet."

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:20.436
&gt;&gt;Do you guys want to work
like, in pairs or you want

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:21.896
to do something each individually?

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:25.686
&gt;&gt;One group did a mind mapping exercise,
where they took the key elements

00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:27.066
of the scene that they were assigned.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:30.386
Another group decided that they
wanted to do their own performance.

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:33.196
&gt;&gt;Mia: When a woman takes
a second husband,

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:34.586
it's because she killed off the first.

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:35.176
&gt;&gt;Jake: Harsh.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:36.516
&gt;&gt;Patrick: So the students
had ownership.

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:38.946
They were able to explore
what they wanted to explore.

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:41.086
At the heart of it was analysis.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.406
Do they understand what these
characters are going through?

00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:45.906
Do they understand what
Shakespeare is trying to get across.

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:47.896
&gt;&gt;Jake: He runs away
because he's guilty.

00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:50.036
&gt;&gt;Mia: End scene.

00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:52.171
[applause]

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:55.756
&gt;&gt;Brenda: It's easy to have everybody
sitting down quiet and taking notes.

00:02:55.756 --> 00:03:00.076
It's hard to get everybody to think
outside the box, but that's what's going

00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:01.736
to happen in a student
centered classroom.

00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:05.556
It's going to look a little bit
chaotic, because not everybody's going

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:07.916
to be doing the same thing
at the same time necessarily.

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:12.376
&gt;&gt;So we've been learning about
chemical bonds, and now what we're going

00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:14.206
to be doing is an enquiry lab.

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:17.166
&gt;&gt;You're giving the students
all the tools that they need,

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:19.726
but then you're asking them
to come up with their own lab.

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:23.286
You're really figuring out
what they've understood.

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:24.746
&gt;&gt;You have six unknowns.

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:27.956
You might think you know what
they are just by looking at them,

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.696
but now you're going to
have to use your knowledge

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:32.426
of chemistry to prove what they are.

00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:35.726
&gt;&gt;Jake: All the substances
look exactly the same.

00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:37.316
They were white, they were powdery.

00:03:37.576 --> 00:03:39.986
Right off the bat we knew,
well, they're not malleable,

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:42.626
they're not ductile,
can they be conductive?

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:46.926
&gt;&gt;Brenda: My role is to facilitate
what they were doing, so I would listen

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:50.096
to their questions, maybe answer
their question with a question

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.696
to have them delve further
into their knowledge?

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.746
&gt;&gt;What do you think you
have to do with it?

00:03:54.746 --> 00:03:57.746
&gt;&gt;Jake: I'm guessing you've
just got to stick the end in.

00:03:58.046 --> 00:04:00.316
&gt;&gt;She gives us a little bit of
direction, but she doesn't give us a lot

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:02.406
of direction, and it's
frustrating in the beginning.

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:06.566
But as you dig deeper and deeper and
deeper, like, it becomes more fulfilling

00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:08.916
than if she told you what
exactly to do, because you feel

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:10.806
like you're being a scientist yourself.

00:04:10.806 --> 00:04:12.316
&gt;&gt;Oh, it went up...

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:16.116
&gt;&gt;Brenda: Another student centered
approach is authentic tasks.

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:19.836
So what the students did was something
that a chemist might do in a lab.

00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:21.596
Some students created data tables

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:24.846
and others were creating graphs
and looking at the trends.

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:25.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Two seventy-seven
point seven.

00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:29.556
&gt;&gt;Jake: I definitely feel like
student centered learning provides us

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:31.986
with a better outlook of what
real life is going to be.

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:35.386
It feels like you're experiencing
something rather than taking notes

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:38.196
on something, memorizing it and
having a test on it the next week.

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:39.056
It's fun.

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:41.906
&gt;&gt;Brenda: I think the students
here are starting to realize

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:44.316
that the teachers are
really in this yes mode.

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:48.696
And so they're asking more for
these authentic opportunities.

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:51.556
&gt;&gt;Mia: It makes me feel like I'm
taking control of my learning process.

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:54.516
It's my choice and it's what I want
to do with what I want to learn.

00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:58.096
We're asking questions and we're doing
activities that help our understanding.

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:00.646
&gt;&gt;Patrick: The student centered learning
approach has been beneficial to me.

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:02.496
For seventeen or eighteen
years, it was always,

00:05:02.876 --> 00:05:04.476
what am I going to tell the kids today?

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:08.056
And now it's, okay, what am I going
to have the kids show me today?

00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:10.616
&gt;&gt;Student: It's kind of like
a more hopeful beat, like...

00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:12.136
&gt;&gt;Patrick: Yes, that's perfect.

00:05:12.136 --> 00:05:14.546
&gt;&gt;They're showing me
what they're learning,

00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:17.616
and the person who's really kind
of blown away by that is me.
