00:00:00.776 --> 00:00:02.953
Voiceover:So we have two
complex numbers here.

00:00:02.953 --> 00:00:06.309
The complex number z is
equal to two plus three i

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:10.157
and the complex number w is
equal to negative five minus i.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.786
What I want to do in
this video is to first

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:16.658
plot these two complex
numbers on the complex plane

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:19.600
and then think about what
the distance is between

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.326
these two numbers on the
plane and what complex

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:26.139
number is exactly halfway
between these two numbers

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:27.877
or another way of thinking
about it, what complex

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:31.291
number is the midpoint
between these two numbers.

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:34.510
So I encourage you to
pause this video and think

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.879
about it on your own
before I work through it.

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:41.640
So let's first try to plot
these on the complex planes.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.310
So let me draw, so right over here,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.238
let me draw our imaginary axis.

00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:49.119
So our imaginary axis, and over

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.402
here let me draw our real axis.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:56.384
Real axis right over
there, and let's first,

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:58.319
let's see, we're gonna
have it go as high as

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.442
positive two in the real axis
and as low as negative five

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:07.632
along the real axis so let's
go one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:11.542
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:13.985
Along the imaginary axis
we go as high as positive

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.891
three and as low as negative one.

00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:19.699
So we could do one, two,
three and we could do

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:22.452
one, two, three and of
course I could keep going

00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:26.140
up here just to have nice
markers there although we

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.197
won't use that part of the plane.

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.399
Now let's plot these two points.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.659
So the real part of z
is two and then we have

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.290
three times i so the
imaginary part is three.

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:43.939
So we would go right over here.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.845
So this is two and this
is three right over here.

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:52.583
Two plus three i, so that
right over there is z.

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:55.772
Now let's plot w, w is negative five.

00:01:55.772 --> 00:01:58.598
One, two, three, four, five, negative five

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:02.944
minus i, so this is negative
one right over here.

00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:05.271
So minus i, that is w.

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:08.452
So first we can think about
the distance between these two

00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:11.398
complex numbers; the distance
on the complex plane.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.310
So one way of thinking
about it, that's really

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.128
just the distance of this
line right over here.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.834
And to figure that out
we can really just think

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:22.870
about the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:27.825
If you hear about the Distance
Formula in two dimensions,

00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:29.770
well that's really just
an application of the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.693
Pythagorean theorem, so let's
think about that a little bit.

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.582
So we can think about
how much have we changed

00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:39.436
along the real axis which is
this distance right over here.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.580
This is how much we've
changed along the real axis.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.929
And if we're going from
w to z, we're going from

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.805
negative 5 along the real axis to two.

00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:51.409
What is two minus negative 5?

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.375
Well it's seven, if we
go five to get to zero

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.957
along the real axis and then
we go two more to get to two,

00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:02.120
so the length of this
right over here is seven.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:09.712
And what is the length of
this side right over here?

00:03:09.712 --> 00:03:11.582
Well along the imaginary
axis we're going from

00:03:11.582 --> 00:03:15.572
negative one to three so
the distance there is four.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:18.037
So now we can apply the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:20.617
This is a right triangle, so the distance

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:24.171
is going to be equal to the distance.

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:26.501
Let's just say that this
is x right over here.

00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.894
x squared is going to be
equal to seven squared,

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:33.625
this is just the Pythagorean
theorem, plus four squared.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.740
Plus four squared or we
can say that x is equal

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.613
to the square root of 49 plus 16.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:44.959
I'll just write it out so
I don't skip any steps.

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:49.376
49 plus 16, now what is
that going to be equal to?

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:56.890
That is 65 so x, that's right,
59 plus another 6 is 65.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.668
x is equal to the square root of 65.

00:04:01.668 --> 00:04:04.357
Now let's see, 65 you can't factor this.

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:06.282
There's no factors that
are perfect squares here,

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:09.990
this is just 13 times five so

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.604
we can just leave it like that.

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:13.427
x is equal to the square
root of 65 so the distance

00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:16.281
in the complex plane between
these two complex numbers,

00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:21.826
square root of 65 which is I
guess a little bit over eight.

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.739
Now what about the complex number that is

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:26.371
exactly halfway between these two?

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:29.381
Well to figure that out, we just have to

00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:31.218
figure out what number
has a real part that

00:04:31.218 --> 00:04:33.126
is halfway between these two real parts

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:34.870
and what number has an imaginary part

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.133
that's halfway between
these two imaginary parts.

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.477
So if we had some, let's say
that some complex number,

00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:43.295
let's just call it a, is
the midpoint, it's real part

00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:45.873
is going to be the mean
of these two numbers.

00:04:45.873 --> 00:04:48.925
So it's going to be
two plus negative five.

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:54.387
Two plus negative five over two, over two,

00:04:54.387 --> 00:04:56.323
and it's imaginary part
is going to be the mean

00:04:56.323 --> 00:05:02.247
of these two numbers so
plus, plus three minus one.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:13.960
Three minus one, minus
one, over two times i

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.975
and this is equal to, let's
see, two plus negative five

00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:21.707
is negative three so
this is negative 3/2 plus

00:05:21.707 --> 00:05:27.989
this is three minus 1 is
negative, is negative two

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:33.972
over two is let's see three,
make sure I'm doing this right.

00:05:33.972 --> 00:05:36.643
Three, something in the
mean, three minus one is two

00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:42.169
divided by two is one,
so three plus three.

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.936
Negative 3/2 plus i is the
midpoint between those two

00:05:46.936 --> 00:05:49.934
and if we plot it we can verify
that actually makes sense.

00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:52.957
So real part negative 3/2,
so that's negative one,

00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:56.664
negative one and a half so
it'll be right over there

00:05:56.664 --> 00:06:02.549
and then plus i so it's
going to be right over there.

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:04.556
And I'll just have to
draw it perfectly to scale

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:06.401
but this makes sense, that this right

00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:09.684
over here would be the midpoint.
