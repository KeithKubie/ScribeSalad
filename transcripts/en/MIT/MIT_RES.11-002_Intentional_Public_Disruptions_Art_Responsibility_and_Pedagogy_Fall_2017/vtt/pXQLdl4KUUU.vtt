00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.710
PROFESSOR: This idea
of social practice

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.860
is one that a lot of
theorists and critics

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.860
have talked about
and tried to frame.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.490
I think of social
practice as an engagement

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.450
in art-making within a more
recent contemporary moment,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.980
although there are historical
antecedents perhaps

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.010
many decades prior to now.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.160
We might think, in, relatively
speaking, last 30 to 50 years,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.670
some of these pieces
start to come together.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.430
But one person
who I've looked at

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.410
to help theorize this
notion of social practice

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.300
is educator and
artist Pablo Helguera.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Helguera says--
unlike social work

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.610
that aims for
betterment of humanity,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.380
defending human dignity,
and strengthening

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.310
human relationships, a socially
engaged artist may subscribe

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.720
to those same values but
make work that ironizes,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.780
problematizes, and even
enhances the tensions

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.620
around those subjects in
order to provoke reflection.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.240
So it's that end
part of the phrase--

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.680
to provoke reflection-- that
I bring into the classroom

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.220
or that I try to center some of
my work around this idea of--

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.710
what might we do to
provoke reflection,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.240
not only in other people,
but also in myself?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.220
Perhaps the work becomes a
provocation in that sense.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.860
And why would we
want to do that?

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.040
Well, Helguera says we
want to do that perhaps

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.710
to discover something
in the process.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.720
These artists, he
considers them--

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.030
renames them-- free
agents, if you will.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.670
They insert themselves
into the most unexpected

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.570
social environments.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.330
And they do so in
ways that break away

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.760
from disciplinary
boundaries, hoping

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.530
to discover something
new in the process.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.060
So the idea of inserting
oneself into an unexpected place

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.210
or to perform a certain behavior
or certain interaction when

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.020
it's not expected,
we would do that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.760
hoping to discover
something in the process.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.800
So these two terms--

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
socially engaged art
and social practice--

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.140
are connected.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.550
Helguera prefers
socially engaged art

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.590
because it still has
that word art in it.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.510
He shortens it to be SEA.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.590
But this idea of social
practice is a wider range,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.620
is a term that seems to be a
bit more widely encompassing

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.220
of the range of practices that
might fit those definitions.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.350
So to go on, just a couple
of more bits from Helguera.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.440
Again, there are other folks
like Claire Bishop and Grant

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.440
Kester and other folks
who theorize and talk

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.640
about socially engaged art.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.100
But I find Helguera's
approach quite useful.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.540
So he talks about
socially engaged art

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.180
or social practice
as a multi-layered

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.722
and a participatory engagement.

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:47.430
He says that there
are these structures--

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.510
multiple structures
or multiple layers--

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.670
among which are
nominal participation,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.730
directed participation,
creative participation,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.480
and collaborative.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.130
So there might be multiple
ways to participate or engage

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.490
the public or other individuals
within this practice.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.060
Helguera also talks about the
idea of how these practices are

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.760
linked to other disciplines.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.760
Specifically, we find
tension between art practice

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.360
and sociology, or
social practice.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.540
But that trying to make sense
of those tensions and say it's

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.994
more art, it's like 85% this, or
16% of this something-- that's

00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:28.160
not what he's talking about.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.450
He says we want to stay
in that unresolved space.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.870
It comes at us perhaps
through a sense

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.070
of art practices and
disciplinary considerations.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.290
But that we want to remain
in that unresolved space.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.432
We want it to be a bit messy.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:45.390
So here's a bit of a
longer one, and then we'll

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.000
move beyond some
of the theorizing.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.280
Helguera says social
interaction occupies

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.800
a central and inextricable
part of any socially engaged

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.480
artwork.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.229
You've got to have the
social interaction.

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.760
Just doing something and
then hang it up and not

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.090
having other people
become participants at one

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.150
of those layers is not enough.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.040
Although one might
argue that any artwork

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.960
is a socially engaged practice.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.420
Once you put, let's say,
a painting or a sculpture

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.520
out to be seen, at least
one person is seeing it.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.279
It's already an engaged
in a social relationship.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.750
But Helguera goes further.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.480
He says socially engaged art
is a hybrid, multidisciplinary

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.044
activity that exists somewhere
between art and non-art.

00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:27.210
And what has to happen is,
you have to have actual--

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.490
and not hypothetical,
not imagined--

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.120
social action.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.940
You actually have to
engage with other people.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.230
So last week outside in
front of the building,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.040
we created ceramic
water filters.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.410
We mixed clay and
sawdust, and we

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.050
had several people stop by
to see what we were up to,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.730
get their hands dirty.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.930
We brought that mixture of
clay and sawdust back upstairs.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.490
And we made ceramic
water filters.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.820
And these water filters will
render contaminated water

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.900
with microbes and pathogens,
it will render it potable.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.530
And so this practice of
performing the construction

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.860
and the production of
ceramic water filters

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.810
fits within Helguera's notion
of socially engaged art.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.070
So I'm telling you that is
kind of a back step to what we

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.440
did last week, but also to
give you a specific example.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.950
But then I want to give
you some other examples.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.100
And some of the examples
that I want to share with you

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.460
push this idea of
telling stories that

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.990
might not be told otherwise.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.670
I was in a course.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.730
I was teaching a course a few
years ago to undergraduate art

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.495
education students.

00:05:46.495 --> 00:05:48.870
We're trying to make sense
of-- what is it that art does?

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.869
Why are we teaching art?

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:53.430
What is the central
importance, or what

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.274
seems to be at the core?

00:05:55.274 --> 00:05:56.940
Not that there might
be a singular core.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.750
But there could
be multiple cores.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.960
And one of the students
said, you know what?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.540
I think art allows us to tell
stories that we would not

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.460
be able to tell otherwise.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.680
In some ways, we might
not be able to tell them,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.550
or we probably shouldn't tell
them otherwise as completely

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.510
through art practice.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.400
And so I kind of
latch onto that.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.500
But I'd like to add
the difficult stories.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.850
The work that I try
to do is interested

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.430
in those difficult stories that
might not be told otherwise.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.320
Not that they're
not told, but they

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.150
wouldn't be told
in the same ways

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.120
that socially engaged
art would do that.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.030
So as I think
about this approach

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.570
to telling difficult stories, I
think of the word double-take--

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.420
when you see something and
then you have to look again.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.800
This is a double-take, right?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.160
You see it once, but it
caused you to stop and take

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.829
a second look.

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:46.620
We might think of
research in the same way.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.400
We can search.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.740
But when we research,
we search again.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.050
It's to look again, to
do this double-take.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.380
I also appreciate the
idea of making trouble.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.370
Not only the idea of
troubling something

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.980
through the making of objects
or the making of experiences

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.580
or making of social actions,
but the making of trouble

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.700
in the idea of troubling
things that others

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.450
have made, whether they be
objects or social constructs

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.710
or ideologies.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.020
So it's this idea of trouble
making and making trouble

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.061
that I like to play with.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:22.410
And there's still images from
one of the Marx Brothers films

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.850
where Harpo and Groucho,
essentially the mirror breaks,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.180
and they're
mirroring each other.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.184
So there's all this
double-take going on.

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:33.600
They're looking
and looking again.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.180
And so you have this idea
of visuality happening,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.150
the perspective of the viewer.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.410
But it's through this
social interaction.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.790
And there a number of
iterations of that Marx Brothers

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.310
mirror scene that
play out in cartoons,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.970
that play out in other stories.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.340
So other ways that I've made
trouble in the past was--

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.080
and to think about
what we're seeing

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.940
and how we're seeing it--

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.520
was to take a look at February.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.550
Quite often, I have been
invited to give talks

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.130
at schools or at
other institutions.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.620
And they like to bring
me in in February.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.230
I guess it's because February
is the month of Valentine's Day,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.230
and they know that I'm a
very passionate person.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.229
But if they look more
closely at my work,

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:26.020
they say I deal with
some difficult issues,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.570
and not the least of which
is the construct of racism.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.900
And that's also the month where
you have Black History Month.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.179
And so I'm pretty sure
that's why they bring me in.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.210
So if we look at February
a bit differently,

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.830
if we engage with
that month, not only

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.630
is it the month where we--

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.970
let's look at a specific
group of others,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.850
which suggests there is another
construct against which we are

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.510
situating African-Americans.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.532
But also the idea
of February being

00:09:00.532 --> 00:09:02.740
the month for Valentine's
Day, is it's shortest month

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.754
of the year.

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:05.170
And the shortest
month of the year

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.090
is the year we say-- go tell
other people how much you

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:07.610
love them.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.280
I mean, you would think a
month with 31 days would

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.446
be a better choice for that.

00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:13.310
Or maybe all year
long we should think

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.100
in more passionate
and considerate ways.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.891
So this is the work I
did a number of years

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:23.030
ago that revolved around
those two concepts.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.060
I also am interested in
this idea of disruption.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.334
I mentioned this
briefly last week.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.500
And I think disruption
happens in a number of ways--

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.732
pushing back, questioning.

00:09:30.732 --> 00:09:33.190
I'm interested in questioning
answers rather than answering

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.050
questions.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.960
One of the ways I've done that
is, I've looked at barber shops

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.290
as pedagogical spaces,
as curriculum spaces.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.120
What can we learn
in a barber shop?

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.910
And I wrote an article
about Pat's Barber Shop

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.260
in Norfolk, Virginia.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.050
And I tried to make
the case that what

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:54.250
happens in a barbershop is a
hyper-textual, multi-layered,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:10:00.250
multifaceted, learner-centered
space of inquiry.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.150
That you might go in
trying to get a haircut,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.670
but you come out
with an education.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.390
And this happens in all
sorts of service locations--

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.710
hair salons and other places
where conversation becomes

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.390
essential to those locations.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.560
I've also written about
digital technology.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.700
When my wife and I
learned we were expecting

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.160
our birth of our daughter,
I started to think-- well,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.090
that's fantastic.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.548
And I thought--
oh, my goodness I'm

00:10:26.548 --> 00:10:28.690
going to be someone's parent.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.710
And, oh, I need to
think this through now.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.820
This is a big deal.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.660
So I started writing
myself a series of emails

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.129
to explain to our unborn
child who I thought I was

00:10:42.129 --> 00:10:43.420
and what I was working through.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.880
And so that series
of emails became

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.700
an article, or a chapter, an
email from a digital daddy.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.150
And I was trying to
make sense of how

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.000
her future existence and
identity would be mediated

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.320
through digital technology.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.780
But what came through in
the process of that was her

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.490
multi-ethnic identity and the
ways that I imagined camera

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.470
technology,
surveillance technology,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.320
being scrutinized at airports--

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.610
among other approaches--
would render her body

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:24.330
the object of examination.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.390
I want to shift now to tell
you a story about Henry Brown.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.660
I'm not sure if you're familiar
with the Henry Brown who

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.220
I think about quite often.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.870
Henry Brown lived in
Virginia outside of Richmond

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.030
in Henrico County.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.490
And there's Henry in the middle.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.310
He's inside this
box, and there's

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.500
some people outside the box.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.450
So I guess they're
thinking outside the box.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.900
And the story of Henry
Brown was told by himself.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.870
He narrated this
story of himself.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.660
And there are many
versions, or at least it

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.096
was published in a number
of different contexts,

00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:04.470
in a number of
different formats.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.977
And so Henry Brown earned
the name Henry Box Brown.

00:12:09.977 --> 00:12:11.310
He was in that box for a reason.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.860
I'm going to let you know
why in just a second.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.740
I brought-- I didn't
bring them in.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.380
We have obtained a
couple of pallets.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.730
And I put the wooden
pallets on the floor here.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.030
So you have these two
wooden pallets on the floor.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.591
And I want to read you a story.

00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:30.840
It's not a story that I wrote.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.710
Henry wrote it.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.600
But it's been retold and
is retold by Ellen Levine.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.280
And the story is "Henry's
Freedom Box: A True Story

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.800
from the Underground Railroad."

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.250
The reason that I'm reading
this to you on these pallets--

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.120
what you see are two
pallets and this book

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.940
that I put on a sidewalk in
the middle of campus last year.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.440
And I let it sit there
for 10 minutes or so.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.564
And then I sat on the pallets,
and I read this story the way

00:13:04.564 --> 00:13:05.730
I'm going to read it to you.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.020
And people walked by.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:12.610
Some of them stopped and
listened, and others did not.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.430
Henry's Freedom Box--

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.670
Henry Brown wasn't
sure how old he was.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.940
Henry was a slave, and
slaves weren't allowed

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.060
to know their birthdays.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.110
Henry and his brothers and
sisters worked in the big house

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.610
where the master lived.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.180
Henry's master had been good
to Henry and his family.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.720
But Henry's mother knew
things could change.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.870
Do you see those leaves
blowing in the wind?

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.780
They're from the trees
like the slave children

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.390
are torn from their families.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.580
One morning, the master called
for Henry and his mother.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.850
They climbed the wide staircase.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.050
The master lay in the bed with
only his head above the quilt.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.530
He was very ill.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.560
He beckoned them to come closer.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.780
Some slaves were
freed by their owners.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.340
Henry's heart beat fast.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.670
Maybe the master
would set him free.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.530
But the master said,
you're a good worker Henry.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.070
I'm giving you to my son.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.820
You must obey him
and never tell a lie.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.960
I will mail myself to a place
where there are no slaves,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.220
he said.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.200
Henry, are you all
right in there?

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.960
All right, he answered.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.430
The cover was pried open.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.140
Henry stretched and stood up.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.090
Four men smiled at him.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.130
Welcome to Philadelphia.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.290
At last, Henry had a birthday--

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:41.660
March 30, 1849, his
first day of freedom.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.140
And from that day on, he
also had a middle name.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.930
Everyone called him
Henry Box Brown.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.780
So this is the
story of Henry Box

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.280
Brown as told in a children's
book by Ellen Levine.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.065
And it was illustrated
by Kadir Nelson.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.440
Why did I read
that story to you?

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.920
Well, I wanted you to hear
the story of Henry Box Brown

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.470
not the way that he told
it, but the way that it

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.450
was retold for children.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.082
That's a children's book.

00:15:09.082 --> 00:15:10.540
It's meant to be
a children's book.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.867
It's meant for children
to hear that story.

00:15:12.867 --> 00:15:14.950
And it's a story that I've
read as a bedtime story

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.620
to our daughter.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.900
There are different versions
of Henry's Freedom Box,

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.280
different children's versions
and different adult versions

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.470
of telling this story.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.640
There are art approaches too.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.370
There's a monument to Henry
Brown in Richmond, Virginia.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.420
And this is a sculpture
made out of metal.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.194
The same dimensions as
that box that Henry was in.

00:15:38.194 --> 00:15:39.610
And etched in the
ground, it says,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.680
"In a wooden crate
similar to this one,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.020
Henry Brown, a Richmond
tobacco worker,

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.740
made the journey from
slavery to freedom in 1849."

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.650
And that box is interesting
because the lid is off,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.220
as you saw in that previous
image, but one side is open.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.790
And it's open with a silhouette
of a man crouched down.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:04.440
Now, Henry Brown was 5'8.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.910
I'm 5'8.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.070
And I was compelled to
get inside that box.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.890
And this idea of--

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.060
from Henry, thinking
outside of the box

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.130
meant literally to
think inside the box

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:19.170
and to put himself into a
situation that was disrupting

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.490
the current practices.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:24.870
But he was at a point at which
he was willing to try anything.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.440
Now, this story of Henry
Brown can be retold

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.450
and can be recreated
and be reproduced.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.930
And there are some folks who--

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.010
you know, I make
these connections.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.660
The image on the
left is actually

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.790
someone who is trying
to get themselves out

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.340
of this particular
situation putting themselves

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.240
inside a suitcase and
mailing oneself out

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.500
of a horrible situation.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.270
The image on the
right is actually

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.860
a white student in black face
as a Halloween costume going

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.450
as Henry Box Brown.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.180
Now, both of these
images relate directly

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.280
to the Henry Box Brown story
for me, but in different ways.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.370
They can be unpacked--
no pun intended--

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:07.020
to deal with various
levels of class,

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.060
of identity, of
social situation,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.599
of systems of oppression,
and expectations.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.359
This idea of reading
in public places--

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:19.020
just like I did with the Henry
Brown work last year and also

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.280
here--

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.849
I think is an important
piece to consider.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.069
And the way in which we
read to children, I think,

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.859
is important.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:27.900
Words are very important.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.900
Words are powerful.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.680
There are games that we
play through social media

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.420
in public spaces like
Words with Friends.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.310
I play this game quite often.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.910
But there are some words
that are unacceptable.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:38.830
You think-- what?

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.650
There are some words
that aren't-- well,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.630
if you misspell it, it's
probably unacceptable.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.131
Negro is an unacceptable
term in Words with Friends.

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:46.630
Really?

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.130
Because that's a
term I think people

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.940
need to deal with and
address and unpack.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.710
Asian is also an unacceptable
term in Words with Friends.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.850
Now, I find these two examples
interesting for the kind

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.780
of work that I'm doing.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.980
But there are some other
words that are acceptable.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.890
And really big words matter.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.070
And just like
socially engaged art

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.960
that moves away from
the materiality and more

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.660
to the conceptual
and the experiential,

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.400
moving from specific labels to
larger concepts and constructs

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.200
seems to be of more value to
Words with Friends as well.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:34.740
For example, "conceptualizing"
can earn you 1,469 points.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.760
That's a lot of points.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.649
So maybe there's something
in conceptualizing

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:38.440
that we need to do.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.560
So how do we conceptualize
telling difficult stories?

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.280
Another children's
book, Goodnight Moon,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.613
you might be familiar with this.

00:18:45.613 --> 00:18:47.780
Goodnight, moon.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.410
Goodnight, cow
jumping over the moon.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.910
There's this
interesting repetition.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.400
Well, Larry Wilmore created
a version of Goodnight Moon.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.650
He called it Goodnight Slavery.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:03.440
Larry Wilmore was a talk show
spin-off from The Jon Stewart

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.240
Show.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.710
And so this show
with Larry Wilmore,

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.730
he decided that one
of the skits that he

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.840
did was to create
a children's book

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:25.070
called Goodnight Slavery
inspired by the Texas

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.430
legislature and the
Texas Education board

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:29.570
changing the curriculum.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.700
And changing certain
terms, moving

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.210
the term the
transatlantic slave trade

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:40.340
and renaming it the
transatlantic triangular trade.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.780
And so he has this entire
piece where he pulls apart

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:50.080
that movement, the essentially
whitewashing of history.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.960
And so what you see there
are lines from the book.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.330
"In a big red state,
there was a textbook

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.680
in a debate and too many knaves
in one big cave and a book

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.920
that is shut and a past
full of smut and a cranky

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.500
conservative with a
stick up his butt.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.970
Good night, slavery.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:08.530
Good night, bravery.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.690
Good night to things
we find unsavory."

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.160
Well, what are
some of the things

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.450
that they might find unsavory?

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.960
Well, I'll get to
that in a second.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.170
But this book Goodnight Moon
has been told in different ways.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:26.260
It's a fixture within
children's book culture

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.080
that gets repurposed
and reimagined.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.990
Some of the ways that
Wilmore understands

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.950
what is being erased--

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:40.780
Goodnight KKK, Goodnight to the
decimation of indigenous people

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.820
on this continent.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.180
So these are all the things
that the Texas curriculum was

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:51.550
erasing or modifying or
eliminating or renaming to make

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.800
them seem less unsavory.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.600
And in one more skit,
he reads this book

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.030
to a classroom of
kindergarten children.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.500
And their reactions
are wonderful.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.500
But it's also-- you can
tell it's kind of coached

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.790
for the skit.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.310
Reading public places--
different than reading

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.030
in public places.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.890
We could also read
public places.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.230
For example, in the summer--

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.550
for the past three summers--

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.690
I've had the opportunity
to teach at Vermont

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.160
College of Fine Arts.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.230
And one of the
courses that I teach

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.830
looks at participatory
inquiry in the public sphere.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.290
One of the assignments
is for us to go

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.690
to the State House, the
State Capitol, which

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.160
is just a mile and a half,
two miles away from campus.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.320
And it's the smallest state
capitol in the country.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.820
It's very accessible.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.420
We sign up for a guided tour.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:49.110
And before the tour, I give
each student a little figurine

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.860
that I bought at the toy
store, these little busts of US

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.940
presidents.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.550
And I ask the students
to go on the tour,

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.810
to be polite on the tour.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:04.300
But I would like you to read the
state capitol in conversation

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.820
with the tiny president.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.120
So on our walk down, in our
mile and a half walk down,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.620
they're on their
phones, and they're

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.090
googling Theodore Roosevelt
or Thomas Jefferson or Abraham

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.590
Lincoln.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:23.300
And then they take
cell phone shots.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.750
There's a close-up
of tiny George,

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.430
and in the back is big George.

00:22:29.947 --> 00:22:32.280
Or please keep off, and they
put one of the presidents--

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.170
I think that's Buchanan--
inside the cannon.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.530
Or they end up
reading other people.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.589
And it's with this tiny
president, this tiny object,

00:22:42.589 --> 00:22:44.380
that they're able to
construct stories that

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.505
couldn't be told otherwise.

00:22:45.505 --> 00:22:48.240
Putting that situation,
that context, history,

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.340
and related information
that they have either

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.870
brought to that
space or that they

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.550
learn on the tour
in conversation

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.330
with what they know
about that president.
