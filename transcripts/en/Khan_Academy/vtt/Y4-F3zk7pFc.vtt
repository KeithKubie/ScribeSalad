00:00:00.514 --> 00:00:03.472
- [Instructor] In previous
videos, we talk about how

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:07.094
as we exit the fourth
century, in the 390s,

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:11.261
the emperor Theodosius, he
actually splits the Roman Empire.

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:15.787
We already had the city of Constantinople

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:18.947
being established as a
capital of the empire.

00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:22.474
That was done by Constantine in 324,

00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:25.476
the city previously known as Byzantium.

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:28.552
But as we enter into the fifth century,

00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:30.964
there is an official split between

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:34.778
the Western Roman Empire and
the Eastern Roman Empire.

00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:37.747
They're actually governed separately.

00:00:37.747 --> 00:00:41.404
Now, also in other videos, we talk about

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:45.237
the eventual fall of the
Western Roman Empire.

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.387
Now, one thing to keep in mind,

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:51.781
sometimes when we talk
about the fall of the west,

00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.683
it somehow implies that
there's no governance left

00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:56.024
or there's no kingdoms left.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:58.445
And nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:01.388
One of the reasons why the
Western Roman Empire fell

00:01:01.388 --> 00:01:04.224
is repeated attacks by Germanic tribes,

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:07.097
and after the Western
Roman Empire was gone,

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:10.096
the Germanic tribes, for
the most part, took over.

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:12.586
On the Italian peninsula,

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:15.761
you at first have the kingdom of Odoacer,

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:17.955
but eventually you have rule,

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:19.996
especially as we get into
the late fifth century,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.747
you have the Ostrogothic
Kingdom, Ostrogoths,

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:27.300
the Eastern Goths, the
Eastern Germanic tribes.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.629
Here in North Africa,
you have the Vandals,

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:33.622
another Germanic tribe.

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:36.627
Here in the Iberian peninsula,
you have the Visigoths,

00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:39.977
the Western Goths, yet
another Germanic tribe.

00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:42.635
Here you have the Burgundians,
you have the Franks.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:46.631
The word France comes from the
notion of land of the Franks.

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.506
Once again, all of these
are Germanic kingdoms

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:51.905
that took over, where before you had

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:53.824
the Western Roman Empire.

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:56.506
Now, as you can see from this map,

00:01:56.506 --> 00:01:58.300
and we've talked about
it in previous videos,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.309
it was only the Western
Roman Empire that fell

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.906
and fragmented and, for the most part,

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:05.970
came into the hands of
these Germanic tribes.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.637
The Eastern Empire continues on,

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:12.331
and it's often known
as the Byzantine Empire

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.718
with its capital at Constantinople.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.313
Now, what we'll see is
that the Byzantine Empire

00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:21.396
lasts for almost another 1,000 years,

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.051
but its importance in the region

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:29.098
diminishes for most of that period.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:32.436
It does have one last hurrah, so to speak,

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:35.436
with the reign of Emperor Justinian.

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:40.734
Justinian is able to come to power in 527.

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.568
He comes into power with
the help of his uncle,

00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:49.625
who's the previous Emperor Justin,

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.625
and Justinian is able to
regain much of the land

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:58.071
that was lost to the Germanic tribes.

00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:01.119
Over the course of Justinian's reign,

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:05.286
as you can see, they're able
to retake the Italian peninsula

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.534
and much of North Africa.

00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:11.176
Now, things weren't
always easy for Justinian,

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:13.482
and they are very difficult
at the beginning of his rule

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:17.121
and they get hard near the
end of his rule as well.

00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:20.545
In 532, there's significant
rioting in Constantinople,

00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:22.183
which is his capital.

00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:24.595
It all starts around chariot racing

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.075
and the different groups or gangs

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:29.070
that support the different
chariot racing teams,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.143
but it eventually
becomes an all-out revolt

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:32.753
against Justinian.

00:03:32.753 --> 00:03:34.338
And many of Justinian's advisors,

00:03:34.338 --> 00:03:36.078
including Justinian himself,

00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:38.602
they're afraid that they're
gonna be overthrown and killed,

00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:41.940
and they think about
fleeing Constantinople.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.099
And this is only five
years into his reign.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.349
This is in 532.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.077
And at that point, his
wife Empress Theodora

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:55.231
stands up and becomes a very
important actor in history.

00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:57.732
She has her famous speech
at the point in time

00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:01.544
when Justinian and his advisors
were thinking about fleeing,

00:04:01.544 --> 00:04:02.572
fear of death.

00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:04.697
They thought they were
going to be overthrown.

00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:08.864
And here is that famous
quote from Empress Theodora.

00:04:10.746 --> 00:04:13.130
The present occasion is too serious

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.283
to allow me to follow the convention

00:04:15.283 --> 00:04:18.472
that a woman should not
speak in a man's council.

00:04:18.472 --> 00:04:22.521
Those whose interests are
threatened by extreme danger

00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:25.499
should think only of the
wisest course of action,

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.840
not of conventions.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.661
In my opinion, flight
is not the right course,

00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:34.292
even if it should bring us to safety.

00:04:34.292 --> 00:04:36.609
It is impossible for a person,

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:40.674
having been born into
this world, not to die,

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:42.644
but for one who has reigned,

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:45.404
it is intolerable to be a fugitive.

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.625
May I never be deprived
of this purple robe,

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:51.584
the purple robe signifying
royalty, being an empress,

00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:54.525
and may I never see the
day when those who meet me

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:56.442
do not call me empress.

00:04:57.368 --> 00:04:59.386
If you wish to save yourself,

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:02.331
so she's talking to Justinian
and Justinian's advisors,

00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:04.531
if you wish to save yourself, my lord,

00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:06.098
there is no difficulty.

00:05:06.098 --> 00:05:07.408
We are rich.

00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:10.434
Over there is the sea,
and there are the ships.

00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:13.233
Yet reflect for a moment whether,

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:16.733
when you have once escaped
to a place of security,

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:21.277
you would not gladly exchange
such safety for death.

00:05:21.277 --> 00:05:24.027
As for me, I agree with the adage

00:05:24.872 --> 00:05:28.191
that the royal purple
is the noblest shroud.

00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:30.655
So, she's saying I would
rather die as an empress

00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:32.607
than try to be a fugitive

00:05:32.607 --> 00:05:34.697
and just try to live my
life, the rest of my life,

00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:36.341
somehow comfortably.

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:38.814
And she's able to convince Justinian,

00:05:38.814 --> 00:05:42.081
and they're able to put down
the uprising quite brutally,

00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:46.248
killing 30,000 of the people
who are rising up against them.

00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:51.048
Now, during that uprising,
much of Constantinople

00:05:51.048 --> 00:05:55.730
is burned, including the main
church, the Hagia Sophia,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.613
and it was under Justinian's rule

00:05:57.613 --> 00:06:01.316
that the Hagia Sophia gets rebuilt.

00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:05.338
And it still exists in
what is now Istanbul today.

00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:07.921
Constantinople eventually
gets renamed Istanbul

00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:10.319
once it's conquered by the Turks.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.956
And it eventually gets
turned into a mosque,

00:06:11.956 --> 00:06:13.844
and today, it is a museum.

00:06:13.844 --> 00:06:16.737
The Hagia Sophia literally
means holy wisdom.

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:19.889
You might recognize the
word Sophia from philosophy,

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.056
which literally means friend
of wisdom, philosophia.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.144
Now, perhaps what Justinian
is most famous for

00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:32.977
is his attempt to better
codify a set of laws.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.181
The Roman Empire, of
course, always had laws,

00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:39.163
but Justinian got legal experts

00:06:39.163 --> 00:06:41.805
to go and collect the laws of the land,

00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:43.458
to make them consistent,

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:45.462
to throw out the laws
that are inconsistent,

00:06:45.462 --> 00:06:47.411
to add new laws as necessary.

00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:49.498
And he did this over his entire reign,

00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:50.545
and he spread them.

00:06:50.545 --> 00:06:54.712
And they are often referred
to as the Code of Justinian.

00:06:55.658 --> 00:06:58.967
And they would have an influence on the

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:02.485
Byzantine Empire for the next 900 years

00:07:02.485 --> 00:07:04.626
and even some influence on some

00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:07.376
relatively modern schools of law.

00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:11.606
Now, as I've mentioned before,

00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:14.783
the reign of Justinian is
considered really the high point

00:07:14.783 --> 00:07:17.314
of the Byzantine Empire.

00:07:17.314 --> 00:07:19.560
And even as we get into roughly

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.398
the second half of his reign,

00:07:21.398 --> 00:07:23.689
things start to slide downward,

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:27.973
and over the next 900 years,
are just in a state of decline.

00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:30.497
Starting in the 540s,
there's a significant plague

00:07:30.497 --> 00:07:32.320
in the Byzantine Empire.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.388
Some accounts I've seen show that

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:37.721
roughly 40% of Constantinople dies,

00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:40.287
significant chunk of the population

00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:42.359
of the Byzantine Empire dies.

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:45.006
And that makes it more
susceptible to attack

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.044
from the various Germanic tribes

00:07:47.044 --> 00:07:49.230
throughout Justinian's reign.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.006
And well after Justinian's reign,

00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:53.845
there's constant tension
and often conflict

00:07:53.845 --> 00:07:57.772
between the Sassanid Persians in the east.

00:07:57.772 --> 00:07:59.766
And then, as we go further on,

00:07:59.766 --> 00:08:03.125
especially as we get into the
seventh and eighth century,

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:05.375
you have the rise of Islam.

00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:11.650
Early Islamic empires are able
to take over the Sassanids

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.296
and significantly eat
into the Byzantine Empire

00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:17.259
and then even some of
the Germanic kingdoms

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:18.983
in the Iberian peninsula.

00:08:18.983 --> 00:08:20.121
And so, this is taking us now,

00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:22.341
we're in the middle of the eighth century.

00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:25.888
And if we go further on,
we see this once again

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:28.364
gradual decline continue on,

00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:32.857
where you have further invasions
into the Byzantine Empire

00:08:32.857 --> 00:08:37.024
from Turkish Muslim kingdoms
or Turkish Muslim conquerors,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.710
all the way until we get to 1453,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.620
when Constantinople
itself falls to the Turks

00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:51.735
and eventually gets renamed Istanbul.
