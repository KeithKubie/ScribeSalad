00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.448
Now, if I asked you to solve for
x, given, 5(x+10)-30=5x-18,

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:11.943
we would find something
else kind of interesting.

00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:18.231
Distributing the 5 to the x and the 10,

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:24.171
we get 5x+50-30=5x -18.

00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:29.539
Let's combine like terms and
we get 5x+20=5x-18.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.045
And again,
things are looking a little funny here.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:37.855
We have a 5x on both sides.

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:42.883
If I were to subtract
5x from both sides,

00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:47.080
I would get 0+20=0-18.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.195
20=-18, so of course,

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:58.060
20 does not equal -18,
that means that this equation is false,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.400
and in algebra,
we call this a contradiction.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.540
And again,
the important thing to remember is that,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.800
if you try to solve an equation for
x and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.670
end up with a false statement like this,
the solution is actually no solution.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.730
That means, it doesn't matter
what value you substitute for

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.660
x, the equation will
always end up being false.
