00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.490
We're asked to compute
3,060 divided by 36.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.860
We want to figure out how many
times does 36-- I don't need

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.045
to write it that big.

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:21.400
We need to figure out how many
times does 36 go into 3,060.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.910
Now, this is interesting because
we're dividing by a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.080
two-digit number, by 36.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.450
We're going to see in this video
that the process is the

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.670
exact same way.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.870
There's just going to be a
little bit more mental

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.900
estimation going on, but we'll
do it explicitly here, so

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.230
hopefully, it won't
be too bad.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.490
So we first look at 36, and we
say, well, does 36 go into 3?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.010
Well, no.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.550
3 is smaller than 36, so
it won't go into 3.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.750
Does 36 go into 30?

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.350
No, 30 is still smaller than 36,
so it won't go into that.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.350
Does 36 go into 306?

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.030
Well, sure.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.130
306 is larger than 36, and if
we were to estimate it, 30

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.750
would go into 300 ten times, but
this is larger than 30, so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.100
it's going to go fewer times.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.150
Maybe it's 9.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.740
I'm not sure.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.410
Let's try it out.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.570
Let me try it out over
on the side.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.390
What is 36 times 9?

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.610
And this is kind of the art of
doing these problems when

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.360
you're dividing a two-digit
number into something.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.280
So 6 times 9 is 54.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.320
Regroup, or carry the 5.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.540
3 times 9 is 27, plus 5.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.880
27 plus 5 is 32.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.710
So 36 times 9 is 324.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.860
That's still larger than 306,
so we're going to have to go

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.310
36 less than that,
so we're going to

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.075
have to do eight times.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.180
So we're going to have to
go into it eight times.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.320
And remember, the way I thought
about that is I said

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.630
my first guess was maybe it goes
in nine times, but when I

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.640
tried out 36 times 9, that was
still larger than 306.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.380
That got me 324.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.860
Eight times should work, because
if you take 36 away,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.040
if you only do 8 times
36, that's going to

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.110
take us below 300.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.080
342, 136 away from that, or
another way, 324 minus 36 is

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.080
going to get us below 300.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200
So let's try this out
and just make sure.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.310
8 times 6 is 48.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.170
Put the 8 there; carry the 4.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.600
8 times 3 is 24 plus 4 is 28.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.650
So 8 times 36 is 288
and it fits.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.610
It's less than 306.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.960
9 would've been too much.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.060
It would've been greater
than 306, so

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.310
now we can just subtract.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.520
So we have 6 minus 8.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.220
We can't just subtract
8 from 6.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.890
We have to do a little
bit of regrouping.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.760
Let's get a 10 from the ones
place right here, but we can't

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.205
borrow anything from here or
regroup anything from there,

00:02:56.205 --> 00:02:59.670
so let's go to the
hundreds place.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.000
Let's take 1 from the hundreds
place, and so this will become

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.170
a 2, and then this 0 here
will become a 10.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.370
Another way to think about it
is this is now 10 tens.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.200
We took 100 from there,
and we're now

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.910
writing 100 as 10 tens.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.940
Or another way to think about it
is you borrowed a 1, or you

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.430
took a 1, really.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.040
You took a 1 from the
hundreds place.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.290
That made it into a 2, and
then you put the 1 out in

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.510
front of the 0.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.450
That's kind of the process
way of thinking about it.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.380
Now, we have this 10 here,
and now we can

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.140
borrow from this 10.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.780
So let's borrow from this 10.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.290
So this 10 can become a 9.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.310
1 is really taken from it, and
then this 6 becomes a 16.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.600
Because if you think about it,
this 10 was really 10 tens.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.310
It's in the tens place, so when
you put a 10 there, it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.990
really means 10 tens.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.730
So if you take 1 away from it,
this is actually now 90, and

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.600
we have 10 to give to this 6,
and 10 plus 6 is 16, so that's

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.090
what we're really doing.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.340
But now we're ready to subtract,
so we have 16 minus

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.060
8 is 8, 9 minus 8 is 1,
and 2 minus 2 is 0.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.149
So we have 18 left over, and now
we can bring down this 0

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.339
right here.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.440
Bring down that 0.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.880
So how many times does
36 go into 180?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.020
And once again, this is going
to be estimation.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.790
It's not going to
be six times.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.240
6 times 30 would be 180.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.800
6 times 36 would be too big,
because 36 is bigger than 30,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.020
so let's try 5.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.790
Let's see if 5 works.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.770
So let's see.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.750
5 times 6-- and there's
a little trial

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.760
and error here sometimes.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.860
5 times 6 is 30.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.310
Put the 0; carry the 3.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.990
We don't need that.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.330
That's from last time.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.410
5 times 3 is 15 plus 3 is 18.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.840
It looks like it works out.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.020
You subtract 180 from
180, your get zero,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.410
so we have no remainder.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.000
So we're left with 36 goes in
3,060 eighty-five times.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So this is equal to 85.
