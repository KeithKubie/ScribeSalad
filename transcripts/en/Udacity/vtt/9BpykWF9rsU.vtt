00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.200
There are some different ways
of expressing multiplication

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.939
that we will use throughout this course.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.320
They look different, but
they mean the same thing.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.140
You may be familiar with
this notation where an x or

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.330
a cross in the middle
means multiplication.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.360
We just use this notation where
a dot means multiplication.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.200
Sometimes a star or
an asterisk will be used the same way.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.860
Finally, we can express multiplication
by putting the numbers we want to

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.750
multiply into parentheses and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.310
then placing them directly
next to each other.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.300
These all mean the same thing,
that we're multiplying two by two.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.250
Which of these does not mean
the same thing as the others?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.020
Please select one.
