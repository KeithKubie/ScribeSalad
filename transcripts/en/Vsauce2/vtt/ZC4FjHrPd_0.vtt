incredible thread installations.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.920
Audiences are allowed to roam within the rooms
where the colored thread is illuminated by

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.359
UV lights.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.750
By giving the room a three dimensional sense
its as thought the viewers have entered a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.300
virtual blueprint.&nbsp;

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.140
Jonty Hurwitz creates anamorphic sculptures
that are made by scanned objects distorted

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.060
digitally and then fabricated.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.930
But once the sculpture is placed in front
of a cylindrical mirror the reflection reveals

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.220
the original image.&nbsp;

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.920
Other works are pixelated or sliced human
forms that are only viewable from certain

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.920
angles.

mobile espresso bar that they call velopresso.

The bike uses a carbon belt drive system to
power the bike and a custom made coffee grinder

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.310
that with five seconds of pedaling will grind
enough coffee for a double shot.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.970
They currently use a camp stove to heat the
water and steam to power the espresso machine

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.399
but are working on a way to create their own
fuel using coffee grounds.&nbsp;

These portraits are created with thousands
of pieces of bread, toasted to different tones

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.859
to create highlights and lowlights.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.119
They're very large and usually displayed as
billboards or in public spaces because the

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.359
best view is gained from being a good distance
away from them.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.829
Street artist OakoAk uses stencils and paint
to create works of art around crumbling buildings,

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.329
