00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:16.406
How many of you have had
your doctor ask you about sex?

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.455
Your mental health?

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:19.748
Alcohol use?

00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:22.867
These questions are almost universal.

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.437
But how many of you have had
your doctor ask you about money?

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:28.914
Most of us haven't.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.898
But that is strange, because
compared to most high-income countries,

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:38.098
child poverty is an epidemic
in the United States.

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:42.192
It creates conditions that may elevate
stress hormone levels

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:44.324
and impair brain development.

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.392
Poor children in the US are one and a half
times more likely to die

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.978
and twice as likely to be hospitalized

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.032
as their middle-class counterparts.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:01:02.726
So my colleague Dr. Michael Hole
and I started asking moms about money.

00:01:03.123 --> 00:01:07.277
We knew we needed to reimagine
what a doctor's visit looks like,

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.919
to get kids out of poverty

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:12.484
and to give them a fair shot
at a healthy life.

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:16.548
Our questions led
to a surprising solution:

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:17.915
tax credits.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.469
It turns out, the earned income
tax credit, or EITC,

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:26.260
is the best poverty prescription
we have in the US.

00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:30.638
The average mom gets two to three
thousand dollars a year from it.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.535
When families get it,
moms and babies are healthier:

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:36.432
fewer depressed moms,

00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:38.428
babies weighing more at birth.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.244
But one out of five families
who could get it doesn't,

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:46.929
and most who do
lose of hundreds of dollars

00:01:46.953 --> 00:01:49.837
to the for-profit
tax-preparation industry.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.073
One day, a mom asked us
why we couldn't do her taxes

00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:56.693
while she waited for the doctor.

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:57.726
(Laughter)

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.994
We all know that purgatory.
Why not make good use of that time?

00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:04.078
So we started StreetCred,

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:09.280
an organization prescribing
tax preparation in clinics serving kids.

00:02:09.674 --> 00:02:11.729
This is a brand-new approach

00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:15.079
and one that left some
questioning our sanity.

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:17.875
After all, we're doctors, not accountants.

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:21.415
But we have something accountants don't:

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.528
access to families.

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:29.033
Over 90 percent of kids in the US
see a doctor at least once a year.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:31.172
Their parents trust us

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:34.725
and will do anything
to give them a better life.

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:40.186
Doctors in every clinic around the country
could be doing this work, too --

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.574
it's simple, really.

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:44.855
The hospital registers
as a tax-preparation site,

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.615
and everyone, from medical
students to retirees,

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:53.390
can volunteer as a tax preparer
after passing an IRS exam.

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:56.656
It's not as hard as it sounds, I promise.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.766
I certainly never thought
I would be doing other people's taxes,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.149
but here I am.

00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:04.698
We're nearing the end of our third year.

00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:09.784
In the first two, we returned
1.6 million dollars

00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:12.921
to 750 families in Boston alone.

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:14.131
This year --

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:18.150
(Applause)

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:22.897
This year, we've expanded
to nine sites in four states.

00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:28.520
Sixty-three percent of our families
have never heard of the EITC.

00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:32.146
How can you claim something
you haven't heard of?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.114
And half have never used
free tax preparation.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.344
That two to three thousand dollars a year

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:40.235
goes a long way.

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.428
Take hunger.

00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:46.562
An adequately nutritious, low-cost diet
for a mom and two young kids

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:49.546
costs 477 dollars a month.

00:03:50.065 --> 00:03:54.195
With EITC money, that family
can eat for five to six months.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.938
Or think about medical care.

00:03:56.962 --> 00:04:00.945
Twenty million children in the US
lack access to care

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.102
meeting modern pediatric standards.

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:10.532
And yet, the average cost of that care
is only 400 dollars per kid per year.

00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:14.739
EITC money can help fix
this access problem.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.837
Perhaps most powerfully of all,

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.583
this money gives moms hope.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:24.482
One mom used her refund
for her son to study abroad in Spain.

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:27.489
She was struggling to pay her rent,

00:04:27.513 --> 00:04:31.310
but she saw EITC money
as his shot at a better future.

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:33.948
We have an opportunity,

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:36.454
as doctors and as citizens,

00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:38.645
to get to the root of this problem.

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.340
We can reimagine health care

00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:44.037
as a place addressing
the causes of poor health,

00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:45.706
be it infections

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.138
or finances.

00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:48.778
Thank you.

00:04:48.802 --> 00:04:54.582
(Applause)
