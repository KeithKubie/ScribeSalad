that excellence so far as it goes is
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.490

and that trade-off has to do with the
fact that excellence is really about

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579
fact that excellence is really about
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.600
fact that excellence is really about
quality control it's about the fact that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
