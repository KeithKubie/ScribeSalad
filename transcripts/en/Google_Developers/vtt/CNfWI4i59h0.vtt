MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.750
Welcome to Root Access, the show
for start-ups on Google

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.940
Developers Live.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.040
I'm Martin Omander, and I'm
joined here by Googler and

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.980
longtime investor and start-up
evangelist Don Dodge.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.480
Today we're going to talk about
setting up a company.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.130
So Don, I often get
this question.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.010
When in the life cycle should I
form a legal corporation for

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.990
my start- up?

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.820
DON DODGE: As soon as you can.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.730
It's important to have a company
to be able to accept

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.600
money, to be able to hire
people, to extend offers, to

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.730
own assets.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.630
So you want to have a company
set up as soon as possible.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.180
It can be a simple, little
corporation.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.220
It can be an LLC or a Sub S
corp, but you should have

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.100
something with a bank account
as soon as you possibly can.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.710
MARTIN OMANDER: So as soon
as you possibly can.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.220
Does that mean before the
friends and family round that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.250
we talked about in
earlier episodes?

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.310
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.270
Again, you need a company
to accept money.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.780
You need a bank account
to put the money in.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.970
So you mentioned earlier
about Larry and Sergey.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.310
They didn't even have a
company put together.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.240
So when an investor wanted to
write them a check, he wrote

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.310
it to them personally,
because they didn't

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.815
have Google set up.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.670
I don't advise doing that.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.350
It worked in their case.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.480
MARTIN OMANDER: It
worked for them.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.810
DON DODGE: Quite well.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.730
But it's better to have a
company set up and a checking

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.210
account set up, so that you can
pay for things that you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.400
need and accept money
as soon as you can.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.100
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.050
And seeing that checking
account statement does

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.770
something to your-- it reminds
you that you have a company,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.470
too, I guess.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.030
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.480
Every month when that checking
account statement arrives, it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.400
reminds you, yes, I'm in
business, and yes, I need to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.320
be doing things.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.420
I need to be hiring people.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.680
I need to be setting
up my website.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.200
I need to be building my app.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.430
So it's another little reminder
that this is serious.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.620
You're starting a company.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.430
MARTIN OMANDER: We're
actually doing.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.370
So you mention LLC, S
corps, Sub S corps.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.280
What should a start-up
founder do here?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.890
Do you recommend what type?

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.150
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.360
It depends on how quickly you're
going to accept money

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.500
from investors.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.730
But typically, start-ups lose
money, maybe for the first

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.500
year or so.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.890
So you can set up an LLC,
or what's called a Sub S

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.940
corporation.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.270
In both cases, the losses from
the company flow through to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.360
your personal return.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.300
So you can actually take a
deduction on your personal tax

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.240
return for the losses
of the company.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.530
Now that changes when you accept
money from an investor.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.090
Then you have to be a
full C corporation.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.740
But it's easy to make the
transition from LLC or Sub S

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.435
corporation to a full
C corporation.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.490
It's fairly easy to do.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.470
You can do it yourself,
if you want.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.020
But if you're not comfortable
with that, then you should

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.250
have an accountant
or a lawyer.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.670
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.850
And even if you may be
comfortable doing that, you

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.780
should focus on your start-up
idea, perhaps, and not so much

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.810
about figuring out these
different types of

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.430
corporations and such.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.790
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.990
Well, you can do Google searches
and find the answers

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.410
to most of these questions
online.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.110
And most of the things that you
would need from a lawyer,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.790
for example, Articles of
Incorporation or IP assignment

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.550
rights, or hiring kinds of
agreements, employment

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.850
agreements, you can find
those things online.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.770
And they're pretty
boiler plate.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.680
But if you're too busy or not
comfortable doing that, then

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.730
it's good to have a lawyer
who can do it.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.710
And they'll do it relatively
inexpensively.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.420
Because those are fairly basic
things, but they're things

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.380
that need to be in place.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.660
So either do a search and find
them online, or get a lawyer

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.970
to help you with them.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.870
But there are things
you must do.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.890
You cannot have a company that
creates value where you don't

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.120
have employment agreements and
IP assignment rights and Board

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.870
Articles of Incorporation.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.690
Because things get messed
up in a hurry.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.950
So those are basic things that
you need to have done before

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.740
you accept money from
investors or

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.550
before you hire employees.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.350
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.470
So what other infrastructure?

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.110
We mentioned checking account.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.890
We mentioned think through
what type of

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.000
corporation I'm creating.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.450
Is there other basic
infrastructure like that that

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.400
I should have in
place early on?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.780
DON DODGE: No.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.230
Not from a legal or accounting
point of view.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.650
Those things are pretty basic.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.570
You can run a company out of a
checkbook for quite awhile.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.320
As long as you have a checking
account where you can accept

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.650
investment or accept revenue
from customers and you can pay

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.140
for things, you don't really
need to have much of an

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.820
infrastructure for
quite awhile.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.900
When you take on friends and
family money, you can still

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.170
run it out of a checking
account and be fine.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.960
When you accept money from angel
investors or venture

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.370
capitalists, then you've got to
have more systems in place

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.910
to be able to handle
those things.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.830
So it's pretty straightforward.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.790
But having an accountant or a
lawyer that you can call on

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.490
when you need them is probably
a good idea.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.580
MARTIN OMANDER: So you have that
relationship in place and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.150
you don't need to go
look for them.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.400
DON DODGE: Right.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.840
You don't want to be having to
stop what you're doing and go

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.660
do all of this, when the
business is growing and you're

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.290
moving along.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.200
Take care of that stuff in the
early days, when things aren't

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.690
quite as hectic.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.580
MARTIN OMANDER: Early
is better.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.490
All right.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.790
Great.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.610
Thanks, Don.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.150
That's all for today.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.670
Please add your comments and
questions for the YouTube

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.670
video, and we'll get back
to them in future shows.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.080
Thanks for joining us
and see you out the

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.410
next time, next week.
