Anne: Well, thanks to all of you for coming
to today's authors of Google talk.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.080
We have Harold Jaffe with us today.
And, I wanted to start out the introduction

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.240
with
"find a seam... plant a mine... slip away."

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.720
Where minds are "imaginative interrogative
constructions in the brethren sense."

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.550
This is what Hal Jaffe advocates in the lead
essay for the American Book Review entitled

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.410
"Guerilla Writing".
He was thereafter known as the guerilla writer.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.390
Jaffe is the author of numerous docufiction
collections, novels and essays,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.780
which have been translated into German, Japanese,
Spanish, Italian, French, Polish, Czech and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.629
Farsi.
In 2004 the journal of experimental fiction

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.289
devoted an issue to ger -- Jaffe's writing
entitled

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.090
"The Literary Terrorism of Harold Jaffe"

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.090
Wish I could redo that.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.929
He has won many awards including a California
arts council grant in fiction, national endowment

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.920
awards in fiction,
several pushcart prizes and 2 Fulbright grants.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.780
Harold Jaffe is a professor of literature
and creative writing at San Francisco State

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.391
 --
No, I knew I was gonna do that.

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:17.910
At San Diego State, sorry we're in San Francisco.
San Diego State University, and editor and

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.830
chief of the literary cultural journal of
fiction international.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.770
And he's here today to talk about his new
book, "Anti-Twitter".

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.660
Please welcome.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.110
[applause]

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.900
[book clicks against podium]

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.390
Harold: "Researchers ask people with high
and low self esteem to repeat, I am a loveable

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.270
person.
They then measured participant's feelings

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.000
about themselves.
In the low self esteem group, those who repeated

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.170
the feel good mantra felt worse afterwards.
However when people with high self esteem

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.570
repeated the mantra, they felt better.
Though only slightly."

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:16.500
And "Hello, my name is Slavoj Zizek.
I'm a Lacanian Marxist, a thinker of the highest

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.769
order.
But, you know I aspire to be a rock star,

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.060
and that's the reason I'm dressed you know
the way I am."

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.170
No, actually, I'm Harold Jaffe, as Anne was
kind enough to indicate.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.739
And I'm going to read to you from "Anti-Twitter."
These are all very short.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:44.599
They're exactly 50 words, and so while I'm
reading, I'll see whether you're slipping

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:56.340
or not.
And then if you are, we can move to questions.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.030
"Walter Benjamin inhabited that place at which
weakness and genius coincide.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.389
Nor did Walter Benjamin kill himself with
an overdose of morphine,

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.459
as was widely reported.
He shot morphine into his left thigh because

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.780
he never found anything else he liked to inject
into his left thigh nearly as much."

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:30.499
Harold: "Memory, he remembered his name, nothing
more.

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:37.310
After undergoing eye surgery as an adolescent,
he lost the ability to form memories.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.430
For the next 58 years, each time he met a
friend,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.069
each time he ate a meal,
each time he walked the streets, it was the

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:56.230
first time."

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.110
"A woman mauled by a kangaroo refused comment
on the bizarre attack.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.920
Kristine V. was assaulted by a boxing kangaroo
outside her upscale condominium yesterday

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.219
afternoon,
and taken to hospital.

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.060
After being released, she brushed aside the
incident.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.310
Fact, boxing kangaroos have been venturing
ever closer to upscale condominiums."

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:34.190
"Shuffle, they've seized your shoelaces.
You're in a padded cell.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.850
Cement floor, grey padded walls, no window,
no way to hang yourself without shoelaces.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.700
Not much to do but shuffle from the cot to
the steel grey wall and back again.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:05:02.090
Remember not to lift your feet in their laceless
shoes."

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.440
"Transgender toilet.
A fracas erupted in the Italian parliament's

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:17.840
ladies toilet between MP's Gardini Santa Ride
and Luxuria transgender communist. Gardini

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.450
former showgirl expressed outrage after inadvertently
meeting Luxuria, former sex worker in a toilet.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.890
The incident has provoked a heated debate
about which toilet the transgender MP should

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.890
properly use."

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:49.160
Harold: "The new U.S. strategy eight bloody
years into Afghanistan is perception.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.550
The current perception is that the campaign
is wildly adrift.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.910
Afghans must perceive that Americans are defeating
the insurgency.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:07.310
Afghans must perceive their irrecoverable
loss should they choose insurgency over democracy.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:17.170
That's the idea.
Implementing it won't be easy."

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:25.420
Harold: Reading Nietzsche, I hear a bird in
trouble.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.070
A house finch with a tumor on its head.
I capture it and put it in a cage with water,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.870
feed.
Nietzsche argued vigorously against empathy

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.110
then weeping embraced the cart-horse that
had been whipped.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:53.050
Madness embraced him the following year."

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:00.330
"Vincent Van Gogh under the supervision of
Dr.Gachet shoots himself but misses a vital

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.240
organ.
He struggles to his cot and lies there facing

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.340
the wall.
When his devoted brother Theo comes, Vincent

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.590
refuses to turn from the wall.
He dies that way two days later, facing the

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:23.120
wall."

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.480
"Lady Day is ambulanced to metropolitan hospital
in New York with liver and heart disease May

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.050
31st 1959.
Arrested at the hospital for heroin possession,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.950
remains under police guard at the hospital
until she dies from cirrhosis of the liver

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:47.781
July 17th 1959.
44 years old, nobody knew who she was."

00:07:47.781 --> 00:08:01.450
"An unaccounted victim of the United States
torture policy,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.900
Is a young army corporal from New Jersey.
Name withheld.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:12.590
She witnessed the violent interrogation of
Iraqi prisoners and was deeply troubled.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.400
Six weeks after her appeal for reassignment
was denied, she shot herself dead with her

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:26.500
government issue semi-automatic."

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.560
"War Mother
The reason I'm standing in the rain handing

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:39.329
out 'Stop the War' flyers is my son Chamillo.
He joined up to learn a trade seventeen years

00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:43.249
old.
I gave permission because where we live was

00:08:43.249 --> 00:08:48.269
just drugs and gangs.
Better the Marines than jail.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:09:00.850
Now I'm thinking jail would have been better."

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:06.670
These are not just any spaces, you know as
I'm looking for the text to read, these are

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:12.230
charred spaces.
You know, I think of it in the Buddhist sense.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:18.100
You know, like the space between notes and
Beethoven's late quartets for example.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.089
That's how I like to think of them.

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:26.009
"19 Toucans.
Gazing through the small cracked window of

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:34.120
her room at dusk, she sees 19 toucans flying
low, languidly in single file from west to

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.050
east.
It was said there were alligators in the mangroves.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:54.740
Naked, she lies on her back in a mangrove
swamp in the jungle denseness."

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:00.850
"Chet Baker
After a heroin deal turned bloody, the baby-faced

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:05.059
bad boy is transformed into mister down and
out.

00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:08.490
The interesting thing is Chet doesn't seem
to care.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:16.759
Not being pretty, face busted up, age 27.
Shoot the right grade of shit and you just

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:30.209
don't give a shit."

00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:41.300
"Machine Sex.
No hokey come ons.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:46.410
No pheromone aftershave.
No premature ejack.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.269
No sexual politics.
No big dick narcissism.

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:54.829
No faked foreplay.
No insincere dirty talk.

00:10:54.829 --> 00:11:03.029
No I've shot my bolts, sorry about that.
Machines provide exactly what you need.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:12.759
And if apres sex you want a cigarette, you
don't have to share."

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:14.580
Well here's something finally about technology.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:21.360
I've been describing a wide art, you know,
but here's something for technology.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.939
"Dead wired
Online social networks are crucial to our

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:33.769
lives and increasingly crucial when we die.
An industry has emerged to deal with online

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:38.980
contacts after death.
Through a site called deathswitch, humans

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.470
post posthumous e-mails announcements on online
social networks.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:59.319
And send text messages.
Current cost, $16.00 per month."

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:03.939
"About Opium.
Jean Cocteau himself addicted suggested that

00:12:03.939 --> 00:12:11.519
official chemistry modify opium's toxicity
while salvaging the euphoria.

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:16.720
Which would mean ungoverned pleasure committed
by the ungovernable.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.009
Not just in the realm of culture as with dada
for example,

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:35.720
but spiriting its bliss into the most intimate
orifices of globalism."

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.930
"A man pretending to be dying of cancer was
sentenced to prison.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:46.050
The former Pontiac salesman claimed to have
kidney, lung and prostate cancer.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:51.819
He shaved his head and dropped red dye in
the toilet to simulate blood in his urine.

00:12:51.819 --> 00:13:06.220
He faked seizures, slamming his head into
walls."

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:13.009
"Kung Fu TV legend David Carradine was found
hanging naked inside a wardrobe in his Bangkok

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:17.319
luxury hotel.
A chord was attached to his neck, and a second

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:21.689
chord to his genitals.
There was no suicide note.

00:13:21.689 --> 00:13:39.829
The possibility of a sex game gone wrong could
not be ruled out."

00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:46.790
"Researchers have begun to unravel the information
and social content embedded in the hyena's

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:51.879
uncanny laugh.
Younger hyenas have high-pitched giggles.

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:59.860
And dominant females of the strongly hierarchical
clans have a narrower range of sounds.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:12.120
It has been hypothesized that the laughing
is not a sign of good humor."

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.779
I'm going to hasten toward the end a little
bit here.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:22.679
"Blame it on Chavez.
The Easter dish of choice in Venezuela is

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:28.110
the capybara.
An oversized rodent, cousin to the guinea

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:33.470
pig though river based like a beaver.
Venezuelans regard the creature as more fish

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:38.149
than meat.
A useful deception during lent when it replaces

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:51.439
red meat in this predominately Roman Catholic
country."

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:57.959
"Young Fulbrighter, I'd landed in Islamabad
international airport when I heard John Lenon

00:14:57.959 --> 00:15:04.040
singing 'Imagine' for the first time.
I've heard it innumerable times sense, but

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:14.089
today 5-17-09 in the small market near my
Paris flat, I hear it while shopping and am

00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:26.220
moved.
Can it be 38 years?"

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:33.759
"Butoh, B-U-T-O-H
The Japanese spirit dance meanders in twists

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:42.480
and turns between living and dead.
Dead is another version of irrational.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.920
Whenever I gaze around me, I want to plunge
into the irrational.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:16:00.399
Whenever I look upward, face downward or stare
in front of me, I want to plunge in the irrational."

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:08.869
"Last Words, Death Row.
Well Mums, that's how it played out.

00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:14.929
Love life, live long.
Dealin' with reality ain't always what you

00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:19.139
want it to be.
Tell my kids I love 'em.

00:16:19.139 --> 00:16:23.749
God is real.
He fixin' to find out some deep things that

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:28.990
are real.
Take care of yourselves.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:34.519
Last Words, Death Row.
Been hangin' round this popsicle stand way

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:37.399
too long.
Before I go, I wanna say something to all

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:42.869
ya'll.
Bury me deep, lay two speakers at my feet,

00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:48.019
put headphones on my skull and rock 'n' roll
me when I'm dead.

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:50.309
Shit eaters, I'll see you in hell."

00:16:50.309 --> 00:17:01.689
Thank you.

00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:09.640
Harold: You know, I find a text.
I don't always alter the figure of the text,

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.730
but I alter the ground.
I put it in some other place.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:18.769
I sometimes change the spaces.
And the original text is not art.

00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:23.720
But the one in the other context is art.
Why is it art?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:30.159
Because I proposed that it be art.
It's a conceptual notion, right?

00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:46.460
You know, I think of the Thai artist Tiravanija.
He was involved in a kind of installation

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:56.419
process where he would bicycle around the
New York area and find deserted Gaps or devastated

00:17:56.419 --> 00:18:03.460
Rite Aids.
Or these cavernous kinds of ex-large stores.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:13.019
And he would furnish them with stoves and
refrigerators and chairs and long tables and

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:17.789
comfort food.
And he would invite the homeless to eat.

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:21.700
And they would be fed, he himself would be
serving the food.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.980
And they would be fed for 23 days.
Homeless people would feed homeless people

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.630
for 23 days.
Then he would give away the appliances and

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.340
move on.
Find another place and do the same thing for

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.740
23 days.
Twenty-three was William Burroughs favorite

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:43.049
number, if you remember that.
And, he himself didn't propose that what he

00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:48.230
was doing was art, but other people did.
There was no residue.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:53.649
There was no except you know the food that
the people ate.

00:18:53.649 --> 00:19:01.820
There was no -- there was nothing palpable
about what it was that could be called art.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:08.190
And yet he called it art.
And arguably it is a kind of art, conceptually.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.409
Not so much the aesthetic object, but what
it does to the mind.

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:19.059
I mean how one thinks about it afterwards.
That's something of what I'm doing by displacing

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:24.150
these file texts.
Which profess to be information.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:34.490
But we know that actually they're mostly disinformation,
deception, distraction and ideology.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:40.419
And by defamiliarizing them, one can see them
differently, more clearly.

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:47.679
Sometimes I alter them fairly decisively.
Other times I do very little to them.

00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:56.289
It's also the proximity of where they are
and the texts that are around them that matter.

00:19:56.289 --> 00:20:03.110
You know, as I was mentioning to Galen, back
when we were walking here.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.519
You know our milieu has changed.
It's very difficult for us to get back to

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:11.490
fundamental things.
You know, we don't hear the mockingbird.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.850
You know wilderness is being real estated
and so on.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:22.559
Our milieu now is what professes to be information.
That's the data we work with.

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:28.049
That's the kind of material that we can do
some interesting art with.

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:35.950
It's not so much the idea of drafting something,
it's more the idea of discovering something.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:41.860
You know, one doesn't have to be a good draftsman
or draftswoman to be a good visual artist

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:47.899
these days.
Discovering, defamiliarizing, being alert

00:20:47.899 --> 00:21:04.330
in that way can cover you I think interestingly.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:10.340
What is my disposition to all of this?
Well, what do you think?

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:18.929
Do, do, do you infer some disposition, some
attitude that I have to this,

00:21:18.929 --> 00:21:29.740
or is it just pretty much hugger mugger here?

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.049
Well you know, my attitude is to interrogate,
you know, clearly.

00:21:34.049 --> 00:21:40.760
And to tease out whatever subtexts are there.
Sometimes you don't have to do much more than

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:47.000
simply displace it.
I mean, there are important and obvious precedents

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.820
to this.
Probably the most famous one is Duchamp finding

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.360
the urinal.
It wasn't in Paris, but it was some street

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.380
in France.
And then writing "R.Mutt" on it and exhibiting

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.269
it.
Didn't do anything to the figure at all except

00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:07.760
maybe cleaned it up a little bit.
Added R.Mutt, but just changed the ground.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.769
And there we had a found object that became
art.

00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:17.760
Became a certain kind of art.
And that started a way of thinking, at least

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:28.320
in the West that's been influential.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.620
Do you want me to read a few more things to
you?

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.750
I didn't read all the incendiary ones.
&gt;&gt; I have a--

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.870
Harold: Yeah, please
&gt;&gt;Related to what we were talking about, concerning

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.720
artists.
This stuff comes from our morning page.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:49.260
On claiming that there is [inaudible] at least
on the more serious one to address the social

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:55.460
issues of the day.
Is there any need in art or artists?

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:05.070
Harold: Yeah, well it's an important and inevitable
question that.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:11.059
And I'm easy to answer.
You know I think of the writer Claribel Alegria

00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:16.549
who is Nicaraguan.
And she was writing particularly during the

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:29.690
United States invasion of Nicaragua, and Iran-contra.
And where they would use drug money to furnish

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:35.530
the contras.
And she was asked about this imperative.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:43.649
And she said, yes, she feels that the artists
must address this, must bracket his or her

00:23:43.649 --> 00:23:50.899
concerns and address this.
And, the interviewer in fact, I was the interviewer

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:59.809
asked her, what would she do if she met an
artist who wasn't addressing the war and the

00:23:59.809 --> 00:24:05.070
U.S. colonialism in Nicaragua?
And she said I'd refuse to shake his hand.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:12.610
Now you might ask, what is it that permits
the writer or the artist to have a special

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:22.230
access or particular ability to articulate
these difficulties and to address social questions.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.809
And to be socially activist.
What would you say about that?

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:32.740
I mean, is there anything that -- and honestly
people don't necessarily say all lawyers,

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.049
you know should address the social issues
of the day.

00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:40.460
They might say that it would be good if doctors
you know joined Médecins Sans Frontières,

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.940
right?
But with writers and artists, one does hear

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.889
this.
Why though?

00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:55.250
What is it about let's say writers that give
them any kind of special access into this?

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.980
So do you have any feelings about that?

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:08.220
&gt;&gt;Personally, well I don't think there should
be expressional art in any form to the degree

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.710
that
you know if it is a social issue is what motivates

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:16.720
you or that spurs you on, then that's great.
But if you are an artist, and that's not your

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.799
emphasis, I don't think there's anything wrong
with that.

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:24.350
Cuz art is just free expression.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:28.130
Harold: Yeah, good point.
But is the free expression really free or

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:33.019
is it secretly complicitis?
I mean, take an exaggerated situation like

00:25:33.019 --> 00:25:39.250
the Third Reich.
You know, a lot of artists left Germany when

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.450
this was going on.
But some didn't.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:49.889
Some Aryan artists continued to produce.
And they weren't writing about the war or

00:25:49.889 --> 00:25:54.070
doing images about the war.
They were writing about the homeland and the

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.030
country,
and the kinds of mythologies that have always

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:02.740
been you know evident in Germany.
Now, were they simply expressing themselves,

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:08.340
or by turning their back on what was going
on, were they being complicitis?

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.950
&gt;&gt; Complicitis, but I look at it more as perhaps
survival.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:20.259
In a sense that you know, those artist might
have agreed with the Third Reich ideology.

00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:27.450
But then again they decided to stay, it might
have been just a matter of survival.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:33.190
Of not being able to have the courage to speak
truth to the powers.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.139
Harold: Yeah, sure, no I think that is well
put.

00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:40.889
&gt;&gt;The thing is that I'm trying to take this
position where I'm not judging.

00:26:40.889 --> 00:26:45.710
But after the same time as a human being I
you know I do judge.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:50.809
That particular ideology is totally offensive
to me, and I would think that anybody would

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.970
come against it.
But life has so many shades of grey.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:27:02.019
And you know, people are put in so many difficult
situations, it's just really hard to say if

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:06.409
they were being complicit or supporting that
ideology.

00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:12.960
Or in a sense, just trying to survive.
Not having the courage to speak out.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.670
Harold: Yeah, no, understood.
I think what at least theoretically gives

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:26.019
an artist a particular access that people
in other profession might not so readily have

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:32.990
is that the artist cultivates dream space
and cultivates rumination.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:39.230
And spends time thinking in ways that aren't
permitted to let's say people who work from

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:44.820
8 to 6.
And the insights that come from this kind

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:51.909
of contemplation are different and often useful
to you know, to articulating.

00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:57.149
Also artists, if they have any kind of reputation,
have easy access to media.

00:27:57.149 --> 00:28:01.480
You know that other people don't have.
Now take the situation of AIDS.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:08.820
When AIDS was happening, you know you're a
young woman, and so you were very young then

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:14.980
if you were even born.
The kind of hate that was let lose was quite

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:20.740
extraordinary, even for a country like this.
The hate that was addressed, especially to

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:26.379
gay men then, that's one act up and grand
fury came together,

00:28:26.379 --> 00:28:33.250
And gay people, but not exclusively gay people
bracketed what they were doing, and they decided

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:40.320
to try to expropriate the expropriator.
And use the very weapons, you know the propaganda

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:50.220
against the people and institutions who were
demonizing people with AIDS.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:58.200
And that's when the battle turned.
And I think even though an entire generation

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:08.029
was lost, I do believe it would have been
a lot worse if act up and grand fury didn't

00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:13.100
poster St. Patrick's cathedral where the then
cardinal was making --

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:19.240
was about to give some talk demonizing AIDS,
people with AIDS and so on.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.759
I think it would have been a lot worse than
it actually was.

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:29.970
So there art intervention actually was very
useful.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:36.060
Sometimes it can't be measured in that way.
And even when it can't be measured, you know,

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:42.059
I think there's a valid argument for it.
But you know, having said this, I do agree

00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:45.580
with you.
That I don't know that the imperative actually

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:51.750
applies to everyone.
There are some people who are incapable you

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.750
know as artists.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.049
&gt;&gt;I was gonna say.
They are wired to personally.

00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:55.049
Harold: Yeah.

00:29:55.049 --> 00:30:01.960
&gt;&gt; You know, I do believe artists have that
obligation to address this issue.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:09.039
In fact I was thinking my daughter is a theatre
major at University San Francisco.

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:13.129
And part of that major is theatre as social
justice.

00:30:13.129 --> 00:30:14.750
And that part is combined.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.750
Harold: Yeah

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:22.139
&gt;&gt; And as she comes home, you know in her
youthful vigor, she talks about her art and

00:30:22.139 --> 00:30:26.830
how it influences and how she really wants
to change things.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:31.980
And that is a perfect complement.
But at the same time, I think about some artist

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:39.309
who just wants to get on television and be
on "American Idol" and do something like that.

00:30:39.309 --> 00:30:43.080
They're an artist, but I don't think they're
pushing any kind of social agenda.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.120
Harold: No I'm happy to hear that.
But you know, as far as changing, effecting

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:57.769
change.
One can't ever expect the response to be commensurate

00:30:57.769 --> 00:31:02.490
with the effort.
I think at a time like now, it's a question

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:07.580
of bearing witness.
Of you know, nobody knows what's gonna happen

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.669
to the works we do.
Whether they'll be absolutely in the hands

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:15.960
of managers, you know corporate managers.
Or whether they'll be somehow alive on the

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.480
net.
Assuming that the net has some degree of freedom,

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:26.830
you know 25 years or 30 years from now.
But the notion of bearing witness is a very

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:31.920
important one, especially in a time like now
because change has been so accelerated.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:38.409
Just think, the last 15 years how people think,
particularly in technology of course, has

00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:43.789
affected the way the world is viewed.
Language, you know, has changed radically,

00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:48.360
very rapidly because of the very short hand
ways.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.179
We don't look at events directly anymore,
not that we're always easily able to,

00:31:53.179 --> 00:31:57.620
we look at them in a mediated way through
a screen or through a small screen.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.029
But what's going on is instead of looking
there, there's violence there, we look here

00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:07.549
and we see the mediated form of the violence
which of course is gonna have some lies and

00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:13.499
some you know some changes that are.
So the idea of being an artist who bears witness,

00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:18.320
I don't think that's negligible.
But again, you're right, there are people

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.140
who aren't wired to do that.
There aren't artists, there are some artists

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:29.870
who aren't wired to do that.
And even if they live in a toxic, you know,

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:35.789
environment such as the Third Reich.
Perhaps one can argue that you know, they're

00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:39.030
still doing the best they can.
I think that's possible.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:45.629
&gt;&gt; Here's another question.
It's sort of falls under the same umbrella.

00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:52.289
How does the influence that corporate or government
sponsors pull on the current artist.

00:32:52.289 --> 00:32:56.010
Oh, I'm sorry, did I?

00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:04.019
Harold: No, I know what you mean.
If you're doing an exhibit which is virulently

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:10.720
interrogative of what government and corporations
are doing and it's being shown at the museum

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.490
of modern art in New York, and it's sponsored
by Mobil, right?

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:17.220
And Mobil does sponsor it.
What does that mean?

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:22.179
I mean are you being complicit?
I mean when you see something on the wall

00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:26.890
in the museum sponsored by Mobil, you don't
look at it in the same way as you might if

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:32.870
you saw it in some sort of handout.
The same thing applies to writers arguably

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:38.419
who publish a book with Simon and Schuster.
You know which professes to be you know interrogative.

00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:43.710
Simon and Schuster wouldn't do it unless they
misread it, which is very likely.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:49.320
And is the fact that it has that imprint immediately
compromised?

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.470
It's a hard question.
I mean the fact is you know we're living at

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:59.490
a very imperfect time.
And there are all kinds of quibbles and small

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:06.669
sacrifices that one makes.
If you see Guernica in the museum of modern

00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:12.429
art or some other place, do you think about
the small Spanish town that's being bombed

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:24.569
by the fascists?
Or do you just see another exquisite experiment

00:34:24.569 --> 00:34:29.240
by Picasso there.
That's part of the question, yeah.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:37.050
&gt;&gt; Well, I think if I understand things properly,
what's going on is really a question of whether

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:42.869
an omission can be an act.
So if you have a duty to do something and

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:48.649
when omitting is safe, then an artist has
a duty to be socially active.

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:56.210
Whether failing to perform that duty is you
know really something that you know can be

00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:00.550
you know display worthy.
And what I find interesting is that in European

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:07.109
countries, omission is generally considered
to be at least in law something culpable.

00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:11.060
So if you see someone drowning, and you could
save them by throwing them a rope and you

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:18.869
don't, that actually can be prosecuted.
But in America, no state can be prosecuted.

00:35:18.869 --> 00:35:22.290
Harold: Yeah, that's an interesting point.
Very subtle.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:30.410
Yeah, you know, there isn't any ongoing tradition
of socially activist art in the United States.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:34.660
I mean there've been moments.
There were the Transit Analysts who were against

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:41.560
the slave trade.
There were the people associated with IWW.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:48.079
There were the 30's communists, most of whom
changed when Stalin came to power.

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:56.550
There certainly, you know in the 60's, for
that blip of a period from 1966 let's say

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:04.650
to 1972, there were young people who at least
in France came close to overthrowing the country.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:12.430
But there were as you know, in '68, there
were protests and very powerful ones across

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:19.410
the world in places you wouldn't expect.
But, and including America.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:24.140
But generally speaking, if you compare the
United States with France.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:30.180
If you compare it even with England.
If you compare it with Germany.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:39.309
There hasn't been any ongoing vital ongoing
social activist response in art.

00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:43.760
Just spots.
But. and that itself is an interesting question.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.970
Why that should be?
And I think the response to that is complex.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:58.059
It has to do with a number of factors that
govern, you know, this country and--

00:36:58.059 --> 00:37:02.109
--and sustain the way this country functions.

00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:08.579
&gt;&gt; I mean socially it has to tie in the sort
of American mythology about personal freedom.

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:09.579
Harold: Yeah.

00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:14.190
&gt;&gt; So, here's the question.
Why do recurring folks on the [inaudible ]list

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:22.880
The outrage of the current society, and the
responsibility of the artists in these times

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.690
seem to both be clear things.
Poverty is a timeless issue.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:32.569
How does it fit into your general argument?

00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:38.130
Harold: How does the notion of poverty fit
into these?

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:44.380
Well, you know I think, you know I read last
words from people on death row.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.610
I think one of the important points is to
see these people from the subject position.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:54.650
And I've dealt with this in different ways,
extreme ways where I've talked about serial

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.980
killers and so on.
And It's very easy to demonize people.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:06.510
And also I've written about art brut people
who are accounted, I use that verb deliberately

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:11.700
who are accounted mad.
And, but do some very unusual art.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:19.630
Art that's valued, but sometimes marginalized.
I try to see them from the subject position.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:28.829
That is to imagine them talking or even to
find places where they've articulated

00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:32.390
sentences or in certain instances art, visual
art.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:39.819
I think seeing them from the subject position
and hearing them is important.

00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:46.490
Whether it's a political prisoner.
Whether it's a very very poor person who's

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:51.960
handing out some homeless leaflet.
I think insofar as possible, and it's not

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.920
always easily possible as you know to hear
them from the subject position.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:04.950
Instead of having them objectified, and hearing
the same kinds of platitudes of moralistic

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:09.630
platitudes about them.
I think that's an important first step.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:15.140
And when you hear them, you know what I did
is I went back to the records of Texas prisoners

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.770
who were executed.
And I actually got to the final statements,

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.540
which again I treated.
I changed in certain ways.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:29.860
They were extraordinarily articulate and very
powerful and very poetic.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.900
None of that's heard.
You know, they're just, you know most of them

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:39.160
as you would expect were Mexican or African
American or American Indian.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.079
And none of that was heard.
They were allowed to have these last words

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:48.119
the way they were allowed to have a last meal,
but all of its forgotten.

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:51.990
But I didn't want it to be forgotten, so I
rescued it.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.630
And I put it in a different context.
Part of what I read was from that.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:40:01.740
But I've a large thing called Death in Texas.
A large text where I actually, I have about

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:06.030
30 prisoners who are about to be executed
talk.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:12.000
And I inserted some unusual things in it that
didn't belong there.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:24.119
I actually took a 19th century person from
a German institution for the mental incapacitated,

00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:29.109
and I inserted that.
Made some changes into the prisoners, the

00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:32.440
death row prisoners.
Nobody was able to distinguish that.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.089
Nobody said a word about that, it was published
in a number of places.

00:40:36.089 --> 00:40:44.109
Madam, that would be the first step I think.
To allow them to articulate from the subject

00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:46.480
position.
You know without interfering.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:53.240
I think that itself is not a small first step.
Because when you hear, when you allow yourself

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:59.849
to hear, you know or see what people who are
otherwise severely marginalized are doing

00:40:59.849 --> 00:41:10.490
then even the coldest least feeling, least
compassionate people are not likely, but liable

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:20.400
to be moved.
And that's not unimportant I think.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.579
Yeah?

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:37.440
&gt;&gt; As mass communication sort of moves seemingly
to increasing form of illiteracy [inaudible]

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.819
social [inaudible]
Are examples [Inaudible] texts becoming harder

00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:42.099
to find?

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:48.420
Harold: Well they're becoming very different.
Everything is very abbreviated.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:54.349
Which makes it easier for me because I'm deliberately
working in very short units.

00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:59.680
I chose 50 words rather than the number of
characters of twitter because that didn't

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:05.440
allow me enough access.
But by choosing 50 words, it forced me into

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.640
closing and opening of certain spaces.
Yeah, in a traditional sense certainly, the

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.890
discourse has changed.
It's much more dumbed down than it was.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:21.069
And the references are much more restricted.
You never find any high cultural references

00:42:21.069 --> 00:42:25.200
or rarely there.
I mean if you read the American newspapers,

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.670
or American you know whether they are online
or off.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:32.940
So it's much more parochial, you know than
it was.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:38.270
The advantage of it is that it's brief.
Because newspapers you know are ape computers

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:43.940
now, so everything looks like U.S. World,
U.S. News today.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:50.799
You know, everything looks like that now.
And so it's easier to plunder, you know.

00:42:50.799 --> 00:42:55.579
It's easier to bushwack these texts because
of their abbreviation.

00:42:55.579 --> 00:43:00.329
But yeah, they don't point in as many directions
as you'd like them to.

00:43:00.329 --> 00:43:05.980
On the other hand, if they were cultivated,
and pointed in those other directions, they

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:11.819
might not interest you know us plunderers,
you know in the same way.

00:43:11.819 --> 00:43:21.120
Because they would be viable, you know, insofar
as you know that kind of news can be viable.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.690
That's a subtle question, it's a good question.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:31.200
&gt;&gt; Here's another question, and it goes to
your book.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.031
What inspired you to use the twitter format?
And do you use twitter at all?

00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:41.240
Harold: Do I, the last part was am I on twitter
myself?

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:47.270
I have an account there, I don't I haven't
followed it up because I have,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:56.369
between my writing and fiction international,
I'm on so many different social network sites

00:43:56.369 --> 00:44:01.630
sometimes that I'm not doing them myself.
But the assistance on the Journal Fiction

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:10.359
International are.
I use it, I use it in an emblematic way.

00:44:10.359 --> 00:44:18.450
As representing the new communication in "Anti-Twitter"
I mean I could have said anti facebook.

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:21.770
Of course, I wanted to use twitter because
of the abbreviation.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.650
The extreme abbreviation.
And I think it's like text messaging.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.220
That's what's been changing you know, the
language.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:34.010
Now if you asked me what I think about the
language being changed, I have mixed feelings.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:41.950
I like some of the innovations that lets say
rap singers and sports people have used where

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:46.630
they play around with their name.
T-Mac for Tracy McGrady and so on, I think

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:55.569
that's amusing and I like that.
But the language otherwise is changing in

00:44:55.569 --> 00:45:06.309
ways that are you know funny and theatrical,
but I think finally leaving us less leverage

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:11.670
to be expressive than we'd like to be.
You know, I like listening to it, but it's

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:18.980
 -- the leverage is getting narrower and narrower.
And I think that's a problem.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.140
And it's moving so fast.
That's the reason I dealt with it.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:32.109
Because the last 15 years have moved much
more, much faster than the previous 15 years.

00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:39.040
And it's that speed, and often speed without
direction that I wanted to address.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.760
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:59.670
&gt;&gt; In "Suicides", was the order of the stories
within intended to prepare the readers to

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:03.240
sympathize with Hamas suicide bombers?
If I would have read it [inaudible]

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.410
A lot of people would have been outraged.
[inaudible]

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.990
Instead I found myself related to the acts
of Hamas, the acts of the character in the

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:12.970
previous stories.
Not judging any of them were bad, rational

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:20.930
or irrational, but simply as acts that are
somehow prick the conscience.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:29.920
Harold: That's a very subtle question.
I've never been asked that question before.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:36.240
And the answer is yes, you're right.
What I did in this text called "Suicides",

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:44.470
I wrote about the suicides of Mishima, Simone
Wilde, Johnny Ace who was an early rhythm

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:50.380
and blues singer.
And there was somebody else/

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:57.270
And the last one was a Hamas suicide bomber,
where I just detailed something.

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:05.579
And yeah, I was trying to finesse the reader
into reading that fairly and in a broader

00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:09.089
context, that's right I was.
That's a very good perception.

00:47:09.089 --> 00:47:15.580
&gt;&gt; There are a couple twists.

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.220
Harold: Yeah, keep going if you like, they're
good questions.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:23.100
&gt;&gt; OK, five points, five point restraints.
"Brilliant, silence has developed solely with

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:31.160
a view to the pursuit that limits performances
to the detriment of any effort to discover

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:40.150
a coherent truth useful to humanity."
Yet doesn't quantum physics seek universal

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:41.150
truth?

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:46.560
Harold: Yeah, I think Quantum Physics does.
But one of the points that Virilio makes is

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:53.660
that increasingly science is allied to technology.
That one -- I mean people talk about pure

00:47:53.660 --> 00:48:00.900
science, but now it's largely become, not
entirely, but largely become techno science.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:07.330
And so when scientists are working and need
money, they get money from corporations.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:12.780
And they get money from the government.
They get that money, they're compelled, you

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:17.420
know -- it's like judging some drug that the
F.D.A. is putting on the market.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.880
They're compelled to respond in a particular
way.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.970
To leave certain things out you know as Nicholas
was saying.

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:28.440
To omit certain kinds of things.
Yeah, I think in principle you're right.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:40.799
You know certainly Quantum Mechanics and other
aspects of post Einsteinian and even in philosophy,

00:48:40.799 --> 00:48:48.210
let's say post Vichtenstein kind of thinking.
I think that's very useful insofar as it could

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.180
be understood.
You know, and even if it's not understood,

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:56.770
it's useful in some way.
But I think there's much less of that.

00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:05.310
Consider, you know, a scientist who's teaching
can't make the same kind of living as he or

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.940
she did previously unless the person's getting
grants.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.900
And who's giving these grants, I mean it's
that kind of thing.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:19.680
Historians, the same way.
I mean, if you're Howard Zinn, or Chomsky,

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:27.260
you could write pretty much what you want.
But even Chomsky has dealt with lots of hate.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.390
I was in San Francisco a number of years ago.
When I did a book with City Lights,

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:38.390
and he was giving a talk at Berkeley.
And there was a letter from Berkeley professors,

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:45.400
many of them Jewish, a number of them previously
progressive who were denouncing him.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:53.079
They were calling him, they were accusing
him of Jewish self-hatred,

00:49:53.079 --> 00:50:02.060
of being pro-palestinian,
of not recognizing the power of the holocaust.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:10.960
I mean all of these things.
And so it's very difficult to take an independent

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:18.930
stance without having the funds to make sure
that it's published in such a way that people

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:22.660
can read it.
Hence, you look for money, and once you look

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:29.690
for money, compromises ensue.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:34.940
&gt;&gt;[inaudible]

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:35.940
&gt;&gt;Thank you very much for coming.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:35.943
Harold: Thank You.
