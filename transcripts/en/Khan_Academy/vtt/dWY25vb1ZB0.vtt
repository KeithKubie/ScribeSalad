00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.380
All the parabolic
mirror examples

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.530
we've been doing so
far have been concave.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.740
And that just means,
you might know already

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.390
what concave means, but
just to make it clear,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.590
they were opening out
towards the objects,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.150
and in most of the
cases, out towards where

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.520
the images were formed.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.730
So what we cared about the
inside surface of the mirror

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.589
right here.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.130
And the way I always
remember concave

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.030
is the kind of forms that cave.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.860
You could view this part right
here as the inside of the cave.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.220
And we had a bunch of examples
where we had focal points.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.710
And then this one here
was our principal axis.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.730
And we had objects.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.030
And I showed you how the light
would reflect off of the mirror

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.304
and go through the focal points.

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:50.720
So thus we did a
bunch of examples

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.490
like that in the last
couple of videos.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.590
What I want to do in this
video is a quick example

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.570
of using a convex
parabolic mirror.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.480
So let's do a convex
parabolic mirror.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.880
And here we care about the
other side of the mirror.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.960
We care about the side that's
the outside of the bowl,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.570
if you want to view the
parabolic mirror as a ball.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.320
So let's think about
that as a little bit.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.170
So let's imagine
that once again we

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.810
have something that's
the shape of a parabola.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.170
It has this-- let me draw
a better version of it--

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.200
so it has the shape
of a parabola.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.160
This is the principal
axis right over here.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.960
You could almost view that
as the line of symmetry.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.400
This is still the focal point.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.050
That right there
is still the focus.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.310
But now we're going to assume
that the reflective surface is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.920
on the outside.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.206
It's on the outside.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:45.580
So the reflective
surface is kind

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.807
of jutting out towards us
as opposed to caving in.

00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:51.640
That's another way to
remember it-- concave,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.010
looks like it's caved in.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.335
Here, it's jutting
out towards us.

00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:56.960
And let's think about
what would happen

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.680
if I put an object over
here on the outside assuming

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.370
that this is a
reflective surface.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.750
So if I put an object over
here, what is going to happen?

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.810
So let's just do
the same exercise.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.160
But what we're
going to do is we're

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.050
going to have one parallel ray.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.240
We could do rays that go
in any direction from any

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.180
of these points because there's
some light source over here.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.680
They never draw
the light source,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.440
but it reflects diffusely
off of this object.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.610
So this object is emitting
light rays in every direction.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.130
But the useful
diffused light rays

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.990
being emitted by this object
are the ones that are parallel

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.030
to the principal
axis and the ones

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.292
that would go through the focus.

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:42.500
Let's do one that's parallel.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.040
So if something is parallel
to the principal axis--

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.290
and I'm not doing
the map over here--

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.980
but if it reflects
on the outside

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.360
of this parabolic mirror,
it will reflect in a way

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.079
so it looks like it's
coming from the focus.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.620
So I would see the focus as on
the other side of this mirror,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.161
but it would reflect
in a way that it

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.300
looks like it's
coming from the focus.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.340
So that ray will
reflect like that.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.500
And then if we have another ray
from the head of this object,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.650
from the tip of that
arrow, and that ray

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.610
is going in the
direction of the focus--

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.920
so the focus is there-- so
let me draw the direction.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.790
So let's say I have
an incident ray going

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.010
in the direction of the focus.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.950
When that gets reflected,
it will reflect parallel

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.100
to the principal axis.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.230
And so what type of image
is going to be formed here?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.650
Clearly, these two rays
will never converge.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.190
So we can't form a real image.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.290
We cannot project that image
onto a screen or cloth and then

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.950
see it.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.460
These two rays are converging.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.920
But if one were to
observe the rays,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.570
they look like they are
diverging from a single point.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.885
This ray looks like,
let me make it clear,

00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:55.010
this one that just got
reflected out parallel looks

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.560
like it's coming from
if you go straight

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.762
back behind the mirror.

00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:00.220
And then this one
that's coming out

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.780
looks like it's coming
out of this point there.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.740
So it looks like
they're diverging

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.365
from this point on the
other side of the mirror.

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:10.740
And not only doesn't look like
they're coming from there,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.870
but the actual image
will look like that.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.689
We could do it with other
points on this arrow if we want.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.730
If you take the bottom of
the arrow, that's maybe

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.910
the easiest, light that goes
straight to the actual mirror

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.050
will then be reflected
straight back.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.310
So it would look
like it's coming

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.250
from a point at the
mirror back over here.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.839
And we could do other things.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.380
We could draw stuff
so that you could

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.935
see what the whole image-- we
could take points over here,

00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:42.310
and you would say
that that would

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.070
correspond to a
point over there.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.120
But I guess the thing
that hopefully you'll

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.370
realize from this
video is when you're

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.750
dealing with a convex
parabolic mirror,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.777
the outside is a
reflective surface.

00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:55.360
You're not going to
form a real image,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.110
you're going to form
a virtual image.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.280
This is a virtual
image, just like you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.200
would see in your
bathroom mirror,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.810
although that's probably
not parabolic, I'm guessing.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.655
And it's also going
to be a smaller image.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.620
And you see these types
of mirrors all the time,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.040
especially around corners.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.610
If you see a
corner-- let's let me

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.550
draw a hallway with
corners-- you'll

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.110
sometimes see mirrors-- let me
do it the other way-- you'll

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.670
sometimes see mirrors so that
people-- well, the mirror might

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.720
be out here-- so that
you can see people

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.220
as they're coming
around the corner.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.011
And the reason why
these mirrors are useful

00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:36.770
is that they reflect light
from a lot of directions.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.877
And so you can kind
of see around corners.

00:05:39.877 --> 00:05:41.460
This is not the best
of drawing, but I

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.950
think you've seen these
convex mirrors, mirrors

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.399
that look something like this.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.690
Sometimes you'll also see
them at the aisles of stores,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.150
at the head of aisles of stores.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.740
And this way, the store owners
can have a good field of view.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.710
And they can see if
anyone is shoplifting.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.860
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that interesting.
