Some various junk that, from the front, looks
like this. And, the world's first orange aligator.

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:10.830
It's episode 19 of IMG!

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.330
A new Kinect trick allows you to take photos
with your Xbox, and then build them in Minecraft.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.420
And here's some true Tetris love.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.189
When your car gets covered in snow, let the
snow people drive it. And then, with a little

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.689
creativity, prove that money is the root of
all evil...Zombies...

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.410
And why spray paint all willy-nilly when you
can paint each individual brick and make a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.210
pixelated Link?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.930
If Greedo was on the "Jersey Shore" it would
suck, but this really blows...

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.950
Awesome...oh...

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.969
This is how pumpkin pie is made...maybe you'd
prefer some Star Wars cakes, or TV dinner

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.649
cupcakes?

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.500
But, before you wash it all down, this is
why drinking is like yoga.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.050
This issue of Parent's Magazine is old and
photoshopped, but covering letters always

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.480
makes places more fun, especially if it's
accidental.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.060
Ted Williams had an awesome week, and to celebrate,
here are some equally awesome homeless signs...enjoy.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.060
Now, it's time for the worst parenting ever.
We've got grocery shopping, party time, snakes,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.990
pole dancing lessons, champagne, and, "hey
you look angry, take this."

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.390
Right now it's Jesus, but, upside down, it's
Satan.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.100
And where's the human covered in paint? Oh, there
he is. There he is. Where is he here?

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.360
Well, this is true.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.400
Ok, let's look at some hilariously inappropriate
t-shirts:

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.280
Wrong strategy. Wrong age. Wrong...everything...And,
thanks for the warning...

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.060
Here's a great vanity plate. And, she is pretty...WOAH,
SQUISHY BALL!

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.320
On Facebook, you guys are still at it. Ryan
Tim brought us "Hard Rock," and he also brought

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.890
us a most nutritious breakfast.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.710
