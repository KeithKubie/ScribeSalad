00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For the next few problems, we're going to be working with what's called

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a parallel plate capacitor and that's a fancy name but what it really means

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is that we have two plates here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
One on each side here, and we give the left plate a strong positive charge +Q

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we give the right plate a strong negative charge -Q.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And this difference in charges gives rise to an electric field between the two plates.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I've shown this electric field using field lines here in red.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And what's particularly awesome about the electric field between two parallel plates

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is that it's actually constant.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The electric field here is just as strong as the electric field

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
here and here and here and here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now it's not completely constant around the edges. We get some bending.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But we're just going to stick to the middle of the plates where the field is constant

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and ignore these edge effects.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now let's imagine that I put a proton here right next to this left plate.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now since the proton has a positive charge

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it should follow along the field lines and move in this direction.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And since this field is constant, this proton should move with a constant acceleration.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
All right. Now can you tell me if the separation between the two plates is d,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
how long will it take this proton to move from this side of the parallel plate over to this side?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here's some values you'll need to solve the problem.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The electric field strength is 1000 N/C. The plate separation is 1 cm.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And here's the mass of the proton and the charge of the proton.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You can put your answer down here and give your answer in nanoseconds,

00:01:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which corresponds to 10⁻⁹ normal seconds--good luck.
