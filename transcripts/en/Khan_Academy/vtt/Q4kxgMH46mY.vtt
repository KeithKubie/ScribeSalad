00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:00.910
- [Voiceover] Hello David.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.967
- [Voiceover] Hello Kim.

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:03.766
- [Voiceover] So today what we're doing

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.247
is taking a look at this speech

00:00:06.247 --> 00:00:08.526
by one of my favorite Presidents,

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:11.347
Franklin Delano Roosevelt which he gave

00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:14.424
at his inauguration in 1933.

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:16.282
And I think what's really important

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.128
about looking at a speech like this

00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:20.821
is not only that we can
learn to analyze this

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.422
as a primary source, which will be helpful

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:26.011
for thinking about it historically,

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:28.124
but also because I
think it's really useful

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:30.527
to be able to look at
a Presidential speech,

00:00:30.527 --> 00:00:32.629
or a speech given by any politician,

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.125
and understand what kind
of claims they're making

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.365
and how they're making them.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:39.490
- [Voiceover] So, Kim,
before we go any further,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.870
what even is a primary source?

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.031
What's the difference between a primary

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:44.947
and a secondary source?

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:45.667
- [Voiceover] Great question.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:49.816
So a primary source is a document

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:53.724
that takes a look at an event

00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:57.060
from the perspective of
someone who was there.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.277
So, a primary source
could be lots of things.

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:05.840
It could be a photograph

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.969
taken by someone who was, perhaps,

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.369
attending a political rally.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.535
It could be a diary of, maybe,

00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:19.847
someone who was active in
the women's rights movement

00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:22.747
in the 19th century.

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:27.149
Certainly any speech,

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.781
or even, let's say, like a
oral history conversation,

00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:34.382
and I've mentioned a lot
of significant things here,

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:37.283
but it also doesn't even
have to be something that is

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:41.464
connected with a significant
person or a famous event.

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:46.206
It could be a shopping list, right,

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.545
if you are studying the consumption habits

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:51.507
of someone who lived in the 1950's.

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:54.377
What they bought at the grocery
store would tell you a lot

00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:58.441
about what they ate,
what they could spend.

00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:02.362
So, a primary source is
kind of the real meat

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:06.240
of research material that
shows you what people,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.446
at the time, were thinking.

00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:10.826
- [Voiceover] Okay, so a
primary source is an artifact

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.786
left behind by someone who was there.

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:14.402
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:15.830
- [Voiceover] What is a secondary source?

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.649
- [Voiceover] So a secondary
source is an interpretation.

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:22.691
So, say I'm a historian,

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:25.071
which I happen to be.

00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:25.907
- [Voiceover] Oh my goodness!

00:02:25.907 --> 00:02:26.906
(laughter)

00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:27.823
What a coincidence.

00:02:27.823 --> 00:02:29.376
(laughter)

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:31.503
- [Voiceover] So I have
done the work of digging up

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:34.603
a bunch of primary sources, and, then,

00:02:34.603 --> 00:02:38.121
you look at all of them and
see what they have in common,

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:39.305
for example.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:42.405
So maybe I'm writing
about Abraham Lincoln,

00:02:42.405 --> 00:02:45.389
and I get a lot of photographs of Lincoln,

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.824
I get a lot of writings by
Lincoln and his contemporaries

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:53.423
and I go through all of them and I come up

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.907
with my interpretation
of what was going on

00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:57.300
in Lincoln's life.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.670
So, I write a book on Lincoln by Kim.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.341
- [Voiceover] Until now...

00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:05.160
(laughter)

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.968
- [Voiceover] And that's
my interpretation.

00:03:08.968 --> 00:03:09.468
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:09.908
- [Voiceover] Right?

00:03:09.908 --> 00:03:12.324
So the things that I'm interested in

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:15.911
say Lincoln's religion, or lack thereof,

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:17.809
might not be the same things

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.010
that another historian
would be interested.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.002
Say, they're interested in
Lincoln's foreign policy.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.768
So, my interpretation is just one way

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:27.881
of looking at those primary sources

00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:29.228
where another historian might have

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:32.188
a completely different interpretation.

00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:34.553
What's also important
about secondary sources is

00:03:34.553 --> 00:03:36.949
that I wasn't there, right?

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.028
I never talked to Lincoln.

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:41.523
He, you know, died more than
100 years before I was born,

00:03:41.523 --> 00:03:45.366
which means that you can
only trust me so much.

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:48.303
You can, instead, maybe
get a much clearer picture

00:03:48.303 --> 00:03:50.068
of what Lincoln was really thinking

00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:52.590
by reading his own words.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.783
- [Voiceover] So, trust secondary sources

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:55.884
about as far as you can throw them?

00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:57.370
- [Voiceover] Well,
maybe trust all sources

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.809
about as far as you can throw them, right,

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:03.200
because everyone at every time

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.370
has their own perspective.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.909
And so, the ideas of someone
who lived in the 19th century

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.790
are gonna be different than the ideas

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.880
of someone who lives now,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.411
and you only know as much
as you can know, right?

00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:20.544
You're only as informed as
the information that you have.

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:24.027
So, you really have to take
everything with a grain of salt

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:26.720
and compare it with other
sources from its time period,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.903
and other sources later on, to get a sense

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:31.283
of what's important.

00:04:31.283 --> 00:04:32.851
- [Voiceover] So you're
saying that you might have

00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.766
a different perspective on Lincoln

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:36.647
than another Lincoln scholar, but

00:04:36.647 --> 00:04:39.480
that Lincoln's writings,
themselves, also contain

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.487
Lincoln's own biases from his lifetime.

00:04:42.487 --> 00:04:43.009
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.407
- [Voiceover] Okay, so what are we doing

00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:47.003
with Roosevelt's Inaugural Address, here?

00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:47.421
- [Voiceover] All right.

00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:51.112
So, let's take a look at
this Inaugural Address

00:04:51.112 --> 00:04:53.447
as though we're historians, right?

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:58.326
We're gonna sit down and
really get into the...

00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:00.180
- [Voiceover] The feeling
of the Great Depression?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.131
(laughter)

00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:02.886
All right.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.047
- [Voiceover] We're gonna get depressed.

00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:04.964
- [Voiceover] All right, I'm ready.

00:05:04.964 --> 00:05:07.820
So we've determined that
because he was there

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.840
and because this is a
speech delivered by him,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.185
that this speech of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:13.509
is a primary source.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.088
- [Voiceover] Right, and
it's a great way to look

00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:16.446
at the Great Depression, right?

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:18.942
If we want to know what
people are thinking about,

00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:21.264
it's very important to
see what the President

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:24.910
of the United States has to
say when he's been elected.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.185
So David, I know that you've
been dying to read this

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.959
in your terrific impression of Roosevelt,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.305
so I'm gonna turn it over
to you to get a sense

00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:34.151
of what Roosevelt has to say.

00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:35.904
- [Voiceover] Okay, I'm gonna
scoot back from the mike.

00:05:35.904 --> 00:05:38.342
"I am certain that my
fellow Americans expect

00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:40.740
"that on my induction into the Presidency

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.149
"I will address them with
a candor and a decision

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:46.040
"which the present situation
of our people impel.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.162
"This is preeminently the
time to speak the truth,

00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:50.707
"the whole truth, frankly and boldly.

00:05:50.707 --> 00:05:53.087
"Nor need we shrink from
honestly facing conditions

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:54.689
"in our country today.

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.428
"This great Nation will
endure as it has endured,

00:05:57.428 --> 00:05:59.705
"will revive and will prosper.

00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:02.271
"So, first of all, let
me assert my firm belief

00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:06.102
"that the only thing we have
to fear is fear itself -

00:06:06.102 --> 00:06:09.805
"nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror

00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:11.442
"which paralyzes needed efforts

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:13.962
"to convert retreat into advance."

00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:15.785
- [Voiceover] That was
beautiful (laughter).

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:17.584
Thank you so much.

00:06:17.584 --> 00:06:18.258
- [Voiceover] You're welcome.

00:06:18.258 --> 00:06:18.850
- [Voiceover] All right.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.031
So how do we analyze
this as a primary source

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:23.491
and as a speech.

00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:25.356
And I think the first thing we want to do,

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:30.085
step one if you will, is just
identify what's going on, and

00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:32.834
thankfully, that's pretty
easy for us, right now.

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.774
- [Voiceover] Right, this is a
speech given by the President

00:06:35.774 --> 00:06:37.504
of the United States in the moment

00:06:37.504 --> 00:06:39.164
that he becomes President.

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:42.113
- [Voiceover] Right,
so we know when it was,

00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:45.260
in March 4th, 1933.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.039
We know who gave this speech,

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.150
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.592
just about to be inducted as President.

00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:55.514
We know why he gave it,
right, very important

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:58.509
for Presidents when they take office

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.831
to make an Inaugural Address.

00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.735
So, we've got some basics here.

00:07:02.735 --> 00:07:05.893
We can even infer from
the Inaugural Address

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:09.578
where this was given,
right, in Washington D.C.

00:07:13.668 --> 00:07:15.739
All right so in our identification,

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:18.746
we've got that it's a
speech, it's in D.C.,

00:07:18.746 --> 00:07:22.438
happened in 1933, by FDR.

00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:25.416
So that's our identification stage.

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:31.087
So to get at a little
deeper level for this,

00:07:31.087 --> 00:07:33.862
let's move on to a second step

00:07:33.862 --> 00:07:36.885
which would be, kind
of giving some context.

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:41.533
So it's 1933. What's going on?

00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:42.314
- [Voiceover] Let's see.

00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:46.609
So, the Great Depression has
been going on for four years.

00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:47.654
- [Voiceover] Uh-hmm.

00:07:47.654 --> 00:07:49.872
- [Voiceover] Prohibition
has not ended yet, right?

00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:50.514
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:07:50.514 --> 00:07:51.753
- [Voiceover] Repeal has not come,

00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:54.671
so liquor is still illegal
in the United States,

00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:58.092
for sale and transport.

00:07:58.092 --> 00:07:59.717
There's massive unemployment.

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:01.331
The Dust Bowl is still raging.

00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:03.990
America is not in the greatest place!

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.778
- [Voiceover] No, it's a depression,

00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:09.214
and it's a depression in
all sorts of ways, right.

00:08:09.214 --> 00:08:11.130
People are emotionally depressed

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.312
and there's an economic depression.

00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:15.158
All right, so we've got
the general gist now

00:08:15.158 --> 00:08:18.406
that this is a speech from 1933

00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:20.194
confronting the Great Depression.

00:08:20.194 --> 00:08:22.632
So let's get into a little
bit more of the specifics.

00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:26.403
What is he actually talking
about in this speech?

00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:28.553
- [Voiceover] Well, if
you look at this speech,

00:08:28.553 --> 00:08:32.593
you can kind of see
that he's acknowledging

00:08:32.593 --> 00:08:34.114
that things are bad.

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:34.666
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:37.446
- [Voiceover] Right. It's
time to speak the truth.

00:08:37.446 --> 00:08:39.292
So he keeps talking about how, you know,

00:08:39.292 --> 00:08:40.268
"It's time to speak the truth.

00:08:40.268 --> 00:08:42.532
"We'll address the American
people with candor.

00:08:42.532 --> 00:08:44.215
"It is time to speak the
truth, the whole truth,

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:45.852
"frankly and boldly.

00:08:45.852 --> 00:08:48.789
"We will not shrink from
honestly facing conditions

00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:50.552
"in the country today."

00:08:50.552 --> 00:08:53.445
So Roosevelt is really
priming everyone to say,

00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:56.452
"Like okay, you have
not been told the truth

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:59.053
"from your head of government
for the longest time,

00:08:59.053 --> 00:09:01.212
"and now it's time to deal frankly

00:09:01.212 --> 00:09:03.673
"with just how bad things have gotten."

00:09:03.673 --> 00:09:05.784
And what's interesting, is that he says,

00:09:05.784 --> 00:09:09.513
"Things are not, you know, great,

00:09:09.513 --> 00:09:13.379
"but in every dark hour
of our National life

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:15.295
"a leadership of frankness
and vigor has met

00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:16.688
"with that understanding and support

00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:19.254
"of the people themselves
which is essential to victory."

00:09:19.254 --> 00:09:22.249
And he's saying that
there's no need to be afraid

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:25.616
of anything except just malaise.

00:09:25.616 --> 00:09:28.194
He's saying that Americans
need to meet the problem

00:09:28.194 --> 00:09:32.858
of the depression with like an
up-welling of national will.

00:09:32.858 --> 00:09:35.218
- [Voiceover] Right, and I
think, you know, it's nice

00:09:35.218 --> 00:09:38.225
that he's saying, "Look, I'm
gonna tell it like it is.

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:39.142
"Things are bad.

00:09:39.142 --> 00:09:40.999
"I recognize that things are bad."

00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:42.323
And that's pretty important,

00:09:42.323 --> 00:09:45.957
because up until this point,
Herbert Hoover hadn't really

00:09:45.957 --> 00:09:48.024
done much to recognize
that things were bad.

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:51.158
You know, he saw that people
were suffering, and, yet,

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.155
he said this is not
necessarily the responsibility

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:55.477
of government to deal with this crisis.

00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:57.462
- [Voiceover] So Roosevelt,
actually, calls it,

00:09:57.462 --> 00:09:59.680
"a dark hour of our National life."

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.479
Right, like this is an acknowledging

00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:04.161
that things are not great is
a big part of this speech.

00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:05.914
But he's also saying
that it's possible for us

00:10:05.914 --> 00:10:08.963
to bounce back if we are
honest about the problems,

00:10:08.963 --> 00:10:10.837
and we address it with vigor,

00:10:10.837 --> 00:10:13.356
and that is kind of the New Deal, right,

00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:14.959
is addressing the problems honestly

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:17.304
and with national exuberance.

00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:18.225
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and I think

00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:21.210
this is such a fascinating speech

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.199
because, for one thing,
this phrase has kind of come

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:27.544
into our national lexicon, right.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:30.353
"There's nothing to fear but fear itself,"

00:10:30.353 --> 00:10:31.874
which is kind of strange.

00:10:31.874 --> 00:10:33.059
It's one of those things,

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:34.742
like "Have your cake and eat it too."

00:10:34.742 --> 00:10:37.343
That you're like, "Wait
how is that possible?"

00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:39.569
So, what does he mean by,

00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:43.148
"The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself."

00:10:43.148 --> 00:10:43.763
- [Voiceover] I think he's saying

00:10:43.763 --> 00:10:45.806
that this is no time to panic,

00:10:45.806 --> 00:10:47.618
and that the only thing
that we should be afraid of

00:10:47.618 --> 00:10:50.299
is unreasoning terror.

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:51.507
We shouldn't be running
around like chickens

00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:53.318
with our heads cut off.

00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:55.512
Right, like this is the time to stand firm

00:10:55.512 --> 00:10:58.972
against nameless terror and
focus on making the problems

00:10:58.972 --> 00:11:01.145
that we are facing into small,

00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:03.581
like accessible, combatable chunks.

00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:05.239
- [Voiceover] I think that
another thing that's important

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.702
about what he's saying there is

00:11:06.702 --> 00:11:10.952
that the Great Depression
is caused by something

00:11:10.952 --> 00:11:14.141
that is very new in American culture,

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:15.981
which is the stock market.

00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:18.592
And the stock market
doesn't play by the rules

00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:21.124
of straight supply and demand.

00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:23.237
Instead, they play on confidence.

00:11:23.237 --> 00:11:26.581
And so, the reason that
the stock market crash

00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:31.399
of 1929 happens is because
people stopped having confidence

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:34.905
that stocks are worth as
much as the stock market

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:35.706
says they are.

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:37.618
So, everyone pulls out.

00:11:37.618 --> 00:11:40.048
There's a panic, and global banking

00:11:40.048 --> 00:11:41.999
pretty much collapses.

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:44.704
And that's a really hard
thing to deal with, right?

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.883
I mean it's not like
you're taking your money

00:11:48.883 --> 00:11:51.556
out of the bank or me taking
my money out of the bank

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:55.617
at any one time could cause
an international depression.

00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:56.058
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:11:56.058 --> 00:11:58.659
- [Voiceover] But when
there is a large group

00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:01.062
of people who all get
panicked at the same time

00:12:01.062 --> 00:12:02.606
and take their money out of the banks,

00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:03.883
the banks fail.

00:12:03.883 --> 00:12:05.579
- [Voiceover] Right, and so
what I think Roosevelt is saying

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:09.062
is that we cannot allow
a sweeping wave of panic

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.868
to come over the nation again.

00:12:10.868 --> 00:12:11.906
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:14.263
- [Voiceover] So, that's
the context for this speech

00:12:14.263 --> 00:12:15.702
is things are bad.

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:17.920
The reason things are bad
is because of this wave

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.287
of nameless, unreasoning,
unjustified terror,

00:12:21.287 --> 00:12:23.562
and "America, I need your support

00:12:23.562 --> 00:12:25.583
"to make sure we don't
let that happen again,

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.904
"so we can turn this
retreat into an advance."

00:12:27.904 --> 00:12:29.565
- [Voiceover] In our
next video, we'll go more

00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:32.467
into how we can analyze this source

00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:34.974
and use it to construct
an argument of our own.
