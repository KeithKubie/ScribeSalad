My name is Jean-Pierre Lehman. I am concerned
with International political economy. I am

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:17.880
the business school in Switzerland. My nationality
is French. I think that the question, or the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.189
opposite question depends on how long the
prices [inaudible]. In other words I think

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:33.110
that the due critical situation in East Asia
is fragile as we know it[inaudible], but really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.430
by and large over the course of the last two
decades it has been managed reasonably well.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.760
With things, for example, Taiwan, China, different
things about disputes of the South China Sea.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.829
The exception of course is North Korea where
there have been; we've maybe seen this scenario

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.950
evolving which might indicate the demise of
that particular regime. However if the crisis

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.050
persists particularly at the very high level
of unemployment, then I think we could be

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.579
talking about [inaudible] and political risks
of a considerable vantage.
