00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
 Dreams are an amazing phenomenon, and taking into consideration that you spend nearly 6 years of your life dreaming, 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.880
 It is strange that we often ignore our dreams and forget them quickly. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.220
 Night after night our brains continue to work and bring us some of the most unusual and often dreamy dreams 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000
 Random images and plot. But, what are dreams? 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 Like many science fiction stories or films, will we ever be able to record and know what we are seeing when we dream? 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.520
 You may have heard people talking about "brain waves" before, but you stopped to think 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.840
 What if these waves are actual? And whether they carry information? 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.000
 Are brain waves similar to radio waves? The answer is yes. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.820
 Both brain waves and radio are forms of electromagnetic radiation, waves are transmitted at light speed. 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.700
 Every time you think, thousands of neurons work on the same frequency and generate a wave. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.280
 These waves fluctuate at about 10-100 cycles per second. 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.220
 Radio waves on the other hand fluctuate in all parts 50, 000, 000-1000,000 times per second. 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.800
 Scientists have long used this phenomenon to measure brain activity and connect the brain to electronic devices. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.600
 It allows us to know which parts of the brain are active for different activities, and likewise 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 Any parts of the brain are activated during the dream. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.240
 What we are saying now may seem strange, but we still barely understand why we sleep, not to mention why we dream. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.420
 Michael from the VSauce channel does a great job explaining the key theories of what we dream of. 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.040
 But there are many theories, because we can not really measure or know what people are dreaming without awakening and asking. 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.480
 Of course, their answers are subject to forgetfulness or mistakes. Unfortunately no existing device is allowed 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.880
 We can sneak into the dreamer's mind, or there? 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.300
 Despite the madness of what we say, scientists have devised a technique to do so. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.840
 This technology begins by reading the mind by scanning through the MRI, inside which simple images are displayed 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.020
 It is composed of black and white pixels. The program then finds patterns of brain activity that corresponds to certain images. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.060
 For example, if the letter "T" is displayed, the program will record exactly how the brain reacted. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.920
 After enough data, completely different images were displayed, and then the program expected and recreated what people believed to be seeing 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 After the word "neurons" was displayed, the program created these images. 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.580
 But it does not stop there, I started more studies using more complex images and started monitoring people during their sleep. 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.420
 In this case, they first had to leave people in the MRI machine, which would awaken them in the middle of the dream, 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.320
 And ask them quickly what they dreamed of. 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.120
 Then they used thousands of images from the Internet to get the best approximation of what people saw based on a scan of their brain 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.780
 After doing this for nearly 200 times with each person and entering the information into a learning algorithm, a program was used to predict and interpret their future dreams. 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.080
 Although not ideal, it was clear that machine expectations were the best chance, to match the description of the dreamer. 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 Perhaps the most shocking is the study in which actual video footage was used. 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.580
 After viewing two hours of film footage on people and analyzing brain activity, then a library of 18 million YouTube clips was used to match brain activity. 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.760
 Here are the results. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.140
 On the left there are new clips that have nothing to do with the above, presented to people later, 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.840
 On the right, people guessed they were watching him using M-mix YouTube clips as his relatives 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.520
 All this based on brain waves! 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.840
 As these programs become more and more complex, they will become closer to reality and capture our thoughts and dreams. 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.960
 At this point, we may find some evidence to explain why we dream in the first place.
