00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.430
At the turn of the 13th century, Eustace Busket
fought, raided, killed, embezzled, betrayed,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.590
revenged, impersonated and prayed his way
across France, Spain and England.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
Although better known as Eustace the Monk,
this younger son of a county lord spent little

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.630
time in a monastery, choosing instead to live
the life of a steward, mercenary and pirate.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.980
Born in 1170 near Boulogne, France, Eustace’s
story really begins in Toledo, Spain where

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.110
he is rumored to have studied black magic
and, according to the contemporary work Histoire

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.940
des Ducs de Normandie, “No one would believe
the marvels he accomplished, nor those which

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.230
happened to him many times.”

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.969
Ultimately giving up his parlor tricks, he
soon decided to join the Benedictine monastery

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.330
at St. Samer Abbey (near Calais).

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.180
At some point around 1190, Eustace’s father
was murdered, and Eustace left the Benedictines

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.789
to seek revenge against Hainfrois de Heresinghen,
the supposed killer.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.739
Agreeing to duel through surrogates, Heresinghen’s
champion won, and, thus, the trial by combat

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500
acquitted Heresinghen of the charges.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.509
With his failed revenge, and now preferring
life outside of the monastery, Eustace next

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.979
went to work for Count Renaud de Dammartin
of Boulogne as his seneschal (steward), peer

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:15.979
and bailiff.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.029
Most important for the future life of Eustace,
his duties included oversight of the Count’s

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:21.029
property.

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:25.209
After Heresinghen instituted a plot to discredit
him, the Count asked for an accounting and

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.259
Eustace fled into the Forest of Boulonnais,
circa 1204.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.750
Taking his flight as a sign of guilt, the
Count seized Eustace’s property and burned

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.750
his land.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.619
Not one to take such a slight lying down,
Eustace then launched a series of raids against

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.249
the Count’s property, including burning
down two mills that the Count had recently

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:43.249
built.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.179
Whether or not he was really guilty of embezzling,
as the Count came to believe, after destroying

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.659
the Count’s property, he was officially
an outlaw, and one with a very powerful enemy.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.429
Having at this point been a supposed sorcerer,
a monk, and an administrator, Eustace decided

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.819
to take up a new career- piracy.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.859
Sailing in the English Channel and the Strait
of Dover, Eustace sometimes worked for himself

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.770
and at other times as a mercenary between
1205 and 1212.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.569
Making something of a name for himself, together
with his brothers, Eustace ultimately commanded

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.239
as many as 30 ships under the flag of King
John of England.

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.680
Raiding along the coast of Normandy and the
Channel Islands, he and his brothers established

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.210
several bases on the islands, including the
Castle Cornet in Guernsey.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.040
Not satisfied with the tremendous spoils he’d
accumulated thus far, around 1212, Eustace

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.239
began playing both sides, raiding along the
English coast as well; at this same time,

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.290
the Count de Dammartin struck an alliance
with King John.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.909
Officially switching sides at this point,
Eustace took his skills back to France, where

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.689
he found work with Prince Louis.

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.810
Together, they supported the English rebellion
in 1215-1216 (when King John refused to honor

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.439
the negotiations that culminated in the Magna
Carta) with the idea that Louis would eventually

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.010
take the English throne.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.540
King John died, however, and with the rise
of Henry III, the rebellion lost support.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.930
Undeterred, in August 1217, France sent its
fleet across the Channel, led by Robert de

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.079
Courtenai with Eustace as admiral of its 70-plus
ships, some of which were heavily overloaded,

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.239
bearing weapons, men and horses.

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.359
The English were prepared and met the French
fleet at Sandwich.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.689
Seizing control of the fleet from Eustace,
de Courtenai ordered the ships into an ill-advised

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.719
attack; losing the wind, the French fleet
suffered serious losses, due in no small part

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.620
to the English releasing lime into the wind,
which blinded the French troops.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.780
Eventually, de Courtenai and the knights were
taken for ransom, and the regular soldiers

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.280
were slaughtered.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.969
As for Eustace, he was found hiding in the
bilge of his ship.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.900
As with the other notables captured in the
battle, he offered to pay a fortune in ransom

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.720
for his release, but the irritated English,
whom Eustace had betrayed only a few years

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.540
before, decided not to take the money in his
case.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.220
Instead, they tied him down and had a man
by the name of Stephen Crabbe lop off his

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.220
head.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.499
In the (largely fictional) 1284 work covering
Eustace’ life, The Romance of Eustace the

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.799
Monk, it concluded of his death (translated),
“No man can live long who spends his days

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:00.799
doing ill.”

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.120
In the aftermath, Louis ultimately relinquished
his claim to the throne of England, and Eustace’s

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:32.280
brothers were dispossessed of their Channel
Islands lands.
