00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.230
If you are the person who has
to champion cyber security and

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.650
get the company to a proactive
cyber security posture,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.220
how do you make your case?

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.250
You're champion, it's your job to
be as well prepared as possible

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.470
given the cost benefits and
risk tolerance and so on.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.470
What are the kind of
arguments you can make?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.820
The easiest argument to make is
the bottom line argument, or

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.540
the economic argument that
it's going to save us money.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.380
Of course security doesn't make money.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.050
Security we would say it's a cost.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.150
It doesn't bring money in, but
we could lose money because of that.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.020
The economic argument we can make is,
the return on investment argument, or

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.260
the ROI argument.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.870
Saying, if you don't do this,
we're going to lose $10 million.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.140
If you do this, it's only going to cost
us 1 million and we save 5 million and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.010
the losses we're going to suffer
are going to be reduced by half.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.010
Then of course it's
an investment you make,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.090
you're putting out one million but
you're saving five million.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.780
So that is a pretty good return
on investment that we have.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.920
So the economic argument of course
makes sense when you say that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.238
by coming up with a budget
to put a control in place.

00:01:13.238 --> 00:01:17.210
The cost of that we're going to
have Is going to result in savings

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.020
that are much greater than the cost.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.810
Significant savings
greater than the cost, so

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.220
there is in a way a return
on the investment.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.940
This is money we're going to lose
that we're not going to lose now.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.380
And that's how our bottom line is
going to be in a better state.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.480
Of course this does require that you
estimate the cost benefits that we're

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.130
talking about, and unfortunately,
it's pretty tricky.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.090
Cost and benefits,
either you can exactly quantify them, so

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.536
that would be data driven,
or its perception.

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:50.960
So with perception it's sort of what
they perceived to be the risk, and what

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.200
they perceived the risk reduction, maybe
if we do A or B, or something like that.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.430
Versus sort of actually knowing
those probabilities and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.650
those impact numbers that
you are talking about.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.800
So you're going to make an argument.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.080
This is all fine and good, but
a lot of times it comes to perception,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.940
and then people would say,
well, this is their opinion.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.940
How do you know for sure?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.252
Do you have some hard numbers?

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:15.610
And unfortunately, making this
argument is difficult because

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.590
a lot of times those hard
numbers are not easy to come by.
