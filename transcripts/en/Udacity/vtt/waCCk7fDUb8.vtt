00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.060
Ultimately, behavior is about how
a device responds to these events.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.950
To model this, we need to
understand what those events are.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.850
For the next step in the state
chart modeling process,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.059
we will look at how to determine,
for each of the external controls,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.390
what stimuli or
events they can provide to the device.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.990
Using the use cases we
have developed earlier,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.280
why don't you begin to make a list of
the user actions that might generate

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.400
events that we would expect
the radio to respond to.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.610
And as a hint, go back and
look at the picture, and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.790
use it to find each of the ways
that user can affect its behavior.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.970
the first is that the user can
switch the mode button, and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.280
that's going to change our
state machine based on, we have

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.380
to look at what mode we're coming out of
to determine what mode we're going into?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.030
&gt;&gt; So what is the event?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270
What is it that the user does?

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.040
&gt;&gt; It's just clicking
that little knob over.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.330
&gt;&gt; So, sliding the thing?

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.590
And, there's really two events here.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.560
There's one is pushing it to the right,
and one is pushing it to the left.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.290
&gt;&gt; Okay?
And, as a programmer,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.642
if you were eventually
doing an implementation for

00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:15.770
this thing, you would have
to deal with both of those.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.480
And you want to deal with
them separately, right?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.140
You have to know.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.970
Now we could model those as two separate
events, or we could model them as one

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.950
event, maybe called slide, and have a
parameter to it that says left or right.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.870
What else?

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.250
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
we can also turn our tuning dial.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.480
&gt;&gt; Okay.
And here again,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.180
we might want to have a parameter which
indicates the rotational angle or

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.830
something that indicates the information

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.940
that is being communicated from
the dial to the system, that's actually

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.410
going to change the vertical bar and
the actual tuning behavior of the radio.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.400
Okay.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.870
Another one is flipping our switch for
the AM or FM.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.971
&gt;&gt; And, once again,
that's a left-right thing.

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.100
Okay?
&gt;&gt; I guess, is it not toggle, though?

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.940
It seems like since we just have two
options, kind of like toggling between,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.590
do we need a-
&gt;&gt; Well, this particular clock radio

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.230
that I modeled, that's on the picture
there, is a slide switch left and right.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.610
And then I have pressing
the snooze button, but

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.360
I felt like it might need to be split,
because you could press the snooze

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.790
button while it's beeping, like kind
of the intended use case for that.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.660
But you could also press
the snooze button when

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.550
It's just sitting there on accident or
something,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.810
or you just fumble-
&gt;&gt; Okay, so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.040
let's think about this a second.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.730
As far as the user is concerned,
the event is pressing the button.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.610
What's in the user's head
is irrelevant here, okay?

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.050
At least as far as our initial
approximation of things.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.650
Certainly, we want to consider the
possibility of what it means if the user

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.838
presses the snooze button when
the alarm is not going off.

00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:06.590
And presumably, our resultant
state chart will describe for

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.710
us what behavior will happen.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.950
This is one of the real reasons
we want to do this sort of thing,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.790
is to come up with insights about,
well, I haven't thought about that yet.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.360
And I need to take care of it.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.910
We certainly don't want
the radio to go off

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.950
when it's not playing,
just because we hit the snooze button.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.230
What else you have?

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.850
&gt;&gt; So, this is kind of
like three parts to this,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.530
but when you press the wake button and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.180
then press either the hour or minute
button, and then that's going to affect.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.290
&gt;&gt; So is that one event or two?

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.165
&gt;&gt; I think the first event, there's
one event of pressing the wake button,

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:55.560
because that's going to
affect our different systems,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.400
like displays is now going to
have to display our wake time.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.410
So that's a separate event, and
then there's a conjoined event when you

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.198
press the wake button, and then you
press either the hour or minute buttons.

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:11.010
Now you're going to be
adjusting the display time,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.060
so that's switching modes from your
display to wake, for instance.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.709
And then you have this separate case for
actually changing the time.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So, we want to be clear about this,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.910
because this one of the different
ways that state chart modeling

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.970
forces us to think about things.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.920
As far as the user events are concerned,
they're separate.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.065
Okay, so, there's an event of
pressing that wake button and

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:39.600
releasing that wake button.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.870
So another event here is release.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.350
Pressing the wake button.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.230
And then, there's a separate thing
going on, pressing the hour button.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.840
The order in which those
happen is very important.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.310
If you press the hour button first,
it's going to change the time of day.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.870
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.255
&gt;&gt; Okay, if you press the wake button
first, then press the hour button,

00:04:58.255 --> 00:04:59.990
it's going to change when you wake up.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.570
So its important that the state chart
that we end up with reflects that

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.980
difference, because the user intends
them to be used differently.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.930
The event is pressing the wake button,
the event is releasing the wake button.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.510
Another event is pressing the hour
button and pressing the minute button.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.810
And our machine, as we eventually refine
it to deal with all these contingencies,

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.611
had better behave in an expected way
as far as all of the precepts in all

00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:32.220
of those possibilities,
all of those possible situations.
