00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.600
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm here at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco with Sam Black. So, Sam,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.750
well, first of all, tell us about your background.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.922
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I have bachelors' degrees in electrical engineering and computer

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:13.302
engineering from University of Michigan, and a master's in computer science

00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:17.974
from University of North Carolina. I've worked in various parts of the graphics

00:00:17.974 --> 00:00:21.569
industry. I started out in workstation graphics, working on the first

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.624
commercially available X server. Then I went to work in the games industry for

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.512
a little while. Came out to California, worked for Pixar for eight years, and

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:31.240
then came to AutoDesk.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.791
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So you've really gone through what I consider sort of three pillars of the the

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:40.497
graphics industry, which is film, games, and and computer-aided design. tell me

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:44.350
a little bit about like, well, you know, what are the pluses and minuses of

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.392
each?

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:48.857
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, they're all, a lot of, they have a lot of similarities amongst them and

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:52.157
so, it's really the sort of the end product that you're looking at that's

00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:57.280
different. And everyone thinks it's the games are, or how much fun to work on

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.520
but in a way they're almost the hardest because they tend to have the most

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.819
compressed schedules. Although the film industry has tight schedules, but the

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:10.244
project that I was working on tended to be a little more open-ended. I was

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:13.610
working on the RenderMan product and some advanced rendering techniques, so I

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.930
wasn't tied directly to a film, to a release. So, I didn't feel all the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.115
pressure that.

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:19.470
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.339
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You normally feel in those things. And then coming here to, to AutoDesk,

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:27.233
working on AutoCad, again very similar, si-, working in the graphics field and

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:31.900
it's just a lot of, you know, getting the, the right visuals out there with the

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.362
right performance.
