00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:02.598
-Let's now attempt to find a solution for

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:06.666
the logistic differential equation.

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.790
And we already found
some constant solutions,

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.424
we can think through
that a little bit just

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:14.674
as a little bit of review
from the last few videos.

00:00:14.674 --> 00:00:17.052
So if this is the t-axis
and this is the N-axis

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:20.067
we already saw that if N
of zero, if a time equals

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.673
zero, or a population
is zero, there is no one

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:24.888
to reproduce and this
differential equation is

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:27.367
consistent with that, because
if N is zero, this thing

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.581
is going to be zero, and
so our rate of change

00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:31.399
is going to be zero with respect to time,

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.212
so our population just won't change.

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:34.378
It'll just stay at zero.

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:35.797
Which is nice because that's what would

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:38.065
actually happen in a real population.

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:40.863
That gives us the constant solution that N

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:42.491
of t is equal to zero, that's one solution

00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:44.940
of this differential equation,
not that interesting.

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.159
A zero population will
never grow or change.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.000
The other constant solution is what if our

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.377
population started at the maximum of what

00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:56.635
the environment could sustain, and in that

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:58.798
situation this term is
going to be K over K,

00:00:58.798 --> 00:00:59.615
which is one.

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:01.753
One minus one is zero,
and so in there, the

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:03.071
population would also not change.

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.949
It would just stay at K,
and so the rate of change

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.048
would just stay at zero.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.046
So that's another constant solution, that

00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:14.046
we start at the maximum
population and then

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.217
this differential equation tells us

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:18.554
a scenario that never changes.

00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:19.630
But we said, hey look,
there could be something

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:23.718
interesting that happens
if our initial condition,

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:27.396
which we called N sub-not,
that's our N of zero.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:29.391
Time equals zero if we
started someplace in between,

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:33.290
maybe closer, much below
our eventual ceiling

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:34.925
I guess, because if we're a lot below our

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:37.112
eventual ceiling this thing is going to be

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:38.800
a small fraction, this
thing is going to be

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.059
close to one, and so the
rate of change is going

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.189
to be pretty close to
being proportional to N.

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:47.481
When we're thinking that,
it might look something

00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:51.767
like that, as N increases,
our rate of change

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:54.811
increases, but then as N
approaches K this thing

00:01:55.207 --> 00:01:56.621
is going to approach
one, this thing is going

00:01:56.621 --> 00:01:58.936
to approach zero, and so
it's going to overwhelm

00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:01.349
this and our rate of change is going

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:02.653
to approach zero.

00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:04.307
So we can imagine a scenario where we

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:08.562
asymptote towards K.

00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:13.447
Let's see if we can
solve this to find this,

00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:18.203
this N of t to find the actual analytic

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:20.115
expression for this N
of t right over here.

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.258
Because this is interesting,
this is what could

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:25.223
be used to model populations that would be

00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:28.297
more consistent with a Malthusian mindset.

00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:30.229
So let's see if we can do that.

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:31.573
To do that we just have
to realize this is a

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:35.545
separable differential equation, and we're

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.170
assuming is a function
of d, we're going to

00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:40.394
solve for an N of t that satisfies this.

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:42.531
So we just have to separate
it from the explicit

00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.173
ts, but there are no explicit ts here, so

00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:46.468
it's quite easy to do.

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:48.670
So what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.968
this part right over here,
and I'm going to divide

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.800
both sides by that.

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:53.540
I'm going to leave the r
on the right hand side,

00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:56.744
it'll make things, I
think, a little bit easier

00:02:56.744 --> 00:02:58.997
as we try to solve for N of t.

00:02:58.997 --> 00:02:59.931
So let me just do that.

00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:04.931
So this is going to be equal to one over N

00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:10.250
times one minus N over K.

00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:15.025
One minus N over K
times dN dT, times dN dT

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:23.162
is equal to r.

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:29.044
Another way we could think about it, well

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:31.891
actually, let me just continue
to tackle it this way.

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.465
So we get that, and now
what I want to do is

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:36.208
take the anti-derivative
of both sides with

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:38.283
respect to t.

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.515
Well, this is pretty straightforward.

00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:42.752
That's just going to be
rt times some constant,

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:43.758
but what's this going to be?

00:03:43.812 --> 00:03:45.305
This is kind of this messy thing.

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:47.090
And maybe if we could
break this out, if we

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.502
can expand this into two
fractions, do a little

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:51.641
bit of partial fraction expansion, maybe

00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.126
we can come up with an expression that's

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:57.875
a little bit easier to find
the anti-derivative of.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:59.599
I'm hoping that I can find an A and a B

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.599
where A over N plus B
over one minus N over K

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.124
is equal to this business.

00:04:11.124 --> 00:04:16.124
Is equal to one over N
times one minus N over k.

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:18.545
Let's see if we can find an A and a B.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:20.122
This is just partial
fraction expansion, if this

00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:21.997
looks unfamiliar to you I encourage you to

00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:24.004
review that part on Khan Academy.

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:25.737
Do a search for partial fraction expansion

00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:27.628
on Khan Academy.

00:04:27.628 --> 00:04:28.682
So how do we do it?

00:04:28.682 --> 00:04:30.584
We'll just add these two right over here.

00:04:31.508 --> 00:04:33.419
If we take the sum,
right over here, this is

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.419
going to be A times this, which is A minus

00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:43.647
A over K N plus B times
this, plus BN, over

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.803
the product of these two.

00:04:47.803 --> 00:04:50.261
So it's just going to be N times one

00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:52.404
minus N over k.

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:53.930
One way to think about
it, I just multiplied

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:55.371
the numerator and the
denominator of this one

00:04:56.208 --> 00:05:00.666
by one minus N over k,
so A times one minus

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:02.893
N over k is that, and times one minus N

00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:04.834
over k is that, and I
multiplied the numerator

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:06.902
and the denominator of this both by N, BN

00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:09.551
and N times that, and then I added the two

00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:11.333
now that I had the same denominator.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.137
So that's just adding fractions

00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:14.553
with unlike denominators.

00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:16.776
It's going to be equal to this, one over

00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:21.485
N times one minus N over K.

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:23.808
Now we can try to think about what is

00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:25.014
A and B going to be equal to?

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:26.790
What can they be equal to?

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.407
Well I have a constant term here.

00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:29.249
I don't have any N term here.

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.361
I could say that maybe I have a zero times

00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:34.092
an N, and that actually
helps things a little bit,

00:05:34.092 --> 00:05:37.301
because maybe we could
say that this thing,

00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:40.535
that this plus this,
which are the coefficients

00:05:40.553 --> 00:05:44.889
on N, are going to sum
up to zero, and that

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.951
this, which is rA, is
going to be equal to one.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:50.356
That's pretty nice.

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.818
So we can say that A is equal to one, A is

00:05:53.818 --> 00:05:56.514
equal to one, and that
if A is equal to one

00:05:56.514 --> 00:06:01.514
we have negative one over
K, negative one over K,

00:06:03.045 --> 00:06:06.966
plus B is equal to zero.

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.280
Well what's B going to be?

00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:14.028
Well B would be equal to one over K.

00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:19.020
So we can re-write this
as, we can re-write it

00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:24.002
as one over N plus one over K,

00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:37.373
plus one over K over,

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:42.523
let me just do this,

00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:46.432
over one minus N over K,

00:06:50.957 --> 00:06:55.957
and then times dN dt, dn dt

00:07:00.164 --> 00:07:04.156
is equal to r.

00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:06.658
So I just did a little
partial fraction expansion,

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.024
and I like giving myself a little bit of

00:07:08.024 --> 00:07:09.102
real estate, let me clear this out.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:12.175
You can rewind the video and review that,

00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:14.213
if you find it necessary,

00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:16.156
so let's do that.

00:07:16.156 --> 00:07:17.455
So how does this help us?

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.447
Well, hey, you probably
might be recognizing

00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:21.855
the anti-derivative of
one over N, and you might

00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:22.868
even see this.

00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:25.045
So let's just think
through this a little bit.

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:26.871
We know the anti-derivative of one over N

00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.280
is a natural log, just did a new color,

00:07:29.028 --> 00:07:32.297
is a natural log of the
absolute value of N.

00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:34.374
We can see the derivative
of that with respect

00:07:34.374 --> 00:07:39.374
to N is equal to one
over N, and if we were

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.183
to find the derivative
of this with respect

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:45.490
to t, derivative with
respect to t of the natural

00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:49.341
log of the absolute
value of N is equal to,

00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:50.826
that's going to be the derivative of this

00:07:50.826 --> 00:07:53.607
with respect to N times
the derivative of N

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:57.975
with respect to t, times dN dt.

00:07:57.975 --> 00:07:59.294
We could do the same thing over here.

00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:03.405
Notice, I have an expression.

00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:05.214
What would be the derivative
of this expression

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:07.105
right over here?

00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:08.753
It would be negative one over K, if I'm

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.788
talking the derivative with respect to N,

00:08:10.788 --> 00:08:12.484
it would be negative one over K.

00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:13.881
I have a positive one
over K here, and I could

00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:15.378
even make it negative.

00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:19.219
I can turn this, I can
clear this out of the

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:22.444
way, instead of having a positive there I

00:08:22.444 --> 00:08:25.572
could have, I guess I could
say a double negative.

00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:28.270
So a double negative,
I haven't changed the

00:08:28.027 --> 00:08:30.581
value of if, and notice,
now this is the derivative

00:08:30.824 --> 00:08:34.077
of this, which makes it very
nice for u-substitution,

00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:36.837
or you might be already
used to doing this thing

00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:39.659
in your head, and so we
know that the derivative

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:40.813
with respect to N.

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.203
Let me write this in a new color.

00:08:43.203 --> 00:08:47.553
We know that the derivative
with respect to N of the

00:08:47.553 --> 00:08:52.553
natural log of one minus
N over K, once again this

00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:55.005
comes straight out of the chain rule, it's

00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:57.057
going to be the derivative
of this with respect

00:08:57.057 --> 00:09:00.532
to N, which is negative one over K times

00:09:00.532 --> 00:09:03.677
the derivative of this
whole thing with respect

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:07.435
to this thing, which is times one over

00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:10.758
one minus N over K, which is exactly what

00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:12.273
we have over here.

00:09:12.273 --> 00:09:13.404
But if I were to take
the derivative of this

00:09:13.404 --> 00:09:15.979
with respect to t, so the derivative with

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:19.981
respect to t of the
natural log of one minus

00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.033
N over K, it's going to be the derivative

00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:24.442
of this with respect to N, which is that,

00:09:24.442 --> 00:09:25.858
which is what we just found.

00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:27.863
It's going to be this.

00:09:27.927 --> 00:09:30.496
So copy and paste.

00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:33.679
It's going to be that,
it's going to be that.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.723
Times the derivative
of N with respect to t,

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:40.135
just straight out of
the chain rule, dN dt.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:43.392
Well notice, we have a
dN dt, we can multiply

00:09:43.392 --> 00:09:45.005
it times each of these things.

00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:46.376
Actually, why not, let's just do that

00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:49.431
just to make it clear, cause this really

00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:51.064
isn't so much differential equations,

00:09:51.064 --> 00:09:53.520
but sometimes some of the calculus that we

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:55.981
learned not too long ago, and even frankly

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:59.184
some of the algebra, it's
nice to not skip steps.

00:09:59.184 --> 00:10:02.388
So if I distribute this, edit, paste.

00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:05.704
Woops, I wanted to copy and paste.

00:10:06.413 --> 00:10:11.413
So, copy and paste, so
I have that, and then

00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:17.632
I have, I can copy and
paste, so that I'm just

00:10:22.085 --> 00:10:27.085
distributing this
business right over here.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.989
So I get that, now let me
clean it up a little bit.

00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:34.084
So I have that right
over here, and of course

00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:38.215
we have this being equal to r.

00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:40.327
If I take the anti-derivative
of this with respect

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:45.260
to t, well I'm just going to get this

00:10:55.519 --> 00:11:00.519
minus this right over that.

00:11:00.687 --> 00:11:01.421
So let's do that.

00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:03.530
Let's take the anti-derivative
with respect to t,

00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:05.458
so the left hand side I'm going to get the

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:09.244
natural log, the anti-derivative of that

00:11:09.244 --> 00:11:13.178
with respect to t is the natural log of

00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:17.936
the absolute value of N, and then minus

00:11:17.936 --> 00:11:21.153
the anti-derivative of
this with respect to t

00:11:21.153 --> 00:11:26.104
is the natural log of
the absolute value of

00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:31.104
one minus N over K is equal to,

00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:33.958
oh, and let's not forget we're going to

00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.216
have some constant here,
I want to find a pretty

00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:37.952
general solution, let's call it C one, is

00:11:37.952 --> 00:11:40.016
equal to the anti-derivative
of this with respect

00:11:40.592 --> 00:11:45.592
to t is r times t, maybe
plus some other constant,

00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:48.607
plus some other constant,

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.311
just like that.

00:11:50.467 --> 00:11:54.033
Now I'm going to assume
that my N of t meets

00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:56.686
this assumption right over here.

00:11:56.686 --> 00:11:59.400
So I'm going to assume,

00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:13.277
assume N of t is going to be less than K

00:12:13.394 --> 00:12:15.015
and greater than zero.

00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:17.564
That means that this thing,
this N is always going

00:12:17.564 --> 00:12:19.846
to be positive, and if N is always between

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:21.789
zero and K, that means that this thing is

00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:23.615
always going to be positive.

00:12:23.615 --> 00:12:25.884
So that helps me clear
things up a little bit.

00:12:25.884 --> 00:12:28.572
Actually let me do it in this color.

00:12:28.572 --> 00:12:30.686
That helps me get rid of that,

00:12:30.686 --> 00:12:35.300
helps me get rid of that.

00:12:35.003 --> 00:12:39.048
I can instead throw some parentheses here,

00:12:39.345 --> 00:12:43.958
and why don't I subtract
the C one from both sides.

00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.225
That would get rid of
it here, so edit, cut,

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.611
and paste, so I have the C one there.

00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:52.642
I know I'm overwriting my own work, which

00:12:52.642 --> 00:12:56.220
is not making it look
as clean as possible.

00:12:56.022 --> 00:12:58.438
I'm just trying to clean
it up a little bit.

00:12:58.636 --> 00:13:00.447
I have an arbitrary constant
that I haven't really

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.258
solved for yet minus another constant.

00:13:02.258 --> 00:13:03.906
Let me just call this some other constant,

00:13:03.906 --> 00:13:06.227
let me just call it a general C.

00:13:06.227 --> 00:13:11.227
So let me just call this C,

00:13:11.396 --> 00:13:16.396
so clear, and I'm just
going to call that C.

00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:19.786
I am just going to call that C.

00:13:19.786 --> 00:13:21.863
And I could even simplify
this a little bit,

00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:23.420
but actually I just realized I'm thirteen

00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:24.977
minutes into this video,
which is longer than

00:13:25.355 --> 00:13:25.452
I like to do.

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:27.763
So let's continue this in the next video.

00:13:27.763 --> 00:13:30.180
I was getting excited
because I'm so close.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.920
I'm so close to solving for an N of t

00:13:33.082 --> 00:13:35.416
that satisfies our logistic
differential equation.

00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:37.690
Very, very exciting.
