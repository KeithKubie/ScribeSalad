are wrong a lot of the time but I think

the first applications of nanotubes will
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.750
the first applications of nanotubes will
probably be encompass of materials where

control of size and structure will not
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.310
control of size and structure will not
be quite so important but for the

some breakthroughs if you've got very

some breakthroughs if you've got very
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099
some breakthroughs if you've got very
good controller structure and they're

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
good controller structure and they're
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.369
good controller structure and they're
all the same then you get a coordinated

all the same then you get a coordinated
 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.679

straws in the box and you open the box

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
straws in the box and you open the box
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.210
straws in the box and you open the box
up and you see that hexagonal packing of

up and you see that hexagonal packing of
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.800
up and you see that hexagonal packing of
the ends of the straw and you've put

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
the ends of the straw and you've put
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410
the ends of the straw and you've put
very very weak glue on the each straw

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
very very weak glue on the each straw
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120
very very weak glue on the each straw
then you you stick them all carefully

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
then you you stick them all carefully
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609
then you you stick them all carefully
together you'll have an incredibly

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.760
know little bit tall it won't propagate
to the next strong and that's a magic

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770
to the next strong and that's a magic
 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.319

is striated I mean though they're weak

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
is striated I mean though they're weak
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.160
is striated I mean though they're weak
this way but they're very strong that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
this way but they're very strong that
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710
this way but they're very strong that
way so we should be able to make perhaps

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
way so we should be able to make perhaps
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.819
way so we should be able to make perhaps
the most amazing material I've ever made

breakthrough and that would change our

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
breakthrough and that would change our
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.850
breakthrough and that would change our
lives because we're built to build

engines fail we could probably make a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950

up it would be so strong and light and
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.120
up it would be so strong and light and
that would be good especially as you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
that would be good especially as you
 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.339
that would be good especially as you
have come into actually you could you

you come to a crossing you wouldn't need
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.699
you come to a crossing you wouldn't need
red lights because you'd be

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
red lights because you'd be
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.650
red lights because you'd be
radio-controlled and they would go down

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
radio-controlled and they would go down
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.479
radio-controlled and they would go down
you go over the top and if you hit

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489
you go over the top and if you hit
 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.100
you go over the top and if you hit
they'd be black with mantra constantly

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
they'd be black with mantra constantly
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.949
they'd be black with mantra constantly
but the fan that'd be good and that

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959
but the fan that'd be good and that
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.210
but the fan that'd be good and that
would change your life but just imagine

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
would change your life but just imagine
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.670
would change your life but just imagine
it no red lights at intersections

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
it no red lights at intersections
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.650
it no red lights at intersections
I think that would be well worth it so

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660
I think that would be well worth it so
 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.559
I think that would be well worth it so
the other possibility is that if we can

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569
the other possibility is that if we can
 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.780
the other possibility is that if we can
solve the molecular electronics problem

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
solve the molecular electronics problem
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.729
solve the molecular electronics problem
that nanotubes could well be the linkers

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
that nanotubes could well be the linkers
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.550
that nanotubes could well be the linkers
are the current conductors in molecular

that requires the chemical synthetic

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519
that requires the chemical synthetic
 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.759
that requires the chemical synthetic

breakthroughs with some weight off that
 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.460
breakthroughs with some weight off that
and of course if we can really solve the

and of course if we can really solve the
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.180
and of course if we can really solve the
problem making cables with nanotubes the

problem making cables with nanotubes the
 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.910

this would be fantastically effective
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.710
this would be fantastically effective
for electrical conduction on massive
