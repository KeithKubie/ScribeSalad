00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.490
&gt;&gt; Alright. So is this, is it clear what these answers are?

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.780
&gt;&gt; Let's find out. So, let's see. we, we already worked out

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.262
the math on this. So we know that, for gamma, greater than

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:14.110
1 6th, cooperating is better than defecting, in general. So if I'm

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.450
going against someone who's always going to

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.610
cooperate, then I should always cooperate.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.660
&gt;&gt; Incorrect.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.000
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.240
&gt;&gt; Yes, so, so, we didn't actually work that out. What we worked

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.680
out was what to do if you were playing against tit for tat.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.990
If you were playing against someone who was

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.190
always cooperating, and is completely oblivious to us.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.680
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, you're right. You should

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.620
always defect because you're always going to win. Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.040
&gt;&gt; You're always going to win. You're going to get zero on every time step.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.350
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.870
&gt;&gt; No, that makes sense. That's beautiful.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.830
&gt;&gt; Alright, what about always defect?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.080
&gt;&gt; Well, if you're always going to defect, you might as well defect.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.580
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.360
&gt;&gt; because we're just in the regular old prisoner's dilemma world. [LAUGH]

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.650
&gt;&gt; good,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.100
alright. So now we, now we have this, this other strange beast here.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.700
So our opponent is playing tit for tat. So we could always defect.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.210
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.150
&gt;&gt; But we would do, we'd get a higher score

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.390
if we can convince tit for tat to cooperate with us.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.360
&gt;&gt; For a gamma greater than a 6th.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.180
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.790
&gt;&gt; So that you should always cooperate.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.730
&gt;&gt; That is true, however.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.080
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.485
&gt;&gt; What if we played tit for tat against tit for tat.

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:15.230
&gt;&gt; You'll end up in the same place.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.160
so that's just as good.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.055
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:19.430
&gt;&gt; And that's, that's kind of interesting.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.748
If you think about mutual best responses.

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:24.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.300
&gt;&gt; So that's a strategy that, a pair of strategies where each is a best

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.000
response to the other, there's a, we

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.370
have another name for that. Do you remember?

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.040
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.400
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You taught, you told us what it was.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I probably used different words.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440
&gt;&gt; It's, it's a Nash equilibrium.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.580
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.170
&gt;&gt; This, that's what a Nash equilibrium is. A pair

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.860
of strategies where each is a best response to the other. Each, ea there's

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.220
no way that either would prefer to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.020
switch to something else to get higher reward.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420
&gt;&gt; And that makes perfect sense. You're in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.420
an equilibrium. And that is a Nash equilibrium. Okay.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.550
&gt;&gt; So we can use this little table here

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.870
to actually identify Nash equilibrium. So, what would a

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.140
strategy be? So, so if one player plays always

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.230
cooperate, then the best response to that is always defect.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.073
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:07.073 --> 00:02:09.270
&gt;&gt; But the best response to always defect, is always

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.250
defect. So always cooperate is not part of a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.690
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.330
&gt;&gt; But what about always defect versus always defect?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.600
&gt;&gt; No, it is.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.530
&gt;&gt; So that's a Nash. Right?

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.630
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.670
&gt;&gt; Because they're both doing the thing

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.070
that is the best response to the other.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.600
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.110
&gt;&gt; Alright, this box here, always cooperate

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.140
against tit for tat. That's not okay,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.280
because if a player does always cooperate,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.110
it's always better to switch to always defect.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.300
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.890
&gt;&gt; But,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.250
check this out. If you are playing tit for tat,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.540
and the other player's playing tit for tat, there's no reason

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.860
to switch because it's actually a best response, it's the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.900
optimal thing to do. And that works from both players' perspectives.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.070
&gt;&gt; And that makes sense. So like you said check this

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.060
out and you've been using check marks that's very good. [LAUGH].

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.630
&gt;&gt; So we're in this situation where we have two Nash equilibria.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.528
&gt;&gt; Indeed, and one of these Nash equilibria, [NOISE]

00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:57.920
is cooperative. Which is the thing that we were

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.820
sad about, or at least that I was feeling really sad

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.880
about, in the, in the last lesson. The idea that, man,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.060
there's just, it's clear that they should just try to get

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.560
along. You explained that you can modify the reward structure, and

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.590
then they would get along better. But here it turns out,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.680
well, no, another thing you can do is just open it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.550
up to the possibility of playing multiple rounds, as long as

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.420
you don't know how many rounds, it becomes possible to to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.800
have a strategy that is best off cooperating, and is in fact a Nash Equilibrium.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.990
&gt;&gt; Isn't that equivalent to changing the reward structure?

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.240
&gt;&gt; It's definitely related to changing the reward

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.000
structure. It's a particular way of changing it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.830
&gt;&gt; A very particular way.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.030
&gt;&gt; But it's. Yeah, because it's not true any more that we can do this

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.700
in the one shot case. You have to be in the, in the repeated game, setting.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.630
&gt;&gt; Right, so you change your rewards structure to be a sum of

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.710
rewards. But it's actually an expected sum of rewards, and you don't know

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.280
where it is you're going to stop. So I guess you're changed, you're changed

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.110
the game, you changed the, the rewards. But in a, sort of very subtle way.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole game is different, really.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah man, you changed the game. [LAUGH].

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.090
&gt;&gt; Sometimes you gotta change the game. Don't hate the game.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.580
&gt;&gt; No, you are supposed to hate the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.250
game. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
