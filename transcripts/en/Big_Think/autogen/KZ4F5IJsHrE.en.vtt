just limited to large states just like

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
just limited to large states just like
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.910

there so for example in the military

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
there so for example in the military
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.410
there so for example in the military
robotics realm it's not just the US

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
robotics realm it's not just the US
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.210

system 43 other countries are building

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
system 43 other countries are building
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.520
system 43 other countries are building
and using them and they're from large

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
and using them and they're from large
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.250

states like a China or Russia to a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
states like a China or Russia to a

weaker States like a Pakistan Iran's
 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.890
weaker States like a Pakistan Iran's
working on them but the other thing is

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900
working on them but the other thing is
 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.140
working on them but the other thing is
that it's not just States it's non-state

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150
that it's not just States it's non-state
 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.289
that it's not just States it's non-state
actors so in terms of non-state actors

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299
actors so in terms of non-state actors
 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.990

organization but it was also

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
organization but it was also
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.740

unmanned drones against each other you
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.429
unmanned drones against each other you
have jihadi websites where you can

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439
have jihadi websites where you can
 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.310

this realm for a thousand dollars you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
this realm for a thousand dollars you
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.020
this realm for a thousand dollars you
can build a drone thats basically has

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
can build a drone thats basically has
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179
can build a drone thats basically has
the same capabilities that the US

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
the same capabilities that the US
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.249

military Raven drone has this is the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
military Raven drone has this is the
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870

Iraq four thousand dollars you can build

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
Iraq four thousand dollars you can build
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.999
Iraq four thousand dollars you can build
it with a do-it-yourself kit and so what

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
it with a do-it-yourself kit and so what
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.069
it with a do-it-yourself kit and so what
you have is sort of the flattening of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
you have is sort of the flattening of
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.679
you have is sort of the flattening of
the realm of war and that has to scare

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
the realm of war and that has to scare
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810
the realm of war and that has to scare
us in a certain way because it means

fighting in our conflicts that's the
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.780
fighting in our conflicts that's the
reality right now and so you can either

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
reality right now and so you can either
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.850
reality right now and so you can either
have your head in the sand or you can

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860
have your head in the sand or you can
 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.770
have your head in the sand or you can
face it and so you've got to figure out

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780
face it and so you've got to figure out
 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.300
face it and so you've got to figure out
all the challenging questions that

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310
all the challenging questions that
