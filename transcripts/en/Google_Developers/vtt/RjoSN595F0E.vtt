MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.670
Welcome to "Root Access," the
show on GDL about startups.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.320
My name is Martin Omander.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.430
And I work for Google
Developer Relations.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.370
And today, I'm joined by no
other than Don Dodge, a fellow

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.350
Googler and longtime investor
and startup advocate.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.760
By the way, thank you, everybody
out there, for all

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.020
of your great comments on
our YouTube videos.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.500
And we are actually, Don, going
to address some of those

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500
comments today.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.340
DON DODGE: Great.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.720
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.080
So we actually had an episode
a couple of weeks ago called

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.400
"Startup Founders Who Say,
I Have a Great Idea,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.306
But," dot, dot, dot.

00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:48.440
So in that episode, you said
that entrepreneurs shouldn't

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.660
be afraid of sharing
their ideas--

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840
or they shouldn't be afraid
of getting them stolen.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.630
And that generated a lot of
comments, great comments.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.940
So could you narrow it
down for us a bit?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.230
Are you saying startups
should tell just

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.340
anybody about their ideas?

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.430
Isn't that risky business?

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.880
DON DODGE: Well, I think sharing
your ideas with other

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.430
founders and other investors
is a good idea because,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.770
generally, the people
want to help you.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.260
And they'll give you advice.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.940
They'll expose you to things
that you haven't thought of.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.990
They'll take your idea and makes
you think about how to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.660
use it in a different market
segment or with a different

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.420
customer base or different
users.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.620
So more times than not, you
learn more from sharing your

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.830
idea than you do by
keeping it secret.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.370
To the question of do people
steal ideas, generally, no,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.490
they don't, for several
reasons.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.420
The first one is they're too
busy doing their own idea and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.970
their own thing to be distracted
by your idea.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.510
So that's the first reason
people don't

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.470
generally steal ideas.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.180
They might see some concepts
in what you're doing or UI

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.990
approaches or something that
might be interesting that they

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.570
can incorporate into
their idea.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.840
But I wouldn't classify that
as stealing your idea.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.460
It's just sort of adopting some
principles into their own

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.500
idea that make sense for them.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.910
So very rarely have I seen
any ideas stolen.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.580
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.690
One viewer, Hazael Reyes, said
that ideas can be stolen.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.280
He's seen it many times.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.000
And he recommends patenting your
idea before it's stolen.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.160
Is that something you
see among startups?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.460
DON DODGE: Well, first of all,
no, I don't see ideas stolen

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.170
very often.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.920
But second to the question of
patents, generally, they're a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.500
waste of time and money.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.690
People don't understand how much
time it takes to get a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.770
patent and how expensive it is
in terms of lawyer fees and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.340
your own time in writing the
patent and all of the defenses

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.350
to get a patent.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.960
It typically takes two to four
years to get a patent issued

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.410
and can cost from $25,000 to
$100,000 for the process of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.800
getting a patent.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.920
So generally, a startup is
either out of business or

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.460
wildly successful and
acquired before the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.390
patents ever get issued.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.810
So unless your idea is really,
really new and different,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.640
patents don't typically
make a lot of sense.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.430
And, oh, one other point.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.260
Let's say you're successful
and you get a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.080
patent issued to you.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.480
Well, congratulations, now
you have to defend it.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.990
So if someone violates your
patent, now you have to hire

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.370
lawyers to go defend
the patent.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.590
So that's going to cost you more
time and more money to

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.530
defend the patent.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.670
So it's much more expensive
and takes more time than

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.100
people realize and, generally,
not worth it.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.260
MARTIN OMANDER: And
you say you have

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.230
to defend your patent.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.340
What happens if you
don't defend it?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.750
DON DODGE: Then you lose it,
because if someone violates

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.450
your patent knowingly and
openly, then you lose your

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.490
patent because you
didn't defend it.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.550
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, right.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.640
So big costs that you
may not see upfront.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.140
Interesting.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.219
So another viewer of
MrBinaryKode--

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.820
I love your username,
by the way--

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.510
responded, commented, really?

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.910
So ideas can't be stolen?

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.590
Tell that to Bill Gates
and Steve Jobs.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.180
So, well, we've all heard
these legends, right?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.280
How Steve Jobs was allegedly
inspired by windowing systems

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.830
he had seen at Xerox PARC.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.970
He built a Mac OS.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.710
Then Bill Gates was inspired
by Mac OS to build Windows.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.040
Don't those examples show
the danger of sharing?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.500
DON DODGE: Well, I think the
key word there is "inspired

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.100
by." So it wasn't stolen.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.240
It wasn't copied exactly.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.410
It was inspired by.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.360
And by the way, Bill Gates and
Steve Jobs also had their

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.980
ideas copied or inspired.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.120
So that's the way
software works.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.680
That's the way technology
works.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.370
You take several different
ideas and put them

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.860
together in a new way.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.520
They may have been inspired
by existing ideas.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.570
But you create something new.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.660
So if ideas are really stolen,
then there are courts that

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.930
decide those things and
award damages and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.010
that kind of thing.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.550
So I don't think in the startup
world, stealing ideas

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.480
is a big problem.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.450
And I think inspiration
is the key word there.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.780
And typically, you see ideas
that get adopted or adapted or

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.940
inspired and result in taking
that idea and incorporating it

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.870
into your own product and
probably doesn't compete at

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.445
all with the original idea.

00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:01.700
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, I see.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.700
I know, Don, you were involved
in Napster some years ago.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.760
Was that idea stolen?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.210
Did you guys steal that
idea from anywhere?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.780
DON DODGE: Well, Napster got
accused of stealing other

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.610
things, not ideas
but maybe music.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.870
But, no, Napster was the basis
of several other ideas.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.260
So like FTP, the file transfer
protocol, that existed before.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.410
The instant messaging
system and protocol,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.660
that existed before.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.070
All of those sort of
ideas existed, but

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.490
in different ways.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.170
So all Napster did was took
the FTP protocol for file

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:46.800
transfer and took the instant
messaging kind of concept and

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.090
a few others and put them
together in a way that was

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.140
totally new.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.550
So we didn't invent anything.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.360
But we took existing ideas and
concepts and put them together

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.370
in a new way and focused them
on a completely new market.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.810
So nothing was invented.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.990
Nothing was stolen.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.140
But Napster was a conglomeration
of different

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.330
ideas that created something
entirely new.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.650
And that's generally
what happens.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.940
That's what Steve Jobs did
with the graphical user

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.410
interface and what Bill Gates
did with Windows.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.450
They took existing concepts
and just made them into

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.900
something new and different.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.920
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.800
Finally, Don, Matt [? Perry ?]

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.490
asked, if you're a startup
founder, you're doing

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.020
something, you have an idea,
you've gotten started, and

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.760
then you notice that somebody
else has a patent on your

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.270
idea, is that game over?

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.540
What do you do?

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.530
DON DODGE: Well, I think it's
game over if you're trying to

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.840
do the same thing in the same
market, the same kind of

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.510
product that is patented.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.320
That's probably not
a good idea.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.580
But if you're starting something
that uses the same

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.780
concepts in a different
market, in a different

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.810
product, you're probably
OK for several reasons.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.780
First one is startups are so
small and insignificant that

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.200
the patent holder probably will
not be aware of you or

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.640
care about what you're doing,
at least initially.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.110
Unless you're wildly successful
with hundreds of

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.350
millions of users or hundreds
of millions of dollars in

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.600
revenue, they're probably
not going to care.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.930
Secondly, if you're in a
completely different market

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.220
segment-- for example, if the
original patent was for

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.610
something in manufacturing and
you use it in entertainment or

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.280
you use it in retail or
something that's sort of a

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.860
completely different market--

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.140
generally, they're not going
to care because it's so

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.049
expensive to sue and
defend the patent.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.110
If you're doing something
else, it doesn't matter.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.200
So it does matter if you're
violating a patent that's in

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.180
the same market with the same
kind of product that's going--

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.380
then you're going to
run into trouble.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.360
And that probably
is game over.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.160
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.450
Thank you, Don.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.230
And thank you all
for watching.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.110
Please keep those comments
coming in on YouTube, comments

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.350
or questions you'd like us to
pick up in future episodes.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.090
Finally, I am also
a developer.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.240
And I built a lot of stuff using
Google Cloud Platform.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.700
I think it's a great platform.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.190
And life is too short to build
stuff anywhere else.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.930
And as a special deal for you,
Root Access viewers, we have a

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.920
$2,000 credit that you can
go and get and get

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.500
started on the platform.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.660
Just follow the on-screen
instructions.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.870
And good luck on the
Cloud Platform.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.110
