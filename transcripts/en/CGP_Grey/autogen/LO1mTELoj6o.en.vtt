00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Much happiness will advise you how to get it but maybe you are not trying 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.660
 . To be happy, your actions indicate the opposite you want to be 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.080
 Tired of sailing in the sea of ​​grief - achieving this is very easy 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.230
 And this video has seven ways to begin to unhappiness - at least 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.860
 One of them you are doing now, let's start to stay where you are. Stay indoors 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.320
 As much as possible and preferably in the same room be like a laundry pile 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.550
 , Do not let a beautiful day tempt you to a picnic .. Avoid everything 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
 Even this mysterious practice keeps good materials away from your mind 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
 Which may help you to improve, and sleep brings you to health problems 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.840
 Which in turn will remain this cycle revolves, sleep is the most influential thing 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.860
 An effect you can do, so be like a laundry pile Make your room a place to stay all the time 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.070
 I live, work, play and sleep in the smallest place possible, and here I come to "tamper with the timing of your sleep" 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.440
 "Insomnia will be your assistant pilot on your journey in the sea of ​​misery 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.280
 Quality is not efficient enough, but it helps to get irregular 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 The productive side of your mind that may lead you 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
 , To happiness in the horizon regularity of sleep something very fragile 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 It takes at least three days to organize it 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 Sleep several hours at least twice a week 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.939
 , And also prefer to be careful to vary the time you wake up go to sleep very late some and not all days 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.479
 And tell yourself that you are compensating for sleep to feel that you are doing something healthy 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.920
 Even if you feel tired when you wake up early or late 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.579
 Irregular sleep helps you in your journey to unhappiness 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.479
 The more time you sleep, the more difficult it will become 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.979
 And make your sleep uncluttered and not sleep or wake up at the same time normally 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.259
 The goal is to help with this "more than one time look at the screens" a great look at the screen helps 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.610
 Helps previous sailing methods, boredom may push you to move 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.810
 So let the screens tangle and fatigue may push you to sleep so let the screens keep you awake 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.020
 As far as possible go always to sleep and screen in your hand 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.060
 Look at it first when you wake up 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080
 Every moment away from the screen you can notice the horizon 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.240
 Keep your head low and let the events pull you away, and here you have allies you do not know 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.780
 Behind the screens there are teams of the smartest people and computers competing 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.910
 They are competing to attract your interest so that they can come to you 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.780
 You will not be allowed to leave again if you turn away and the screens also help us in advice number four 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.590
 "Use screens to express your negative feelings" to feed your anger or intolerance to things 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.390
 For things you do not have authority or influence be aware of everything but do not do anything 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.630
 Things to care about may lead you out of the sea of ​​blindness 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.890
 There are reasons to leave your room and do things that are meaningful to the people around you 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.300
 , But on the contrary you can make things you care about as a source of misery 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.920
 Focus on the bad side to ship your frustration and frustration and if you have to participate 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.660
 SHARK participated in a worthless way and was frustrated by the lack of change 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.069
 We are now approaching the end, and if you follow the steps correctly, unhappiness 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.750
 Misfortune comes on the way, but part of your mind is trying to change the course of the ship 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 The ship has a goal and if you are not careful then that part of your mind 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.329
 Your mind may save you and fortunately we can trick 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.549
 And a torch leads us deeper into the sea, to achieve the goals must be specific targets and midwives 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.079
 Achievable, measurable, responsible, and related to a certain time "I will turn the wheel 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.760
 By one degree now instead of focusing the productive part of your mind on the trivial goals 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.620
 Make the goal unclear 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.810
 Make the goal unclear and the road is unclear 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.489
 To ensure failure, I have cleaned up the whole house today better than 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.540
 I will wash clothes now, cleaning the whole house is impossible 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 You will always fail to focus on the goals after what you will achieve 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.299
 Learn how to shop for a program before you learn how to program 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.709
 , This will end the productive side of your mind well 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.269
 Be careful to wait for stimulus rather than plan a specific time to do it 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.399
 When you feel like you want to do it, you can never do it and with trivial goals 

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.669
 The product part of your mind will be transformed from a serious source of development 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.659
 Reward yourself every little step you make, into a disgruntled part 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.409
 A scoundrel cheats you for your failure and for your goal 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.379
 , At every step in the way and now the petty goals they set 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.370
 The productive part of your mind may be cooked, but if it continues to resist you 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.129
 Face to mirage of happiness in the sea of ​​unhappiness and to the islands of happiness 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.919
 "Immediately after happiness" the human mind will achieve the opposite 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.569
 When sailing in the direction of happiness 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.569
 , Imagine happiness as a place where people live there happy happy time all the time 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.129
 This makes happiness a sense of pleasure that no one can reach 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.229
 True happiness like a bird may land on your ship, but it will not land if 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.699
 If you are motivated to hunt it instead of that good from your ship and sail to 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.830
 To warmer waters, so that the bird will descend while you are not looking ... so do not ever do that 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.270
 Sail the mirage of happiness instead of improving your ship sailing 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.590
 Finally the most important but "follow your instincts" 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.729
 Sailing deeper into the sea of ​​grief is easier because there is 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.779
 A dark magnetic field leads your connection in the right direction 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:38.759
 Once you start you will want to stay indoors, you will not want to 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.889
 Failure to exercise will be very desirable. Sleep will want to do what you know will make you more sad 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.349
 Your connection points to the road, both inside and outside 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:55.020
 Exterior So follow the real north for your motives and stay away from the other pole 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.360
 It's all very simple to start with just these tips 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.630
 And let the sea carry you away ****

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.530
