Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Videos, boom. And we're live, uh, ladies and gentlemen, Charlemagne, Tha God my man, Andrew Schultz. Yeah. For being here. Thanks for setting this up. Thank you for having me sir. My banker. I've been a fan of yours for a while. You, I think you're the last great radio host and you will be the last famous radio host cause I think radio is a dying thing. You're the last great one. You're the, you're the one who made it famous from radio. Who the fuck else? Yup. In this era. I mean, I, yeah, I think radio was like one of those, uh, one of those rare lanes way. It's really not a lot of people who prosper in it. You know what I mean? Like especially in the black radio space. I mean, you've got the, Tom Joyner is Doug banks to Wendy Williams, you know, so it's, it's rare in that lane. But I think, I think you've got people that have established good careers and radio, but that's a great question. When was the last one? He's the last one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Famous from rating on last Samurai hundred percent. Gotta give Bobby bones Bobby bones. That's nice. I don't know who that is. [inaudible] shots fired. Shots fired. I know. Sorry. Bobby knows somebody. Fuck, I suspect. I'm sure he's great. He's a nationally syndicated radio host, but he's on the country states. He just want to marry. You want to definitely just start, so, okay. Yeah. Joe was like, I don't give a shit. I only know Bobby is, you talk about them. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He's got two national New York Times bestselling books season. That's one of those things though. It's like Comedians, like you know, just talking about a comic that everybody loves and people are like, I've never heard of them. Like amongst comics, she began expected, Bobby has the oldest on the idol now. Okay. Yeah. And we're around the same age, so I would have to give it, I would have to put him in that fight.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       You and Bob, you're a gracious man. Yeah. In my opinion. You're the last Samurai guys like you. I just want to snatch you up and bring you over to podcasts. Like get the fuck out of there. Get out of that censored boss man, world interacting with it. What's he calling you guys? I know you guys have a podcast together. The brilliant idiots, you know Podtrac right? You know that Short, short, like we just crack Podtrac the breakfast club. He was number 20 on Potrero. Okay, so you put that online as well? Yeah, we put it out of the pocket. That's a good cause. I feel like we're radio. That's what it is. Like people still listening to terrestrial radio, but you have to go where the people are, so you have to have the podcast, you have to have the youtube following. Like you can't wait for people just to come to radio.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       Everything. I wish you could swear though. So that's the problem they do. That's the thing. He so they release all the interviews they do on breakfast club and those things explode on youtube. They have all the curse I just found out about, exactly. That's where most people globally with watch and listen. I mean, yeah, right. Yeah. That's what separates this radio, this era of radio from other arrows or radio like I was starting didn't have youtube. You know what I'm saying? If I was 30 I had youtube, wouldn't be no question. He'd still be the motherfucking guy. Even though he is the guy. Right. But he's still be like Super Super Guy in this era. Right. He's in that pay wall, which is very strange to a serious paywall. That's the strangest paywalls. Yeah. Yeah. He took the check and then you get financial independence. Mac check. Let's be realistic. He was already financially independent. So why do you do it? You just the numbers that are thrown at him. Yeah. That was a different 300 million. Right? Well I think that was just initially you'd have to do, I think he makes like 100 million every year or something crazy. 300 was flat and then another hundred [inaudible] like your kids be in a straight and like your great, great, great grandkids being a straight right. Yeah. But Sears stock and serious as me is like blockbuster stock.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       Hang on to that messed up match. Something like that. Yeah. I remember when Netflix used to have those DVDs that you would get like in front of the fucking [inaudible]. You have to send them back. He was like, I'm not sending this back now. I was so funny. I was home this weekend. I was in Moncks corner, South Carolina, and like there was a black panther DVD from the library in my mom's house. I'm like, what? The Fun Library, Black Panthers in the original Black Panthers or oh, I was like, Yo, she was true from back in the day. That's an original Black Panther. Like who got the Black Panther DVD that they checked out from the library and have not bought it back yet? You didn't bring it back to the library yet. Now you don't have to like what are they willing to do? Why you the Black Panther from the library because you wanted it and it was there and you were at the library. I'm still trying to understand why you call it library. What is it? Library? I don't fucking know. I mean, graduated guide. It's like a library. Yeah. It's one of those words, you know, don't bail him out. [inaudible] blackberry. Especially talk variable in Texas to say special, but everyone, even like George Bush when he was president would say x specially extensionally yeah. Yeah. I think a lot of it has to do with region cause I still say straight street strong.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       Yeah. That's or nothing. Screech, screech, crawl scrumptious say pacifically Oh, specifically specifically instead of specifically cause everybody knows then it's fun. That's the point of view. It's a little Dick. It's like, um, dialects. Like my grandparents were from Sicily and they would talk and dialects and even people that knew Italian wouldn't know what the fuck they were saying. Like just like people that knew pure Italian at some weird like pig Latin type shit. You know. I mean my mom's Scottish, like, have you listened to a real Scottish people talk, you don't understand what the fuck they're talking about, that accent. So the way they rolled their words together and then they get them drunk. Well it's impossible. Where you from Joe? I was born in New Jersey and uh, I grew up mostly in Boston, but most really all over the country. Stubborn sensibilities. Like before we started the podcast, she was talking about all the hunting, hunting. I didn't get into that until 2012 wow. Why? Cause I was thinking about being a vegetarian. I was like, I was watching these animal rights videos, Peta videos, and I was like, I don't want to participate. And it's factory farming shit. It just, it's fucked. You Watch these

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       pigs slammed into these cages together and cows and chickens. I was like, this is inhumane. It's, it's insane. Decided to go on a thought, killing them yourself. I decided one of two things. Either I was gonna, I was gonna try hunting and either I was going to become a vegetarian or I was going to become a hunter and so I became a hunter. I did it. I killed a deer. I ate it. I was like, this is perfect. I love this call. I'm trying to fix. Make sense? I'm trying to forget the thought process when you saw that it was inhumane for these animals would be dying. No, no, not you want to kill him. Factory farming. Factory farming. And not that they're, look, every animal dies. They don't live forever and become angels. They live in the wild. When you hunt, you dip your feet into the wild.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       You go out there and you, you fair chase, you'll find them. You track them, you stay down wind, you get in a good position, you kill them and then you eat them and it's a different animal when you're eating that. Like if I eat an elk steak, I know it's good that it's delicious. I know that I was there. Can I see a picture of this? I'm still trying to imagine what it is because I understand dear and understand Moose. A giant deer is that those antlers pipes froze antlers on like an 800 pound animal. How tall is it? It's huge. They're big. Like six feet. Oh, taller. Yeah. Yeah. Elk can mushroom training. The Moose is crazy. I saw the first time I saw him moose, it was like that scene in Jurassic Park with Jeff Goldbloom looks out the jeep and sees the dinosaur. It's like you can't believe how big a MOU says.

Speaker 2:          00:07:22       I don't think I've seen a moose in prison. Double and elk. The double the size of a note. Yeah. Yeah. We need to go hunting, man. You want to go? I'm being dead serious to take you hunting, camping and hunting where it's one or the other. But you could do both. Okay. Well you could camp or you could hunt rather and then stay in a nice lodge. That's the move. But also kind of want to do like the full outdoor cause sometimes I'll watch those shows on like nat geo or something like that and it's, they're just living off the land and they got to like make a hunt or make a year, you know, make it out of snow. Yeah, don't do that. Don't do that. No, but what for what for like two days. Like a cool, you want what you want. It's like a real tent with a real sleeping bags and stay warm and you're healthy and you're not worried about fucking freezing to death or anything weird like that.

Speaker 2:          00:08:07       And make sure you have water filters so you can drink out of a stream if you really want to do that. Yeah. I want to try. You should try hunting in New York like nobody's ever done that. Like hunter rats. I'm saying. I'm saying think about all them big ass rats in New York. Like nobody's ever done that. I'm not going to lie. He'll probably get a lot of attention for this. Back in the day, you could go to 120 fifth street and like Spanish Harlem and you could buy pigeons. People were like catching pigeons and they were selling them and trying to front like they were exotic pigeons. Shit, I swear to God. No. Pigeons were brought over here for food. That's what squad is. That's what the fuck is. Squad squad is like of like a Bougie restaurant item and it's actually young pigeons. Really? Yeah. That's what, that's what squat is. Yeah. I didn't know that. All pigeons, all pigeons you see in the United States or all brought in from somewhere else for food and then they released

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       it become feral. They like the wild hogs of the bird world. What a young rats called that are used for food. It's a good question. Who uses young rants for food? I don't know. Yeah, but there's a, there's a cousin that rats documentary. What does this is just the dog that hunt rats in New York, right? I don't believe that shit. What do you mean you don't believe it? That they're really guys sending their dogs out to go get rats OCR paper. Because that's halls. I mean, they're not going to fix it. There's no way to fix it. But you like Jack Russell terriers, they fuck rats up. They're designed to fuck routes up, but it's gotta be people who live up north in New York who have the same desire to hunt. They just, they just go down south. So why did I go here? Right. They hunt deer in New York has a lot of deer.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Jersey, jersey, or got allowed. Yeah. I live, I live in Jersey and that's one of the reasons I loved yard because I'm from South Carolina, so I'm used to seeing deers and possums and just different types of wildlife running through the streets. I, that's why I like living in Jersey. Yeah. The Jersey is an unusual play. Jersey has more black bears per capita than any state in the United States. I don't know if that's a fact, but I believe you cause I've seen it myself. Yeah, they're everywhere. You seen bears on your property? Not on my property, but when I used to uh, stay with my aunt in the Poconos, the bears used to come in her backyard cause there was like a scream in the backyard and they would like come in and just grab fish out of the screen. They kill the kid. One bear killed a kid a couple years ago from one of the colleges.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       What colleges or was it the one near New Brunswick? What was it you didn't see in the video? In Jersey at a walking bed bed. I would walk on two feet through people's back yards. They had a bad friend. Paul was so hell yeah. Shit happen there. It is looking at the video, the bear walking around. Oh yeah, that's a foot. You know who believes in bigfoot? Yeah. You have a believer in the studio right now who believes in bigfoot. Do you really? Yeah, absolutely. 100% believes it, but you know why I believe in bigfoot? Because it shit like mousses. You know what I'm saying? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       you see something? If you see a fucking a species like a moon, God believe. Look at this shit. Yeah. At some point in life, somebody was trying to explain that to somebody else. He's like, man, get the fuck Outta here right now. When he's trying to explain it to me, we look at the size of that. God Damn, that's insane. Was the legs work? They'll fuck you up to. There's a, those are the rare deer species that will fucking stuck to death. Yeah. They used to dealing with wolves. If they think you're a threat, they just run up on you and stomp you to death. Why don't you believe in bigfoot that? Well, I actually did a television show where I went hunting for them. You going to do it? I'll find it. No, no, no. I was, I did a show called Joe Rogan questions. Everything. We spent a whole week in the Pacific northwest talking to big foot hunters. Yeah. We camped out there. Me and Duncan Trussell went and interviewed scientists and interviewed all these different archeologists, all these different people that didn't believe and didn't believe it wasn't real animal. At one point in time. I don't think it exists now. I think it existed. It's just a primate in the fucking woods. Yeah. Okay. You don't think it exists? You believe that exists now? I did up to a certain point, but I was like in this era

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       with all the cameras and everything else, somebody would have caught one. Okay, that's good. Yeah. I was a little worried. No, I don't. I don't believe in it now. I believe it existed at some point, but I don't believe it exists. Let me tell you something.

Speaker 4:          00:12:05       Charlemagne has this amazing power to manifest shit. Okay, so I see how it could lend itself. When you believe something so much, it becomes real. Right? Right. I could see how it manifests itself into things like big foot, like you believe in things. I mean Sasquatches wasn't, it's not a far fetched idea. It's literally just a primate in the woods. I'm just saying when you were young and you believe that you were a teen wolf, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:31       That was like, no, no, no. I did third grade. He believed that his ears actually changed shape. No, they did. I was sitting at the list and I will sit at the lunch table telling everybody I was going to turn into this Werewolf at lunchtime and I was saying this for like a week straight and we was all sitting at the table and I was just sitting there like this going to happen. It's happening. And my ears actually went from round to points into like two seconds. And when all the kids at the table saw it in, jumped up and ran. So they fucked up my concentration. So if I hadn't kept that concentration going, I probably would've turned full fledge where within that moment and maybe levitated possibly. I've done that before. Really? Oh yeah. I used to, I grew up Jehovah witness. So I used to leave the kingdom hall and I would walk outside of the kingdom hall and I would like jump in the air and be looking down at the kingdom hall. And not stay up there for awhile and then I would come down. But here's the thing, he's not, he's not doing bits. Right. He really believes this shit. I'm just telling you what happened in my life. If you believe what you believe it, if you don't, you don't memories a strange thing.

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       Ah, you think it's one of those like you recreate the past

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       well, memories of strange thing. Like you couldn't believe something and know something to be true when it didn't actually happen. Mm. You can absolutely do that. I mean there's what you have. People have memories in their head that never happened. You have memories that people positioned in your head. They proven that you can talk someone into a memory. You can change someone's memory. That's why it's particularly dangerous for kids when you know, there's a whole case where they were talking kids into saying that their teachers molested them and all these people like lost their careers, lost their lives, turned out it was all 100% made up. But those kids believed in, they believed when they were telling them that they were molested, they believed it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:18       Yeah. That's gone into it. What is that called when you give that information to the police? What is it called when they interrogate you? Interrogations can be bull shoe. Yeah, the course you, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       The article I was reading the other day about why people make false confessions, why did they just get talked into believing that they actually,

Speaker 3:          00:14:34       you scared the devil. If you a kid, especially a young kid from the hood and you like 1516 years old and the police like, yeah, you went to jail for 20 years. If you don't tell us what we need to know, you don't fucking know no better. They put

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       you under duress. They put you in a room, they sit you across from a position of authority and this person questions you. You start, you start, you start saying

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       things that aren't true. You've seen beyond scared straight. They tell you, you gonna get 20 years and get bunched. Fuck foot. 15 of them show the first five 15 they let they let you kind of settle in for the first

Speaker 5:          00:15:01       fine. Yeah. You know what? Let's let that bucket nice and tight. But five year birthday you might like some elk, you might go listen, you might go in under age, you know there's these criminals got moral [inaudible] a few but not too come on up monsters.

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       When I was young, I used to have a red tractor trailer. It was a red plastic trailer with a farmer on top of it and like of those hard plastic trailers. Now farmer used to get off that trailer in fuck with me and I took it in the yard one day, put kerosene on it and set it on fire. And in my mind, I remember hearing that farm farmers scream, my mom even tell you the story of how I used to always talk about how this fucking farmer used to come off of his tractor and fucking me. And she saw me set it on fire and I thought I was crazy until years later I met Tiffany Haddish and she said she had experiences with her. Teddy bears used to come to life and fuck with her. So I'm just saying, I'm just saying shit happens. Is All this happening?

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       I haven't heard this started happening at night. When did it happen? Ah, I don't remember. I can't remember. I don't remember like the details of when it was at night or during the day. That's why these things are trying to figure out with Ufo abductions, you know almost all those UFO abductions happened. My people are sleeping and they think what's happening is your brain is releasing and dodginess psychedelic chemicals and it's forcing you to have these hallucinations and that you really do believe you're taking the board, the CFOs and gone away. But if someone is watching you with the camera, nothing actually happens. Questions, people swear by it. Have you ever had one of those dreams where it feels as if someone's holding you down to the Hag Hag riding you? I mean that's a term they really call it a sleep paralysis, but growing up in South Carolina they would say to hag was riding you.

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       Okay, what do we have to take salt is that you would easily put us, you need to put a straw broom at your door or you would take salt and sprinkle salt at your door. Because when the Haggins, there's your room, you got to pick up every criminal assault, so by the time he picks up every kernel of thought, it's fucking date I ag was like these little old women that they say would come and ride people in the middle of the night. I think I've seen them before, but it's really looks like just the shadowy figure and it's the same feeling. You get that feeling like your body is frozen. They can't, your eyes are open, but you feel like you're talking, but nobody here. That's, that's it. They said that's the Hag, right? What did they say that is like what? The scientists, the blood's not flowing in your body looks like when you're sitting on the toilet too long and your fucking leg legs go. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a psychological thing. [inaudible] your, your brain is just not sending signals to your body, but you want to move and you just don't move, but I can't knock. That shit is frightening. I had that before and I've had that before and I had a, when I woke up it was just, you seen the movie signs? Yeah. So it was this creature that looked like he was from the movie signs, but it was purple and black and it was standing over me and I couldn't

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       move. And so I was making noise, just trying to get it to go away. And as the sun came up, it just faded away. Now that I don't know if it was a dream or an actual

Speaker 2:          00:17:57       visit from extra extraterrestrial, it could be the thing about extra terrestrials. Well, you know, I believe in him. Will you believe in everything? The reality than toys that can harass you as a child? There's no evidence. But the numbers of humans, I mean the numbers of planets rather that could support humans are there. They're pretty well just what we've documented so far, it's pretty interesting. Just what they know about the thousands of plants to discover this hundreds it could possibly support human life. And then there's hundreds of billions of galaxies. So the idea that we're the only one, not only that Neil degrasse Tyson's explaining this to me is this is a mind fuck and a half that the universe is so big that not only is there another you out there that has done everything exactly as you've done to every pause like that. Pause every pause down to the second. An infinite number, right?

Speaker 6:          00:18:52       Yeah. Yeah. You're talking about, is it called the, uh, infinite in an infinite universes, there's this exact conversation happens.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       My name look, people look exactly like that because infinity implies that that can be a million variations. There's one where you get up right now and you have to take a piss right out of the room or Charlemagne today. There you are. Here I'm there. There's one would you get up and you're mad that we don't believe you that you saw big foot or something. You know, that kind of shit. Yeah. This, the idea that when you think of infinity, right, we think about it. It's being really big. It's not, it's impossible to put in your head. Yeah. The infinite, infinite universes, like the size of the universe is 14 billion light years apart. Infinite numbers of those. Not only that, they think that inside every galaxy is a supermassive black hole. And inside that black hole, maybe another universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies with hundreds of billions of black holes inside each one of those hundreds of billions of galaxies, hundreds of billions of black holes, that it's fractal. And that it's impossible for you to even conceive.

Speaker 6:          00:19:50       Yeah. I think it's very, so you're saying just based on the numbers, there has to be something. The question is, as you gotta be, to think that would have only life in his book was only life in the universe. I'm just saying like, hmm, whether or not it's reached us. Well, yeah, I don't think it's reached us. And if it has reached us, it's like they have to find a way to bend time. Right? Because time is the biggest issue. I'm gonna tell you what the problem, like where earthlings, right? Yeah. And if you look at how diverse the earth he is, like there's different species of shit in the woods, different pieces of shit in the water, different species that shouldn't have jungle, different species. That shit in the sky. Why wouldn't the earth be, I mean the university just as diverse and is where assuming shortage, we're assuming we're the smartest life form in the universe. No, no, no. I'm not at all. And sure it is all I'm saying is life has an end, right? What is the oldest species on the earth right now with the turtles lived like 200 or some shit like that. What pool is Morgan Freeman? The doors on the Goddamn Room. So let's say it's 200 300 years, right?

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       Let's say that's the Max. Now we have 300 years to travel, millions of light years away to get to another galaxy to see other planets, to see if they have some shit and they have the same for us. So let's say there is another species, did somehow found a way to take your, the consciousness that they have and put it in a robot that can then last for thousands of years, then they would have the opportunity to come here. But we're limited by time. Right. You will die before you get somewhere. Like you can go to Mars, we can't come back. I think we're basing that off our intelligence. There might be a species in this universe that can fly to earth the way we fly to la. But that's what I'm saying. They would have done

Speaker 2:          00:21:26       Ben time. Not necessarily what they could do is fold time or full time,

Speaker 4:          00:21:30       whatever. You know what I mean? Create that wormhole fact where you're going where instead of it's not linear, it's whatever. Send somebody

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       time like it was in um, event horizon. They talked about how they did that. Remember that movie?

Speaker 4:          00:21:42       Yeah. But, and there was another one to add. Matthew mcconaughey. Interstellar. Interstellar. Yeah. Where they get into like space time, space time is really interesting, right? It's like the faster you go, the less you age. Right? Like, so somebody on a plane flying over us into someone here on the earth, right? So someone's flying around the earth on a plane versus us sitting on earth, they will age fractionally less, right. So if you just increase their speed and decrease hours, uh, when that or keep ours at the same, they will, let's say not yet

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       at all compared to us aging like 30 years even crazier. Brian Cox, I went to see his cosmos exhibit and that's the fastest, oh is a physicist from cern, from the large Hadron collider is a bunch of differentiate podcasts and shows. He said that if you were born and right next to you, like your mother and you both put on a watch at the moment you were born and then you checked that watch 30 years later, if you have a perfect watch, it was never out of time. Your watch would have a different time than her watch because you have gone through time differently than she has fracture fractionally because the amount of speed, how fast you travel it. Ew, ew, ew. Experienced time in a different way. The Path you take in life, the different terrain you travel over the earth, all those factors play in to how much time has passed.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       Let's say you're locked on the top of a mountain and she lives at the bottom, you're actually traveling at a faster rate, right? Because it's no different than like let's say there's a ball on a tether, right? And you're just swinging it around in a circle, right? The ball at the end is actually going faster than your hand in the middle of swinging around. Gotcha. Right? So since you're going fast, you're actually aging slower and we're talking about fractions of seconds. Yeah. But over the course of time, it proves that everyone experiences time and a slightly different rate, which proves Einstein's theory that if you have to travel very fast in a spaceship and then come back, you would look at your brother who was your age and now he's a hundred years old and you're only at 30 so I think I figured it out how we can time travel time, but I think I figured out, all right,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       so we're trying to create, okay. And again, I don't know shit, but this is just me like you know pontificated logic. This is brilliant. Lydia chip right here. Okay, so we have to do is go faster than the speed of light in order to time travel. I don't know how to do that just yet, but what I think we can do is we're trying to use like rockets to propel us at a certain mile per hour to get close to the speed of light. Fuck the fuck the rockets. Why don't we use light as wind and create a sale? That harness light and that sale will naturally take us the same speed or as close as we possibly could get to the speed of light. He did it in a movie called Sunshine. I'm a fucking genius.

Speaker 7:          00:24:23       You somebody shipper just sunshine and didn't tell anyone I'm shine. How could you see that movie? I don't even know where the milk is. Science fiction come on the show. It's fiction movie. I'm talking about

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       Bob Lasar tonight. That was the guy I was telling you. I'm wanting to bring you to dinner. I'm going to as well if you want to gum. He's the guy who worked at area 51 and uh, I mean I didn't even know if he's talking about the test tomorrow. Yeah, I'm going to bring it up. Oh, area 51 is real, but this guy literally worked on what he says or alien spacecraft. Spacecraft. That sale on sunshine could be the next big thing is Caitlyn Bro, you should work for now and this is public school education gets you a job at Trump space for us to do any of the math. I just want to throw the ideas out there and I think I got it. This is a legit space for shirt from Trump's from Trump tower. Tim Dillard bought me this. Yo, shout out to Tim. I love Tim. This is real. This is what the real fucking space for us. This is the logo.

Speaker 7:          00:25:24       I didn't know how I missed that one cartoon of the wheels space

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       for us. This fucking goofy shit. [inaudible] you had a friend who works on alien spacecraft. Oh, I don't know [inaudible] on the podcast tomorrow. He worked at area 51 is he allowed to talk about that shit when I'll get you is because he's been talking about it for decades. Yeah. And they've tried to discredit him. There's a very controversial, a lot of people think he's full of shit, but the more, there's a recent documentary by Jeremy Korbel and the more you look at the documentary, he knows too many things. He knows too many things that that prove that he absolutely worked at area 51 he got arrested for bringing people to a lookout peak to look over where the area where they would launch these spaceships and he's got video of these things flying through the air, doing all these maneuvers that no conventional spacecraft could do in 1980 whatever the fuck it was where you got arrested. They must have some type of uh, like, like, like a Nda with extra terrestrials or they don't talk about, I feel like the US government, it just, governments in general throughout the world have some type of NDA will kill you. I don't know. Probably is the same one Leonardo Dicaprio uses on his girlfriends. He's got the greatest NBA history now. Holy Shit. I mean, Shit. No one gives a fuck about NDA. So we had pay people and they don't care. They'll out and talk about it

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       later. We had Lisa Ann on a, on a podcast, right? I just parked the porn star go playground too. Right. And Lisa and came on and she was talking about Ndas and how stupid women are for a obeying them. And I was like, what are you talking about? And she's like, what are they have to lose? They don't have any money. Exactly. So she's like, you have a bunch of fucking heels in your apartment. You think that Leonardo Dicaprio is going to take your heels. You can break any fucking India. But for whatever reason he gets scared. You pay a woman to half a million dollars. Tell her to keep her mouth closed. She breaks the NDA. An NDA says she has to pay you back when you exactly. You mean we don't have money forever. One money he wrote one is bill O'Reilly. He had to pay a lady $32 million.

Speaker 6:          00:27:23       There's no pussy worth that. I need to see what she looks like. Can we look at this woman? I need to see no bail is into some wild, wild shit. Can we? There's no picture of this woman. I don't know. I need to see $32 million policy on blast, but I love to, I would love to see what she looks like 32 million. He agreed to it. He agreed to it. He must've did something. He didn't want nobody to be even remotely bills getting packed 100% yet. It's not even about what actually happened is about what the person said they did the you that can ruin your reputation. She's texting me in 2019 Scott Pick's, she's got picked, she's got videos. Something's going to meals, ask guaranteed DNA. She's got his shit under her thumbnail, I guarantee. And then a guy like bill has to keep a certain, like, I guess you know, standard about himself, right? You have to look at him a certain way in order to listen to what he's saying and what to take his, his information, you know, correctly, I guess. Seriously. Yeah. Yeah. So he could lose all that equity in his audience. He's out there doing wild shit. He actually didn't tell him he's gone anyway. Is it over from bill while he's not on Fox News anymore, he's podcasts. He was the number one guy and they were like not worth it. Yeah man.

Speaker 6:          00:28:44       Y'All be talking about cancer culture. Bell really got canceled. Real came over in a big way and I think he does do some type of broadcast and now, but nobody cares. Well he let out a book and the book was Number One New York time best sellers. Fox history books. Yes. You know, like, I don't even think he ran into him. I think he just puts his name on it. I wonder about a guy like bill though, because think about it like you started your own platform. You know what I'm saying? And people really care about your voice. Did people ever really care about bill's voice? The thing, check it. Right. So it's like sometimes you become a mouthpiece for a network or foreign ideology they believe in and this is the difference. This is how you find out if people really fuck with you the second you leave that network.

Speaker 6:          00:29:25       It's like when people leave ESPN and you never hear about them again. It's like, Oh, you thought you were bigger than ESPN. You thought you were bigger than the sports. They just want you to say strike ball. That's it. Yeah, so I think we learned that bill really didn't have all that cachet that we thought we hit. Yeah. That's why I like ESPN is a good analogy. That's why you got to get people like skip Bayless props. Yeah. You got to get your mail hill prop so they can go other places and people still care about what they have to say. Even if it's just in tweets. Right. I don't even know what Bill O'reilly's Twitter handle is. I imagine something around it like below where I'm sure it is, but you know what I mean? I see him, he's never known for like, Oh, Bill O'reilly said this on social media when the last time you heard bill O'Reilly say something, he might not even be, I made some news. Yeah. He might not even be own. It's tough bro. Yeah, he's podcasting from his like apartment or something like that. Dude is like, it's no background. Nothing really. Yeah, it's bad. He's not even wearing like suits. Skylar, NASA wealthy shirt below Rogan.

Speaker 6:          00:30:25       Well we gotta look him up. We got to see the girl, he fucking him and see how they're living right at the top. Guys like that. They say we'll just lay low for a couple of years and then someone will scoop you up again now, which is only right

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       one fox and Fox lets you go. Yeah. If you're one of those guys, those neo-con guys like you don't really have any place else to go. Hey,

Speaker 6:          00:30:42       too old to really understand the landscape of like how to navigate this new Internet space cause you've got plenty of conservative voices. We don't have those big platforms right to Candice on Tommy Lauren's bitch bro. I don't even look at them. Well no makeup. He really look at the, on the shirt. He's wearing a nurse's outfit underneath that fun pants on for sure. Guarantee that aura is based for a shirt for real under the what size is that button up? Shirt did that. You'd take his wardrobe. He's got old fat gut now. It's been drinking. No, this is not good. Those are the news. Watch the film fold. No Spin News. Nobody low riley.com now we need to get some new shorts. 81,000 views on whatever video that is. What is what is on Twitter?

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       There are no charges. You are presumed innocent in this country. This is not what the left wants. What is this about? Was he renting them out as April 19th well, maybe we turn your report. Scroll down. How many people are watching that? How many people have him on Twitter? How many

Speaker 6:          00:31:45       Oh, so you may million followers. He has and that video had 581,000 views. 10 you look at them right there in that video right now. Go down.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       Now scroll down. Do you think he's doing the orange thing to reflect triangle? 100% he's bringing them in. We'll look at that. That's 100% the orange thing. He looks like turmeric. Yeah, but he don't look anything like it looks in real life. That's like an Instagram. Whoa.

Speaker 7:          00:32:04       [inaudible] come on Bro. If you met him at a restaurant, you'd be like, wait, okay, wait a minute.

Speaker 6:          00:32:14       Not Update your picture son. You had to pay that woman $32 million. Fucking disappointed. Just it keeps getting more orange. Go down raw. That's [inaudible]. People are watching video watching it. He's got 500,000 views. Yeah, definitely watching it. But now he's in a vacuum. But it's those crazy old white people that live in Kansas. Yeah, but they don't have Twitter. Hey man, I went in when, you know what I'm saying? If you got 580,000 people that can watch it when you put up a video and you could still get paid for it. I'm cool with that. It's true. You know what I'm saying? I think we put too much emphasis on like whatever mainstream it is. There's no such thing as mainstream cause there's not just one scream anymore that's over. That's why. And shouts at Brennan Shab. That's why we wanted you guys to connect because I feel like you guys represent the most.

Speaker 6:          00:33:02       I think you will are both the most influential people in media. Right? And you represent, put that kind of pressure on me. Well, I think that evil on me, Ricky, Bobby, I think it's important. No, because I think you guys represent, and I think the illusion was before I went on, before I went on here for the first time, the illusion was that these things operated in separate spheres, right? That there are these different vacuums, like the Charlemagne world, right? And then the Rogan world. And then I went on, I found all these people that knew me from our podcast. They also listened to yours, right? So it turned out in that moment I was like, Oh shit. It's not as fractured as people thing now because everybody's aware. People will always been hitting me for years. Like, yeah, you got to go on Joe Rogan.

Speaker 6:          00:33:41       You've got to go on Joe Rogan, or you've got to go on Joe Rogan. So there's clearly that the worlds collide connected, especially this internet wave that we're on right now, the Internet we have people are craving this type of information. They're craving the type of interviews you guys are doing and talking to the people you guys are talking to. Right, and I don't know, for me, this is really cool just to see people like the fact that everybody could do everybody show. It's not like, like Jimmy Kimmel never does psych the Seth Meyer show, but you know what I mean? It's like everything is not, that world is very disconnected. Yeah. Whereas this world, the Internet world is like for the comics and podcasts, it's like there's no competition. Everybody helps everybody. Everybody supports everybody. I mean that's one thing I've always noticed about your platform. Like you've always bought on up and coming Comedians who just needed that extra push to for people to know who the fuck they are. You know what I'm saying? This is important. That's why you have ms paddling yesterday. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:34:38       genuinely funny. [inaudible] is insane. Like you can only take a story that sad in that tragic and turn it into a sitcom. She was talking, she was talking yesterday about her ex husband who shot her in the [inaudible] her in the head, shot her in the titty shot in the back of the head, shot in the, he got her pregnant. It was fucking her when she was 12 got her pregnant when she was 14 with two kids by the time she was 16 she had an abortion when she was 16 with with his third kid. She called him up to try to get him to apologize to her. He wouldn't apologize to her. So she forgave him and she said it released like this huge weight off of her shoulder. She was talking about it like you can't believe her story she's laughing about. Of course not. Yeah, I'm not. I'm the, I got, yeah, def whole forgiveness thing. We talk about that all the time. I'm not with that whole like I forgive you and it makes me feel better. I'm fine not fucking with you. I'm fine saying, fuck this guy. Fuck this person. Like, I don't care. Like why I have to give you when I a manual movie just came out, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       uh, the shooting that happened in Charleston, South Carolina and like all of the family members for gave Dylan roof. And I'm like, there's one dude in there that's like, fuck him. He killed my mom. I'm like, yes, that's PR. That's a perfectly fine emotion. You go talk to your therapist about it, you allow yourself to feel like, yes, fuck him. Why do we feel like we got to forgive and in a way that comes off our shoulders

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       for her, it was like she was carrying around her whole life, you know? I think for her it just helped her and she knew he was a piece of shit when she was talking to him. She said to him like, you are fucking me when I was 12 years old. And he literally said this to her, your mind, your body wasn't 12. That's what he said to her. And she was just like, so she decided after that like, I'm not going to invest my energy in this cause I'm gonna let it go. Let it go. So she just doesn't fuck with him. Doesn't talk with them and she doesn't, she doesn't carry around the hate. That was a, it was poisoning her.

Speaker 3:          00:36:31       Yeah. I get it. And I understand the power of forgiveness. There's a reason why it exists. Right. There's a reason why it's, you know, it's still here for thousands of years. This idea of, hey, let's forgive so that we could feel better. Right. I think, I think, I think usually things get weeded out if they don't work

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       well. It's hard to forgive someone that doesn't feel bad about what they did. It's one thing if you like, man, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I get it. You're a person. Human beings make mistakes. I forgive you. But if someone is like you were, you weren't, you weren't 12 with your mind, your body, and he's talking about fucking you when you were 12 years old. Like I have an 11 year old daughter. The idea of I'm a grown man, fucking her violin.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Yeah. Yeah. You're not gonna forgive him. You know, you might fuck him up and then after you fuck him up, he'd be like, you know what? It's all good.

Speaker 5:          00:37:14       Well, no, I'm saying you put a fucking hour on his fucking gun. That's it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       So maybe forgiveness is misconstrued. Maybe you're not actually forgiving the person and letting them offer what they did, but you may be just re removing them from your consciousness. People forgive when they not gonna do shit. [inaudible] realize I'm not going to slap the shit out there.

Speaker 5:          00:37:34       Punches you in the face. You're like, I forgot to you go [inaudible] I'm attaching myself to Jesus because I can't carry this no more. [inaudible] I don't know. We do. We don't know. We do. Sometimes we make mistakes. We all make mistakes out here. And when somebody who gets punched in the face and be like, Yo, you got it. You got Sam [inaudible] forgive me. I'm a Christian. You're fighting. You might attach me to the worst part, my state.

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       By the way, that's probably when I would get to that point of forgiveness when you want to do something to somebody so bad. But when you get the opportunity you don't and you realize it's not that important to you, then at that moment I might be like, you know what, God bless. I wish them the best. When you guys have like surpassed people in your career that were pieces of shit to you as you were coming up, did, did the anger that you had towards him totally leave your body? No, absolutely not. Hold onto that. She books about it.

Speaker 5:          00:38:30       Yeah, totally. Like Jordan at the press conference, I need you. And by the way, God bless

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       you with the facts are the facts. You did fire me. Right. You know Boogie d from an it firm in Philly going [inaudible] you did fire me for no fucking reason. You did that happen. You're listening what you're doing right now. How are you feeling? He goes over, he does radio in Saint Louis. He does. Yeah. Yeah. Cause they told him that if he, um, if he fired me and whatever he bought in didn't work, they were going to send him back to Saint Louis cause he had moved from Saint Louis to do be the PD in Philly. And so he fired me. What he bought in didn't work right. And they kept their word and they sent it back. And Saint Louis Garbage is probably the best thing for them though. But everything worked out for everybody. He's living a great life in Saint Louis. I'm living a great life.

Speaker 6:          00:39:21       Oh life. Have you seen that? Uh, uh, Jordan, uh, what does it get into [inaudible] what was it? A training. He wouldn't stop talking about journalists Brown cause they remember every single thing and that was his, he's Bernard Hopkins. Remember we were putting on happens a fighter. He needed to be the villain. He needed to be the heel for the motivation. Y'All don't have people that

Speaker 3:          00:39:43       shitting on y'all and like, you know, when I surpass them it goes away and not for me. And when I start passing it goes away. It's weird. It's like bullying. I'm not saying it goes away, but I have to remind you to remind you because you told me I wasn't going to make it. I'll tell you this.

Speaker 6:          00:39:59       When I was starting out as a comic and I was, you know it was rough in New York, motherfuckers are just dickheads. Teacher used to carry a, a list of people who are pieces of shit in my wallet. All the people I was going to say fuck you to when I passed him and as I would start to pass them, I felt zero, I felt was your anger. I almost start to feel bad. I go, Shit, you're still in the same place. That's why you were addicted me. Cause I was all you had to be a dick to well that's the type of person that is a dick to someone who's coming up. The person who is your fee. This famine mentality. Yes. She think there's not enough. Yes. So you try to keep people away, get away, get away. Whereas the people that don't have famine mentality like, come on, come on, come on. Let's do it. Plenty for everybody, for everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       Like if you like I'm been five, four times from radio, you know what I'm saying? So I'm not angry at the people that fired me, but the people who told me things like, like there was a guy named Dj Cath and Sean's the sideline who told me I wouldn't be my first time I got fired. He told me I would never work in radio again cause I was an asshole. And then you know, Boogie Dee told me, this is why you'll never make it in radio. So those two individuals just need to be reminded. So people need to know that they may [inaudible] you like to know the person that cut Michael Jordan from the basketball team. He had eyes glow. Wouldn't you like to know the person that didn't hire Oprah? The news cast the back and they would you like to know if people just want to know these people. By the way, I've had other executives in radio, you know like [inaudible], my God dark winters doc when it's told me that one person in particular, he would never hire because they fired me and couldn't give him a reason why. When he asked him why,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       he was like, I just did. I just, I didn't, they didn't like what he was doing and he was like, I never hired that person. So that's why certain people need to be told,

Speaker 6:          00:41:42       being reminded about the decisions. They made it like a cycle. Know Francis

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       also that you get hired for these jobs and you can get fired by these assholes and there's always that weird power play between producers and executives. That happens with television shows and networks and it happens with radio. It happens. This, this a power play. Yeah. The thing about comedies, it's like, you know, you just work at a different club. There's no real, the only, I mean there's a little weird struggle between you and the other comedians, but there's no where real struggle between you and a club. When you go in there, you sell out, you kill and you're friendly to everybody. They don't give a fuck 100% thank you. Here's your money

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       bro. They lash fucking care. And it doesn't matter how much of a diva you are. Everybody knows this story in comedy. Eddie Griffin, you know Eddie Griffin, writer anywhere has the best rider in comedy. He has a writer. Oh did he give me writer? Oh he's had it forever.

Speaker 6:          00:42:30       Oh, so he had a ride. A ride. No rider mean like the thing, it's all about me pronounce this shit wrong. [inaudible] go man. And he's great. So, but apparently his his rider, which means like the shit that's in the green room. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:42:49       Any needs a brand new pair of air force ones for every show.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       A lot of people do that. What? Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people have like sneaker riders. Wait a minute. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:42:59       fucking up. Cause I haven't asked for anything but water. You would think sneakers are the most important thing in standup, right? Like you need to fucking shoot when you're on that page. Hold on. There are more than just Eddie has some guys have it where they

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       want a fresh pair size eleven's whatever. They were right there. So they, they get to the plate, they number one to wear them at all until right when they get on stage. That's it. Yeah. What's in your either I just was like Jack Daniels wine meet, um, water, simple sugar free, red bull kind of meat. You're not specific with me? No. Like, like meat plates, like roast beef and shit like that too, just so I don't eat garbage, you know, stuff like that. Nothing. Nuts. Macadamia nuts and pistachios. Normal Shit. Red M and m's,

Speaker 6:          00:43:45       Kelly Green ones pick out the green ones. They, I mean, that is what you're saying about standup is the beauty of independence though, right? Yeah. That's why. That's why everybody who gives me to run through the standup stage afterwards because the comedy clubs still accepted.

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       Did you see that tweet? I thought he was, uh, I forget what word or something like that and he was like, oh, Jay, we'll be doing stand up in three months, dude. Do you watch those?

Speaker 6:          00:44:07       No. Why do you, why do we it? She love it. I love that term Twitter world. There's a lot of bs out there. Now there's me off that. He does videos on Twitter. That shit to Instagram doesn't know. He thought he thinks Twitter is bad. Thanks.

Speaker 2:          00:44:27       He's holding his reading glasses in his hand. I mean he's going blind. He's 71 old. He

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       just see the, the, the DME sent that dude amazing with all the,

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       all the knife emojis. What'd y'all do you understand that with strategic, right? He sent that on Monday. Monday was the 25th anniversary of the fucking Bronco Chase. So you think that he didn't just want to be in the news like that was a, that was a strategic move.

Speaker 1:          00:44:48       I don't think he's that smart. I think what's going on is he reacting to someone fucking with him and he doesn't, he doesn't know how to just let shit slide. So somebody makes a parody video or he's doing his Twitter hello Twitter world and then someone's got hell please

Speaker 3:          00:45:03       background. That's a great deal to me. He gets mad and new DMS. That person who made that video? I'm going to cut you. I don't think they said I'm going to cut. Yeah. Yeah. Strategic Man. I think he knew it was the 25th anniversary. The Bronco Chase and old ojs only relevant is the fact that he got away with murder, so he has to remind us of that fact all the time in order for us to give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       Did you ever see the videos he did when he was doing rap? When he's dressing up like King in Miami? Yeah. He dressed up like a rapper. Yeah. You said no yet Jamie. We can't, we can't play it. Right. You get pulled off of youtube real quick. That stuff was faked that DM stuff at the end.

Speaker 3:          00:45:42       Oh Wow. Yes. I listened to Jim and Sam yesterday actually like

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       rub it down instantly. He made an a fake account with like it though. It was the real Oj. He just made the l a capital. I

Speaker 8:          00:45:53       Ah, [inaudible] gave him

Speaker 3:          00:45:57       he day for no fucking reason. God Damn Lucky your I'm and I'm back. I'm glad. I'm glad he's not that stupid. Right donkey today. The second one, I'd go in the breakfast club. I get somebody to the credit they deserve for being stupid. I'm like, yeah, you can't be that stupid, that thirsty for attention Oj. So, so it's kind of, it's kind of a relief that he's not

Speaker 1:          00:46:14       that thirsty. This is Oj when he was doing rap music, all right, well no we can't and now he is. He can't play the music. But he had girls out there dancing around their underwear and the Oj was rapping to me. Have like a crown on or something. There he is dressed up in like white face and all sorts of things. There's naked girls in it. Oh God. You don't think Oj man riding a wave of killing these two people for too long, Bro. Crazy bitches will still fucking guarantees. I don't understand this, this, this part of women at all. Like the women that like meet people in jail and then they're like getting married to them in jail. Like what is this about? It's thinking about that Jill Dick, when they come home and jail, those guys never get to give them that jail Dick. They're in jail forever and then get your conjugal visits and they still want to marry him. But why are attracted to killers? So they want killers. They want killers in specifically they want killers that kill women. What? Yeah, that's a thing with some women with really fucked up women. They, they're attracted to men who kill women.

Speaker 3:          00:47:10       God Damn happened. The girl just wanting to get choked. No. Why? Why? Why go? Why you got to go to that extreme? Spanky that's all I'm going to just ranking. Do you think all the choking

Speaker 1:          00:47:22       they know and like, you know how like some girls have like rape fantasies and shit like that. Do you think that's all because men have just become such pussies, they want to see if they have the ability to even do it? No. I think some girls have this primal need to know that you can kill them. But what don't they know that this turns him on? Turn Your Daddy, right? Yeah. Protect them. It's a tech kill them. Yeah, for sure. But they want to know you could kill them. Not that you're going to kill them or kill someone else. Trying to get them that hand on your neck choking you. They want to be like close to the door of you doing something viable to them while you're fucking them. So it feels good. Why you got control over their life? You really have like you're holding their natural. Yes.

Speaker 5:          00:48:04       So why do we up too

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       dudes that like jerk off with like a belt on her neck and choke them. We call them Weirdos. Women. Yeah. But that's different. Does, that's on our erotic is fix the [inaudible] it is. But I think the choking is, you're doing it. A man is doing it to you. It's not just that you're running out of oxygen because someone is squeezing the blood out of your brain. Right. But it's also that someone's doing it to you while you're while there. Do you guys go for the whole choke? Because what I do is I like put my hand there and then I kinda just tense my forearm. But I don't really squeeze the fingers cause I want, you know, cause it's way to really show like that she won't let me do that. She wants the whole choke. No, she doesn't like that. She doesn't like that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       Yeah, because she knows you could do it. Well it's not just that, it's like she just did. You took people out regularly. She knows you're capable, but the kind of girl that wants you to children like that, I think you should leave that one alone. Dude. My wife liked the load shogun. I mean we've got, we've got no did all of that stuff and kind of like subsided, but she used to like a lot of choking. You know we've been together 22 years though. Yeah. You want to play, you have a John Doe she likes, she's nice.

Speaker 5:          00:49:08       Did I do? It's enough for us. It's happening to you. Some girls love it, man love it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       But I think it's really because they see men as pathetic. Now they see men as babies and the more pathetic and like cocked up a guy is there like, okay, choke me, slap me around, show me that you have some testosterone, show me you have some sort of frame gotta go give. Oh Jason Placido. Mike. That's right. That's right. They're asking. Oh, take the token. Richard Ramirez used to have girls visiting him Manson that was married when he died. [inaudible] Manson had charm. He must have had something. No, he must've had some, I've had fame. Fame has always been in attraction. People are famous in the beginning when he was getting people to do all that wild shit, man in Manson, right? Well he wasn't famous. Buddy was a cult leader, so, right. So he was the leader of a small group. So he was infamous. Infamous amongst that group of people.

Speaker 1:          00:49:57       But you got to at least turn a couple of people to turn it into a cult. Like eventually it becomes part of them. But if you look at social media, you realize that ain't really shit right and ain't really shit to have a following. You know what I'm saying? 500 followers on social media is pathetic. Right, but 500 in real life. Yo, you champion a man, Jim Jones. He's like, especially in 67 yeah man, you get 10 people, you get 10 people to kill herself is 67 man. Some people can't get 10 people to accommodate you. That's what I'm saying. That's a different kind of captive audience. Yeah. You would have met and know like you got a fax them like there's no organization. Everything has to happen in real life. Yeah. Peach, like that's wheel. He must have the speech when he made everybody drink the Koolaid, bro.

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       Let me tell you something about some he that must've been, they know they were drinking. That wasn't even cooler. You know? Cool. I took a bad rap. It was some like cheap Costco brand, which koolaid existed even back then I think who laid existed, so he went with the generic to me was some bullshit clerks. It's like they didn't have enough money for all Koolaid. Hey, whatever the fuck they drink, they serving it in the Dominican Republic. Every cocktail in sandals, performance is happening in the Dominican. All these people are dying. They should try to get that big PAPI. No, no, no, no. This is a dye that resorts, that was an assassination attempt hold. People are dying at these resorts there. They're listening to all these Americans that are being poisoned. One lady got beaten to death and raped. She didn't get beaten to death but like beaten half to death.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       She survived, but like her whole head was just big swollen, massive blood and injuries. Everyday at the worked at this resort, she saw him where at least he was wearing an outfit, clubbed her over the head and did all kinds of crazy shit to her and left her for dead. I read a story today. It was a group of high school kids who went to the Dr of celebrating graduation or whatever. All of them ended up in the hospital and nobody knows why this shit is happening. Nine people have died at these resorts and nobody knows what. A lot of them are dying from pulmonary edema and heart failure. It's like some blood issue and the drinking things from the Minibar, the Minibar, you know, we'll do a walk around the yard a minute. What is the number of buildable puts? The number of people if tied over then now it's like seven nine, nine, nine nine and it's happening in the resorts.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       The safe spots. Yeah, it's happening in the resorts. Fuck the dog off of. We got to go to Dr. What? What? That's hunting right there. Let's get into it. This is, this is, let's get to the bottom of it. Do you want really want to do some nature shit, Joe, you want to go do some major shit? Let's go hunt some rapists in the Dr. I wonder what's happening. I don't think it's just right back and got his right as people die from drinking. If they started drinking at these mini bars and drink it at these bars and like they've been testing the alcohol and it's like fake alcohol or some shit like that. I don't know what the fuck is going on. I just know nine people lived. Died. Yeah. I'm not gone. Nah. Yeah, I'm not going. Yeah, you can't take it. That's all it takes.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       It takes us nine people going, Oh fuck up your whole tourist economy, you would think. But we live in this era where people are like, Oh shit, let's go over there and see if we can survive the DVR. Like it's become like a fucking game almost. Yeah. Yeah. Well this one, anybody dies of a cocaine overdose. Everybody wants to shit. [inaudible] right where you want the good shit. You know what the shit they, no, never ever done it. You ever do coke? I fixed enough cold coins. I smoked in it, a blunt with some weed. Okay. Back in the day. But I fixed nifty, like it was like the lines are on the table and I just wanted

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       to make the people I was around feel comfortable almost like on some training day shit. I don't want them to think I was like gone to a couple of copies. So some mother fucking, you just do like this. Yeah. And you knock it off. Yeah. I just get a little on your face and you just go, whoa. Everybody's high, but it's not like they really do. Black does say Wu after doing coke too. I don't know. I did [inaudible] ric flair movie. I saw it. He let out a Goddamn ric flair. Woo. I've had that

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       t that Mata de cocoa tea tea made out of cocoa leaves. Yeah, those, yeah, the apparently the leaves, if you just chew them are actually good for you and they have the phytonutrients. It's like cop, it's like a cup of coffee. Okay. It's like, but it's healthy. It's actually good for you. Right though. Those high, those high altitude herders, they put a big wad of that shit in their mouth. They chew on it and then it releases into their bloodstream and it's actually healthy. It's not bad for you. It's when they process it and turn it into cocaine. That is bad. That's when it gets, what I've had is coca leaves in a tea form, so you just take the leaves and it's like you're in a tea bag and you drink the tea. It just makes you kind of like hyper and he talked to me.

Speaker 3:          00:54:32       I'm not gonna lie. When I smoked that cocaine with that weed by accident, that was the best high I've ever had in my mother. Really? Yes. I used to always say I would do it again by accident if it was all by accident on purpose. What? I think I'm too old for that shit now, but back then my God, I remember that high like it was yesterday. He said if you just feel like very alive, like you feel aware, like everything just seems bright. Even when it's dark out and it's just like you feel like you're actually on top of something. It's just like you just feel mad hypo. But when you crash you crash. Came over when he crashes. Tried Molly.

Speaker 2:          00:55:10       Yeah. Want to try them DMA and Dma yet? Yeah, same shit. It was once though. You like it or no, I love the feeling when I was on it, I did not like the next day I couldn't read. I was trying to read a magazine and I couldn't read. I was like, I just can't, I couldn't follow it. Yeah. My brain was so dried out to shut down. Just it was just debt. And then I've been on stage that night and ate shit. Yeah. Cause the synapses are firing up. I was slow and sloppy. My, my delivery was, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:55:36       all fucked up. Cause when you say shit, I thought literally I was like, Oh, I can't wait to hear this story. I was like, you started reaching in your fucking pants and you pull it out of my mind, dude. So I've been going to burning man last few years. Right. Real and uh, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:55:52       Got, get the hippie pussy bro. Dude, it's not even really like for me at least. I haven't even really been fucking there. No, no duty. You don't, you're not showering, you're all fucking hopped up on drugs and check. Yeah. I think like the fuck communities exist, but I don't want to sell it. It's, it's weird to like sell it, but it's a really cool experience. You would probably really love it. But, um, and I tried Molly and it was, you know, people say like when you try drugs it gives you, um, this heightened version of reality that you can't come to naturally. Right. And then you have a new perspective because of it. Some people say that about like acid or mushrooms at these types of things. Um, it

Speaker 6:          00:56:23       was weird used for the first time in my life, I felt past emotionally fill full. It was like excess. Does that make sense? You don't, you kill on stage and you walk off and you just want to like help people because you filled up the void and then you have a little extra, right? Yeah. So Molly put me there and I was like, oh, this is how people who feel no void operate. Like I was just calling my parents, I was calling my best friends and tell him I love him and I'm gonna take care of your kids if anything happens. Like w what the flow. Yeah. Maybe they gave you the courage to do things you want to do before, whatever reason you choose not to. Right. Because you know, before I'm busy trying to fill the void, right, be it through laughs or through content, whatever we're doing.

Speaker 6:          00:57:07       And here I had the excess and it was an interesting experience to make me okay, I can probably hit this maybe without the drug, I can do things in my life. Exercise or gratitude. Gratitude 100% that's the ultra hundred percent Dr Wayne w dies said that you won't find your true purpose. Your true purpose in life is service to others. So I think most people that are public servants and like give their lives to other people, like I think that's the ultimate high, but it's so crazy. It's like you don't get to notice that until you're there. Like it's so easy to sell. If you tell people, hey, you should be grateful and then you'll feel better. But if they're not able to feel the sensation of gratitude, you're explaining to them. You're explaining Chinese to someone who doesn't even know what the fuck the languages.

Speaker 6:          00:57:49       Yeah. It's like we're, we're all in this like unique situation where we've probably experienced that and we probably, you know, it tried to find ways to give back, et cetera. And then we felt really good because of it, where like, I should keep doing this, this, this is a really good feeling thought. But imagine someone who's like barely surviving. They don't, yeah, but they still have something to give. They just don't realize it. Like you might have $10 in your bank account, but guess what? It's a homeless person on the street that has zero. Right? You give him a dollar, you might feel great, and then we take that dollar and he's so appreciative. Like, thank you. Thank you. Like that'll make you immediately feel better. Yeah. Really just helping people without any, you know, you'd have no alter your motive. It's a great feeling.

Speaker 6:          00:58:26       It's addictive. I thought about that with Karma, right? Like we always look at Carmen, we think that calm is what you put out is what you're supposed to get back. No calm is just an action and you're supposed to do those things just because it's the right thing to do, period. Like also Karma involves you feeling the way you feel about yourself because when you do shitty things, you feel you have a bad self image. So you live in your Karma that people don't get. It's not like, here's a dollar for a homeless guy. Five minutes later I should get $10 it's not an investment Karma, right? It's I feel better when I'm acting right. It's simple as that. You can't run from yourself. You do. You go to sleep every night, you look in the mirror like, and when you jack off, you know what you're thinking about your Jackson.

Speaker 6:          00:59:06       I'm like, you know you, and I think a lot of people don't understand that concept. Like once you like, I can't do people dirty because I know I did somebody do it. I can't do something. I'll carry that. Cause I know I did something foul. You know? And even when somebody does something to me, I've, I've got to go through my files and my mind like, did I do something fucked up to this person? Did I do something to cause them to run yet this, wait, no, I didn't. That's their problem and that's the competitive advantage of sociopath's is they don't carry the negative Karma. Sure. Right. They have the interaction. We, the three of us would walk around afterwards like, man, I shouldn't have fucking done that. What the fuck was wrong with me? I feel like a piece of shit. They just go, no.

Speaker 6:          00:59:43       All right, that happened. I don't believe that. No. That's why they, if they're effective in business, that's why they're effective in politics. That's why you see these personality types succeed. No, with the ability to just destroy thousands of lives, you would just say, but I think eventually it catches up to all of them. I don't think it does emotional just suppressing shit so much, but eventually I think that just, I think that should just explode in them and causing them to go crazy if they don't fucking get killed. There are people though that don't experience any emotions the way we experience. No empathy. Yeah. There's, there's, they're broken. There's something wrong with the synapses. Yeah. Stuff like that for a long time. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I, when I started going to therapy is when I started like piecing things together, but I, I, I made myself cold just because of how to protect yourself.

Speaker 6:          01:00:25       Yeah. And how I felt like the world and the business was treating me. Yeah. At a certain point. Yeah. I mean I was purposely making myself code and I thought that was the way that I had to beat you fucking around and read books like the 48 laws of power when you're young and you know, you study all of these people who got to a certain point and they all had like this, this, this, this, this coldness about them. Like this ruthlessness. Like I'll step on anybody to get to where I need to be, but then you realize these motherfuckers up miserable. That's the theme saying, Dude. So you're on the island, right? Lanai. Yeah. Right. And were you hanging out with any gallon folks? All. Yeah. So there's this a comic and little Duvall. He's, he's, I really think he's one of the people who understands life better than anybody on this planet. My guy and good breeze. Yeah. He's a good buddy of ours. He's, he's fucking and brilliant. And um, he says, he goes, dude, for the smile bitch song. [inaudible] you go, okay Joe, when I'm telling you stop vendor comes out to that song easy man, let's talk. We were on is pious last time we were talking about how is he was going to do it man. Yeah. But um,

Speaker 4:          01:01:26       he's one of these guys, I promise you, his understanding of life is unparalleled, unparalleled to anybody I've ever seen. And you see a song like smile bitch, and we see it maybe on surface value, but everything he does has a purpose and he's aware of the purpose, right? He's aware of the energy puts out in the ecosystem and how it affects the ecosystem. And he was telling me how he likes to go to the islands. I visit him and Bahamas and he likes to be in the moms. And I was like, why? Why do you like to be here? He goes, because people understand what life is. Here. I go, what are you talking about? He goes, they don't get caught up in the bullshit that we caught it get caught up in the states. Right? And like in the states, everybody here thinks they're going to be a millionaire. Everybody. Yes, we have a lottery or reality show, some viral video, and you'd go to the island and they understand that they're gonna live and die there. And then they start to realize, hey, I got to just maximize happiness in life to try and get some chicken tenders on the island. When we were in Bahamas, it takes 50 50 minutes, an hour for fucking five chicken tenders. I'm like, why the fuck is it taking so long? And he looks at me. He goes,

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       why should they hurry? It's philosophy. The purpose is real Buddhist. Like it's a lot of it is a lie. He doesn't know. He doesn't know that. But his philosophy is like he's, he's aware of it. He don't even know what you call my nephew who was Buddhist. He'd be like, Hey, I didn't go to school. No Buddha. No. He thinks he knows instinctively. He no formal education comes from nothing and the way that he's found a way to understand humanity. It says competitive advantage in the industry is in. He just truly understands. It's fast. We've complicated this shit dude. We had that like capitalism is complicated things, you know the cultures that we strive to be a part of of complicated things. The truth of the matter is life is about treating people good, being a public servant and dying. That's how I, the crazy thing he goes, he goes, I love, I love it and this is what's hard to understand because I love hanging out with old people.

Speaker 6:          01:03:12       I'm like, why? He goes, because they understand life like what do you mean? He goes, you eventually get to a certain point where you realize you're going to die and all these things that you want to accomplish that you thought you had to accomplish and all this shit that you thought you had to get done in order to value yourself as is meaningless. It was just distraction. Until we get there. Yeah. That's the concept. I could you not believe hard to swallow too, cause you have to let go of Ego, right? You have to go, you have to go, okay, I'm okay as I am and I'm okay having a quick conversation with somebody or a good interaction today or just fucking sitting on the beach and looking at the stars. Right. These are cool things. That's just as valuable as having a youtube clip hit a million or something like that.

Speaker 6:          01:03:46       These, these things aren't any different in the grand scheme. A grand scope of things, right? Yeah. I believe in the law of attraction, right? Your thoughts become things. So that's why it's hard for me to grasp the concept of, okay, when are you going to die? Because in my mind I want to die when I'm 90 or 100 years old. But you know, you read certain things and you're like, no, you have to embrace it. You have to tell yourself every day you're going to die. Cause then you'll live your life like every day is your laugh. I that's a hard concept. You know CT Fletcher, I've heard that name. So he had a heart transplant last year and he came on the podcast a year after his heart transplant. And you've never seen a guy more than loving and open and friendly and thankful and tells everybody loves him and he's hugging everybody and just genuinely grateful because he was at death's door like legitimately on death's door.

Speaker 6:          01:04:34       His heart was failing him. His father, his heart had failed him is his brothers is like, he's got congenital heart disease in his family and he knew that his heart was going. He had had heart attacks, he'd had surgery and they transplanted his fucking heart and they put a woman's heart inside from two. Wow. Also fucked with him. That's why his lines. Wow. No, but I mean it's just like just that's one. The one that fit, you know, there was like this is matches you and we're ready to do it. Bam. So now here, here he is a year later, but that guy has like this renewed lease on life and he just, he glows like a, like a, like a religious figures. He got close. Tell concept for a movie like somebody who was a male chauvinist all his life and shitting on women and then had to get a woman's heart as a whole. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       move yourself. Put Nail Polish. I'm jealous for no reason. Wow. Yeah. Interesting. Crazy. Yeah, it is interesting. It's like that's why now we're getting to the fuck up thing, right? Like this idea of there is no good and bad things just are et cetera. Right. But like, but there's good and bad and how the, the energy that you put out, how it affects people. If you do a bad thing and it hurts a bunch of people's lives, that's you're really, you're changing how those people are going to interact with all the people they experience as well. You fuck up the ecosystem. There's a ripple effect with the ecosystem. Right? But like let's say you look at like you were early, we were talking about like bears, right? Or maybe I was watching a clip of your show, but you're talking, I think it was who you and Duncan and you're like, bears really just attract baby animals.

Speaker 6:          01:06:02       That's what they eat. They eat baby deer, whatever they can, but the, the most, most of the baby deer, that dog and Eaton, they just, they're like animal pedophiles. They're just killing fucking kids, right? That's what they do, right? That's what they fucking do. Coca Cola, Coca Cola sponsor is an animal pedophile, just eating baby seals. Right? So that in our culture would be a piece of shit. What if there was a group of people that just killed kits? Right? We would call them pieces of shit. That would be a bad thing. Right? But that's just, you've acknowledged within the, you know, the ecosystem of that with those animals, it's necessary, right? The bears need to, how do we know though? How do we know there's not fucking groups of animal rights activists, animals in the woods saying he's fucking man video. We don't know what these animals are really talking about and really discussing, you know the shark fin soup, Yo Charlotte, you know what? Shark fin soup. So they cut, they just cut the fins off the shark and then they'd let the sharks sink to the bottom of the ocean and die and die. Right. It just sing to them. I can't swim. It just sinks to the bottom and there was somebody tweeting about how horrible it is. But I bet there's a bunch of fish that are pulling up on that shark. Like, Oh look what we got here. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:07:17       Right. So say you've been there, don't just stay there when they see, you know they get the fuck on and hit them and fucking humans with them guns again, like I think animals are way smarter than we give them credit for. Well they have instincts. I think they got a little more than, than things. Some, some do, some animals are smart. You know what's interesting? Moose are some of the dumbest, the dumb as fuck, but because why so big? Cause who's gonna take them out? There's so big. All they have to do is stomp, stomp wolves. That's all they have to do. Wools try to come after him and then they just came off. If I was a moose, I'd beat them too though. Cause I'll be looking at y'all like y'all dumb. Y'All really out here with us. Yeah. And I just, motherfuckers got the, you don't have the nerve to try me shooting at them more than you're like fuck he shot. It's like from game of Thrones. What that, what's that guy's name? Thorn and [inaudible]. No, his Iq, but I can't imagine. It's incredible. You think six, nine, 300 pounds. You've got to figure shit out. It might not have to, but some dudes choose to this giant dudes that are

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       smart as fuck. Small Cox. That's what level people would like to think. That's what I have to think. You have to make yourself feel better. Maybe six, 900 hammer. Always say that about Shaq. Someone saying that about, oh, he's got a little Dick. Uh, compared to who or no, I ran, I ran, I ran. I would compared to a bear

Speaker 3:          01:08:32       current stuff is book current stuff and said she had sexual relations with superhead. She said it's not little, it's just regular. So it's like his dick probably look big on me

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       when on shack, right? Like nine inches ain't really big for you. Shag Chris Rock joke about the background and he's like, I don't have a big Dick but I've got a small background or something like that so it looks like he's so skinny. That is Dick. Oh, got you. Got You. Got You. Got You got to check. Needs to come through at the time Warner remote check the 15 inches on his dick. Yeah, that should be set. That boring company. What does that call Joe the barn complaining. A lot of flame thrower that, that's what shocked me. Ain't got to disappoint a woman. I guess what I'm saying it's like,

Speaker 3:          01:09:16       like with CT Fletcher, right? He needed to see death in order to like have this amazing revelation about life and maybe the fucked up things that happened in the world. Right? Maybe if there is some sort of designed to all this, maybe the fucked up things that happened in the world allow us to have a little bit of empathy and joy for being able to be here. But you got to give a fuck about life first of all, because I can think about all the near death experiences I had, whether it was somebody pulling a gun on me, whether it was, you know, me being drunk as shit and wrecking my mom's White Lumina Caravan and literally the only reason I survived because I didn't have a seatbelt on it because I was so drunk at the impact didn't kill me. I didn't think about stuff like that until decades later when it happened in the moment.

Speaker 3:          01:09:55       It was just like, all right, whatever. I got into a wreck. Oh I got a gun pulled on me. But when you're old and you know, I've got three daughters and I look at my wife and I looked at people that love and care about me and I really appreciate and value life. Now I started thinking back on that shit like what the fuck was I think like I didn't give a shit about life back then, but I can get an anxiety attack thinking about those past moments because those past moments would have caused so much not to happen if I died. Yeah. So you've got to care,

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       you got to care and you have to have something to care for. And that's one of the things that really changes when you have children. Oh absolutely. Just change. Chappelle said the best thing to me, he said not only did it change how much I love, he goes, it changed my capacity for love.

Speaker 3:          01:10:35       It teaches you how to love. Yeah. You might not even know what real love is until you have children and you realize like, man, this is like my heart walking around outside my body. Yeah. And you feel a different level of love with different level of empathy. Like, like I remember my, my daughter had attracted me like two or three years ago and she was learning the long jump and you know, it was like the first time she ever did the long jump. So it was literally, it wasn't even a meet with like practice, right? And so she goes and do the jump and I just, I go, oh my God, that was horrible. And she just burst out into tears. And I'm like, well what the fuck did I just do? What did I say? My wife was like, Yo, what's, what's your, what's your problem?

Speaker 3:          01:11:10       And then other parents would come in like, oh, it'll be fine. You did perfectly. I said the fuck up. She didn't do good, but I didn't understand that my word meant everything though. Her like everything. So I just took all her confidence out of her and just that one snap of a finger like fails and that shit, even thinking about that shit now hurts my heart, but I've never made that mistake again. Now I'm the father of that, that that overly tells her how great she is. And I know how to explain to her if she does something that I necessarily don't think it's great. I know how to explain it to her in a way where she can do better and she's very receptive to that changes who you are. You how many kids? Three daughters too. Oh, you as a whole in the past life.

Speaker 7:          01:11:52       Let me see. Go wrong. I'm telling you this is Carol. You versus meeting right now. I swear to [inaudible] girls. [inaudible] I know, I know for my whole, when I see

Speaker 2:          01:12:07       about how much it changed, the way I feel about life is that when my daughter was little, there was two bananas and a one of them was brown and fucked up and old and one of them was perfect. And I looked at those who bananas and I know my daughter loves bananas, so she'd probably want that Nice Banana, I'm sorry, eight that fucked up. And so while sitting there eating this mushy mashed potato texture, banana, I was thinking about this and not another person in this world. I would do that for because I love my wife. My wife is an amazing person, but it was just me and my wife. I'd be like, Ooh, I guess that bitch is getting the shit.

Speaker 7:          01:12:45       You had asked her three times. You show baby sure you set it on. The [inaudible] is perfect. He just asked the wife three times. They get it from the start.

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       You would literally, I'd jump in front of a bus for her. It's a different thing. So like this, people say I would die for you don't mean it most of the time unless they're a Serb soldier who's wanting to dive in a fucking grenade. Yes. But if I could die and I knew that my kids would be happy and healthy, but if I lived, they would die. I would.

Speaker 3:          01:13:17       Dot. I flew out. I flew out. Uh, I flew out here. I left. I left New York five 30 this morning simply because I was supposed to fly out last night, but my daughter had attract dinner, which I forgot about, and it was literally like attract dinner. It's in a fucking gym and they're serving chicken tenders and Lasagna and pizza and listen to the old town rolled Tinder

Speaker 7:          01:13:37       different times. Everybody gets to participate. Participation, trophy talk, please go 11 places. I'm like,

Speaker 3:          01:13:45       ah, but I stayed just to be there. I changed my flight and everything just to fly out this morning because I needed to be there for that track. Then that's dope. You don't do that for people that you don't absolutely love and adore. So here's a question. You both have these kids and you need to balance loving them so much and telling them to the most amazing people in the entire world and not making them horrible human beings.

Speaker 2:          01:14:10       Well more than that, and making them weak

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       and not making weak. You have to give them a diversity or they'll never know what to do with. I think sports is the key. The key to that make them do not know that it's difficult. Well, I know what you're saying about participation trophies, but get them involved in something competitive where they have to struggle so they'll learn what it's like to lose, to learn what, what life is like in a kind of controlled environment and then you can still nurture them and love them. The difference between people who participate in sports and people don't as you learned what losing is. Yeah. Some people never learn what losing is and they just are terrified of it. But they're not teaching these kids how to lose no more. Some in schools, schools, but I mean like competitive things like get your kids involved in martial arts, get your kids involved in these things that are just, it's very clear.

Speaker 3:          01:14:52       The binary one or zero. Either you win or you lose. Those are important. You learn, you learn. Like what struggle is if you have a race riot, attract mates. Perfect example. Someone fucking want and someone did not win. That's it. You know like who? Oh you got to cross the line and I'm second. Fuck, I gotta be first. How the fuck can I be first? I've got to figure out how to run fast. That's it. Will you guys ever, will you guys ever be openly disappointed in them? Will you show them that they let you down? The only time I'm that way with my kids, when they're mean to each other, I tell them I go, this is unnecessary. I know while while you're feeling this way, I know why you're mad at each other. Be can't be shitty to your sister. You can't do that.

Speaker 3:          01:15:31       It's a bad thing. You've got to learn how to take a deep breath and think about the consequences of what you're saying and every time you do do something Shitty, learn from it. Yeah. You know it's a learning experience. I think for me, I'm just like that when I, when I think that there'd be an ungrateful, okay, am I going, oh my oldest daughter is 10 my second oldest is three, but so she doesn't really understand. The concept behind the daughter is nine months old, but my 10 year old is had lived a very privileged life and sometimes you see that Bougie shit come out. And like I'm saying like, like little things like, like I love this island called Angola, you know what I mean? And we vacation like two, three times a year. Like these long, 10 day vacations, just like ugh man. Quilla cane. Oh, you know, we was on the Isle of, uh, we was on green, we was in Grenada and her and my niece because my niece comes with me all the time and they're just talking like, the food is so much better and cooler than here. I'm like, Yo,

Speaker 7:          01:16:22       no, the fuck I was doing when I was [inaudible] toys on fire and my thanks [inaudible] road in Moncks corner, South Carolina,

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       single wide. Fucking try to like that. The only thing that pisses me off to his lack of gratitude, but that's perspective issue though.

Speaker 2:          01:16:41       They'll never there. They're wealthy. They'll never gonna understand what it's like to be surprised. You instilled that in us. Impossible. You know, there's gotta be ways Ms Man, all of my favorite people have fucked up childhood, but I don't want my kids to have a child.

Speaker 3:          01:16:55       You're not supposed to. My mom, my mom told me we're here to make our children's lives better. Like my mom actually showed me like my great great grandfather's taxes. He had to pay one year and that she was like a quarter. What I'm saying like it was just something to light but back then was a lot of money.

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       So she was just saying that to me. Just tell me that every generation is supposed to be better cause I got this thing sometimes where I feel guilty about doing so well cause I don't have no fucking skill set. Like I didn't go to college. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm not, I don't feel special. Like why am I in the position that I'm in? My mother was a school teacher with 30 plus years. Most she ever made was $30,000 a year. So I can line up. I get that for a fucking appearance. So it's like that shit will make you feel bad sometimes. Like you'll feel a sense of guilt. So she was just showing me that to say, Hey, every generation is supposed to be better than the next generation. So our kids are supposed to be way better than us. Yeah, but don't you want to prepare them for that life? Like you look at any one of these movies or even stories about, uh, a king that took power and then the son that he has, Sonny has only some spoiled little bitch who ruins the kingdom.

Speaker 2:          01:17:56       Well, that's the thing. Find me a great man as a son of a great man, find me a man who's the son of a great man who's the son of a great man

Speaker 6:          01:18:05       because I'm great man. Always has these weak little sons. And it's like, how do you like maybe you do need to create adversity for your kid. Maybe you do need to be a Dick a little bit, and maybe it's selfish to be sweet to your kid all the time because you're not preparing them for the world when you're not there. I think you've prepared them for the world when you let them find their own way. Meaning like you got to cut the cord. Yeah. I don't want my, I don't want my daughter to get into media, you know, if they choose to. Cool. You know, my daughter likes the right now, so she wants to be an author. Fine. I'm not loving. I'm not really an author. I wrote a couple of books, you know what I'm saying? When it goes rider,

Speaker 7:          01:18:38       right. I think I'm not really an audit. That's all I want. I want them. I want them to find their own way. When they find their own

Speaker 6:          01:18:50       wait, then that gives them that integrity in that purpose and everything else that they're looking for them. I think when you hand them things, yeah, that's when the Eagle,

Speaker 2:          01:18:58       all that other shit I have to work for. What I see in the communities that I live in is I always like the rich kids that have nannies that take them everywhere and they don't see their parents very much because the parents work all the time and their parents vacation without the kids. They like to go places without the kids all the time. You see a lot of that. Those kids are getting fucked up and you see them as they get older, they're more and more vacant, more and more weird. More and more detached. Yes. You know, but the kids that around the family all the time and they do things with the family, then they get a richer experience. It's, it's neglect and it's the parents that are like super driven and they're never home. They're working 16 hours a day and that's why they live in this fucking giant mansion and drive around in a Bentley. Like though those kids get fucked up and they wound up getting on drugs and empty and looking for something to fill them up. Imagine your parents sent you to boarding school. I have a buddy of mine, 30 minus Brian County is a, his parents sent him to fucking boarding school in the United States and they didn't even live in the United States. They send him to another country. Jesus, where's Brian from? I love Brian. Brian is from all over the world. His Dad was a banker and international banker air quotes and uh,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       traveled everywhere and was involved in some weird foreign shit weapon deals. We can talk later. But he was involved in some weird weird shit and then sent his, was fucking 13 years old. Set Him to the United States to go to boarding school and Brian to this day, still a little shell shocked cause of it dude. And at your parents send you away. You feel like when you're 13 it's, yeah. Imagine if he was at that boarding school and got fucking molested or something. You would really hate life each parents molested. No, I'm just saying, let's just say listen somebody that's funny. That hasn't been, yeah, you got to get that funny diddled in. Something fucked up happened. Yeah. If you're fucked up, if you're funny, something fucked up. Some, some pain, some struggles. You have to learn it, you have to learn it. Why would you need funny? It's like, it's, it's why it's so rare to see people always say this about women, but like even attractive dudes. Like have you ever seen like a male model? That was funny. I was to say about girls carrot top, unless you fat, your stories suck. Real talk. It's true. Unless you have to earn pussy, like lesbians are hilarious. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:21:19       right fucking to talk to Tiffany Haddish. Yes. Tragic is, fuck. Sorry. Yes. She's not fat. No, no, she's not. But she had that tragedy. The tragedy. Yeah. Yeah. That does. The tragedy is the, that y'all say being a fat is a tragedy. Yes. Oh, for Shit. That's why miss pat is hilarious because she's, that's why. That's why you would never want your kid to become Miss Pat, but you love Miss Pat. He's not miss you. Let me spread only because like that's when you go through that kind of trauma. When you come out on the other side, you're really unstoppable. Yeah. Especially when you deal with what's going on in here, which is the toughest part, right? Yeah. I think that's what comedy does. Comedy is therapy for a lot of people, a hundred percent therapy for a lot of people. It gives you an escape. Well, that's why she was able to accept what that guy did to her and forgive him because she just, she's passed it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:15       Yeah, she's on the other side. Yeah. She's gotten through on the other side and it forces you to deal with the reality of the world. Like I think comics better than most people deal with the reality of the world and often it's because we went through some kind of real shit, right? So we go, Oh yeah, these things happen so I can let my mind even operate in it. When you exist in like a really privileged life, emotionally and even mentally, when you exist in that space, you don't want to imagine that there are people starving. You don't want to imagine there are people hungry or that their parents are abusing their kids. You don't even want to go there because you don't have to. When you grew up in it, you're like, yeah, that's what the life is. Where's the fun? My Dad could hit me for shit. My mom, when you travel, you can appreciate where you're going. Is your daughter's like again, he'll go again. I went to South Africa in December. Um, it was like the hundred view of Mandela. It had been his hundredth birthday or something like that and I took my daughter, my

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       10 year old daughter. So like a few months later she had a project in school where she had to do a project about Nelson Mandela in South Africa and so she had printed this picture of the Nelson Mandela statute and from Mandela Square and had it as the cover and I'm like, where's the picture of you next to the statue? And she was like, I don't want to use that. What the fuck do you mean you don't want to use the picture of you standing next to the actual statue in a Nelson Mandela Square? That's the point of these experiences because you're able to do things like that. I had to explain that to her. You have to teach her how to flex,

Speaker 5:          01:23:40       teach a class on how to start, Bro. You got a kid now, but think about how normal that moment seem to her as she was.

Speaker 3:          01:23:53       Don't even need to use this as a cover for my book. I think she's embarrassed. You don't think she didn't want the other kids to be like Kansas rich private school in Jersey. All these kids are doing well or not the kids, but the parents, all the parents are doing well. Like, yeah, like what did I, I yo would you guys, you guys got, you guys got some money and you've got kids. What'd you guys pay to get your kid into a good school?

Speaker 1:          01:24:15       Cool. Oh, like that lady didn't know no fucking chance actually earn that shit. Yeah. You got to earn that shit. You can't do that. Cause they're not going to enjoy it and they're not going to do, they're not going to work hard. Yeah. Some of those people paid a half a million dollars. Right. To get up, get a Shitty, shitty kid into some schools that they didn't deserve.

Speaker 3:          01:24:35       Yeah. And the kid's not going to have no passion for what they know in, you know what I'm saying? They just dare like they gotta fuck. It's just like having a regular piece of paper like I want, I want my kids to do things that they really want to do. That's how you change the world. You change the world when you're doing things that you, that you want to do.

Speaker 1:          01:24:49       Yeah. What's funny, I thought, isn't it those kids that went to the school like did fine at them. So yeah, so school's just a big fucking hustle. It's like if they didn't earn it based on grades, they should feel right the fuck out of the school. It's becoming a hustle just because of the way the world is working. Jane went to school for audio engineering, not a Goddamn thing he learned in school he could use today. Really?

Speaker 9:          01:25:11       Yeah. Yeah. I mean for the most part I got the touch. Some stuff I could never have touched before.

Speaker 5:          01:25:17       No. [inaudible] at that time it was,

Speaker 9:          01:25:24       it's like 2005 maybe youtube didn't exist and there wasn't the plethora of knowledge out there that 12 year olds are teaching you how to record audio now. Whereas I had to learn from the guy that was recording mnm and Jay z and all these guys, doctor tray. Right. Like they can't really do much with that job either, besides teach it now either. So

Speaker 3:          01:25:40       that's why I like the go back to Joel's point when he said I'm the last and radio to reason. I'm probably the last thing radio is because I'm the guy that steering people away from radio when she's come up to me and I'm like y'all want to get in the radio? I'm like full what? You can start a fucking podcast and like, you know what I'm saying? Like it's all type of different ways to be heard. You can go on youtube and if you want to be a VJ on TV, you can start doing your own video countdown's on Youtube. Like why you need TV

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       or radio to do middle man gone. Yeah. We didn't have any of that growing up. I had to be on the radio. You had to be on radio, you had to be on TV. We didn't have that shit

Speaker 2:          01:26:13       growing up. Now I'm even experiencing that with commentary for the UFC because I love doing commentary for the UFC. Be Known. I love even better. I do these fight companions. Yes. When you want to get in here we get hammered. He start smoking weed and talking shit and we watched the fights on the screen. We have the best time. It's way more fun than being there live.

Speaker 6:          01:26:29       Do you think that's the future of all live events? Right. So you could watch the NBA finals and instead of listening to the guys, you know Marv Albert or whoever do it, you could choose your guys that you watch the commentary with. Oh, so fight companion for basketball. Football.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       Well Dana Hart was doing that with Snoop Dogg. He had, he had a the Tuesday night contender series and snoop Dogg and Uriah Faber. We're doing commentary and snoop would just have a constant blunt lit and he was drinking tankaray and getting hammered hot and talking crazy shit. That was an option for the commentary. You should listen assumption snoop cast, it should be right. It should be every single one like got tired of doing it though. Stop doing it. He'll snoop is thought to be around Dana White. Ah, it's bright. I think he just got tired of having to be there every Tuesday.

Speaker 6:          01:27:17       Well that's a beautiful thing. Like we showed you the, excuse me, the NBA did this during the finals this year. They tried an alternative stream using the ESPN APP. Right. So the thing about this as you're doing it with ESPN guys, right? Correct. Correct. So it's like what would be great is do it with like the funniest commentary guys that you like in your life. Hear them too. Just the reason why people tune into your thing. Right. I'd guarantee they'd probably mute the TV. Right? The people who are watching, they listen to both. I think that's what people probably do. So they never let the good commentators commentate anything like Todd Bockley, kidneys, movers, shacks. You'd be actually commentating dorm the NBA and it would be incredible. It would be incredible for them talking shit to each other. Matter of fact, put them on a little screen in the bottom so we can actually look at them visually what they're doing. I Dunno, I just think of that

Speaker 2:          01:28:02       UFC, they have the best guys doing like Daniel Cormier. He does it and he's great. Dominick Cruz, Paul Felder, you know, they have good fighters. Uh, Michael Bisping that do commentary now. Columbia is the best though. Yeah, he's great. He's hilarious. Yeah. And you used to fight fuck gaze. The heavyweight champion. He comments. He's the light heavyweight champion and then the, he vacated his title and the, he's the heavyweight champion. Yeah, he does commentary. We do it all the time together. Wow. Together. Cause you guys get fucking, we're also good friends so we're always talking shit and we're laughing about things like whether it's a judge who's a nice lady but a terrible judge Europe. But this is like when, when Rose Nama, une is one the title, he starts screaming out thug row. Yeah. It's not like you guys turn into fans. Yeah. Well we are. I mean neither one of us are real professionals, but we do it for a living and it's weird.

Speaker 6:          01:28:50       That's my worst nightmare. Like to be out somewhere and fucking get into a argument with an MMA fighter. You don't realize that name if me no, don't say, oh she's terminates. Propel show where he got folded when keeping it real goes

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       wrong. When the got to hold him up. [inaudible] girl. I'm telling you. Got To chop. Forgive you bro. [inaudible] or other signs other than ears. Here's a good one. But, but the thing is you can wear at your cards. I don't have any cauliflower ear. I have a little bit on this year, but I wear ear guards. Get changes the way you hear things. You don't want that cauliflower ear the case your stick out already too much. Oh, they would stick out like a bat. Yeah, you'd have a big old knots and cancer. There's no other signs of, of what? Of a guy could be an MMA. No, not really. Like hands. What about knuckles? No, I mean you can tell and not tell. You know? It's not. You don't know. See, that's the way it's gotta be nice to people. Be Nice. Nice. Are you going to find yourself in one of those? You got it, Bro. Fucking Andy Ruiz, the new high champion. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       you look at his body, he would think no fucking way. And you look at Anthony. Joshua was sculpted out of marble. Ben Thought he was trashed, Bro. Yeah. It been saying we've Saint Anthony's hospital was not that guy. Never. He never had it. Never. He is literally Ivan Drago. Literally, he's the UK. Ivan Drago. He looks the part, ladies love him. He never had that skill in the ring. I told him that when he came on breakfast club. I don't think that's true. He got dropped by Klitschko and he came back to knock them out. Let's go with [inaudible]. She was a old ass man dude. And he's Ukrainian. He's got Chernobyl and them and shit. He was seminar. That's nuclear poisoning and shit. He was very old. He was trying to win an election for like this, you know, crazy. Because she's got a lot of things going on in his life.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       The real fight is to Deontay wilder Tyson. Fewer to, how about this tight security closest thing we've, we've had, uh, in the heavyweight division to Ali. I'm not going to say, I said after that, I said a couple of fights. I think he is the head movement. The foot movement at his size and weight. I leave was doing that 212 pounds. His head moves. That last fight was very Ali, like on an amazing deal, but Ali did that with George Foreman. You see there's a difference. The guy that he was fighting like that Guy Deontae Deontae he did it, but he also got dropped and almost murdered. He died every time I look at 12th round when Deontae connected and then walked back, went like that game over and the fact that he just rose up and then outboxed him for the rest of the round when I was over all those years of therapy.

Speaker 1:          01:31:19       That's all those years of therapy and meditation. When did he say he hit him and knocked him out? He was in that place of stillness. Oh, he knows how to come up. Absolutely chaos. It was chaos are weird, man. It's like sometimes the, the a punch does not look like much and it drops you and puts you away and sometimes you get fucking flat line like right there and it looks like you're over watched. I was amazed at the ref and gave him a cal, thought it was going to call him out. I thought, I thought the ref was going to wave their hands. Meanwhile, this motherfucker rises up and doesn't even look wobbly. Unbelievable. By the way, Anthony, Joshua can't beat Tyson fury. He can't beat Deontae while I know he can't beat Louis Ortiz. Well, well I don't have, Louis is all too, here's a good 90 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:31:58       The word is, and I get this from a reliable sources inside the fight community. Yeah. That Anthony Joshua got dropped in training camp right before the fight. Bad. Yeah. From Philly. Right. I don't know who, but bad to the point where he was chaos. Yeah, essentially. And that's why his dad went after the promoter after the fight was, you see his dad's screaming at the provider in the ring. Apparently he was just not, he's not prepared to fight. And he had, he was looking bad in the locker room that they were worried about. So we'll totally get a panic attack. Yeah. That's what I heard too. He had a panic attack before to fight and if you remember, we know it took him a while to come to the ring. Like they even played dance music and everything, but he never came out. And I was told that when, if you notice when he was walking out, he was rubbing his back and they were rubbing his head.

Speaker 1:          01:32:40       I already had a panic attack, fainting attack. If you've been Kao like within a week, you, it takes months to get your shit back together again. The whole world is like shaky to you. Well, equilibrium's off. So he was in there and then when he dropped him, he was like, Jesus Christ, can I go get him? No, no. When he dropped me or whatever, he's like, good, we've got it. Let's get this motherfucker out here. And then he went right at them and then boom, he got clipped and then it was over. There's a, uh, there was a, the biggest, what is it? The biggest upside heavyweight history is typing, right? Guess who got dropped and training camp. Tyson did, did he, I'm strapped and trends, right? I forget the guy's name who dropped him, but his sparring partner track them and training camp. There's video of it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:22       This video, the Human Kao. Let me took a knee, but still it's like got dropped your body shut down for a second and it takes time to recover from that shit and that dimension in the night before he was fucking a bunch of Japanese women would Bobbi Brown in the hotel room and doing drugs by the fives five at a time. Take a toll out. Yeah. They'll take a toll. Bobby Bobby said, Mike told him, I'll be right back. Bobby was like, don't you got to fight tonight? And he's like, yeah, yeah, I'll be right back. I'm going knock the guy out and I'll be right back. And he still got up and he still dropped buster Douglas. That's even crazier because you have a watch the 30 for 30 about Buster Douglas. No, they had the 30 for 30 in me. I didn't realize how much he dominated Mike Tyson, like round four round.

Speaker 1:          01:34:05       He was punishing Mike Tyson. Yep. I remember that when I was just a, Douglas is like one of the most talented guys that just didn't have the kind of drive and discipline that you needed to be a champion. But when his mom died, mom or dad is mom. That's what gave him all the drop dead. He was hooking off the jab on Tyson popp like in a beautiful way. His skill was incredible and wasn't afraid. It was a world beater. He was a world beater in that fund. We needed the motivation. No, totally feel. Fucked him up after that and yeah, basically done. No, he didn't. He was done. Yeah, but he's a, he's infamous. He beat Mike Tyson when it, when it meant something to beat Mike. I found out about it after the fact. I didn't watch the fight live. I had a Gig that night, not in real time. And then I watched it later and I still was waiting for Tyson to get up and beat him. I didn't believe him, believe it. I remember, I remember watching that fight and in my mind, I guess I wasn't really paying attention. I was just like,

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       this is longer than most Tyson fights always so low. You can have a dinner reservation on a Tyson. I'm like, and then when you finally got knocked down, I'm like, Oh shit. Mike just laws doesn't mean you've got to think. Not only did we grow watching Mike Fuck people up, we grew up trying to beat him on my Titan Punch. As you say, that shit was impossible. So it's this like dad, that was an unbelievable moment. I didn't feel like that we were weeding

Speaker 6:          01:35:20       Joshua though. Well there's certain times of people lose. You can't believe they lost. Like for me it was Roy Jones when Tarver knocks him out. I was just like, what on fucking White Jones? They stopped to this day, man. Unreal. If you watched in the second round. It's really interesting thing. It happens. They both, they both throw hooks and Tarver just gets there. Yeah. And we'll Tarver was actually a south pole rights. I think it's his is kind of like a looping left, but they exchange and Tarver just hits first. Roy timed it and this, what happens? I think when fighters get a little bit older they lose a fraction of a second and that fraction of a second earlier and Royce career, he's checking them and then he's moving out of the way. Well, I think the real there is is fine. Do you see it? Oh look at them.

Speaker 6:          01:36:04       Exchange ready. It's an yep. Boom. At one point it changes everything. Well, you know what Tarver coach said that Tarver beat him in basketball. Yes. And then when he saw that he beat him in bed, the bed or after, who was his coach? Mcgurk is buddy. Yeah. I think find that's true. Did we had, we had Roy on a, on a on flavor and two and a, I asked him, I was like, were you ever worried about like getting knocked out in like a, you know, losing something, leaving something in the ring and he takes a second. He goes, I'll be honest with you, man. I didn't come in the rain with much sense to begin with. So I wasn't really worried about losing it straight up. I've got a crazy competitive nature to Roy last, was it last year? Last year Roy was hitting me because he really wanted to fight Michael B. Jordan.

Speaker 7:          01:36:51       Yeah. Would be Jordan say that he thinks we were talking about on the podcasts like,

Speaker 3:          01:37:00       no, I really want to fight him. Road was like, y'all got the sponsors that can put them money up. I think it was like $30 million. I made the call for him and Michael was like, Nah. He was like, Nah, we good on that. Like, Yo Roy would fuck Michael B. Jordan. Oh, don't let creed fool you. Don't let fucking kill mom game black pants. You still run up on one of them old boxes right now. Muscle memory will get you not them. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:37:22       And some would even be close. So horrific. And isn't that what happens is like some guys start, they start fight fighting or they start to an MNA, they start doing a little Brazilian Jujitsu or some shit like that. Right? Yeah. And they put a couple of jokes in it, like a safe controlled environment and you get that like delusional. Yeah. Confidence. And that's why sparring so important. Do you remember the first time you guys sparked? Sure. I'm not the first time. Well you were doing since you're a kid, right? Yeah. Okay. I mean the first time I started before I went in the ring I was like, oh I got this. It's just combos, whatever. I almost fucking frightened. Frightened when the we're coming back. Yeah. I was just a shell. I just stopped. Yeah. Miss bought since the last time I was born. I swabbed with Shawn Porter.

Speaker 6:          01:38:01       Really? Yeah. This was nuts. He was actually throwing punches. Yeah. Cause I was mad. But this shit don't mean nothing. He was dodging. I'm surprised he didn't knock your ass. Hell Bro. And this is one of the, there's this guy's head movement is impeccable them. I mean people have tried to tack them on the street and they missed it every single time. Cho, Cho, Cho. It's unfucking real cute is what do you got here? Here it is. This, you guys far look at him going forward. This is a PR move that's got a PR move I was trying to show. I know you're sweating. Mm Nah. That shit is in Brooklyn. And you gotta be focused cause there's people yelling in there. You're showing me and got on, make up. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:38:47       can I get a drop from the army? You lefthanded? No, I'm right handed. I'm just trying to throw him off a little bit. Really? Yeah. He did that on purpose, man. He'll know what he's doing. I don't know what the fuck [inaudible] bouncing word his mind. Do you know movement. Do you train in boxing or are we just doing this for a goof? Nah, I just wanted to go in there and I was like, fuck it. This is Shawn Porter. I'm a boxing fan. I'm like, you know what's the worst can happen? You get knocked the fuck out. Worst can happen. Is these mean? Yeah, you're right. That could be terrible. I'm just sitting there flat footed. Yeah. He's now, we not even really and we went three rounds. Wow. That was about to die at the end of the three rounds bolted a few times. That's why I haven't spots.

Speaker 6:          01:39:28       It's like stay in my fucking lame. You know what I mean? I hit the punching bag callins bars all the time and I'm like, Bro, doing? Yeah, Brian on that pry can DJ count? Oh no one person is not doing any cardio. It's Dj Cally Ruiz, one cal getting out of a car with a gun hanging out. It's like all the big guys. The day after the release was the title Kaolin Kaolin Kaolin been working out on snapchat for a whole year and didn't lose her motherfucking pants. This guy and got a weight watchers deal. God left the marriage, didn't really steal a weight watchers. I mean we are just watching this weight, this plus size models, right? And they're doing that now like Nike and the Nike store has like a big mannequin, like a fat mannequin, but they don't, they don't have plus size models from men.

Speaker 6:          01:40:11       Chill. There's nothing that enrages me more than fat models. There is nothing that enrages me more than fat for. Okay, let me just say something. As a comic, we want attention. We don't feel like we deserve it. So we make you laugh. So there's an even exchange. I get my attention. You get some joy. Okay, actor, they want attention and I'm willing to write the script, but they'll memorize some lines. So do a little bit of effort to get the attention. A regular model. It least she's willing to lose weight so that she can be looked at, but these fat bitches are just like, look at me. Stop using the word bitches in 2019 what the fuck that's, that's a, that's the plus sized model

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       mannequin. This is the all

Speaker 5:          01:40:56       dentist rage. You guys. The only thing I don't like about that in Rachel that they're like, just stare at me. I'm going to eat bread all day, but you should stare at me.

Speaker 1:          01:41:05       The only thing that bothered me about that, that's out of context because that's the oversize mannequin in workout clothes. Right? Right. She's going to lose the weight. Now she's trying to lose weight. Okay, so I need needed some context. This is workout gear. So overweight women who want to go lose weight. Cool. Other than that, why are you wearing workout gear? Because she's trying to lose weight. That's the only reason you'd be wearing it. She, she even bigger, if she didn't work out, she like Allen.

Speaker 5:          01:41:29       Cal didn't Jay, Jay,

He's the epitome of not being afraid to ask for things, but it looks like French toast. Jesus. Every time I look at him, it's French toast and he has no, Oh cal it minus the butter and the maple syrup. It

Speaker 1:          01:42:11       says the lost 15 kilograms. What does that 34 pounds? Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Lost 34 pounds. Listen, congratulates. You can see his dick now. Congratulations. Slimmer on the ride. He does look a little slimmer. Oh, okay. Maybe it's a little bit rose Christ's. I don't even know what that is. Our, we watch her. I respect that cal came from radio. Oh Dude. Cal came from Radio College, used to do 12 midnight to 2:00 AM, uh, on weekends at w Edr and Miami, if I'm not mistaken. He used to do Friday and Saturday night and then that was like 15 years ago. Right. So radio is a lot like comedy in a way. Right. And not like this, like a sort of a fellowship of radio people. You respect people who did it. Yeah. It's so, it's so few and far between that actually, I guess make it so to speak that you know who those players are.

Speaker 1:          01:43:00       You know what I'm saying? So yeah, in a way. Yeah. And there's so few like national ones, like who's like nationally known radio guys, Elvis Duran, there's maybe a dozen. Um, you, Elvis, Bobby, Tom, us. Tom Is retiring this year. What about Steve? Is Steve National TV national? Obviously those, and I respect Steve and I respect Ryan Seacrest and I don't really count those guys cause they didn't start in radio. They in grassroots cause didn't start in radio, wasn't he on own radio guy? Dan have no, a radio guy a lot. I did his radio show in the nineties. Okay. So he might've, he might've been none. He doesn't tell him on the show. He doesn't radio five jobs from American idol. He does radio day. Yeah, it does it in the morning. And he does that secretary radio. What do you like it like, hey, you're the one who won,

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       you know, come on be thing like that kind of shit. Why don't we run is never off. No, we work for the same company. I heard, I've seen Ryan walked out the bathroom like he's walking on stage to introduce the next guest on American idol. Like he's always on. Like how is a perfect example where like you're gay? Rumors trumped tear me to rumors. What happened? Remember when he called the me too and like a girl said that he meets who'd or whatever and then a girl who worked with right, something like that. And then everybody was like the gay guy.

Speaker 6:          01:44:21       Okay, sure. He's, he's not okay. What is he know? What is he, what do you call it? I don't know. Ryan is one of those people. He is a handsome, those fucking teeth. But you don't think about sex with him. So what is he right out with a letter. So what? ASEXUAL sexual, sexual. Oh, that's the old, it's a positive. Positive. Is Oh, closet to he's, oh, he's like, oh, you don't fuck dudes or chicks. Okay. I see what it is. Yeah. He's always on. I've, I've, uh, can you imagine him choking the girl? No, no. Absolutely not. I can imagine she's beating him to death. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:45:02       down in the middle of Bolivia, right. Is One of those people that when you hear something about him, you'd be like, Nah, not right. You know what I'm saying? Like you have that kind of personality was actually worked in a lot of people's favorite. Yeah. What's great for top 40 radio? It's great for secretaries that call in. Yes. You're the seven color. Congratulations. What'd you think about the finals of game of Thrones? That kind of shit that some people thrive in that, that frequency so good at being like authentic in the most inauthentic situations. Explain like, like hosting a show is why like America's got talent, all that kind of stuff. When you've got to be like really excited about somebody like juggling deldot's or some shit that's really inauthentic, but he kind of comes across as believable, like sincere that matter, meaning like this. His reactions and knows moments matter. I just [inaudible] care that no one cares. Chief man, that's a pretty man. He's America's host. He is, yeah. He's America's holes man. He said host some den in that slot, that's for sure. Big. The Rowan's say what did put him on Clark?

Speaker 6:          01:46:25       Does he do the New Year's countdown now? I've got a lot of jobs, man. Listen, they was [inaudible] they was probably in Dick's Kopeks cops up for like 10 years before they finally say, Ryan, just do it yourself. Right when he had a stroke and he was still do it. Not that your dick been dead, Bro. Wait, he had a stroke. He was doing out the side of his mouth, like to phase. He was struggling. He was definitely struggling to talk. I said it was so they kept them bad. Yeah, like they, and it went from he would it, but then it was just like they would

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       pop in on him and like some studio and he'd be like sitting there struggling and talking. I'm like, why do they keep willing Dick Clark out for New Year's Eve? Like you're actually depressing people before the ball drops. Oh, and then they had Kathy Griffin and Anderson Cooper. That was a great combination. It annoys me. No Man can shut up. I love Kathy Griffin. She enrages me. Just like the fat model, Kathy, because Kathy don't give a shit. I like Kathy would the same reason I like, I used to like join rooms. I mean, I say used to because she's dead, but I mean like, oh no. John Legend, they both didn't give a shit. They will cut from the same cloth. I don't know if they're cut from the same cloth. So man, I think so. I used to love Anderson and Kathy Griffin together.

Speaker 7:          01:47:35       You've never heard anybody say that you're guilty pleasures. Anderson Cooper and cat. Look at that chemistry.

Speaker 1:          01:47:47       You breakfast club. Now I'm saying she cut. She cut Trump's fucking head off. That was, that was a strange thing that would change. What was strange about it is the fact that she didn't think she was going to suffer any consequences from that. I think people forget that Donald Trump, even though he is the ex executive producer of celebrity apprentice and he was a reality star, he's the president of the United States of America. It's rules about threatening heads of state. Yeah. That you just can't do things like that. But it's hard. It's almost like a fucking flavor flavor became president. Right. And it would be hard for you to look at him as anything other than flavor flavor, but you better respect his position before those God damn minutes suits come knock on your fucking door at flavor becomes president. Well Donald's the first guy who was famous like other than Ronald Reagan, I guess Ronald Reagan was famous as an actor, apparently. Really famous, famous. I don't think he was famous, famous.

Speaker 1:          01:48:41       He was in big movies and then to the governor of California. You know, it's a weird one, right? I mean just having a famous person in a popularity contest is strange cause you got a built in advantage. That's how all of them are going to visit popularity contracts. Not all of them are going to be moving forward. Someone could say. Some people might say Obama was the first celebrity president. He became a celebrity though. I don't think he was one before now. No, absolutely. I think there was some, Nah, not Trump is on a different level. Domino's commercials, Bro. He has Trump had rap songs named after him like, hey Caroline. Yeah, an airline. I'm fucking hotel. I'd show him is on buildings all across the world. Giant Trump letters. He was a brand troubles. He might not have been the first thought. Trump was the first brand to run for president.

Speaker 1:          01:49:29       Reagan might've been the first star. Trump was the first brand, but he was definitely a bigger star than Reagan. I think easily it's Megan is before our time. It's hard to understand what it was like when he was a movie star, but I don't call it, it's called Betty White and after it's up to how big is still alive? She's still alive. Still kicking, checking. Do we have to like, do you have these people's Joe? I don't have her number. Okay. Was anybody in a while? You become famous. You get on a Rolodex like here, here's a list of all these famous Keanu Reeves, Betty White, some famous people where I texted him and I call him. I'm just like this so strange. [inaudible] feel like that. Mm. Steven Tyler's a weird one from Aerosmith and text each other and I'm like, Huh, okay. All right. That's the most surreal feeling that while it was weird, I never get youth today. No. It's humbling though. Yeah, but that's why I always say I don't, I don't do shit. I got no wait. I talk. Right. I know people who have real talent actually looked up to growing up that people like about you is that you recognize that in yourself. Yeah. You know that you're not, you're not oblivious to that. You're not delusional. I mean, I kind of wanted the room to be like, well, no, you are talents.

Speaker 5:          01:50:35       [inaudible] you weren't fucking normal. [inaudible] just double down on [inaudible] let's change it. Came up a little bit like that in that regard. For

Speaker 1:          01:50:59       people listening, they want to know that, you know, you know the, you can't play musical instruments sing or do something crazy. They want to feel like reflected like often, often at times I think they had a, your audience resonates to you like that. It's like you are asking a lot of times the questions that they would love to ask people. When I, when I listened to you, I hear somebody who is still a fan and that's how I, that's how I feel. Like I'm curious, I'm curious. I have a curiosity about things and, and I'm not afraid to, I don't, I don't know shit I don't have, yeah, I don't, I just got some experiences. I'm not an expert at nothing. Everybody did. I sit across from is way smarter than me and I'm fine with that. Let's have a conversation I want to learn.

Speaker 1:          01:51:38       That's good. That's no, that's what, that's probably why you're successful is the way to thing where people be like, oh, I can't believe you would say. You would ask you Elizabeth Warren about her native American ancestors. Did you see that? What do you call the original, well, Rachel's by now too, but did you see the interview with him and, and uh, Elizabeth Warren? Yes. He calls her out on the native American Shit. But you know, here's the weird thing about her. It's like I don't necessarily think she told the truth in that interview and I don't know how she did away with it when she said that the Boston Globe did an investigation. They said that she didn't it, she didn't in any way profit off of that or have an advantage. She got hired for apart from Harvard and she wrote native American on a resume. Like they hired her based on her at this city.

Speaker 1:          01:52:20       Yeah. Yeah. She's a liar. Yeah. That's a lie. Which is fine cause I don't have no problem with my politicians lying. They do it all the time. But I want you to acknowledge your lie and hold yourself accountable. Like none of this shit is disqualified. It's not the eighties anymore. It's not the 90s where shit like that ruins you. Just be honest. Like, look, I'm American. I've cheated before. I've taken shortcuts. I fucking used to put the cheat code in Mike Tyson all the time just to get Mike Tyson, give everybody else. That's what we're based on. So if she did that at some point in her life, was it a horrible thing to do? Absolutely. Does it make it a title for her? Make her a terrible person for ever? No, I buy what you saying though that she was told that she was native American because many people were and then they find out when they get a DNA test at this time. Didn't happen to you,

Speaker 9:          01:53:02       didn't have to you? Well it hasn't been disproven yet, but yeah. What are you native American? Yeah. It was like growing up around the time I was going to college. My it guy that works with my dad found out that he, he like filed the paperwork to, to his college 10 years after the fact and got a bunch of money back. And so my dad's like, well, we're native American. That's what we've been told our whole time. So we're trying to prove it right. Birth certificates and whatnot. And it's really hard to, because they didn't keep a lot of information back then. Right. So I put it on an application, got into Ohio state that way, caught them and it was real weird when I was in like the minority, uh, hauling. There's like on the orientation day, they was like, they gave me a letter to say show, but this, uh, like

Speaker 1:          01:53:41       you pulled out me and Elizabeth, you got your photo. That's exactly what might have, I didn't take a position from a hardworking, exactly. Cherokee kid did it in good faith.

Speaker 9:          01:53:51       I did. I had no idea. And it was the first time, just like when I sit him application and it was like, what's your race? I was like, I just found out I'm native American I guess so I'm going to put that and no one checked. No one asked. That's hilarious that people notice it. Yeah. I, I didn't know I was doing anything wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:54:06       The w the wild thing about that is like, that that conversation was like, people would ask me why I said that. I'm like, I'm just too dumb to know that that wasn't a question I wasn't supposed to ask. If you were supposed to ask that [inaudible] having a conversation. Yeah, I did. You're not as ridiculous. That's a huge thing. We need to find out how she reacts. The fact that she told a lie cause the rest of her life is her family. Did that fuck up the whole lineage. Ditto. Family Start Tearing Shit down off the wall like, oh my God, we're not native American. How many dream catchers were in the garbage that we can talk some saying holy shit, just feather sticking out a hefty bags. Once she learns that the whole family have to realize that we're not native American. I had to fuck up some family reunions or had to fuck up some tradition too.

Speaker 1:          01:54:48       Oh my Lord. There's a lot of people who were shaking their head after that one. She actually got the DNA test. Okay. Can we talk about how fucked up Ticketmaster is real quick? Yeah. You went through and talked about the dealing Maltitol. I just figured out it just put my mind to get on this thing. There's a text he sent me. Oh my God. Model Ticketmaster. We're going to take them all down. Okay, so take a master. You know what? The place where you buy tickets. I had no clue about this ticket master thing. I'm just starting to do some theaters and shit on the tour. So I'm starting to look at like what they charge to do. Like the processing and servicing, right? You buy, it's like a 30 or $40 ticket. I looked at yours, 40 odd tickets. $16 in servicing for a service charge. Yeah. Is it per ticket? Personal fucking tickets. We got it. They got to pay 40% don't they gotta pay for Shit in a venue? Like no you don't. That's the venue cost that you also got to pay. It's just a process that ticket and if you want to pick it up and we'll call another $3 it's unfathomable, right? So I'm starting to think I'm going, okay.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       So for the first time in my life I'm like, okay, I'm selling some tickets and everything's good and I'm just getting a piece of the door so I'm happy. Right. And my boy who's like this genius fucking kid, Oj Nigerian, all these Nigerians are geniuses. And he comes up to me. He's like, okay, but what about the processing fee for Ticketmaster? How much are you getting off of that? And I go, what is like, what percentage are you getting off of that? I go, nothing. He goes, wait, but you're bringing all the tickets sales. Why aren't you getting a piece of it's 40% of your ticket price? And I'm like, well I don't know. And he goes, and what about the data from the tickets being sold? Are you getting that? I go, no. He goes, hold on. So they're fucking you and getting paid to fuck you.

Speaker 4:          01:56:16       I go, what do you mean? He goes, the game is data. Now, any businesses successful right now was all about data acquisition, right? Any business and data is not how many followers we have on Instagram. Because they could take your account away in a second. How many subs that you get on Youtube? Cause they could throttle your search. We can see that happen all the time. It's direct connect to fan. Right? And what Ticketmaster has done is they're your ticketing site. They get your email, they get your data set, they get all your fans, they know exactly who your fans are. May email them and tell them when you're coming into town or when somebody else, they might like this like you. Exactly, and then they're getting paid an absorbent amount of money. They're fucking over the fans on it. So I'm like, I'm talking to him and he's like, Yo, we've got to just create another one of these.

Speaker 4:          01:56:53       We've got to create another system that gives all that data to the comic. Why is the middle man even there? We could create a way cheaper ticketing service that gives every one of those emails to a comic and it's like comics used to do back in the days by putting a comment cards on the tables and you collect them afterwards. You can have an email list for every time you go to Idaho and email lists for every time you go to New Jersey and email lists for all these different prices the most authors do. And Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart came up, Kevin Hall was going into all of these comedy clubs and he was getting everybody's mother fucking email. And people wonder why whenever Kevin would launch on these social media sites, he'd get all of these crazy followers immediately is because of that road work you put in in those comedy clubs and everybody's, you know, before anybody, I think Louie CK did that as well.

Speaker 4:          01:57:37       We had this massive email and that you have direct connection with your fans and that's what your fans want. Your fans don't want ticket master telling them that led Zeppelin's come through. They want to know enrollments come through. What do you know? Pearl jam tried to fight them back in the day. And what they have, they have exclusive deals with certain venues. They are top to bottom, they own, they own live nation and live nation owns a venue. So that complete vertically integrated. So if you want to plant the garden or whatever the fuck it is, right? So you go, we're going to process your tickets. The only way you do is perform here. So you do it with our promotion company, which is alive the nation. And um, you're going to have to use our ticket processings fee and our venue, they actually own the venues now.

Speaker 4:          01:58:14       But here's the thing, there's a handful of you guys to get to play those venues. Now, I think with podcasts now shows are 300 people. There's going to be thousands of comics that have 300 fans and the venue where we perform, it's not imperative that it's this specific one. It can be a comedy club. It could be a hall, it could be some conference center. It could be anything. It could be Airbnb, but aren't you only know in Ticketmaster and when you're doing these big ass venues, well, sometimes now that they're nation, they own some certain

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       clubs. I work with live nation. So now I make sure all your shit is that up. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Why not just do the podcast live every fucking where different man, it's not the same. Yeah. I like podcasts like this where it's just people talking you, you do it differently when you're playing for an audience. He's performed for them. And it becomes this weird days an issue. It just is not. Um, it's not the same. It's not a real conversation. Like I think the intimacy of podcast, one of the things that people like about as they listen in their ear, right? They've got to leave your plug. It's like you're talking to them. They're like, you're right there. When you're doing it live, it becomes a different thing. There's reaction reactions, a bad thing, but it's different thing. But standup is way better way. It's just way more fun.

Speaker 1:          01:59:26       I'm saying is what are we doing with this, right? It's like you should, you should have a direct connect to all your fans. I should have a direct connect to all my fans. Right? We should be able to, even the venue should have that as well. Why? Why do we, why are we giving away all the data to a company that's really not, I know my agent's going to call me right after. This thing's going to be like, why the fuck we have to shut the fuck up? So you want their email, do you want your audience with emails? Basically. And that's what the audience wants and I don't want my audience to get charged 16 bucks every time they buy a ticket. Where does that money go? It costs $16 to process a ticket, 40% of the ticket price. Why not just create an email and when you're at these venues, just put it up on the jumbotron and be like, Yo, email me after the email me after the show.

Speaker 1:          02:00:06       I mean that's, yeah, that's one more step. Or we could just create the ticket process and the charters. I'm way letter left. Excuse me, and Andy already starts aggregating the emails and then if you want to get real crazy with it, you have a boy of yours that like let's say my buddy Aakash right. I do the podcast with. It's like, Hey, I caught you. You were about to go on tour. Yeah, why don't you just use my dataset man. They're going to know you from doing the podcast with me. Maybe you can, they'll want to see you. It's like we get to empower each other through that shit. Am I making sense or no? It makes sense to think specifically about data, about the email list and about they get that if you show up in these different places, they get the email address because that's how people get their tickets.

Speaker 1:          02:00:43       But you get that, that you get the option of saying like, cause they'll ask you, they'll say, can Ticketmaster reply to you all? Can ticket master's send you the latest updates and news and events? You can click no. Yeah and I could go all the time. Let's take a master. But you would click yes. If it was us and there was somebody who are invested in going to see you just don't want to take a master promoting random events. Depends what you're sending me. You click no Ticketmaster's still gets your email address and might sell it. Absolutely. Yeah. Even if you just click no like you do you want updates from Ticketmaster. You're not saying is it okay if this company just starts selling my email address because that's what they do. That's what they do. Yeah. Rodi own us anyway, but they don't have to. I'm saying now, like everybody that's coming out to your shows is coming out from this podcast. They're not coming up cause the Ticketmaster and if you use a different email service or ticketing service, they would come out with that one. There was a Sam Harris' podcast where he talked about this, where they had on this expert and they were discussing how data is. It's

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       like a commodity that no one knew was a commodity. And we signed off on it before we realized it. And these people that don't provide any service or getting that data and it's worth billions and billions of dollars, which is essentially what Facebook is. It's Facebook, but it's also shaping the way we communicate with each other because the things that attract people there are conflict, right? So things that get you to engage our conflict, right? So that's the stuff that shows up in your email or your Facebook feed. They find out what's going to know you. Yep. And that's the shit that they show people.

Speaker 6:          02:02:09       Click on Oj has 800,000 followers in two fucking date overnight, instantly on Twitter, which nobody grows on Twitter anymore. No, but at least we're trying at least Twitter. At least. At least Facebook, they're not charging. Right. My issue, if Ticketmaster was like, hey, here's a free service, we just want to get your data. I bet. All right, boom. Cool. If Facebook is, you want to charge me, you gonna fuck me in my ass and make me pay you. I think Facebook gets you all. Did they just not charted ads? Yeah, and also like think about it there. They've stolen a lot of that data from people. Yeah, a lot of ways. So that is a charge because you signed up with something but you didn't know you were signing up for that. I didn't know I was giving you all it is. Right. What's weird

Speaker 2:          02:02:45       to me, man is fucking, when you're talking about something and then those ads show up in your Google feed, Bro, we were just talking about coolers, Bro. And I looked at my Google newsfeed and there's ads for coolers. I'm like, how does my phone, no, I was talking about

Speaker 6:          02:02:58       cool. That's why I say date long as you know. What else is crazy. When you get in your car and you look down at your phone and it says 32 minutes to where ever the fuck you're going. That shit happens to me all the time. Knows what you're going to go and that was where you look at your phone. It'll be like 32 minutes to whatever gym. I go to a now, I used to tell me 40 minutes to work in the morning. Now it says 40 minutes to Starbucks Brown. I'm like, I drink Starbucks every morning and there's a Starbucks by my job in the building, but that's the way it tells me I'm going. I'm going every morning I watch one video of Robbie Williams, you know that like English singer. It was a youtube video with him and Tyson fury. I just clicked. It was two minutes long.

Speaker 6:          02:03:41       Every other ad on Instagram is Robbie Williams life, so it's not good. The targeting isn't perfect. I'm not going to buy those tickets, but my point is it's scary. One Youtube video and then a completely different platform. Yeah, and this is all within the last decade. They figured out how to do this. Yeah. Even if we unplug was still plugged in. If we were all to delete everything that we have on social media. Right. And I ain't got us already, Bro. That's why I don't like all that snapchat shit with their face filters and all that. And you can see what they did to him. What'd they do to you? What they're doing, the shit where they are. Yeah. I

Speaker 2:          02:04:13       think this was nuts. He made a, a complete deep fake with they take, they basically took all the recordings of me talking and it's made me say words that I've never said before and I was, it talked about me sponsoring a hockey team made of entirely of chimpanzees and a bunch of other crazy shit that I might actually say, but it said it. I've never said those things. Okay. So they use my voice with artificial intelligence. They've all the sounds that my mouth winks and they use it with all the right inflections and they create the sentences and the Pharaoh is out of a job. They just passed the legislation about that, about deep faith, congresswoman from Brooklyn, I can't remember her name, she just passed the legislation about defects. They also did video of the Mona Lisa talking, bro. They got the Mona Lisa. They took the painting of the Monalisa and start and now she's like opening her mouth and saying things they can do with Abraham Lincoln. And how can you believe anything you hear on social media anymore? It's going to be in a few years. You're not going to be able to.

Speaker 3:          02:05:14       No Man. You don't know what's true, what's not true, and nobody cares about the truth and the life more in a table that's better. Maybe now we could say fucked up shit

Speaker 2:          02:05:21       like, Bro, what are you talking about? Definitely deep. Thanks. Well it's, you're already getting porn with actresses. They're taking actresses face and putting them on porn stars and you can't tell, whoa, wait a, yeah. Oh, you could fuck everyone. Yeah. And now they're going to be able to do that with virtual reality. So you're going an ar porn. Yeah, they have that. Yeah. Vr Porn. And they put something on your Dick so it feels like, yeah, they could put a logo, one of them little things that jerks you off.

Speaker 3:          02:05:46       Eh? [inaudible] got the same, it's not the same old school. You like your Paul just started fucking listen to the audible books too because I'm old school. I like flipping the page and get a book. I just started listening to audible only because of time purposes and it's like, it's like listening to the long form podcast. I'm like, you know what? Fuck it. I'm still getting the information and I feel like at this age I retain information more by hearing it. Right. So I'm not bought that gold start fucking virtual reality pussy. Here's the shit that's not porn. But it could be interesting. Have you seen the one about the basketball games? What? Okay, so they put a few cameras so you can sit front row. But in Vr, Ooh, I don't think I would mind that. That's the best you're looking around. You're seeing all the people that are actually there and your front row at the game.

Speaker 3:          02:06:34       Oh, last month I went to, um, I could use the bathroom cause I went to Disney, I went to Disney and I went to that fucking, that Avatar, avatar flights of passage. Right, right. It's Weiss. Yeah, me too. That shit was incredible. And you know, I got anxiety, right. So I'm on it and I'm like, Holy Shit. Until you just remember I'm not even moving. Right. And then it's just like, it settles everything for you and then you can just enjoy the actual experience. And that helped me. I was telling my therapist about it, cause that helps me when I, when I'm dealing with my anxiety because it's like, you know, breathing exercises, things that get you back to center even though you're falling and you can feel to the dragon breathing on you. It's just like when you realize you're really not moving, it just brings you right back to center, then you're okay, then you're fine. You can't do that on a rollercoaster. No, really, yes, it's real.

Speaker 2:          02:07:26       But if they have a roller coaster with virtual reality, like if you're wearing virtual reality goggles and they put you on a roller coaster.

Speaker 3:          02:07:33       Yeah, but I can enjoy, I can enjoy the, what do you mean?

Speaker 2:          02:07:35       Like they put these goggles on and then while you're on this roller coaster, you're experiencing things that aren't really there, but you're explaining like you, you like going through wormholes and you're traveling, you're seeing things happening and I'm a heart attack. Have a panic attack. That's not, that's not something I want to experience. I'm glad you talk about anxiety. I'm glad you're talking about the way you do because I think you've opened it up for a lot of people. I think [inaudible] get, you've made it a subject that's okay to talk about. For someone like you who would like a cool guy. It was a smart dude who is successful and talks openly about anxiety and about how it's affected you. That's, I think that's a, you're doing a very big service for that.

Speaker 3:          02:08:14       I didn't even know what the anxiety was until 2010 because growing up in the environment that I grew up in, I just thought all those feelings were normal. I thought all those feelings of paranoia or you know, being anxious all the time like you know, and I used to smoke weed so you know when you smoke weed and you have a panic attack, you just blame it on the weed. Know. I remember driving the Burger King one time with two of my home boys. One of them is dead now. His name is Darell rest in peace. My Man Zeke and I was high as hell and my steering wheel needed like steering fluid. So it was shaking so it was shaking my legs and I'm bugging out just driving the burger king, a two mile ride. I'm like, Yo, one of y'all got to drive. We're all gonna die right now.

Speaker 3:          02:08:52       Take the wheel right now. I'm going to crash this motherfucker. Call them tripping the fuck out. And they looking at me like, Yo, don't let this motherfuckers smoke no more. But I had nothing to do with the weed. It was, we'd probably accentuate. It. Definitely did. Because when I, after, you know, when I found out what anxiety was in 2010 and I didn't start going to get, you know, going to therapy until like two years ago, because back in 2010 when I, when I got diagnosed with my first panic attack that somebody, the doctor was saying, Hey, this is a panic attack because I had just gotten fired from radio for the fourth motherfucking time and I was back at home living with my mom and like 31 years old with a two year old daughter and you know, collecting unemployment checks. So when I'm having this panic attack and I go to the doctor and he's like, Yo, your heart is fine.

Speaker 3:          02:09:30       You've got a perfectly fine hardening, you're healthy, you got an athlete's heart. He was like, Yo, are you stressed about anything? I'm like, fuck yeah. You know, so in my mind, all I gotta do is get me another job, get back in position and everything will be okay. But when you get back in position and you know you've made more money than you've ever made in your life, and you've got books that are selling in TV shows and all of this other shit, you still having no same panic attacks. She's like, well, what the fuck is going on? I'm sure that's it. That's exactly what it is. You think you're going to lose everything.

Speaker 2:          02:09:58       It's also you experienced pressure that uh, most people never experience because you experienced pressure at this, this public scale. It's not just pressure, it's pressure with people's eyes on you and expectations and criticisms and all these different things that the average person is not gonna experience that from millions of people. And you do. And it's just like it's always on. And if you're one of those crazy fucks that reads comments, good

Speaker 3:          02:10:20       Lord have mercy. God love. That was my problem with you. At first. I used to enjoy it because I was the guy who came up on Youtube looking at all these worlds thought hip hop conspiracy theories about people and you'd be like, oh my God, it's motherfuck sacrifices hamsters. And that's how he got successful. You know what I'm saying? I know you take all that shit is cool until you get old and then you start seeing things about you and you laugh at it at first until you realize like I not even really starting to say some wild shit. What was the craziest one that you heard about you? I mean for me, you know what it is when they tried to meet to, to fuck over the last year, try to get him Outta here. You know that that was, that was the most, that was the wildest one to me cause I was always the person, I say live your truth so nobody can use your truth against you.

Speaker 3:          02:11:02       So it's not like they bought up anything that I hadn't spoken about numerous times before or written about in my books. They just decide to attack, oh my God, targets. Oh man, it can happen. It can it. So that for me, that was like, I, this is going too far, but it then it's like you really can't do anything about it. That's the other thing. Like there's no, there's no way to fight it. Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, there's no way to put the toothpaste back in the tube. So the only thing you could do is just either let it consume you and, and, and, and probably ruin you just because you took it all in. Oh, you just keep it to fuck moving like you, you how you have to be confident enough to know what's the truth and what's not the truth.

Speaker 2:          02:11:42       And so now you don't read any comments anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:11:44       I don't go on Twitter at all. What is too toxic? That shit like yeah, we were in verbally abusive relationships with our fucking smart phones.

Speaker 2:          02:11:51       Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it's not, it's definitely not healthy. You know, we were talking about it yesterday, me and Duncan Trussell, we were saying that it's like your diet, like your diet, if you take in junk food all the time, eat a bunch of shitty things that are unhealthy. It's not good for your body. What your mental diet, it's important to. And if you're always taking in these toxic arguments and yeah, I mean half a Twitter is just people screaming at each other and just yelling and insulting each other and trying to find ways in this person's being shitty or wrong or negative and it's like that's not real life. The real life that we experienced that were designed experiences like this, people interacting with each other reasonably. It's one of the reasons why I think people like podcasts so much, especially good podcasts where people have real conversations is because you go, oh, okay, this is, this is, this is v resonates with me.

Speaker 2:          02:12:40       Yeah. Whereas Twitter does not resonate with you. Twitter just gets you anxious and gets you upset and conversations where people actually being nice to each other in person. Look, I don't do podcast over Skype. I don't like it. I don't. I want to see you. I want you to be in the room with it. I want everyone to know we're going to be okay. You know when you, when you have these conversations and people listen to them, like just one on one like this or two on one to this, this kind of what we're doing now. This makes sense to people.

Speaker 3:          02:13:06       That's one of the reasons when I, when I'm out and about and you know, like if I'm at the airport and somebody comes up to me and talks to me, I speak to them. Yeah. Because I feel like that interaction was supposed to happen. Right? Yes. You know what I mean? Normal Twitter, Instagram, I ain't supposed to be talking to you on this shit. Yeah. With a Vegan you are not supposed to be human beings are not wired to be that wired. No. Everybody should not have that kind of access to, you know, so it's just like we got us, we've got to take back to them that see the facade fall apart when you respond to one of their tweets, like someone would be like fuck you, Charlemagne you a shit and then you can be like, why in the bag? I'm just playing bro.

Speaker 3:          02:13:37       I'm a fan. I didn't really know what to say though, is that they're just trying to get a read. They just, one reaction I, in my mind, if people, if you like somebody, right, you see him, you're going to go up to them and speak to them. I just try to gauge things on how I would do it. Right. For example, I was on a plane with Steve Nash this morning. Okay. Steve Nash. I'm like, why? He's like, Oh shit, where's my boy? He's like, Oh shit. That's Steve Nash. And I'm like, Oh shit. That Steve. I didn't speak to Steve. Did you say hello? No. Nothing. No. Okay. I didn't feel, I didn't feel it. Even I respect them. No, he's a great player and I feel John Stockton, that's a little like [inaudible] have to say hi to say what? There's some people you have to say hi to Rachel Dolezal [inaudible] Seattle.

Speaker 3:          02:14:24       Absolutely. Where was she? Was I started with a, I think she had at least one kid. Maybe another one. She was just at the airport. Where? Online? No Tsa. Precheck sexual. Now she's bought. Yes. She bisexual biracial shoes. Oh, no shit. Not biracial. Transracial she is black. She's got both transracial I know, but what I'm saying is she's bye. So she's straight and gay with the thing, but I said hello. Said what's up? Amazing forehead. One of the best port has you'll ever see in a game. I want to ignore her. That's what I would have known her. You want to got the Selfie? No, I saw Jessie Smollett took a picture of, oh my goodness. In Lafayette Bakery. What do you think's going to happen with him? Nothing. Nothing. It's amazing. Nothing legally. It's amazing legal. I think Chicago was coming after him. Now you think so now didn't they say that they were going to get them for the money? For the money that they spent? There's no such thing as cancer coaching. No more cancer coach was absolute bullshit. Ooh. O J Simpson proved that. Ooh. You know what I'm saying? Like, Hey, when bill Cobb, he comes home, he'll be on the road doing motherfucking standup or Kelly's still out here selling shows like Charlie Sheen is still out here. Flourishing like it's really sheen duct it all.

Speaker 3:          02:15:39       Wait a minute. Not all he did get. That ain't [inaudible] blue man. And what is HIV? Some say the greatest endorsement deal. Magic Johnson ever sign. I'm saying we're not going to act like his career and it looks great. Take this age. You're going to get some movie theater though. I was in my head

Speaker 2:          02:16:08       car the day they announced on the radio that Magic Johnson had HIV and I was shitting my pants. I was like, oh my God, this is like the beginning of a Zombie movie. We're all going to get it. If Magic Johnson with all his money and all his fame, if he's got it, I'm going to get it. We're all gonna get it. I was terrified. I remember in my car driving and then hear it on the radio.

Speaker 3:          02:16:26       Holy Shit. Holy. This is insane.

Speaker 1:          02:16:31       30 years later he looks great. He looks amazing. It's great. He's on TV telling us why he left the motherfucking Lakers. The Lakers not once did somebody say Yo, you know magic got HIV. This is how you shut it. Let you did that. That's all I was thinking about. Every time he, cause he looks incredible. He does look incredible. Incredible. Yeah. It's not even positive and tests anymore. Wait, what? Yeah, I heard that. Yeah. If you give them a test for HIV comes up negative because apparently these protease inhibitors and all these different things that they take to to the different medications, you don't even test positive for HIV anymore. By the way, Dan, listen, it was just, it was this older white dude and I forgot what TV show I was on the set up, but he was explaining to me the whole situation with magic and he was like the reason that they chose magic with, because they want it to erase a lot of these stigmas. People thought that HIV and AIDS was a gay disease and he needed like a, an Alpha male. I guess to have it, to kind of erase that stigma and to let people know that you can live with it like HIV. They gave it to him. Well this is what he told her

Speaker 7:          02:17:37       nuts by the way, is it [inaudible] I'm telling you what somebody told me.

Speaker 1:          02:17:44       They said to me was magic had got caught up in some type of scandal and [inaudible] right? Yeah. And we'll put in before the scandal came out, just because the person that he was with was like some allegedly some big wigs child or something like that. And so this, they said this is what you're going to do so we don't ruin you. I'm just now on this show before you take this in, he believes in Sasquatch. [inaudible] believe Sasquatch was real. That just started right now on this podcast. If I asked him yesterday, he did 100% there. I'm not saying I believe that magic theory, I'm just repeating what I was told that that is a common rumor that's out there. I've heard that. I've heard that rumor. It's guy, he doesn't actually have it. But then it was either that or, but we just got done saying how you read rumors about you that are ridiculous and go, what the fuck? And then you realize, oh this is what happens. People just make shit up. And then people repeat the shit that people make up cause he can't fathom that he beat aids. Bro Aids was bodying people back in the day like shooting mercury. Freddie gone? Yeah. Who else? He's he. He's he, he my downstairs neighbor. Downstairs neighbor? No, no. I had it downstairs neighbor who had aids.

Speaker 7:          02:18:53       [inaudible] I learned about it really young. That's

Speaker 1:          02:19:08       definitely Andrew with his thirties I'm like either he was just out looking at him. Yo Book Charlie Sheen for 350 bucks. Book them where I came. Yeah. Oh on cameo, cameo sunglasses on like what is happening here? What is, what is he doing? Yeah, it is strange stuff. Just showing you what is that too? He aged very quickly. It's like, see he seemed to be fine when he was doing two and a half men when he stopped doing that show. He aged like a hundred years old. He had HIV. We don't know how it's affecting her too. I forgot. I forgot. Everybody has, everybody's not magic Johnson here. Okay. Come. Same Magic. That's why

Speaker 3:          02:19:48       that, by the way, that is why I say magic is like the greatest NBA player of all time. Why? Because of that, he played 13 seasons in the NBA, went to nine NBA finals, won five of them. One in college, came in one his rookie year and went one on one with HIV and fucking one destroyed. He destroyed the stigma of HIV. Definitely did. Anybody that catches HIV right now, the first thing you're going to say to yourself is give me a magic style. I can live through anything of magic. Made it real time.

Speaker 1:          02:20:17       You know what I'm saying? 30 years later he's okay. What did the death sentence anymore and by the way, what's worse? Herpes all over your Dick for life. Not that it comes back and forth, but it's always there. The open blisters forever, forever or having HIV, definitely the herpes, it's worse because the HIV, they could basically cure it pees on your dick forever. Meaning those boosters don't go away. You can't even fuck, it'll hurt. No, let's just go away. Nobody's saying that you get it do today. Yeah. Breaks. He said, I'm saying this specific type of like real hardcore herpes, they never go away. They're just always, they have one that doesn't go away hypothetically, which is herpes. You ever see the Damon Wayans bit about magic when magic came back to the MBA? No, no. Nobody wanted to block him, but second Dennis Rodman, Dennis Rodman was like, fuck y'all. Spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptoms. [inaudible] enough credit. David's a goat man. He's one of the greatest of all times. I don't give them enough credit.

Speaker 3:          02:21:22       We had to actually delete a Damon Wayans joke from the breakfast club. Well, because it used to play like, you know, you have stuff that plays, has the loop and he had to delete it. Wants to meet two times up. Eric Cain, can you say it? I mean, I'll say dammit.

Speaker 1:          02:21:36       Damon Wayans Damon Wayans.

Speaker 3:          02:21:40       It was on the breakfast club and he was talking about the bill copy situation. He just goes, Yo man, have you seen the women that are accusing bill Cosby? They're all on [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:21:50       Damon Wayans that day I was like, you know what I mean? For the authentic. Always have. She doesn't give a fuck man, but we do. So that's why we took this shit. Taking the heat for somebody else's words. Dennis Rodman's said, I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptoms,

Speaker 3:          02:22:07       bro. I think about when call him alone. Think about calling alone. Everybody right now call Malone would get so much flack for this, but in the 90s what he said made sense. Oh, none of us really knew what HIV aids. What? Do you remember what he said? Oh, about? I was like, I'm not playing basketball with him. Like what if I hit him and he starts bleeding and he gives me like, but that

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       was what a lot of people were thinking. Sure. How could you be mad at him for not knowing? For being ignorant about mosquitoes? Remember that? Yes, I do. What about mosquito? That's, I mean, yeah, that's reasonable though, right? I think what works with Ebola and other shit, they can give you birthday or some shit or malaria. Why can't they give you some HIV? We used to be. We used to be, as somebody said, you can't get it in your mouth. I thought this was propaganda, but like you can't get it in your mouth when someone comes in your mouth. Yeah, you can't get it back and tell you that.

Speaker 5:          02:22:54       Free tickets to the movie theater for life. What are you talking to that show? If you got HIV aids, like look, you can't get it. You can't just come in your mouth. It's calling your mouth. Don't worry bro. Oh my God. Did you just put it up?

Speaker 1:          02:23:15       All the mosquitoes are carriers or yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis and sinful itis encephalitis. There's no evidence of mosquitoes can transmit HIV. Studies with HIV have shown clearly the virus disappears the mosquito after about one to two days. But what if that shit bites you and invites you right bro? Look at that last line. I've never heard it described like that. The time required for them to scuttle the digest, the blood meal. Oh Jesus Christ. You don't even talk about vampires is like that. The blood meal. So that means if they get someone who's got HIV and then they get to you within one to two days, doesn't that seem like it would get you bro? That's all I'm saying. It's, it's a reasonable thing to ask. These are reasonable things to do. I have to worry about shit like that. I'm married. Well, the real fear is pandemic diseases. I'm out the gate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that's his fucking, we're talking about. You're on the beach and, and some dude with Charlie Sheen's next to you spitting in your mouth. Yeah. Just from Tiger Blood Hashtag Tiger Blood Hashtag

Speaker 5:          02:24:16       oh Charlie had a moment. You had a moment. Moment. HIV cases moment count was the thing. The only thing we could have handled similar thing like [inaudible] the hell there. That winning shit don't sound too, I don't believe you ready Bro. Yeah, he was wild. Do you know why don't match the difference between magic and Charlie? I don't think Charlie was ever recruited

Speaker 1:          02:24:40       anybody because people, yeah, like we wanted, we wanted to be magic at some point in our lives. Everybody wanted to be Magic Johnson, his live show showing stand up in 2011 was when he was on that thing. But that's crazy. What fixed that those Russell Peters fixed that Russell Peters fixed it because he went with him. So what happened was Charlie was trying to do it by himself and really didn't have anything to say. And people get bored after a while. They would boo him and like he was like, Oh fuck you, I have your money. And he's like a bunch of dumb shit cause he tried to do this live tour but he didn't plan it out. So then we did as you brought Russell Peters with them. So Russell, who's the best at work in the craft, right? He could just make something out of nothing. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:25:22       So Russell got Tim to talk and then Russell would start talking shit and making fun and someone would say southern Russell incorporate that and Russell are treated like a comedy show and turned it into something that was actually good. I have a bunch of people go see him live. He should Russell's there. So it's going to be good cause Russell's though, right? Russell's going to handle it and turn it into funny. So I want you to just do the podcast. Yeah, yeah. Hi Cass. Back then nobody cared about podcast early. Have some stories though, Dude. Oh yeah, those cracked stories and the workers if you willing to tell him though. Oh he's telling he was all that had already got aids. What's worst? Do you remember when he was on television? He was talking about just smoking rocks and just all this and the people are like, what?

Speaker 1:          02:26:05       Like what you're saying, but did that excite people in 2019 like we've seen all the crackheads? No. Back then it was the right window of time and it was like him coming through and just being unapologetic about doing drugs and you don't pay hookers to fuck you. You pay him to leave if you're kind of shit that he was saying it was unapologetic and that's why it resonated. And that's also why no one could get him with like a me too thing. It's like, what are you going to say? Of course he, he'll tell you what he did. First of all, no woman is going to say they slept with [inaudible] for sure. Yeah. Maybe he did that too.

Speaker 5:          02:26:35       Oh, [inaudible] you about to catch that? Me Too. You just got, I got heat and those girls get quite here real quick. Holy Shit. That's what you found a way around the system. Oh, my show. What did, that's what Leo says. Every time a girl leaves the house. Oh, by the way,

Speaker 1:          02:26:58       positive. Oh my Jesus. Really nice to them. They like them. They don't want to fucking throw him under the bus. So some guys are like, the Leo would like that. Drake, I don't know about Drake. Derek Jeter. Oh, Derek Jeter was given a gift bags, baby. You know what I'm saying? Can you imagine the number that came out? He was getting signed baseballs. Yeah. Think about how many guys have gotten a signed baseball from their girlfriend as a gift. Think about what was going through their head when they read the post that moment. And there's this sign, Derek Jeter baseball one. They're fucking Nantel. Oh Dude. Yeah. And your girls like no other girls might have, but he was just nice to me. He's a gentleman, but what you've got to earn that gift back, Joe. Joe, Joe saying is very true though. That's why I always like when I see dudes still treating women like shit in 2019 like, yeah, fucking them and kicking them out the room.

Speaker 1:          02:27:48       Oh my God. No, I'm not answering the phone for after, but I'm like, you're wiling. You should be treating her with the utmost respect and being extremely nice because you just never know. Uber, Uber, she's your friend. She's your friend. She, she should be. She should be your friend. Like I don't understand why guys, like I said at the time said, why are y'all still calling women bitches? Some of them are bitches bitches out like it in a positive way. Like check this bad bitch out. Yes, that's okay. But some of them are just old school bits of stuff. There's some bitches where it's like you're in a derogatory way. Like you could say it in a positive way. You're laughing about it or you could say it in a derogatory way. Yeah. Sometimes I'll say it in a derogatory way as a man. Cause I mean it because man, it's 2019 no.

Speaker 1:          02:28:34       What about Twat? I've never used that ever. What about content now? I've never used car. He got in trouble for using the word cunt. I didn't trouble me in trouble. You get, but you got outraged. He's, yeah, he's, he's not a match. I want to ask you this, first of all, I think what you're doing with youtube is genius. It's brilliant. You're the first comic to really capitalize on using you to, you know, Netflix. They want to give you a special like, fuck, I don't need you. Let me do this. It'll get more views. And it has, and it's been amazing. It's been beautiful to watch. But are you experienced because of the popularity increased? Are you experiencing some push back on some of your material because you go hard

Speaker 4:          02:29:12       bro? The weirdest thing? No, it's like we've curated an expectation for it. Mm. So the people that are going there are waiting for it. It's not people who like got free tickets from the funny bones website. No. What you do, they're there for things that they didn't watch. You talk about eating ass either ass. Yeah, I was just talking about this on, on a pod on the part of the other day, but like we were just talking about privilege. You have to be to eat at no serious sign because think about all these third world countries where they can't even eat food, but we're so full in America. Look, you can't have a fucking cocktail or without almost dying. You think they're eating ass in America. We're so full. We got so many choices that we choose to eat ass we want to do for fun. But Bro, I'm telling you they're not. It's pretty, pretty amazing. They're all leaning into it and I think that people have had enough with the PC shit. So they really like to see the fact that this is out there. And I mean we're posting, you know, I'll tell you one thing, the Joe Rogan effect, we used to do a million views a week on my youtube channel. I came on here, 2 million now.

Speaker 1:          02:30:09       Wow. Wow. Doubled. That's crazy. We'll see what happens now. I mean, we'll see. I mean it was nuts. Charlemagne effect in there. Well we do a pocket. I mean, but the channel exists because of the Charlotte made effect by Shayle exists because we were putting the brilliant idiots, fat videos, idiots videos out every week on the channel. Like without him, that channel doesn't exist. I mean like you two guys,

Speaker 4:          02:30:30       I swear to God, I have the biggest influence on the market and it's like he gave me this opportunity to have all these people view and I was able to put the stuff out and luckily they liked it. But the same thing happened here. We just doubled up again. I mean

Speaker 1:          02:30:40       it's crazy that it's all dependent upon generosity and being a fan. Cause that's what I do. I mean, when I'm talking to a scientist or talking to you, yeah, I'm a fan, I'm interested. I'm curious. And it's not like you're putting on some fuck shit. Right. You know, say like Andrew's funny, he's been funny. Exactly. Years. So now everybody else is actually realizing what we all knew already. Yeah. And the limitations of like those platforms putting you on like Netflix or HBO or something like that, that doesn't exist anymore. It's not you

Speaker 4:          02:31:10       in your whole game and you know that you go, you go get no systems and they teach you I just to shoot three pointers. Yup. You know what I'm saying? Instead of like fucking cultivating your your whole game.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       That's why, you know, really needed, I love rainy days. I try not to promote brewing needs. I know this sounds crazy, right? This is interesting. And the reason I do it because I love our audience. I love that group of people who come to listen to us every week. They know that we just out here saying some wild shit, not even on purpose, just because we're, we're, we're trying to get ideas out and we're just talking through things. It's when you bring those outsiders in, who here you don't know any context than nothing. Take that little piece out of context. Give it to the rest of the world. Now the rest of the world is outraged. We can ask God to come over here any fucking way. Right. You know what? We want to be wild. We want to place

Speaker 2:          02:31:59       is where do you think that's going? Like what is outrage? Culture reached full outrage.

Speaker 3:          02:32:04       It's coming back. We turned it around. I agree. [inaudible] around. You know what's made me think about that? Two situations in the past two weeks, I can't remember the first one, but the whoopie Goldberg one from yesterday with Bella Thorne. I didn't hear it. Bella Thorne, uh, she took some nude pictures. Somebody was going to expose him. So she just shared them herself first. I think somebody hacked her out. Acthar clouds cloud. They're trying to say, hey, we're going to put this out unless you give us money or some shit. She's like, fuck it. I'm gonna put my own shit on Twitter. Yeah. So Whoopi Goldberg, it's on the frame of juggernauts. I didn't even see it. Lovely. We'll be getting on the view at whip. He goes, look, it's 2019 when you take pictures, they go up to the cloud. Hackers can hack you, so don't take pictures. She was like, it's just common sense like it's not, it's not worth it. Just don't take the pictures. Hey. I was like, oh, your victim shaming, but I thought that I thought that was what the outrage was going to be. It wasn't. They was like, Oh shit, we'll be, you're talking to super common sense. Now. Bella came out and said she was being victim shame, but the general public on social media was like, so y'all are mad at whipped before talking common sense and I was like, Oh shit.

Speaker 2:          02:33:05       You can't say it's victim shaming if she's correct because we are moving into an era where all information is going to be available to everybody. I think that's going to be a thing that we're going to have to overcome. The privacy is going out the window, John. It's not going to exist anymore. Like what? Our expectations of privacy are so much different than people that lived in our parents' age. Well, our kids, it's going to be even less and then their kids nonexistent. They didn't even know FDR was crippled. That's right. FDL was crippled. Yeah. See? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:33:37       They didn't know. He would literally hold himself up at the podium. I think he got polio or some shit. Right. So he was a paraplegic. Right. And but the press respected his role as president and they respected his privacy. I mean he had side bitches, he had all this shit going on and he would just stand up at the podium holding himself up. Whenever you're talking to everything else besides that, they kind of roll them around with the people didn't know because there wasn't this access. Oh I want us to get back in line to each other all day. Talk to me cause I cause think about it, it used to be a time where you didn't know what somebody's religion was. You didn't know what somebody's political views were like you didn't like, nobody knew. Like you just went, you presented and you went the fuck home. I think we need to get back to that. Well I think it's too much

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       motherfucking. So every call trooper get back in the closet and not just with your gay should just whatever the bullshit meter everybody to just get back to bullshit and each other. Cause. Guess what? Remember I used to say you don't want the truth because you can't handle the truth that this era, the world cannot handle the truth. That's why you wanna tell us about Ufos. What, what do you think is happening with you? Fos they won't tell us that you FO's exists because if they told us that you oppose exists, motherfuckers would probably go crazy when the reality is we really probably need to know you. Fo's it just cause it would humble the fuck out of everyone. Well that's the only time we get a roar, right? Like in every movie, right? The only time Russia and China and America get on a conference call is when they had the movies. Aliens are coming up the movies. Ronald Reagan said that in his speech in the eighties Ronald Reagan told him to Kel Gorbachev, why the fuck are we beefin cause one day we might be, we might have an extra terrestrial threat and then we got to come together and everybody was like, what the fuck is Ronald Reagan talking about? Click quickly. We would put aside our differences. We were three phase faced within a threat from an alien world and everybody was like, what does he know? Oh, I would respect

Speaker 5:          02:35:19       no tonight show. We go find out 10 nights. By the way, I would respect you have prejudice. If aliens came and you still had held onto whatever the fuck you [inaudible] was still racist, you will still homophobic, transphobic, got the aliens came. I'd be like, shit, that's not a girl. That's a fucking dude in a dress. Can't get pregnant. Hold on. [inaudible] oh my God, I respect the fuck out of there. I'd be like, okay, I'll tell you no. It's true though. You know it's real.

Speaker 6:          02:35:53       As long as it's real. I really don't have no choice but to respect Joe, I think you're right. I think we're getting to the end of outrage culture. I think she was almost over. We had, we put on a clip this last week, there was this kid in the front row in a wheelchair heckling me, saw that. That was hilarious and we went back and forth and initially I put it out like, oh fuck. What's going to happen? Am I going to have these like, you know, people rolling up to my shows and like fucking pussies that really, well he was also a special kid. He had something, you know people have it, you are river around people and they just have a fucking, like, they have a cold like you know who has it? Ari, Ari, Ari Shaffir. He has this fucking, I don't know, there's something I just want him around.

Speaker 6:          02:36:31       I just like them. I just kind of want him to tell me his opinions on shit. I was ask him Janklow Talker, but he's just, he's like, do you feel about carpets? And he'll just fucking tell you. They'll be like, eh, whatever. So it was like, he just had this thing needs such positive energy and I'm making fun of the guy from fucking being in a wheelchair and he's making fun of me for having a shitty up body. And like literally I go to him, I was like, I said, you don't, are you upper body is pretty good. And he goes, what's your excuse?

Speaker 5:          02:36:54       Like cool.

Speaker 6:          02:36:57       And we have this moment and no backlash. There's a thing. It was cool. Backlash shouldn't matter except for the guy in the wheelchair, right. If everybody else is like, oh, why the fuck are you picking on him? If the guy in the wheelchair don't care and the guy in the wheelchair is going back and forth, why the fuck are you jumping in ever? People that have it, never always. Parents of people have things

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       like when there was this person had a seizure in, in one of my videos, everybody who had seizures was cool with it. It was always a parent of a kid who had a seizure, who was like, my son suffers from, how dare you? What a clip up like that. So it's always a fence on behalf of cause I really think that people who suffer for things, they've went through way harder things in a joke and they actually like that they're being spoken to as a regular person in the audience, not babies like every other part of their life. When can I get the door for you? Can I get, it's like they all right for the first time I'm in it.

Speaker 3:          02:37:45       I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't pose, I won't post or like make jokes. I talk shit about something that I wouldn't want to happen to me or somebody I loved though. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like I can handle, you know what I'm saying? Like HIV aids. I don't want it [inaudible] I wouldn't trip if I got it. I wouldn't trip to orders. I mean not what we used to think it was. So it's a different thing. Yeah. Do you know what bug catchers are? Yeah. What's a book around fucking people who have those?

Speaker 1:          02:38:18       Did he try to get it? Yeah. There's a bunch of guys in the gay community. We're trying to get HR. Yeah. That's fun catching crow. Hold on. Self low. The people that wanted to get HIV, and this is back in the day where it was a death sentence, there was a lot of guys who were doing that hold on. Their goal. Their goal. Yeah. They would try, they would put out ads on craigslist looking for HIV positive guys to give me the bug. This is why colts happened because people need to be part of something there. It's like in them, some people are just broken.

Speaker 3:          02:38:48       Exactly. Cause I heard about that 20 years ago and I thought that was crazy. But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm like, what was their life like? I need to know what their life is like if they had something to lose, if they was actually successful, would they be doing that? I need to know what kind of people were out there trying to catch dis book.

Speaker 1:          02:39:05       This every, every step in the spectrum of crazy you think about it. And there's a whole fucking category of people that are doing that. So bug catching was one of them. Like it was a big thing where guys were like actively going out and trying and guys who had HIV, we're trying to go give it to people.

Speaker 3:          02:39:22       Yeah. That's why, uh, I did thing would calm, I don't even necessarily believe in common anymore because every day of our life we're trying to avoid crazy. Right? Yeah. But you can't, you know what I'm saying? When a guy comes in with a gun and he shoots up a motherfucking school. Yeah. Like what are we supposed to do? We didn't do anything to cause that, but he's got something going on with his life that caused him to snap and it affected us. Like if you're walking down the street and you know a guy's just angry about something, he bumps into you and you're like, oh, excuse me. He's like, why the fuck you mean it's choose me and he's ready to fight. I don't got nothing to do with you. I've got everything to do with him. So you really can't avoid this crazy that exists.

Speaker 1:          02:39:59       I had a conversation with someone they were talking about like everything in your life you have manifested and created. I go, okay, explain babies who get shot and drive bys. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. There's random things that happen. Kids get leukemia. What would they do? Something bad. Come on, I use it, but bigger than you.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       That's the thing that people hate to. Yeah. We are a very small part of this big fucking ego system, right? We really think that everything in our life is that important. That it could affect the world. Get the fuck out of here. Sometimes random factors, cause you know, you think about the secret, like the law of attraction, your thoughts become things. I think that thing that we forget about that is not only do our, it's not just our thoughts, our actions. You know what I'm saying? It's not like you're just sitting around. You didn't think, you didn't sit around and think about doing this. Yeah. We actually put us on fucking work.

Speaker 2:          02:40:42       That's the difference between the secret in reality is that people think that you think things into existence, but know when you're successful and people say, what did you do while I thought this a new existence, show me how you did that. Well, I got up every morning at 6:00 AM and I fucking hustle to the gym and then I wrote jokes all day. Like, here you go. Listen Bitch, you put it in the work.

Speaker 3:          02:41:01       Yeah. Yeah. And put in the work. It's like, it's like literally if somebody said to you, Hey, one day you're going to win the lottery so you can sit at home. Right. Thank all day waiting to win the lottery. You get up and go to the fucking store and buy a powerball ticket. I think Chappelle had that joke. He's like, you don't think they're starving kids in Africa thinking about food, right? They don't get drew out a nice roast beef sandwich. Any common exactly that, don't get me wrong. There's plenty of things that I've thought about that I've manifested, but like you said, I took the steps to go put in the work. Like there's focus, there's a process discipline. I've got this theory called putting the weed in the bag, you know what I'm saying? And they came from the movie belly because nod and Dmx was sitting at this table with these two young kids and they were bagging up the weed and all the kids was like, y'all want to go thank you money with y'all. I want to go out there and get money at Dmx is like, what are the, we in the back first didn't go out there and get money. You have to go through the process so we can start with a thought. Yeah, but you still gotta execute. Put some fucking work in.

Speaker 2:          02:41:54       All right. I remember I was talking to this girl, she was a friend of a friend of mine and she was telling me how, um, I found the secret and my life is going to be amazing now and I'm gonna, I'm going to get married and I'm going to meet the right man. Never ever. It was like, okay. And then I ran into, like a year later she came to one of my comedy shows and I'm a, I'm like, how's everything going? She was like, I don't get it. I've been using the seat.

Speaker 7:          02:42:14       Good. But I, life is a mess. My father's in jail.

Speaker 2:          02:42:21       She was a sweetheart of a person, but she really believed that her life was going to transform. I'll never forget the juxtaposition of those two conversations.

Speaker 3:          02:42:29       That's why that's why the position that we're in in media, you have to be very responsible with these positioning. Yeah. Malcolm X and Malcolm x at the person who controls the media controls the minds of the masses. So you have to be very, very responsible. What do you remember when you used to get a lot of flack for putting on just different voices that people didn't agree with? Yeah. Like why are you giving these people a platform platform? I'm like, Yo, everybody deserves to be heard. Yeah, I guess

Speaker 2:          02:42:54       man, I'm not everybody but I just, I want to know how people think too. I want to, uh, even if I don't agree with it,

Speaker 3:          02:42:59       especially if people you don't want to go with that conversation isn't a co sign and I think that's what we owe. We often mistake

Speaker 2:          02:43:06       in this day and age two was especially on the left that so many people are talking about d platforming. You want a d platform

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       people, I don't like to know. I don't like that. Like you might get either. I saw people getting mad at Lavar ball this week, you know what I'm saying? Because of the comments he made the Molly on ESPN, which I didn't, I didn't. He just was like, she was like, Hey, let's shift gears and you said you can shift gears with me anytime. [inaudible] he said it just like that. You can still be in the meeting. He didn't say, he didn't whisper that you could shift good placeholder. If she had said, hey, let's switch it up. He would say, hey, you switch it on me. But every people was like, oh, they need to stop putting them on ESPN. I'm like, wait a minute, Huh? Literally just last year y'all was saying he was the drunk uncle at the picnic and you love him or hate him. He's good entertainment but that now because he said that you want to take them off and I'm like, we got to stop doing that because guess what?

Speaker 1:          02:43:53       Every single one of us is going to say something that is going to offend somebody at some point. Now that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have a platform. I'm not calling nobody to get killed, but also makes things fun. When people say stupid shit sometimes. You know when Steven Smith was going off about Andrew, he's winning the title looks like Butter Bean. This is a disgrace. There was mad. I'm like, the guy is speaking the way he would speak if you are around him. You gotta appreciate that. Unless you want everybody to be Ryan Seacrest, you should fucking appreciate not there's anything wrong Ryan Seacrest, but you should appreciate someone who just giving you what they really think. Yes we do. That's why he's so popular. We pretend to hate it, but the reality is we're going to keep listening. The second one gets a result. So pay attention.

Speaker 1:          02:44:34       A lot of people like, ah, all right, that's the America feeds off of that. She, that's why Donald Trump is president. That's why the Kardashians are still viable. I caught that. She's the first family drama. Every year. Every year they find a new piece of trauma. Once shit gets calm and cool, the show ends. So they need a new piece of drama. Oh, who you got cheated on this year? Who's going to have a baby? You're gonna, you gonna get a baby. But whatever it is every year, hey, you're going to chop your dick off. But you respect her for with Kim, she is getting people out of jail going forward. I can go back before that. I respect the Kardashians because if we really, really pay attention to the Kardashian's over the past 10 years, first of all, you got to put them up there with some of the greatest dynasties of all time.

Speaker 1:          02:45:12       This is Lakers. This is patriots. This is fucking, they've made billions. Yes. Billions with a B. So many, so many social conversations have started because of the car dashes. You're talking about interracial relationships. You're talking about, uh, the transgender thing. You're talking about drug use and mental health. With Kanye plastic surgery, they did change the shape of American women. They changed, they changed asses. They made that whole fat relocation thing popular. They suck it out of your waist, turn your, wasting this little thing and turn your ass into this ridiculous platform. But Real Kim. Kim learned that from black women though because people forget Kim. But that's a bile. The when, when the, when you would look at someone who really has it. It's different. Absolutely. You will see a woman who has a big ass naturally. It looks like it belongs on hers. It's a different thing.

Speaker 1:          02:46:02       Yeah. They thick legs. They're there. They're fucking genetically superior. Built like a Turkey. Built sexy. Yeah. Kim. Kim is inspiration. People don't rip from Jim and Kim came up in the black circuit. Right. She did king magazine and smooth. That's right. That's right. You know what I'm saying? Wendy Williams radio show earlier. That's what I'm better. I met her when I was going to read it with Whitney. He knew her before she was ever on anything. When she was [inaudible] who's assistant? Some of the system was Paris Hilton. She's the organizer to organize closets for Paris Hill. I got a old picture like me and Kim from like 2006 different, what I will say, she always had that vision. She used to always say, I'm going to do what Paris is doing times a hundred wow. She motherfucking did it. The secrets she used. The secret secret is black deck.

Speaker 1:          02:46:53       That's the secret smoke a black cock. It's amazing that that kicked her off because it used to be the kiss of death. If a girl did porn, that was the hand Lisa and she was the one to break that down. Well what's it to her, Jenna Jamison. I think Jenna Jameson was the first one to become actually popular outside of porn. Oh, I thought you meant like the first person to break like the racial barrier and pull pulling on purpose. She was the first to break the racial part, but I mean doing porn periods where you can be, where you could be a celeb outside and you talk about radio. Uh, it's not too many people that came up off celebrity sex tapes as long as few and far between that really popped off. Who made it off the sex? Do you remember when girls were showing him [inaudible] they were showing their pussy on purpose.

Speaker 1:          02:47:35       You remember [inaudible] camera just happened to be down with that. Pussy is, yeah. Fuck. Did you not know that camera was down near your pussy up? Yeah. That's a lot of confidence to put climbing out of the car is showing their pussy. Not a lot of trainers chill. What is happening you not a lot of witch fingers. That's all the more reason you got to say Kim k Bro. Sat grow. That was happening on a cause and you could see her vagina and was doing sex tapes is out here getting prison as free is doing that. I don't give a fuck. Yeah. I don't give a fuck if she's best friends with Donald Trump. I don't care. That's my thing. Right? If you care about prison reform to care about criminal justice reform, yes. You should be happy that these people are getting out. Yeah. Worried about, oh, she's doing it in the White House with Donald Trump.

Speaker 1:          02:48:22       Who gives a shit. You, you think the guy who just did 15 years for nothing, nothing cares what president let him out. She doesn't have to do this. She could just be buying cars and getting her nails done. She's choosing to spend her time to get these people that are unjustly accused and convicted and get them released and that and Trump like him or not, and he's listening to her and he's helping her at that. But you know why? Because he's a celebrity. He understands the and go. So you keep sending all these politicians to talk to a celebrity. That shit, that shit goes over his head. You've got to send another celebrity to get in his ear because he understands that type of lane. He just understands that their power, he understands where they're reaches. He knows the Kim k doing something is way more valuable than some random, you know, democratic congress person. Are you seeing that much now? You look at Capitol Hill

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       the past few weeks, you see you're not, I was there meeting Bti in David Gross, what they're talking about opportunities on legislation. I was there with Taraji talking about bringing social emotional learning in schools. In therapy. You had a a tiny, he see Colton. Danny Glover was dead this week talking about HR 40 you had John Stewart. They're talking about the victims of nine 11 now be compensated by the way, to nine 11 shit. I didn't even know that was going on, Bro. If Jon Stewart hadn't had done that, that I would've never even known that was going on and that is fucked up. And it was a simple statement. The people you said you would never forget, you forgot, whoo, that's not going to win. Nobody's, hey, anybody can get that. You can be with no teeth sitting in fucking South Carolina in a trailer park. You understand it. You understand that link.

Speaker 4:          02:49:48       It doesn't have to do that. Let's do that because he needs to. It's in him. Yeah. It gives you a different sense of purpose. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:49:54       Like that's what really means something. When you talk to me about talking about anxiety and mental health, like the past couple of years, I feel like I've been walking in my purpose, you know? Because I truly feel like if we can get more people to deal with their mental health issues, you'll reduce so much of the other bullshit we complaining about in in America, the violence, the gun shootings. Because when you've got a bunch of people who have never dealt with that trauma, never dealt with their pain and their hurt, hurt people, hurt people, and all we do is go around redistributing that pain. The others, you think murderers and rapists do that. She could just put the thrill of it. No, they are broken, damaged people so they go and break in damage other people. So if you can get people to deal with their mental health issues, man, that's the foundation of it all. To me that's the real secret.

Speaker 4:          02:50:35       Getting to the root of that shit. Yeah. There is a thing about about purpose that like what happens I think when, when some people reach financial independence and I mean like fuck you money meaning like you don't have to work anymore, your family good. Everything is good. Yeah. You have some people go, well I'm going to get even more money and I'm going to become a billionaire and a trillion or whatever and then some people go, I'm going to live life instead of survive it. Or if you're working every week so you can get a paycheck. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. That's a majority of people are. But you are surviving. Yes. That, that, that job is no different than being out there in the forest trying to find some foods you can eat. We have some shelter, you get financial dependence, you have the opportunity to truly do whatever you want every single day with your life. Yes. And some people go, you know what I want to do. I want to go to fucking DC and help out with these causes or I want to put on a whole comedy community. You know what I mean? And like you really put it on your back. I want to help other people out. I want to have these conversations and just talk shit about, you know, fucking magic having HIV, whatever it is. We're actually choosing to do the things that we enjoy.

Speaker 3:          02:51:38       Cause you realize it was important. Like even when you're talking about something like that, but it's only when these known legislation, I feel like that goes hand in hand with mental health because the environment is so important. So if you can, you know, get into these, these, these, these, these communities, these points just in franchise areas and you can start putting things in these communities that people actually need. Like in the hood, you replaced the liquor stores and the fucking chicken spots in the check cashing places with juice bars and mental health spas and wellness centers, things that people actually need. Now you're creating an environment where people can thrive in instead of just trying to fucking survive in. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? You can't properly deal with your mental health if you're trying to survive every fucking day.

Speaker 2:          02:52:13       Well I think what you're doing is very important as you're bringing up that conversation. That conversation wasn't taking place before the mental health conversation about anxiety amongst cool, successful people. It just wasn't happening. Yeah. Everybody was pretending everybody was there. They're hiding from it. You can use secrets like you've got, you've got the float tank in your fucking compound. Yeah. Are you telling people about that? Oh yeah. Okay. I'm the, one of the reasons why that thing became popular again. I got one in 2002 wow. Yeah. I didn't do it for the first time like three weeks ago. Yeah, man. If you go to some float places, they'll ask you how he found out about it. It's like, did you find out from the Internet, Yelp and then they'll say Joe Rogan. That's why one of the, cause I talk about it so much as videos of me. I gave one away. I gave one. No, I had bought a new one and I said I'm going to give one away to, and I just got random emails and I picked one of them had it sent to this guy's house, had it set up. I just cause I want people to know about what these things are.

Speaker 3:          02:53:05       Never felt stillness like I felt inside the float tank. Yeah, it's amazing. It's like, you know, at first you're like, okay, they want you to get butt naked. You don't know if they and you, you know what the fuck's going on. You know what I'm saying? And then they're like, no, that's complete a lot of confidence in your cock. I wasn't even swinging. And I'm a, I'm a, I'm a grower, not a short, my shit is like swinging that. Actually I was trying to think it was all church say bro, I can't, I actually would try to make it a little chubby just in case you can't trust these people. I don't know. Trust. How do I go, Oh fuck, I might be recording me in this shit. So the lights went off and it's like when you first get in, it's allowing yourself to relax because at first year fighting it a little bit, you got your head up, you're like, I don't know if I'm a drown, but when you finally just relax, you don't, you don't even know what the fucking I went. Right. And I've never experienced the level of students like that. It was point, it was period where I thought I was actually, I'm like, am I alive right now? Right. Because your eyes are open, but it's totally dark. It's totally dark. So you don't know if you're really sleep, you don't fill the water, you don't feel the water. You don't know if you're in and out of consciousness. It's, it's, it's wild. Everybody should do floods.

Speaker 2:          02:54:04       Yeah, I agree. What is the hardest part about having influence? That's a nice pregnant pause. I was dope. Right? Yeah. And then the clap.

Speaker 3:          02:54:20       Who's going like [inaudible] the cameras. Cameras switch. Well timed.

Speaker 2:          02:54:29       Yeah. I Dunno. What's the hardest, I don't think about it that way. The thing you're very, there's very, there's very few people that you have the opportunity to have the kind of influence that you or I have or you, it's a, it's, it's very, very strange. I think you gotta realize what harm you can do. You gotta be careful when the, the kinds of things you say are the kind of things you promote, you know, the kind of things that you sign off on or agree to. And I think there's also a responsibility to tell people about cool shit. I tell people about things that have benefited you to help help people about how you've

Speaker 1:          02:55:03       overcome your own personal mistakes. I think all those things are very important. Yeah. I never, I never even thought about having influence until like the past three, four years because you know, I'm just out here doing my thing. Just doing it. When you read, when you realize you are having influence and a lot of that influence could be negative. Yeah. That's when you realize like, Oh shit, let me make sure I'm doing the right things with these platforms. You know what I mean? Let me make sure I'm bringing on the right voices that people can learn from. Let me make sure I'm telling people about the things in my life that are making me a better person. So for me it's like the best compliment I get nowadays when people say, man, you really grown like you've, you've really evolved. Like it's visible. People can see it.

Speaker 1:          02:55:46       Yeah. That right there lets me know I'm putting out the right energy into the ecosystem. It also people become inspired to seek that same kind of path. When someone in the public eye, like yourself and they see you grow and expand and change your views on things. It also inspires other people to open up themselves and change their own perspective and enhance their own way of looking at the world. I can admit when I'm wrong, y'all said, I've said a lot of fucked up wild shit. You're going to live on the air, you're not reading a script right now. You're free balling. It's going to happen. And I think the worst thing that can happen too is like for me, you know, breakfast club has only been going on for nine years. So I never had experienced this level of attention. And you know, you start reading things about yourself in the media, like you read real articles and be like, oh the hip hop Howard Stern.

Speaker 1:          02:56:34       And I'm like, oh, so I gotta be like, how would so I gotta give him more of that shit. So what Howard though? Right? Cause I'm giving them a little bit of nineties I was like, what? How would do yo fuck no. So it's just like you can get caught up in that, you know, you could get caught up in what people's expectations of you are. You change who you're, you know, a lot of people say that happens to a certain comedians, so they become their character. Dice. I was going to bring up, his name is Andrew Silverstein. Yeah. Dot. The dice man character that he would do in his bit. He would do, he was doing a routine where he would be John Travolta. He would do a Sylvester strong and then he would do this character called the dice man. And that part was so funny and so good.

Speaker 1:          02:57:17       It took over his whole act. I went toe to toe with dice one time. Toe to toe. Yeah, on Wendy Williams show back in the day when I was Wendy's a sidekick. And you the Wendy VH one. Wendy had a show on VH one and Andrew dice clay had a show on VH one so they bought him on to promote it and like we just ended up going, but I don't know why the fuck me ended up going to happen. Yes. And and like VH one edited it to make it look like he like kind of fucked me up. But they kept a couple of mine mining. He was really upset. Like I called him, I said, you're like a fat Fonzie. Fuck fucking loved it. He was like, fuck are you fucking one is basketball fucking living? And I'm like, Oh shit, it's on and got his shoes on. I'm like, you fucking laugh at that. I thought it was funny. I want to be able to laugh

Speaker 7:          02:58:02       at that. If I looked like a fat Fonzie be like, Oh shit, you'd have to go. I was on, as I told you, he going to discontinue terminate a model. You remember did that.

Speaker 6:          02:58:17       But what you said is real cause I'd never want to become a character, chill my say. Yeah. And I feel like it was a certain point in my life where I was becoming a character of myself and it's like, well that's not real. Like you can't claim claim to be a real person and be out here pretending to be real. You either really you not. Yeah. And what's real is yo being honest about going to a therapist, what's real as being honest about your mental health issues was really talking about being a father. Like real shit. Like you can't always be trying to be cool. It's not cool. That's fake only existed when there was like some sort of, uh, you're, you're, you're projecting something. You're putting something out there in these small bits. When you're doing what you do, when you're talking for hours and hours on gotta be you gotta be you, you at the end of the day, it's going to come out. And then people with the longest careers, I feel like are the people who evolve born time. Boom. You could see the guys who have real growth, like how it started in the beginning when we really think about Howard, like chicks were queesland on speakers. That was a normal thing in the Howard stern radio show is come in. Who has the loudest Queef on the speaker? They're lucky. The Tiffany Haddish wasn't around back then.

Speaker 7:          02:59:28       That's cause he, cause it would be over six that Microsoft Pussy, she makes a canon sound. It doesn't even make sense. She's like large had midgets into the fucking atmosphere. Yeah. She used to do that all the time. She would quantify what she's shameless. That lady

Speaker 6:          02:59:45       give a fuck. [inaudible] guys to fucker like on comedy. Oh y'all. Well there's not allowed. I'm kind of an elitist approach to comedy. It's quite interesting. He likes and he likes bars. He says he likes jokes. He doesn't like school. Fucking still fucking, if it's the right bit can be funny, but it has to be the right. It has to be a real comic with a real reason to fuck that stool. There has to be something to it. I'm trying to think of Eddie. Fuck this tool. I'm asking. Nobody fucking knows stole Bro. See, I like Eddie. I like Richard. I like Chris Rock. Bless you. I like Chapelle. You know what I'm saying? I like, I like those guys that actually don't say, just say something like have something in perhaps something to say. Louis C K has something to say like I want, I like people that have something to say.

Speaker 6:          03:00:29       All that stool fucking is, hey, I want to get him on stage. I think he could do it. Oh, you never go down. I would not.
