00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.540
When we're dealing
with basic arithmetic,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.770
we see the concrete
numbers there.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.262
We'll see 23 plus 5.

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:09.220
We know what these numbers
are right over here,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.303
and we can calculate them.

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:11.610
It's going to be 28.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.920
We can say 2 times 7.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.510
We could say 3 divided by 4.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.940
In all of these cases, we
know exactly what numbers

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.930
we're dealing with.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.791
As we start entering into
the algebraic world--

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.040
and you probably have seen
this a little bit already--

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.080
we start dealing with
the ideas of variables.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.820
And variables, there's
a bunch of ways

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.653
you can think about
them, but they're really

00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:36.240
just values in expressions
where they can change.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.550
The values in those
expressions can change.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.770
For example, if
I write x plus 5,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.760
this is an expression
right over here.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.110
This can take on
some value depending

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.630
on what the value of x is.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:00.450
If x is equal to
1, then x plus 5,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.870
our expression right over here,
is going to be equal to 1.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.110
Because now x is 1.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.050
It'll be 1 plus 5, so x
plus 5 will be equal to 6.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:20.330
If x is equal to, I don't
know, negative 7, then x plus 5

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.020
is going to be equal to--
well, now x is negative 7.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.730
It's going to be negative 7
plus 5, which is negative 2.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.970
So notice x here is a
variable, and its value can

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.840
change depending on the context.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.059
And this is in the
context of an expression.

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:42.100
You'll also see it in the
context of an equation.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.660
It's actually
important to realize

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.870
the distinction between an
expression and an equation.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.890
An expression is
really just a statement

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.840
of value, a statement of
some type of quantity.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.290
So this is an expression.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.750
An expression would
be something like what

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.220
we saw over here, x plus 5.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.700
The value of this
expression will

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.740
change depending on what the
value of this variable is.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.050
And you could just evaluate
it for different values of x.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.770
Another expression could be
something like, I don't know,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.130
y plus z.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.430
Now everything is a variable.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.570
If y is 1 and z is 2,
it's going to be 1 plus 2.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.820
If y is 0 and z is
negative 1, it's

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.476
going to be 0 plus negative 1.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.600
These can all be evaluated,
and they'll essentially

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.820
give you a value depending
on the values of each

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.226
of these variables that
make up the expression.

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.350
An equation, you're
essentially setting expressions

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.610
to be equal to each other.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.100
That's why they're
called equations.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100
You're equating two things.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.060
An equation, you'll
see one expression

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.830
being equal to
another expression.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.900
For example, you could say
something like x plus 3

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.230
is equal to 1.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.250
And in this situation where you
have one equation with only one

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.400
unknown, you can
actually figure out

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.587
what x needs to be
in this scenario.

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:03.170
And you might even
do it in your head.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.939
What plus 3 is equal to 1?

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.480
Well, you could do
that in your head.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.220
If I have negative 2,
plus 3 is equal to 1.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.140
In this context, an
equation is starting

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.892
to constrain what value
this variable can take on.

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:16.850
But it doesn't have to
necessarily constrain it

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.400
as much.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.750
You could have something like
x plus y plus z is equal to 5.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.360
Now you have this expression is
equal to this other expression.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.669
5 is really just an
expression right over here.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.960
And there are some constraints.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.220
If someone tells you
what y and z is, then

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.480
you're going to get an x.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.250
If someone tells
you what x and y is,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.820
then that constrains what z is.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.660
But it depends on what
the different things are.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:51.610
For example, if we said y is
equal to 3 and z is equal to 2,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.600
then what would be
x in that situation?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.880
If y is equal to 3
and z is equal to 2,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.260
then you're going to have
the left-hand expression

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.330
is going to be x plus 3 plus 2.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.030
It's going to be x plus 5.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.560
This part right over here is
just going to be 5. x plus 5

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.920
is equal to 5.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.200
And so what plus
5 is equal to 5?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.750
Well, now we're
constraining that x

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.269
would have to be equal to 0.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.769
Hopefully you realize
the difference

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.899
between expression and equation.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.315
In an equation,
essentially you're

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:23.640
equating two expressions.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.390
The important thing
to take away from here

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.370
is that a variable can
take on different values

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.570
depending on the
context of the problem.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.440
And to hit the point
home, let's just evaluate

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.060
a bunch of expressions
when the variables have

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.350
different values.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:47.890
For example, if we had the
expression x to the y power,

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.930
if x is equal to 5
and y is equal to 2,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.060
then our expression here
is going to evaluate to,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.680
well, x is now going to be 5.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.400
y is going to be 2.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.630
It's going to be 5
to the second power,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.830
or it's going to evaluate to 25.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.250
If we changed the values-- let
me do that in that same color--

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:24.850
if we said x is equal to
negative 2 and y is equal to 3,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.650
then this expression
would evaluate

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.359
to-- let me do it in
that-- negative 2.

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:34.900
That's what we're
going to substitute

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.760
for x now in this context.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.300
And y is now 3, negative
2 to the third power,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.860
which is negative 2 times
negative 2 times negative 2,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.842
which is negative 8.

00:05:46.842 --> 00:05:49.300
Negative 2 times negative 2 is
positive 4, times negative 2

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
again is equal to negative 8.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.310
We could do even
more complex things.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.290
We could have an expression
like the square root of x plus y

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.600
and then minus x, like that.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.890
Let's say that x is equal
to 1 and y is equal to 8.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.920
Then this expression
would evaluate to, well,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.460
every time we see an x,
we want to put a 1 there.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.800
So we would have a 1 there,
and you'd have a 1 over there.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.350
And every time you see a y,
you would put an 8 in its place

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.320
in this context.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.760
We're setting these variables.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.150
So you'd see an 8.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.640
Under the radical sign,
you would have a 1 plus 8.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.130
So you'd have the principal
root of 9, which is 3.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.970
This whole thing would simplify.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.850
In this context, when
we set these variables

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.580
to be these things, this whole
thing would simplify to be 3.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.640
1 plus 8 is 9.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.740
The principal root of that is 3.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.490
And then you'd have 3 minus
1, which is equal to 2.
