00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.580
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Okay we're
going to be like this.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.020
Say hey.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.320
&gt;&gt; Hey!

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.120
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Alright
[inaudible].

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.090
[ Laughter ]

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.390
Who's sway?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.840
Okay here we go and I'm on mic so.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Alright let's go.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.120
Hi I'm Marisa Bellack, I'm an
editor at the Washington Post,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.830
which is a charter sponsor of
the book festival and I'm pleased

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.110
to have a conversation
today with Angie Thomas,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.510
author of the bestselling young
adult novel "The Hate You Give."

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.430
[ Applause ]

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.870
I think most of you know
something about her,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.640
but I will do a quick introduction
before we start talking here.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.820
Angie was born in the Georgetown
neighborhood of Jackson,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.260
Mississippi, which she describes
as one of the poorest neighborhoods

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.610 position:56%
in the poorest state in the country.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.490
Growing up she said she imagined
a local crack den as a dragon lair

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.710
and she wished for superhero speed
to avoid getting caught in gunfire.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.820
The Hate You Give began
as a short story

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.200
that Angie wrote during her senior
year at Belhaven University.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.090
And she says it was
inspired by the shooting

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.600
of Oscar Grant in Oakland in 2009.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.560 position:56%
But Angie was actually focused
pitching an upper middle grade super

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.860
hero novel.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.160
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Totally different.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.560
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: In 2015 when she
asked a literary agent via Twitter

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.860
what he thought of.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.160
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Millennial.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.580
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: What
he thought of why a book

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.740
about the black lives
matter movement.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.250
Things moved pretty
quickly after that.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.980
In October 2015 Angie
was the inaugural winner

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.510
of the Walter Dean Myers Grant
for we need diverse books.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.730
[ Applause ]

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.240
In February 2016 The Hate
You Give was acquired

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.510
by HarperCollins' Balzer
and Bray in print

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.680
in a 13 publishing house auction.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.770
In March 2016 Fox 2,000 Temple Hill

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.060
and State Street acquired
the film rights

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.810
with Hunger Game actress
Amandla Stenberg slated to star

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.930
and George Tillman Jr. to direct.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.000
And the book was published
last February to rave reviews.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.950
I'm sure Angie will talk about
some of that wild ride today.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.250
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Yes.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.880
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Before we
dive in I'm supposed to mention

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.190
that the Library of Congress
has been the festival's host

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.770
since it would began 17 years ago.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.050
I want to thank the co-chairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.100
and the many national
book festival sponsors

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.130
who made this event possible.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.870
You can support the
festival with a donation,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.020
there's information
in your programs.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.030
Please note too that
there'll be time for questions

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.480
after we have a conversation here.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.020
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Just don't ask
me for movie roles [laughter].

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.770
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: And anyone
who ask a question will be filmed

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.730
for the Library of
Congress' archive.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.240
There will be microphones
in each isle.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.510
So now please help me
welcome Angie Thomas:::.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.770
[ Applause ]

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.390
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Thank
you, thank you so much.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.860
I'm so happy to be
here, I really am.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.430
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: So
let's just start off.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.500
Why did you do this as a YA?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.140
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Well first of all
no offense to any adult writers

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.780
or adults in general, but I
think adult books are boring.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.370
I can't see myself
writing for adults

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.670 position:56%
and the reason I'm really excited is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.100
because teenagers are much
more open minded than adults.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.480
And especially with
a subject like this,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.250 position:56%
I felt like I would get more empathy

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.700
out of teenagers than
I would adults.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.380
And then so many times with
these cases we're talking

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.600
about young people.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.740
Trayvon Martin teenager, Michael
Brown teen, Tamir Rice 12.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.860
So when young people see these
cases they're affected by it.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.970
I know that there were kids
in my neighborhood who looked

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.270
at Tamir and saw themselves.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.560
So I wanted to write it for them,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.790
but yeah big thing was I just can't
see myself writing for adults.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.890
It's amazing to me that adults have
picked it up and have been drawn

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.460
to it, but I was not
thinking about you all

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.950
when I wrote this book [laughter].

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.310
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: So I understand
you had a short lived career

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.910
as a rapper.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.210
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Short.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.040
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: And so I
wonder is there something similar

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.350
about writing Why I Hate
and writing rap lyrics

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.720
in that the rap's biggest
audience is that kind

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.190
of 18 to 24 year old segment?

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Oh yeah absolutely.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.350
We do not give hip hop
enough credit for giving

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.420
so many young people a window
to see themselves or a mirror

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.020
into a world they wouldn't know of.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.830
You wouldn't know about half the
stuff that happened in Compton,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.730
California if it was
not first for NWA.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.570
You may not have like
how they said it,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.020
it may have made you
uncomfortable, but this is fact.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.900
And so when books were not
providing mirrors and windows,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.050
hip hop did, I know for me it did.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.640
So when I did not see myself you
know, no offense to Twilight,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.420
I have nothing against Twilight,
but I know had that been me first

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.400
of all my mama wouldn't have let
me date nobody that old [laughter].

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.930
So and then with the Hunger Games,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.860
you know when I teenager
The Hunger Games were big.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.350
Nothing against it, I love The
Hunger Games, but had that been me

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.880
when I raise my hand my
mom would've brought it

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.750
down and said no, I got this.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.450
And it would've been called mama
won't let you go hungry games.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.450
That's a whole different book.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.450
So it was hard for me to see
myself in those popular books,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.170
but I saw myself in hip hop.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.590
When Tupac said the blacker the
berry, the sweeter the juice,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.280
the darker the flesh,
the deeper the roots.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.290
I give a holler to my
sisters on welfare,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.180
Tupac cares if don't
nobody else care.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.880
He spoke to me more than books did.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.240
So I think we need to give
more props to hip hop for doing

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.880
that for kids and I
hope to yeah [applause].

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.400
Now don't get me wrong, the
criticism is rightfully criticized.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.470
There's a lot of work
that needs to be done,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.560
but I look at the positive rappers
like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.030
they're doing the good work.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.060
So I want to give, I'm
going to pay homage

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.500
to that in my second book promo.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.110
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Look clearly
music had a big influence

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.250
on this book as well
right, so we have the title

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.350
which comes from Tupac's Thug Life.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.650
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Yes.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: But you also tell
us about what is playing on the car

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.480 position:56%
when your characters get in the car.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.780
What's playing at a party.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I just have to show
my sock, I doubt anybody can see it.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.900
I got on Tupac socks, I
doubt you can see that,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.920
but I do because I have to
take Pac with me everywhere.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.220
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Those are nice.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.520
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Thank you.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.820
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: So there's
characters in your book

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.590
that are named after the
members of [inaudible]

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.580
and I know you posted a playlist
of artists that have inspired the,

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.280
let's talk a little bit
about the influence of music

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.500
in the writing of this book.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.010
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I always
whenever I write anything I start

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.310
with a playlist.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.700
I know with this book
Tupac was a huge influence

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.000
in a lot of different ways.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.300
Of course there's a title.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.250
It comes from his thug life tattoo.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.800
So yes that u is on
purpose grammar nerds.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.760
It spells out thug.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.270
It comes from Thug
Life and that stood

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.300
for the hate you give little
infants f's everybody.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.970
And he said that means
that what society feeds

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.520
into youth has a way
of affecting us all.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.150
So, Tupac was influencing
that since also the character

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.330
of Maverick is influenced by Tupac.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.940 position:56%
And then just music honestly because
I saw myself so much in hip hop

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.480
and in music more than
I did in books at times.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.230
I couldn't help but
be affected by it.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.870
So as I'm writing yeah
I may mention songs,

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.770
I'm probably doing it a little
too much now in this second book.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.120
I don't think my editor is going
to be happy, but that's okay.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.290
But I think honestly books
and music, they tell stories,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.590
they're forms of storytelling.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.690
And honestly for me it's
hard to avoid using music

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.350
in a way as influence as I write.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.420
So it happens naturally and I
apologize in advance to the people

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:25.230
who have to clear lyrics
at HarperCollins.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.210
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: So people like
might expect a book like this

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.000
to focus on the distrust between
African American communities

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.690
and the police, but you
also have a lot in there

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.480
about anti-snitch culture.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.560
You have about gang
recruitment pressures.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.220
Do you see those as kind of
just as constraining or kind

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.500
of they're all part
of the same story?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.490
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Well honestly when
I wrote this book and I knew going

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.990
in that it would be a black
lives matter focus book.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.370
I knew somebody somewhere
would say well what

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.100
about black on black crimes?

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.270
I addressed it, there you go.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.680
We're talking about two
separate issues here.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.240
And yeah it's an important
issue to bring up too and I felt

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.160
like though I wanted to show yeah
all of the issues that take place

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.910
in my neighborhood and
neighborhoods like mine.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.530
And but still like I said they're
two separate things and I wanted

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.940
to show that even through
Starr and her trauma.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.350
She has two very separate,
different things

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.730
that have happened in her life.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.270
One was a case of black on black
crime with her friend Natasha.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.950
Khalea was a case of
police brutality.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.630
Two things that affected her in two
very different ways, yet similar.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.060
So I hope that by showing
that two different things,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.790
but they still have an effect yeah.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.710
I address black on black crime,
but yeah can we still pay attention

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.510
to what's happening in
our communities as far

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.010
as police brutality goes.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.810
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Let's.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.250
[ Applause ]

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.040
So let's talk about
Starr a little bit.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.680
So you mention that Oscar Grant
had a big influence on this book

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.080
and the movie "Fruitvale Station,"
which was a very powerful movie,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.110
but tried to give a
fuller picture of his life.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.910
So can you talk about your
decision to focus on the witness,

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.040
rather than the victim
of a shooting,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.740
the direct victim [inaudible].

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.250
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: That decision
was actually influenced

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.550
by Trayvon Martin.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.750
When Trayvon Martin was killed,
right before it happened he was

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.830
on the phone with a young lade
by the name of Rachel Jeantel.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:31.310
And Rachel, when Rachel went to
speak on Trayvon's behalf basically

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.420
in the trial against George
Zimmerman, there was more focus

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.040
on how Rachel said things as
opposed to what Rachel was saying.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.360
The media, they tore
that girl apart.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.620
The people tore that girl apart.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.600
I read so many articles about well
she should be more professional

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.160
or she should be this,
she should be that.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.260
Why are we not paying attention
to what this girl is saying?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.270
Why are we focused on
how she's saying it?

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.220
She sound just like the
girls from my neighborhood.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.600
Yeah and they may not be the most
polished, but she's telling truth.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.270
Why aren't we listening?

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.960
So with Starr I kind of felt
like Starr was my response.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.340
Here's a young lady, young black
girl from the hood and she's going

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.420
to say it the way you
think she should say it,

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.340
but are you still listening?

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.540
That's the question.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.940
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: So one thing
that struck me about Starr is

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.130
that she almost has
two different voices

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.940
within the book depending
on who all she's with.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.270
Can you talk about how you
developed those voices?

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.870
I mean is it almost like thinking
about two different characters

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.020
or do you try to carry
certain things through?

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.820
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I'm
doing it right now.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.160
[ Laughter ]

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.300
[ Applause ]

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.630
I mean that's the truth
of the matter.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.870 position:56%
If I got up here and started staying
fina [phonetic] and stuff like that

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.640
because I'm southern, you
all would be like what

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.870
in the world is wrong with her.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.860
So code switching.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.200
Code switching for so many
of us is a survival tactic

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.390
because there's this idea that
if you speak a certain way,

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.270
all of a sudden you're
considered ignorant.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.660
With Starr I wanted to show a
young lady who does code switch

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.960
because so many of
us go through that,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.210
but then there were two
characters that I wanted

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:16.120
to show different sides to and
that's her uncle and her dad.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.660
Maverick her dad, the former gang
member, he says "Aight [phonetic]."

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.720
Her uncle Carlos the cop alright.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.080 position:56%
I look at them like Will and Carlton
in the Fresh Prince [laughter].

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.990 position:56%
So her dad would be more Will and
her uncle is Carton, but guess what?

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.910
They're still both
intelligent black men.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.680 position:56%
They're very, they have very
important roles in her life and just

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.020
because Maverick speaks different

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.010
from Carlos does not
mean he's any less,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.450
he's any less intelligent
than Carlos.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.840
He's very intelligent.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.210
So I wanted to show
yes this young girl

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.730
who is living these two
different lives happen

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.490
to be two different people, happen
to change the way she speaks.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:00.050
But I also wanted to show these
two guys who speak differently,

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.470
present themselves differently,
but they're still strong black men.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.330
And I've had a lot of young kids,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.170
especially young black girls who've
come up to me and said thank you

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.680
for having Starr code switch.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.500
I've been accused of sounding white

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.460
and I just want to
put this out there.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.760
I don't care how you speak,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.250
the way you speak does not
determine your blackness

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.490
and I wish we could get
more people to realize that.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.060
So that was for my black
folks, you'll all know

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.730
where I'm coming there with that.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.740 position:56%
So I wanted to address that with
this character and show the struggle

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.820
that so many of us deal
with on a day to day basis.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.950
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Do you think
having a character who moves

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.010
between different worlds
also helps you relate

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.810
to your audience differently?

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.860
I mean you can, you're not just
writing for people for people

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.550
from the neighborhood
you grew up in its.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.850
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Yeah I think so.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:52.830
I think it has allowed first of
all it showed, it's shown people

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.270
that all black kids in the hood
don't just stay in the hood.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.890
You know sometimes they
get bussed to schools

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.850
across town if nothing else.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.010
But her school environment yeah,
I wanted other readers to be able

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.240
to connect, but it wasn't as much
a priority as it was for those,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.340
as it was to write for those
kids who are like Starr.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.480 position:56%
Who are sometimes the only black kid
in their class or in their school

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.170
and the pressure that that is.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.530
You know like pressure that
comes with that, that was me.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.130
I went to a mostly white private
school in Jackson, Mississippi,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.700
conservative Jackson, Mississippi.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.400
I just said a mouthful.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.540
A private Christian
school at that and so

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.180 position:56%
for me it was, I had to code switch.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.910
I would leave the house blasting
Tupac, but by the time I got

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.940
to my school I was
playing the Jonas Brothers.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.540
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: You
pulled your pants down?

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.830
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Yeah, yeah
I pulled my pants down.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.050
So it was, that was
me, that was my life.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.090
You know and I had to deal with
you know when slavery is discussed

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:54.250
in class, everybody's looking
at me like I was there you know.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.740
I had to deal with that.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.970
So I wanted to write for those
kids that I know who are going

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.220
through this and who
are dealing with it,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.880
but yeah like you said it was a
good way to connect with readers

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.120
who maybe go to the
private school like Starr.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.420
And maybe they'll see the Starr's
in their school and they'll look

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.430
at them differently and realize
just because where they're

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.160
from does not determine
who they are.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.220
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Can
you talk a little bit

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.350
about how you've become a voice
for greater diversity in fiction?

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.650
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I have?

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.950
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack:
Look at these people.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:31.240
So I mean its one thing to count
up black characters in books.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.780
You know how many include
a prominent black character

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.810
and it's another for readers to
really find characters who sound

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.110
like them or think like them.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.680
And I know you told,
you did when we spoke

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.250 position:56%
about this a little bit before, that
you found, I know you saw yourself

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.080
in hip hop more than
in books themselves.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.880
Do think that's changing or what
sort of conversations have you had

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.140
about that since you've been
on your book tour in that?

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.950
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Oh yeah
I think it's changing.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.220
We need diverse books, first of
all is doing incredible work.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:08.860
Shout out to them [applause] and
we are starting to see changes.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.580
I hope we will see more changes
because there was a study that came

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.020
out that showed that there were
more books one year released

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.010
about animals and trucks than there
were about black kids, Latino kids,

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.030
Asian kids, Native American kids.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.330
Are you kidding me?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.670
So hopefully we will start
seeing those changes.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.350
What and the conversations
are not that easy though,

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.650
this is the thing we're
coming to see.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.130
You know you have the question
of well who can write what?

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.550
And I tell people you can write
whatever you want to write

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.000
because you're going
to do it anyway,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.970
but if you're writing outside
of your own experience,

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.080
don't get mad if you
get criticized about it.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.190
We ask you to put in the
work and do it right.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.060
So many of us have been already
harmed by bad representation

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.650
in books and the last thing I want,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.020
especially as a children's book
author is for a kid to pick

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.050
up my book and for them to
be harmed by what they see.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.580
So the discussions are messy.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.550
The discussions are hard,
but they're necessary

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.200
and hopefully we will
see changes and hopefully

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.830
in five years there will be more
books about children of color

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:14.630
than there are about
animals and trucks.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:21.270
[ Applause ]

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.570
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: I know
you've been speaking a lot

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.430
to school groups since
the book came out.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.900
Can you talk about some of the
interesting things you've heard

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.310
from students from
those conversations?

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.610
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Students
who are surprised

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.000
that their teachers
let them read this book

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.350
because of the cursing in it.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.340 position:56%
You know, but the best conversations
are always when the kids,

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.290
the students who tell me thank
you for this because I see myself

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.720
or when I was in Philly
not too long ago

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.790
and there's this young
boy, black boy.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.050
Sagging pants comes up to me and
he's like yo [phonetic] mine.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.760
I'm like er [phonetic].

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.320
He's like yo [phonetic].

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.990
He's I don't like reading
[inaudible],

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.290
but I read this in a day.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.220
This is dope and I'm like.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:04.260
So when I hear that, when I
have kids send me messages

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.020
on Instagram saying I hated
reading until I read your book.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.950
That's amazing to me and what I'm
seeing now is those teachers are

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.700
contacting me saying my reluctant
readers are tearing this 400

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.930
something page book apart.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.230
That's amazing.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.150
So I think what has shown
me if nothing else is

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.820
if we give kids the books that
they want to see themselves

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.120
in they'll read [applause].

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:34.320
You know and I recently had to
tell my publisher HarperCollins,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.210
I said look you guys
failed me as a kid.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.700
You didn't give me enough
books to see myself in.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.070
But and I said I'm
going to be honest

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.460
with you I think the
reason is because you assume

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.930
that black kids don't
read and that's a lie.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.430
Not to brag, but my book's been
number one for a while now,

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.630
black kids are reading it too so.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.760
Having those conversations
with students

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.590
and with teachers shows me we
do need more diverse books.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.150
We need to get these books
into these kids' hands

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.510
because those same kids as you
think will not read will read

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.330
if you give them something
that they are interested in.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.570
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: So we're here
today celebrating books of course.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.870
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Yes.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.170
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: But
can you tell us anything

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.330
about the movie [laughter]?

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.850
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I'm
looking straight

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.750
at my film agent, she's here.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:28.520
The movie, filming begins
September 11th in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.400
Everyone has been cast, not
everyone has been announced.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.510
I cannot tell you everything,
but I am excited about it.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.760
It's funny because like right
before my signing I got a call

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.060
from the director.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.920
His name is George Tillman.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.020
George Tillman is known for doing
the movie Soul Food, Barber Shop.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.410
He did Luke Cage and
he did This is Us.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.930
So brother's got his
credentials you know.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.600
So he just called me a
little bit a while ago just

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.170
to ask me some questions
about the character King.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.970
It's small stuff, but in the
bigger picture it matters

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.740
and what it shows me how dedicated
he is to getting this right.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.870
I've been involved along the way.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.150
I don't cast movies.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:17.570
I have no say over casting and
there's some things that are still

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.510
out of my control, but
the script is amazing

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.450
and it does the book justice.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:29.720 position:56%
And what I tell people is movies for
books are lot like fraternal twins.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.500
No they're not going to look
exactly the same, but they're going

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.850
to be similar and it gets to the
heart of it and it gets it right.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.120
So I think everybody's
going to enjoy it.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.440
The entire team is dedicated to
it, they're doing a great job

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.010
and I can't wait to visit set.

let's open for questions.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.820

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.120
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Hi.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.420
&gt;&gt; I'm also from Jackson,
Mississippi.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.720
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Hi.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.090
&gt;&gt; I found out about your book
from my 12 year old niece.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.390
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Oh wow.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:17.660
&gt;&gt; And Mississippi has such a
great history of great authors

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.490
from William Faulkner
to Richard Wright.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.990
I'm just wondering what the impact
of your book has been in Jackson,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.410
into Mississippi and
the reception of it.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:33.940
And when is it going to be required
for all school children to read?

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.240
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Thank you so much.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.550
It's so funny like no matter where
I go there's always one person

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.060
from Mississippi, never fails.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.180 position:56%
I was in Australia the other day and
there was this lady, she's like I'm

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.000
from Mississippi and
I was like really.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.210
So never fails, so thank you so
much for coming and for asking.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.600
The impact in Jackson
and then Mississippi,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.470
I was surprised recently to
find out that the governor

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.230
and the lieutenant
governor even know who I am.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.100
They gave me a shout out at
the Mississippi Book Festival.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.640
I've been able to visit a
couple of schools back home

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.770
and I haven't been able to do
a lot because of my schedule,

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.420
but it's opened up
some conversations.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.790 position:56%
And I've gone to both public schools
that are all black and I've gone

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.060
to the private schools
that are all white.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.750
And both have told me that this
book is opening their kid's eyes

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.050
and stuff.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.200
And then you know it's always funny
because the students are like,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.090
so is this based on my school
or is this based on that school

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.070
because I think that
school you know.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:44.240
That's always fun, but its and
recently over 750 9th graders,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.760
all the 9th graders in the Jackson
public school district were given

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.890
free copies of the book.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:54.650
So that's amazing and
there are efforts right now

00:22:54.650 --> 00:23:01.170
to make it a school district
wide read for the 8th

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.670
through 12th graders, not
the younger kids of course,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.870
but yeah it's been interesting.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.860
You know it's gotten to the point
like sometimes I go to Kroger

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:17.770
and somebody knows me, so I have to
be careful about how I go out now.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.510
But seeing the reaction
and when I have signings

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.660
at the Mississippi Book Festival
and my line is both black

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.200
and white, old and young.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.050
And I have people with the thick
southern draws telling me thank you

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.540
for this book.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.910
I just, I understand why they
say black lives matter now.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.870
When you get that in Mississippi

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.810
where our flag sucks,
that's amazing.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.510
So it gives me hope for my state.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.510
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Awesome, thank
you for what you're doing.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.810
&gt;&gt; Well thank you.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.640
I wanted to know what
recommendations you have

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.650
for addressing the issues
you address in your book

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.110
with young people in
an educational setting.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.880
Working with six year
olds, so maybe not just.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.180
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Oh.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.480
&gt;&gt; Handing you, handing
them your book.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.780
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Don't.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.420
&gt;&gt; But any recommendations
generally for that.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I think when you're
talking about kids that young,

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.640
the biggest thing to
instill in them right now is

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.430
that empathy is more
powerful than sympathy.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.450
Get that in them now.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.270
Help them feel for others.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.460
You know my whole goal
with this book was

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.140
that after someone reads it,
when they see Tamir Rice instead

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.100
of just saying I'm
sorry that happened.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.760
I want them to look
at Tamir Rice and say

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.020
that could've been my little
brother, I'm heartbroken by that.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.380 position:56%
So that's what I want with the book.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.940 position:56%
So I say instill empathy in them
and then not just empathy for people

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.630
who look like them,
go beyond themselves.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.580
So I think there may be some books,
I know there are books coming

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.680
out that address it
for younger readers.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.830
I'm going to Tweet about it
if you follow me on Twitter,

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.890
but yeah I think at the core
of it, just instilling empathy.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.420
That'll go a long way,
I promise it will.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.720
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.020
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Thank you.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.320
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.620
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Hi.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.920
&gt;&gt; I just first wanted
to really thank you

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.350
because of this book I understand
these issues so much more

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.510
than I would have just
observing in my own community

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.520
where it's not really as prevalent.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.740
And I wanted to ask if there's
that scene towards the end

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.700
of the Hate You Give
with that really intense

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.370
and exhilarating protest and I sped
through that in like 10 minutes.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.890
I could not put it down.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.400
Where exactly did you get
the inspiration for that?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.700
Was it personal?

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.400
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: That, that was
definitely inspired not just

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.010
by Ferguson, but protests around,
even the protests in Oakland

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.410
and a lot of it was
also was inspired

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.970
by the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.160
Actually it's funny because that's

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.000
when Tupac started
talking about thug life.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.510 position:56%
Back in 1992 Rodney King, the Rodney
King verdict had just happened

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.730
and also there was a young lady
by the name of Latasha Harlin

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.360
who was killed in a store when she
didn't apparently pay for a bottle

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.650
of juice and the store
owner killed her.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.730
And it led to a lot of
unrest in Los Angeles

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.970
and that caused Los
Angeles a lot of money

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.500 position:56%
and Tupac was like that's thug life.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.030
So I remember looking at
those riots, I was young,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.990
I'm not going to say how
young when that happened.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.070
But I remember watching footage
on that and just seeing how

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.080
like Tupac said the
hate that was given

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.950
into that little infant
Latasha screwed the entire city

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.710
of Los Angeles and the
entire state of California.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.130
So those riots definitely inspired
it and the riots in Ferguson,

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.640
then protests and all
of that inspired it.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.890
And I wanted to show honestly at
the end of the day why people are

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.430
so angry that they're willing to
burn down their own communities.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.800 position:56%
It's easy to look on the outside and
say oh they're just being ignorant,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.850 position:56%
they're just no but look at the why.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.220
Why would I be angry enough to burn

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.760
down the only grocery
store in my neighborhood?

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.860
Why, why are people hurt?

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.930
So at the end of the day,
yeah it was inspired by L.A.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.730 position:56%
and it was inspired by Ferguson, but
really the inspiration was getting

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.340
to the heart of the matter
and showing people the why.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.150
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Thank you.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.730

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.030
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Hi.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.600
&gt;&gt; And I teach high school and I
want to thank you for your book

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.210
and I do plan on using
it in my classes.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.510
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Thank you.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.820
&gt;&gt; And I've been recommending it
left and right to my students,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:29.320
but my question is you had talked
about code switching as far

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.810
as mainly the language and
dress and that sort of thing.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.810
But one of the things in your book

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.780
that I found particularly
interesting

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.990
and there's a lot I
found interesting,

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.380
but this was one thing
was how her relationship

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:47.510
with her friends on
in both communities.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.680
In the school community
however you had her choose

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:57.350
to have a white boyfriend and she
had trouble really confiding in him

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.290
about what happens, so can you
talk a little bit about that

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.550
and the reactions of her friends
to what had happened to her?

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.850
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Yeah sure, sure.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.570
Its funny Chris is one
of those characters

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.170
that gets brought up so much.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.590
Chris is probably the character
I get asked about the most

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.340
on Instagram as far as who's,
who's playing Chris in the movie?

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.500
Apparently there's
a lot of Chris love.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.770
Starr and Chris, you
know I've also had people

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.700
who say why didn't you
put her with a black boy?

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.420
You know first I'm going to tell
you all now I do give black love

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.950
in my second book.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.780
For all the folks that are
mad at me about the white boy.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:37.280
But as a writer honestly I
look at sometimes for drama

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.780 position:56%
and I thought hm, this girl is going

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.600
through this situation
that's so racially charged.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.200
Why not give her a white
boyfriend and see how this goes?

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.350 position:56%
But with Chris I also wanted to show
with that character what it means

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.070
to be an ally, a real ally.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:58.520
That word gets thrown around
a lot, especially nowadays.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.650
And I wanted to show
somebody he's not perfect.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.640
He learns along the
way, but guess what.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.700
The most important thing
is he starts listening.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.430
That's what I really
wanted him to do.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.420
I wanted him to listen to Starr

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.000
and that's what I think allies
should do, they should listen more.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.420
So with that character and that
couple, I wanted to explore that

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.620
and then I wanted to
show these two kids

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.530
at the end of the day they're kids.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.810
They're in love all.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.310
So how do they survive this?

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:33.140
How do they let something
as heated as racial issues,

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.550
how do they get over that?

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.850
How do you do it?

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.600
And then I wanted to
show two kids who come

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.890
to realize colorblindness
is not where it's at.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.220
We say that people think
colorblindness is good.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.020
There's nothing wrong with looking
at me and seeing that I'm black.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.510
It's what you do once you
see that and so [applause]

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.190
with them I wanted to explore.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.620
Chris does have a couple of
times he's like I don't see you

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.920
as black, I see you as Starr.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.610
She's like, but I am black.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.530
So he comes to see its nothing
wrong with accepting her blackness,

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.830
there's nothing wrong
with her looking at him

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.570
and seeing his whiteness.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.160
Like I said it's what they
do once they see that.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.130
So with those two it was a
way to explore multiple things

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.510
and honestly it also gave drama
if nothing else with Maverick.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:21.210
[ Laughter ]

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.300

be addressing themselves

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.160
with their jobs, so
I'm a social worker.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.100
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Oh
awesome, thank you.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.840
&gt;&gt; I've also been recommending
your book.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.050
I work with a lot of adolescent
boys and women as well.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:38.240
So my question is actually
about your character Hailey.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.540
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Oh.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:45.040
&gt;&gt; Right, so I'm curious about
your own experiences with the.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.340
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Ooh.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.920
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] in the
world and I'm also curious

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.190
about if you've had a lot
of reactions especially

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.080
from white people saying, but I
understand Hailey's point of view.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.030
She didn't, she wasn't so terrible.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.870
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I
haven't gotten that,

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.450
but I don't think they're
brave enough to tell me that.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:08.660
You know Hailey is definitely
inspired by people in my life

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.220
and the funny thing is
they don't realize it.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.720
You know I had a former friend
who's like I read that book.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.610
Oh my God Hailey was so horrible.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.510
I hope nobody ever did
you like that, I'm like.

Look in the mirror.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.570
You know it was for me it
was like the girl who when I,

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.480
we had the Christmas party,
I'm giving all my business out.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.050
But we had a Christmas
party when I was in college

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.470
and professor had this pile
of gag gifts under the tree.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.360
And we could pick whichever
one we wanted

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.130
and I picked one, didn't
know what it was.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.150
I opened it, it was prescription
drug book and a water gun.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.230
And she goes oh my God the black
girl from the hood got the gun

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.510
and drug book ha ha ha ha.

[ Background Sounds ]

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.420
So that my way of addressing that
because I didn't do what I wanted

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.430
to do that day, it was through this
character [laughter], but honestly

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:06.090
and I'm probably going
to make somebody mad

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.930
and I honestly don't care.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:14.600
Hailey is honestly a lot of
white feminists, intersexuals.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.240
Look I could have gone into a
whole discussion about that,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.430
but it's that person who
only sees their issues.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.810
What about my issues
as a black woman?

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.580
Are they not valid?

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.520
So with Hailey I wanted to
address that and I wanted

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.780
to show someone yeah, she's a
feminist, nothing wrong with that.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.680
But can you still look at Starr
and see what she's going through

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.730
and fight for that just as much
as you fight for your issues?

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.030
Can we have that?

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.110
So with Hailey, Hailey was
definitely a way to get at a couple

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:48.510
of different folks and they
still haven't realized it.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.330
&gt;&gt; I probably, I mean I
can relate so I wonder

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.520 position:56%
if I'm asking the same question, but
how do you feel about the casting

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.050 position:56%
for the movie comparing to the book?

&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: I knew
this was going to come up.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.260
I'm going to just, we're just,
I'm just going to address it.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.730
There's been a lot of discussion

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.680
about a specifically Amandla
Stenberg being cast to play Starr,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.280
when Amandla looks so different
from the girl on the cover.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.560
I want to explain this.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.520
First of all yes colorism is real.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.140
Hollywood does have colorism stuff.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.190
Here's how this happened though.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.100
Amandla was cast almost
two years ago now

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.260
and when Amandla was cast I
was still editing the book.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.610
I had not even written a
description for the character Starr

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.980
because I write descriptions,
physical descriptions last.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.490
There was not even a cover for the
book, so there was nothing for them

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.030
to look at and say oh well this
is how the character looks,

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.330
this is what we need.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.780
At the time Amandla
had just come out with

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:52.040
that video Don't Cash Crop my
Cornrows and Amandla was so vocal

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.400
about issues like this that
it felt like the perfect fit.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.280
And people would say well why
didn't you describe Starr to look

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.310
like Amandla or make them, I don't
write characters based on actors

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.560
or actresses because
something could have happened,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.040
Amandla could've dropped out.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.340
Then what?

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.640
You know what I mean?

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.820
So in the cover, the cover
is an artist interpretation.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.450
I have no say on the cover.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:18.710
I think the cover is
beautiful, but I'm also excited

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.950
to see what Amandla
does with this role.

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.330
They are dedicated to it.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.060 position:56%
They've been dedicated since for two
years now when nobody knew anything

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.750 position:56%
about the Hate You Give, Amandla was

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.530
out there pushing this book,
talking about this book.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.800
Amandla was out there
being vocal about this book

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.240
and supporting this book.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.450
So I support them just as much
as they support me and I get it.

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:42.870
I get it, I hear you, I
hear the conversations.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.200
Trust me I've been tagged in
enough stuff on Twitter, I hear it.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.830
I hear it, but and I'm not saying
the conversations aren't valid.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.870
But in this case this
is how it came to be.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.500
Before Starr had a description,
before Starr had a cover,

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.420 position:56%
Amandla was cast because Amandla
was passionate about the same things

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.040
that Starr is passionate
about at the end of the day.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.160 position:56%
And but that passion I feel is going
to show on screen and I'm excited

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.230
to see what they do with
the role, I absolutely am.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.420

being the person that ask.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.490
It takes the, I'm not saying
you created it, no, no, no, no.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.720
Don't get no, but it takes
true allies stand with us.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:19.950 position:56%
You know you can stand with us on it
you know and that's what it takes.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.590
It takes sometimes other
people saying something.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.980
It takes other people standing
alongside us sometimes.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.280
We need it.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.580 position:56%
We need more voices helping us speak

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.810
up because sometimes
people just look at us

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.630
and say we're just complaining
or we're making this up.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.960
We need more people to
stand beside us and say no,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.490
this is actually happening.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.030
We're not going to stand for it.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.730
So thank you for even wondering
where you stand and for even trying

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.160
to figure out what you should do.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.270
So I say shouting along with us,
don't shout at us [laughter].

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:49.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:55.550

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.570
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Alright, thank
you everyone, thank you Angie.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.870
It's been great.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:01.170
&gt;&gt; Angie Thomas: Thank you,
thank you so much [applause].
