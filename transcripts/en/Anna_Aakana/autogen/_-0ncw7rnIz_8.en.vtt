00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.720
Hey guys!  So in today's video

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.840
I'm going to show you what's in my baggage!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.560
This has been a highly requested video and I'm very excited to show you all.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:17.480
So.  Perfect.  Let's start with the basics.  I like to have my anxiety, insecurity, and jealously all in one place for compact travel.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.880
It's just so much easier if all of the complementary baggage is accessible in one!

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.980
Oh!  No girl can ever leave the house without her rage.  I like to bring a ton of different anger sources with me.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.660
Whether it's external irritations, internal worrying, traumatic incidents from the past, or even just a memory or two that makes me feel embarrassed or ashamed.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.040
Ah.  Ah!  This is my absolute essential.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.140
My depression.  I cannot go anywhere without my depression.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.080
Fun fact about my depression (it's actually vintage!) it was my mom's and then she got it from her mom

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.880
who got it from her mom who got it from hers.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.420
Beautiful.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.500
Oh!  Self doubt is my favorite thing to bring when I go outside!

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.660
Because every girl has to be her own worst critic!

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.380
"You're so stupid.  Everyone thinks that you suck."

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.740
You too, Honey!

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.340
Haha!

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.580
And of course, it's pretty deep in here

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.720
but my abandonment issues are in every relationship

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.820
friends, family, lovers especially

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.820
now, not everyone needs abandonment issues.  You have to find the issues that work for you.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.000
Whether it's Daddy Issues, Trust Issues,  or just plain addictions.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.860
I actually got my abandonment issues from fighting with my little sister and telling her that I hated her and then she went off and killed herself.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.320
So now I believe that if I upset anyone and they leave they're going to go take their own life.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.300
Remember guys, though you know something on an intellectual level, doesn't mean it will register emotionally.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.300
Oh no!

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.040
No, it will come back.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.080
It's fine.  She'll be back.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.780
It's okay.  It's okay.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.980
*gasping for air*

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.040
Anyway!  Thanks so much for tuning into today's episode.  Let me know what essential emotional baggage you bring with you on a day out.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.940
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.
