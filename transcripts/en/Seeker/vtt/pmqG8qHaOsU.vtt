00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.720
It's the miracle of life… you get to a certain
age and your biological clock kicks in, your

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.570
mom starts calling you and pestering you for
grandbabies...

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:17.460
It's the 21st century… are we still victims
of the biological need to Fam Up?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.340
babies
Inside our brain is the hypothalamus and inside

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.680
that is the supra-chiasmatic nucleus, a small
grouping of brain cells which make sure our

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.060
metabolism, hormones, body temperature, and
sleep/wake cycle stay on beat.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.660
Biological clocks are an example of convergent
evolution, as plants, fungi, animals and cyanobacteria

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.450
all seem to have some kind of clock.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.579
Flowers need to know when to open, close,
or release fragrance; deciduous trees need

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.670
to know when to pop buds or drop leaves -- and
humans have a biological clock telling us

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.950
when it’s time to bear our own fruit, so
to speak.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.440
When we're not talking about our daily biological
clock, usually people mean when are you having

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.539
the babies?

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.850
But is that a biological clock too?

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.940
Or just a social one?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.810
The puberty clock is a mysterious beast.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.219
A June 2015 study in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Scientists found after

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.579
puberty set in, the set of neurons in the
mammalian brain which tell the body when to

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.369
release sex hormones.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.880
Meaning, scientists have found the switch
that tells our sex organs when to make eggs

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.969
and sperm… and as time marches on, fertility
begins to diminish.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.469
According to a study in Human Reproduction,
the late 20s are the strongest biological

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.030
clock years for women.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.249
After 27 the chances of becoming pregnant
during any one menstrual cycle declines slowly,

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:42.389
and after 35 rates have dropped 40 percent;
basically, it's almost twice as difficult

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:45.369
to get pregnant after 35 than at 19.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.680
Which explains that oft-reported late-20s
biological tick-tock; the body is saying,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.149
“You’re running out of time!

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.149
Do it now!”

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.090
But it's not just them ladies, y'all.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.919
Men have a biological clock too.

00:01:55.919 --> 00:02:00.159
For most of the history of modern medicine,
women have been the focus of infertility,

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.099
but in the last two to three decades, the
spotlight has been on men too.

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.509
As men age, their sperm volume and quality
decreases (we've talked about this on DNews

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.830
before, as our subscribers know).

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.519
And a 2008 study in Nature found of 100,000
men studied, offspring of those over 40 had

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.330
a 475 percent increase in autism spectrum
disorder, in comparison to those under 30.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.280
One would think, if it was biological, the
clock would kick in near the end of your ability

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.939
to safely have babies.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.450
And by studying In-vitro fertilization treatments,
McGill University found 43 and a half was

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.260
the crossover age for males with or without
offspring; suggesting the tick-tock was strongest

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.450
in the late 30s; and just like with the ladies,
your body is yelling at you to get a move

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.450
on!

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.180
So, since it would seem biological baby fever
is real, what about emotional?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.349
According to one 2011 study in Emotion, both
men and women experience the "fever."

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.951
They explored it from three angles 1. we are
trained by society to have babies; 2. we have

00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:08.530
a need to nurture; or 3. we adapt to babies
through our exposure.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.530
Using surveys with (an admittedly) small dataset,
neither needing to nurture nor social pressure

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.019
explained baby fever as strongly as the adaptational
view.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.620
According to their findings, "positive exposure
to babies" made people want to have kids,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.219
but "negative exposure," loud infants who
cry, or stink, made people shy away.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.430
They conclude people's positive and negative
experiences are weighed by their subconscious,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.920
and that flips our biological baby switch.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.760
As expected, baby fever is a combination of
subconscious concerns over viable offspring

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.480
and positive life experiences for both men
and women.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.069
If you’re around babies, you wants one.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.590
As men garner more focus from the scientific
community you we can all look forward feeling

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.269
the pressure from… wait… hang on…

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.319
Interestingly, the researchers from the Emotional
study found something else… after the first

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.400
kid, women's self-rated baby fever dropped,
whereas men's rose.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.000
The researchers guess women’s baby fever
was somehow satisfied, and perhaps men wanted

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.250
to spread their seed even more after their
first success?

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.560
As we usually say, more research is needed.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.560
exits

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.560
What do you think?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.490
Do you feel the tick tock of the biological
clock?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.490
Pressure from Mom?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.490
Dad?

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.790
Tell us about it in the comments.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.380

clock, check out this video Anthony did where

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:46.720
he explores how our biological clock gets
