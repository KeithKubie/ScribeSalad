Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. The topic is totally tumor. Of course. It's my line by the way. Oh No. Yeah, yeah. We've been talking about tumors. This, our famous tumors and thus far they've been really bad. Heritable tumor, any bad Geary, horrible tumors. But because we are fair-minded about everything, even tumors, let us consider the possibility that sometimes tumors can be rich, beautiful and desirable. For example.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Well, George Malley is an ordinary man who is about to become extraordinary name as many mammals as you can in 60 seconds. How about Alphabetic r Brock, Batman, Caribou, Dauphine, OHIP hip. This what is going on in this 1996 movie, John Travolta plays a guy. If it gets a brain tumor and a tumor, the performance makes him into a genius are quests of [inaudible] Portuguese language in 20 minutes. Not all of it. Phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Learn the accent though too, where it doesn't give accents, but, but it does. It does raise a feel question, which is like can't, is it possible for a tumor to create something good? So we paid a visit to a guy, a doctor named Orrin Devinsky.

Speaker 3:          01:16          I'm a neurologist at NYU Langone school of Medicine

Speaker 1:          01:20          and Dr Divinsky has had a lifelong interest in the beneficial effects of certain kinds of brain conditions. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:26          Yeah. I'll just tell you, I think one of the most fascinating cases in neurology very quickly, and this one we were not prepared for. A gentleman was described who ever since he was a child would look at safety pins and have an orgasm at safety pins at safety pins. The more shiny and the more numerous, the safety pin, the stronger the sexual experience. And this happened from his pubescent period. He just safety pins and try them on. Right. If you were pretty, he made this association when you looked at a safety pin, he had an orgasm, so he got to have been embarrassed by this. This is worse than being so yeah. So he would go into pride. He realized this is not something most people do. He never talked about it and he did it in private and then he got married after the war. He was honorably discharged and got married and then started having less sex with his wife because the safety pin was much safety pins were much more enjoyable. Sometimes you just had to think about a safety pin, not even hold it up.

Speaker 1:          02:21          So wait, where are we seriously making the case that this guy is getting a benefit from furiously pin obsession. But I think actually you could say that the experiences that this guy was having with those safety pins gave them a kind of pleasure that maybe is unavailable to the rest of us from an odd, odd source, but you know, pleasures pleasure until says Devinsky. This fellow began to have seizures,

Speaker 3:          02:43          got admitted to a psychiatric hospital in London, the Mozley, one of the big psychiatric units. They actually got an EEG. And to make a long story short, there was a benign tumor.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Oh, right in the part that's called the temporal lobe, sort of in the middle of your head, right behind your eyes.

Speaker 3:          02:57          But they took it out. They took it out, they took it out, and they cured him of his wonderful experience. So he, uh, he never was able to, he could look at safety pins all day long, but he would never again enjoy them the way he had for his whole life. How did he feel about that? Um, I think it was a mixed blessing as you would imagine.

Speaker 4:          03:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:24          well, I've got blue jeans on sneakers and this idea that from a tune where you can get something in the not so good, but also something good. This is an idea that has, well, there has been a, a novel written on this theme. The title of the book is lying awake by a friend of mine. My name is Mark Salzman. Mark is a writer who lives out in California and he thought, I'm going to imagine a nun, our main characters, sister John of the cross. This is a woman who had joined a nunnery because she felt just lonely for a relationship with God.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Yes. It's just not enough for her to tell herself. Yes, God is there. What she longs for is a tangible sense of God's presence, a sense that she can really feel God's presence in her life. And, um, she, she begins having what she thinks are migraine headaches that the regular doctor that the sisters see tells her that she seems to be having migraine headaches. They're coming more and more frequently and there comes a point when one of these headaches changes dramatically and then everything is different. Everything is different. What's different? Well, what happens? Shall I read? Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. You kind of have to imagine this scene taking place in, uh, an environment of profound silence.

Speaker 4:          04:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:44          She's in the cloister. She and one other sister, they're working on a sewing project. They're sewing an altar cloth. One of the pins slipped out of her hand ringing like a miniature triangle is it bounced off the floor. She looked down to the floor and saw that it looked impossibly distant when she reached down for the pin, her hand look strangest of all as if it belonged to someone else. The silence in the room came alive like the words left out of a poem.

Speaker 4:          05:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          05:25          something buried. So deep insider, but she'd forgotten it was there rose to the surface sister, are you not feeling well? God was present and sister and his voice was present in her face. Nothing was changed yet everything was changed. God is here. She answered, you were here all along.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Well this is a field goal isn't it? For someone seeking a spiritual connection. She has one. That's right. She was. This is the moment she's been waiting for all her life. But there is a problem because when these things come in, sorry can we you she has a tumor. Let's just get the non surprise out of the way. The show is called totally tumor famous tumors. Okay. Yes. She has a meningioma, a benign tumor, small about the size of a raisin in the temporal lobe area of her brain. Right in the same spot where the safety pin fellow had his tumor. So the problem for her is should I have the tumor removed, give up the most satisfying and fulfilling experience of my whole life or should I sacrifice my health in order to share with others the experiences that I'm having. So we thought, well our Devinsky the doctor we spoke with first.

Speaker 5:          06:46          I think every case is unique and individual. See patients like this. This is what he does for that. So we took the case to him. Now here's the question. If a person comes and says, I'm having what I want and you are suspicious that what she also is having is a disease, what do you do about the patient?

Speaker 3:          07:07          If I knew for sure that the tumor, let's say was benign and would never grow, and the only thing that person experienced was this religious feeling that they've found extremely enjoyable, I would say let's do nothing but do serial scans to make sure nothing grows in that you're safe.

Speaker 5:          07:24          But in the book, as it happens, the nun got a little worse. She had a few more

Speaker 1:          07:28          headaches, the more severe, and they took the tumor out, the seizure activity stops

Speaker 4:          07:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:36          these experiences stopped coming

Speaker 4:          07:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:40          and she does feel afterwards a sense of Blah

Speaker 4:          07:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:47          she feels as if she sort of tumbled out of a Himalayan mountain into a muddy village.

Speaker 4:          07:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:54          this is common apparently in patients after they've been treated. Right.

Speaker 5:          07:57          So my last question then is really about the, it seems to me the deepest question though. All on this case is that, um, if someone has a very important and meaningful experience and you have a sense, it may be a abnormality, a physical abnormality that is triggering them, do you regard them as delusional? Like there's just the possibility here that maybe these people are having an actual conversation. So

Speaker 3:          08:27          yeah, there's no question. Are you not even considered that? No, I mean, so side I think the question you asked and I think you're getting at is could it truly be that this is God's Evan knew to speak to us, um, and people in the late 18 hundreds thought it was through the right hemisphere. And that's often where these cases occur in the right hemisphere. So it may be that that's right. It's the more emotional hemisphere and when things are in a perturbed state, you may be more receptive to experiencing spiritual things. And I think there probably is some physiologic basis that allows you to tune into a broader world and maybe some states of neurologic dysfunction allow you to harmonize or tune in or receive those messages so to speak. In which case then your tumor or your epilepsy would be the window or the conduit.

Speaker 3:          09:19          Right. I do feel like I need to place an asterix right here, like we are talking about a tumor in the end. Well, but understand that every feeling, every thought you have comes from cells in your brain. Yeah. Any of those cells can produce a glorious experience than the experienced stands on its own and sometimes in very well documented cases. These are extraordinarily profound, desirable thing. They're often hard to put into words. Have you tried, I mean, when you, I mean people, you know Destro Yefsky, he's probably the most articulate person with epilepsy who's had a religious experience and who wrote down what he experienced. I don't have the quote in front of me, but it's, you know, this Felicity, this, this a feeling I get

Speaker 5:          10:06          for several moments he was quoted to say that I would experience such joy as would be inconceivable in ordinary life. I would feel the most complete harmony in myself and in the whole world. And this feeling was so strong and sweet that for a few seconds of such bliss, I would give

Speaker 4:          10:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          10:27          10 or more years of my life

Speaker 4:          10:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          10:30          even my whole life.

Speaker 4:          10:35          [inaudible] hi.
