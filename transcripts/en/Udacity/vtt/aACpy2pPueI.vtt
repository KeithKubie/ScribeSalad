00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.020
So first we're going to make a pandas

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.750
data frame. Again, I'm going to call it hr year.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.895
That will read in hr by team year sf

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:11.100
ls.csv. Then we'll create our ggplot. So we'll say

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.470
print ggplot hr year, and note that we say

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.300
aes yearID, HR, and then we set color equal

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.680
to teamID. Then we're going to add geometric points

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.020
and geometric lines, but not pass on a color.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.860
Otherwise this is very similar to our basic plot, which

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.590
didn't have different lines and points for different teams. Let's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.490
see what this creates when we actually run it. As

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.860
you can see we have here a chart which compares the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.402
total number of home runs hit per year, for the

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:43.830
L.A. Dodgers, called here LAN for LA National League. And

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.150
the San Francisco Giants, called here SFN for San Francisco

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.380
National League. We have two different sets of points and lines

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.170
which are color coded according to team, and we're able to compare how the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.100
total number of home runs hit have varied by year for the two teams.
