&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; It's September 20, 2017.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.470
I'm Jennifer Cutting.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.430
I'm a Folk Life Specialist in
the American Folk Life Center,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.670
and I'm here with Cathy
Fink and Marcy Marxer,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.490
who have just participated

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.760
in the Take the Archive
Challenge Concert

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.260
in our Homegrown Concert Series.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.130
Cathy and Marcy, thank you for
taking the Archive Challenge.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jennifer.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.730
This is wonderful.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.320
&gt;&gt; You sounded wonderful on
the stuff that you picked,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.710
and what was interesting to
me is that some of the folks

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.860
in the Archive Challenge
came into the Reading Room

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.230
to select their material, and
some of you selected it online,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.770
and you guys didn't come
into the Reading Room,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.700
but found great stuff online.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.190
And I wondered you know, were
there any particular challenges

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.040
about finding it online
as opposed to coming

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.690
into the Reading Room?

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.310
&gt;&gt; They are definitely
different experiences,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.810
but because we were,
from the time we heard

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.200
about the challenge to today,
we were traveling so much,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.080
that we knew we weren't going to
have the time to come in and sit

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.030
and do that, away from
travels and things like that.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.490
And it was such an incredible
experience, to have the luxury

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.110
of listening on the
road through the magic

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.550
of the archives on the internet.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.500
And in some ways, it
probably offered us different

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.260
opportunities than doing
this live and in person.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.560
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.820
&gt;&gt; Simply because you can
just keep scrolling through

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.460
and honestly, I would say
that I probably got lost

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.360
in about 12 hours of listening.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.230
&gt;&gt; Wow! That's amazing
amount of listening.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.970
&gt;&gt; It's an amazing
amount of listening,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.710
and some of it was pieces
I was familiar with.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.460
A lot of it were pieces
I wasn't familiar with.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.790
I probably earmarked 10
pieces for us to consider

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.720
that we didn't do, but that
are now on our list of oh,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.410
there's a song I'd
like to do sometime.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.030
&gt;&gt; Oh great, maybe there's
an album in it [chuckles].

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.330
&gt;&gt; That would be great.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.730
&gt;&gt; There could very well.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.850
I mean, there could be
so many albums in it.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.350
And particularly of things that
are not terribly well-known,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.200
or not known at all, you know?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.710
And I think that's
one of the beauties

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.540
that there is this archive of
common ground, and obscurities.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.140
&gt;&gt; And--

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.440
&gt;&gt; Hidden gems.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.740
&gt;&gt; Hidden gems, you know?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.040
They're little diamonds
in the sand.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.340
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.040
&gt;&gt; It was a great experience
to do that listening,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.240
and by example, we played a
medley of fiddle tunes collected

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.150
by Alan Jabbour, the founder of
the American Folk Life Center,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.840
of him and his wife Karen,
collecting fiddle tunes

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.250
from a southern Virginia
fiddler named Henry Reed.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.540
And both of the tunes that we
picked are tunes that we knew.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.850
&gt;&gt; But to listen in detail
exactly how Henry Reed played

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.650
them, and bring that
back, 30 to 40 years

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.320
after learning those tunes.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.620
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.800
&gt;&gt; It's a really
nice experience.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:58.040
And I have to say that it gave
me a renewed huge appreciation,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.070
not only for Alan Jabbour's
work filtered out to us all

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.040
through the people he hung
with in Chappell Hill, Durham,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.550
North Carolina, starting a band
called the Hollow Rock String

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.820
Band, touring and
performing with a bunch

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.860
of different string
bands, and recording some

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.090
of those tunes that, you
know, 30 or 40 years ago,

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.210
everybody was learning from
those second-hand recordings.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.170
&gt;&gt; And at the time, no
internet, you'd be lucky

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.920
to hear a first-hand recording.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.580
&gt;&gt; Now, we're lucky that we can
hear them either on the internet

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.770
or a beautiful visit here.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.020
&gt;&gt; Well thank you for being so
eloquent about that experience.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.380
It's a great case
for us continuing

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.020
to put collections online.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.400
&gt;&gt; I can't beg you
enough [laughter]

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.230
to continue putting them online.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.590
&gt;&gt; And the archives is magic,
though, I mean, there's so much

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.220
in there, you can
sit down and listen

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.860
to the original recordings
in the Library of Congress,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.920
in the Folk Archives,
and it is unbelievable.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.300
But one of the things the
internet does is let other

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.110
people experience some
of that magic, you know?

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.410
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.710
&gt;&gt; There's nothing
like listening

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.010
to the original recordings.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.310
Absolutely nothing.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.410
But at least there's
a way into that music.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.200
&gt;&gt; And for busy musicians
on the road.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.800
&gt;&gt; Like you guys.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.100
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and I
feel like, you know,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.570
knowing that Sam Gleaves
was going to be here

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.060
and accompanying us, Sam
lives in Berea, Kentucky,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.470
he had become good friends with
Jean Ritchey and her family,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.520
and we worked with Jean many
times over the last 40 years

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.470
or so, accompanied her at some
festivals, been to, you know,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.910
parties and Suarez, and jam
sessions and all of that,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:53.080
and so we knew that we wanted
to do something of Jean's.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.610
We also knew that we didn't
want to do something of hers

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.540
that was well-known,
or had been done a lot.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.440
We wanted to dig in there.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.680
And so there is that
short little song.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.540
If I Were a Blackbird.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.910
Which she learned from
someone in Ireland.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.200
But it was while she was
on a Fulbright Scholarship,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.510
researching the connections
between Appalachian music

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.220
and British Isles music.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.720
And so we were right at the
corner of the two places

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.320
in her life at that time, and--

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.670
&gt;&gt; I didn't know the background.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.970
&gt;&gt; That was, to me, very
influential and then add to that

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.640
that Sam had also spent
a lot of time with Jean,

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.670
we also felt it important to
also keep this very personal,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.430
and because Alan and a lot of
his musical buddies were mentors

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.360
of ours, and as was Jean, as
well as friends, we just sort

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.170
of felt like, oh,
we get to learn,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.070
we get to honor these
people at the same time,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.430
we hear something new, and I
guarantee you, we'll be back

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.030
in those archives
on the road a lot.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.330
&gt;&gt; Great, great to hear.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.630
Great to hear.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.330
Well, when I went back to
re-listen to those tunes

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.240
that you chose, I was struck

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.710
by how possibly challenging
it could be, to, you know,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.630
for example, with the tune
Granny, it seemed to my ear

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.650
to have an extra beat at the end
of the A music, and I thought,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.740
well are they going to
even it out, are they going

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.940
to put the extra beat in there?

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.320
And it just flowed,
the way you did it.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.620
It was--

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.390
&gt;&gt; And I think that Henry
Reed was not always consistent

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.160
in where that extra beat might
happen, or might not happen.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.630
And I know that he played
for a lot of dances.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:53.320
He also played banjo and
harmonica, and my guess is

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.830
that he knew enough
in a dance not

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.130
to throw the extra
beat in [laughter].

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.110
&gt;&gt; When there were
dancers dancing, right.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:06.620
I had mentioned before to you
that one of those tunes turned

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.550
up on a Flying Fish
album, and I think it was--

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.850
&gt;&gt; Shoes and Stockings.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.230
&gt;&gt; Shoes and Stockings
turned up on Sandy's Fancy?

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.530
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.160
&gt;&gt; On the Flying
Fish label in 81,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.640
but you said you were
playing it before that.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.750
&gt;&gt; Well I learned the tune in
the late 70s, from Irene Herman,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.830
who was a member of
the Harmony Sisters

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.080
with Alice Gerard
and Jeannie McCleary.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.380
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.230
&gt;&gt; And Irene was hanging
out at Alice's house,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.730
and I was down the street
at Helen Schnare's house,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.620
in Kensington, Maryland,
Garrett Park area.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.000
And I think Irene had probably
learned the tune from Alan.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.300
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.710
&gt;&gt; So that was my first
exposure to that tune.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.250
And then of course Alan
recorded it with Sandy Bradley,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.130
and it was re-released
as a double album,

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.200
I think with the Hollow Rock
String Band and Sandy's Fancy.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.120
It was re-released as one CD.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.420
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm, okay.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.580
&gt;&gt; And that gets a fair
amount of play in our car

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.900
on the road, actually.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.200
&gt;&gt; Oh great!

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.760
&gt;&gt; Love those tunes,
and love hearing them,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.070
love hearing Alan play them.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.350
Brings back a lot of memories
to hear Sandy accompany him.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.720
&gt;&gt; And you know,
it's a great way

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.470
of just keeping this
stuff alive.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.320
I mean, the music, the music
exists, but the music is part

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:32.500
of the stories, and with each of
these tunes, Marcy has a story,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.350
I have a story, Sam has a story.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.650
Alan has a story.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.540
Henny Reed has a story.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.210
Then all these stories swirl

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.100
around each other,
and what do you know?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.720
Next thing is Sam's whole
generation 40 years younger

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.020
than us.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.570
They embrace this, they have
stories, and it keeps on going.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.870
It morphs.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.170
As it should.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.620
You know, Sam Gleaves is
an amazing songwriter,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.210
but right in the heart center
of the kind of tradition

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.070
that Jean Ritchey
wrote songs in.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.370
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.840
&gt;&gt; And to me, that's where
we gather our strength

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.430
from the people before us.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.130
&gt;&gt; That's beautifully
put, beautifully put,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.180
and today Alan Jabbour's
tunes that he collected,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.200
as played by you, have come
home, and Jean Ritchey's song,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.760
that's in our collection,
has come home.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.660
With that particular song,
If I Were a Blackbird,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:38.000
it was sung unaccompanied, and
when I listen to what you did

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.550
with it, adding penny
whistle, I was not able to get

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.720
out into the audience
during the concert,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.550
so I couldn't tell were you
playing in standard tuning

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.850
or in alternate tuning?

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.390
&gt;&gt; No, I actually played
guitar in a banjo tuning.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's interesting!

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.400
&gt;&gt; And on this song, we
played around with about six

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.810
or seven different
arrangement possibilities.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.110
&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.400
&gt;&gt; I talked about playing it
on the dulcimer, since Jean was

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.740
such a beautiful dulcimer
player, and I actually--

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.530
dulcimer was my third
instrument.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.650
Piano first, guitar
second, dulcimer third.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.460
And I thought about that,
and we loved the song

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.030
so much we realized
that we were going

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.730
to want to be performing it.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.710
Outside of this concert,
we're doing a lot

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.010
of shows together with Sam.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.310
&gt;&gt; That's great news to us!

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.030
&gt;&gt; And so I thought, you
know, I love the dulcimer,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.430
but we're not going to
be taking it on the road.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.360
Where can I get the drones,
and sort of that, again,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.140
that cross-section
between where Appalachian

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.080
and British Isles
music and vibes meet.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.180
And so I knew it was going to
be an open tuning on the guitar,

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.610
and I also thought, you
know, I could put this

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.070
in a banjo modal tuning.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.370
&gt;&gt; Ah!

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.670
&gt;&gt; So that's what I did.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.680
I put my guitar in
banjo modal tuning.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.980
&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.540
&gt;&gt; And it gave me all
the drones that I wanted,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.220
which is what the
dulcimer would give us.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.520
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.820
&gt;&gt; Then Sam added some of that,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.010
along with the melody
on the fiddle.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:17.150
&gt;&gt; And Marcy captured some
of that Irish ornamentation.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.450
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.750
&gt;&gt; And her beautiful vocal.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.050
&gt;&gt; In her vocal.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.350
&gt;&gt; And the penny whistle.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.650
&gt;&gt; And penny whistle.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.950
And it turned, you know,
I think the thing is,

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.320
it's a great example of
a tiny little melody,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.180
I mean Jean's recording
is very short.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.480
&gt;&gt; It is short.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.780
&gt;&gt; It's a tiny little melody,

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.280
but it's such a beautiful
melody.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.800
&gt;&gt; And it's a great story.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.510
&gt;&gt; And you want to hear
it over and over again.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.880
You don't tire of it.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.160
And so we felt like, well if we
introduce it with the fiddle,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.800
and then some of
the story comes out,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.590
and then a little more story and
the fiddle and the penny whistle

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:59.520
that we could more
thoroughly tell this story.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.670
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:08.110
&gt;&gt; And it just felt like what
we wanted to be doing with it.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.700
And my guess, we're about
to make a recording,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.140
so this may end up on it.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.440
&gt;&gt; That's wonderful.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.740
So the arrangement
that you put together

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.200
for today's archive
challenge concert will go

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.500
on to have a life.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.800
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.100
&gt;&gt; And all goes around again.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.400
So.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.700
&gt;&gt; Well it does, and it
goes around in another way,

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.700
I mean Cathy touched on this,
but to us, not only to know

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.490
that their music is here, and
it's always available to anybody

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.790
who wants to hear
it is remarkable,

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.880
but these are people
who were our friends.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.650
You know? We could have gone
another way, but with Alan,

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.190
and Jean, they're people
we knew our entire careers,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.020
until they passed,
which was recent.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.320
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.130
&gt;&gt; And with Alan, we spent
years playing at folk festivals

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.610
and cliff top jam festivals
with him and Mike Seger,

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.400
and with Jean, you
know, we just loved her.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.470
And we got hired years ago to
play a festival that she was at,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.460
the Golden Link in Rochester.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.760
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.310
&gt;&gt; And I was really happy
because I could get a whole hour

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.990
of Jean Ritchey, and she
was going to play solo.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.640
This was so long ago, I can't
remember how long it was,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.950
but then she asked us to play
with her, and we thought,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.600
oh yeah, that's nice too.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.580
And she said, "Well I want it
to be just like my records,"

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.010
so we ran to the CD
table, bought records,

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.840
and went to the car, and learned
the arrangements on the records

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.480
as fast as we could,
and hoped for the best.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.780
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.890
&gt;&gt; But then we had a
repertoire with Jean,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.570
you know, we knew her stuff.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.230
&gt;&gt; About how much of it was
it a whole, you know, hour?

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.530
&gt;&gt; Oh it was an hour.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.830
&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was an hour,
off three different CDs,

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.430
and she gave us a list of songs.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.730
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.260
&gt;&gt; So that was great, but then
to see that, this is available

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.870
to people, anybody
who wants to hear it,

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.430
young people doing research,
older people doing research,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.630
people want to delve
into the music further.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.360
It's just such a great resource.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.660
Thank you for your work--

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.960
&gt;&gt; I want to say too--

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.260
&gt;&gt; It's really remarkable.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.560
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you
for thanking us.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.220
&gt;&gt; In listening to Jean's
recording that Alan Lomax made,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.520
in this particular recording,

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.760
was made in his apartment
in Greenwich Village.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.060
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.800
&gt;&gt; Third Street, 1949.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.630
&gt;&gt; June 2nd, 1949.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.970
So neither of us was around yet.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:30.080
But when you listen to
her sing, the purity,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.080
and clarity of her
voice is so there.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.330
And Jean had that remained
part of her singing.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:46.310
It was, you know, I want
to say unadulterated.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:52.090
It was such a pure,
Appalachian soprano.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.390
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:16:00.250
&gt;&gt; And just beautiful to hear
the young Jean Ritchey sing,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.430
and make that connection
to various other stages

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.670
in her career, where
we got to hear her.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.970
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.700
You heard her at many
stages of the life cycle.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.110
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.520
Absolutely.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.770
&gt;&gt; Well it's wonderful to
know that you went back so far

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.530
with her, that you had
this connection with her,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.970
and with Alan Jabbour,
and as I say,

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.240
it's all come home
today with this concert.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.830
And we very much appreciate
both of you coming,

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.060
and sharing your arrangements
of these songs and tunes,

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.270
and taking the Archive
Challenge.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.570
Thank you Cathy and Marcy.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.170
&gt;&gt; Thanks for inviting us, this
was-- a pleasure and a treat.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.470
&gt;&gt; It was a blast.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.770
&gt;&gt; It was great.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.050
&gt;&gt; September 20th, 2017,
I'm Jennifer Cutting,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.840
a folk life specialist in the
American Folk Life Center,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.660
and I'm here with Klezmer
genius, Seth Kibel.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.420
We've just concluded the Archive
Challenge sampler concert.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.030
That took place in the
Coolidge Auditorium,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.790
in which musicians were invited
to identify field recordings

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.630
that they could fall
in love with,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.870
and put their own
creative stamp on,

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.320
and play for a very
appreciative audience,

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.750
and they were appreciative
today.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.770
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:19.160
&gt;&gt; You played a medley of tunes
from the Ruth Rubin Collection,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.110
from a musician called Barish
[assumed spelling] Cats.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.060
Can you tell me a little
bit about Barish Katz?

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:31.700
&gt;&gt; Sure, well Barish Katz
was a fiddler, violinist.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.000
He also worked as a Bodkin
in the old country, now,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.790
Bodkin was kind of like--

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.140
imagine a cross between a
ringmaster for a circus,

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.430
and a wedding planner
for a Jewish wedding.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.350
You know, Jewish weddings in the
old country were very confusing

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.650
and complicated affairs.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.860
They, you know, took place for
several days, often as long

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.950
as a week, involving
the entire community.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.140
There was no such thing as
a guest list, and took place

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.850
in various locations, indoors

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.980
and outdoors throughout
the Stettler Village.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.860
So the Bodkin was
responsible for, you know,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.120
making sure everyone did what
they were supposed to do,

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.480
and were where they
were supposed to be

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.100
at the right time, and
organizing the sequence

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.020
of events, and making sure
everyone did what they're

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.320
supposed to do at
the right time,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.690
but also introducing people,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.730
and just generally making sure
the guests had a good time.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:26.860
Again, kind of an emcee,
ringmaster sort of person.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.980
And yeah, Barish Katz did
that in the old country,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.870
and apparently he came from
a long line of Bodkins,

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.740
and Ruth Rubin, well,
let me back up,

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.590
the Ruth Rubin Archive
is a legendary archive

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.660
in Jewish music, I mean, it
has just been a treasure trove

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.740
of material, mostly
from the Ashkenazi,

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.970
eastern European
Jewish tradition.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.760
Now, a vast majority

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.190
of the countless hours
Ruth Rubin recorded is

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.600
of vocal music.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.440
She traveled all over the world,
throughout New York, Israel,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.320
all over, and getting people
to sing these songs for her.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.650
Now, I'm not a vocalist,
so I was very intrigued

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.130
by the Ruth Rubin Archives,
and enjoyed listening to stuff.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.680
But I found this
tape by this fiddler,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.900
I thought okay this is something
I can, like, directly tackle.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.580
So Barish Katz was originally
from Galatia, which is, well,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.580
I guess it's today part of
present-day Poland and Ukraine.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.630
And he played for Ruth Rubin
in 1947, all these songs

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.250
that he said he learned from
his uncle in the old country,

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.560
in the town where they grew
up, which is called Glena,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.890
and it was great to listen to.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.660
Because there were all these
little snippets, you know,

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.840
20 seconds, 30 seconds, 45
seconds, just tune after tune

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.280
after tune, and like
so much of this music,

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.070
everything sounded
vaguely familiar to me,

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.480
but nothing was actually
something I'd heard before,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.930
so it was all like,
you know, new melodies,

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.500
and new repertoire, for
me, which was so much fun

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.300
to sink my teeth into.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.270
&gt;&gt; And you did a great
job of arranging them

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.040
into two separate medleys.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.340
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.330
&gt;&gt; How did you decide which
tunes to put in which medley?

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, what I
did is first I listened a lot

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:21.620
to the recordings after you guys
so kindly digitized them for me,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.150
and I picked a whole bunch of
melodic snippets that I liked,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.430
that I just, in and
of themselves, again,

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.340
unaccompanied violin, and
then I transcribed those,

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.110
so then you know, midway
through this process,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.090
I had all these transcriptions,

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.630
of all these little
different melodic fragments,

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.900
or short excerpts, and
then I began to think,

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.630
okay how can I group
these together in ways

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.260
that make various, at least
some semblance of sense,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.450
and I tried to balance
it, because what I wanted

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.140
to do was I wanted
to make sure some

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.450
of the melodies were presented
in a more traditional light,

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.200
perhaps closer to the way
Barish Katz himself might have

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.240
performed them in an ensemble,
and then some of them I wanted

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.280
to put my own spin on them,
partially because I love

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.450
to keep it a, you know,
living, breathing tradition,

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.990
and partly because
it's just more fun,

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.350
it's kind of self-indulgent.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:17.240
So I just found, I experimented
on my own, playing them

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.740
in different combinations, and
what if I put this one here,

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.560
and this one there, you
know, it almost seems kind

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.450
of mathematical, I had
numbered them all, so I'd like--

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.580
okay, what if I go from
7 to 9 to 3, and then,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.010
okay that doesn't work,
how about 7, 9, 2!

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.610
You know, and I eventually
came up with these two melodies

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.340
that seemed to flow
pretty naturally.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.330
&gt;&gt; Thanks for describing
your process,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.230
which I was wondering about,
as I heard your medleys,

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.180
which so nicely moved
from different tempos

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.860
to different tonalities,
speaking of tonalities,

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.930
the field recordings
that you were working

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.070
with were just unaccompanied
melodies.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.370
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.770
&gt;&gt; And yet you came with
a pianist, Sean Lane,

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.430
who was playing chords
with these melodies.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.520
&gt;&gt; Now, did you decide on what
chords were going to be played

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.070
with the melodies, or did
Sean, or was it a combination?

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.810
&gt;&gt; It was mostly me.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.980
I sat down and I'm
a bad pianist, and--

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.480
&gt;&gt; And a good arranger
[laughter].

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.950
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, thank you,
and I sat down and worked

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.580
out harmonizations for all
these things, and again,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.840
different melodies I took
different approaches to.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.340
Some I said okay what-- a lot

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.220
of the melody is pretty
obvious what the original

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.520
harmonies were--

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.820
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.160
&gt;&gt; Like, let me go with what
it probably was, you know,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.530
and then there are
some other melodies,

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.340
like the waltz we ended with,
where I'm like okay, no,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.700
I'm not going to go with what
was probably the original

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.410
harmonies, I'm going to probably
put some jazz substitutions

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.080
and some chords that probably
would have made Barish Katz keel

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.450
over [laughter], you
know, I have no idea.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.440
&gt;&gt; I noticed that you
started with a straight waltz,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.200
and went into a jazz waltz.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.730
&gt;&gt; And that was fun.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.330
&gt;&gt; And on one of the tunes,

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.940
I noticed you used some
kind of Latino rhythm.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, we used that
kind of Montuno beat, uh,

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.230
kind of a Latin beat,
which fit remarkably well.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.530
&gt;&gt; It did.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.120
&gt;&gt; Under what was originally
probably a traditional Klezmer

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.760
freilach or bulgur, in fact,
we were talking, we might,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.850
at least that part,
we might just play!

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.360
On gigs and no one--

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.660
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.960
&gt;&gt; No one would even know,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.260
no would even know
[overlapping speakers].

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.560
It worked shockingly well, so...

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.860
&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.160
&gt;&gt; So that was fun.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.460
&gt;&gt; It was great.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.130
And tell me about the
process of incorporating Sean

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.760
into your arrangement?

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.320
&gt;&gt; Well, Sean and I
have worked together

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.420
for years and years and years.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.400
And the nice thing about
working with a musician

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.380
who you are very good friends
with and work very well with is

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.800
that you don't really have
to worry about their ego.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.090
So we were able to rehearse
and I could, you know,

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.910
I could easily say I don't
like what you just did,

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.970
and I don't have to worry
about him taking it personally.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.200
He knows I respect him
and like his musicianship.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.540
So it made it very
easy to kind of get him

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.440
to do what I was
hearing in my head.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.420
You know? Because we were
so used to working together,

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.480
I was able to say okay,
that I liked, or you know,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.330
change this feel, or
do something here.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.750
And he is someone
who originally,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.050
well he has classical training,

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.370
but is a very accomplished
jazz pianist.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.860
But then through me has done
a fair amount of Jewish music

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.080
as well, so he's got some
background in that as well,

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.070
and we tried to bring
all of that

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.410
into the arrangements we did.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.460
&gt;&gt; Have you ever tackled
field recordings before,

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.480
or is this your first
time using them?

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.670
&gt;&gt; This is certainly the
first time I've done this

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.980
in any serious degree,
I mean, this was kind

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.400
of a new experience for me.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.000
It was so much fun coming into
the archives, and just listening

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.390
to his stuff, and you
know, listening to some

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.140
of these field recordings,
it almost feels

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.750
like the closest
thing I will ever come

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.160
to an actual time machine.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.760
You know, you feel almost
voyeuristic, I mean,

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.670
it's one thing when
you're listening

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.980
to a commercial recording,
even one that is made,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.060
you know, 80, 90 years ago.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:02.520
You know the musicians being
listened to are expecting,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.280
or at least hoping that
other people will listen

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.580
to that music.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.880
This is different.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.630
This is the strange woman comes
into this guy's apartment,

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:16.130
you know, and says play me some
songs, play into this machine,

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:20.360
you know, even though it
was 1947, I've got to think

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.470
that would have been
even beyond,

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.310
almost beyond his comprehension.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.640
I don't want to say that in too
insulting a way, but just like,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.570
hard to fathom that those
melodies he was playing

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:35.950
in that moment, in 1947 would
be reinterpreted some 60--

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.260
is my math right?

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.880
Sixty years later!

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.580
No, 70! Seventy years later,
in the Library of Congress.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.190
I mean, that, when
I think about that,

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.740
that almost gives
me goose pimples.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.170
Like I say, I feel kind
of voyeuristic, you know,

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.470
that's a little window in time.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.810
So anyway, I totally
enjoyed the process.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.480
It was a real thrill.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.400
&gt;&gt; Well, we totally enjoyed
having you [chuckling]

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.180
and I just want to
thank you, Seth Kibel,

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.140
and I want to thank your
accompanist, Sean Lane,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.090
for taking the Archive
Challenge.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.370
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you!

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.150
&gt;&gt; September 20, 2017,
and I'm Jennifer Cutting,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.820
Folk Life Specialist, with
the American Folk Life Center,

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.880
here at the Library of Congress.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.800
We are here with Brazilian
musician, Cissa Paz,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.670
who has just performed in
our Homegrown Concert Series,

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.990
Archive Challenge Concert.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.050
And I'm happy to be
talking to Cissa now,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.610
about how she chose the field
recordings that she chose,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.070
and what the process of
arranging them was like.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:41.780
So first, I'll ask you, of
the Brazilian collections

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.250
that I recommended to
you, how did you hone

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.120
in on the discotheque
collection?

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.890
&gt;&gt; Well I listened to all of it.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.060
And all of it was so rich and
exciting, and it was really hard

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.320
to choose one, I mean two,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.480
I had to choose two
pieces, which was nice.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.520
But I knew that I wanted to work
with something that was related

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.170
to the African and the Indian
influence, so that's kind

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.000
of what I was looking
for, and finding things

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.250
that I could relate
to from my background,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.690
as well as from my
musical experience.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.420
So it wasn't too bad, once I
started listening to everything,

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.200
and I found some favorite ones,
and I kind of said, okay, these,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.620
I think I'm going to do these,
and then I was still like, oh,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.440
but maybe I want to do this
one too [chuckling], you know?

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.410
It was hard, a hard decision.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:36.720
Do you want me to speak
specifically on each one?

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the two that you chose
were [foreign words spoken],

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.040
and [foreign words spoken].

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So [foreign
words spoken],

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.170
I thought it was interesting

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.430
because Mina [assumed spelling]
actually means a person

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.390
who comes from the area of
what is Benin right now?

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.690
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.060
&gt;&gt; And when I did, you
know, my ancestry map,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.360
whatever it's called--

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.660
&gt;&gt; The DNA testing?

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I saw that's

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.990
where my heritage
is from, from Benin.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.290
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.810
&gt;&gt; So of course,
instantly I was like,

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.180
oh this is cool,
I want to do this.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.410
Makes sense, it's
like connected.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.410
&gt;&gt; That's a very
personal connection.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:16.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.390
It was personal, and I thought
it was a beautiful song,

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.540
and I thought I could
do something, you know,

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.320
all these songs are simple,

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.400
so it's not like I didn't do
anything very complex with them,

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.630
I just found a few chords that
worked together with the melody

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.880
and I kind of put it together
that way and it worked.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.380
I liked it anyway, I
thought it was nice.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.660
Then I added some more
melodies, and it was cool.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.560
&gt;&gt; And you actually got people
in the Coolidge Auditorium

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.700
up to dance, that
is, you will go

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.400
down in history for
that [laughter].

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.700
That alone.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.000
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.300
It was fun.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.990
&gt;&gt; So the field recordings
that you chose, when I listened

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:59.110
to them, I thought what's
interesting is first of all,

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.400
they're not accompanied with
anything but percussion,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.040
so you had to add
chords to them.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.480
Also with [foreign word spoken],
it was like this rapid fire,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.260
almost like machine gun
rapid fire of quick words--

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.030
&gt;&gt; And I wondered how you
were going to deal with that.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.960
Did you slow it down a little?

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.260
&gt;&gt; Not really.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.060
I mean, I think it
was pretty fast.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.090
And it's like, there
is a specific style

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.460
in Brazilian music, where
we speak and in Africa, too,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.700
if you notice, it's
almost spoken,

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.960
it's almost like a precursor
to hip hop or something,

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.890
where you speak really
fast, but you're singing,

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.480
and you're going [makes noise].

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.780
&gt;&gt; And it's almost percussive.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's percussive,
and it's-- but it's melodic,

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.870
and it kind of all blends and
works together, but it is harder

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.270
to work with than if you're just
working with a smooth melody.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.200
So that's why I added some.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.890
I added a little bit of a hook
in the beginning and in the end,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.720
and I just-- to make it a little
bit more chill and melodic,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.010
but also work with
the dance vibe,

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.110
because I really wanted
people to, at least dance

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.650
in their seats, and
some of them--

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.950
&gt;&gt; Uh huh!

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.250
&gt;&gt; Ended up standing
up and dancing--

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.550
&gt;&gt; Got up.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.850
They did.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.150
&gt;&gt; Which was really good, yeah.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.450
So it worked out.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:17.750
Mm-hmm.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.050
&gt;&gt; And I think on the
[foreign words spoken],

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:24.600
was it kind of a layered vocal,

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.850
where in the field recording the
main singer would sing a little

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.870
bit, and then another
singer would come in,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.910
kind of over that.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.210
And sing a little bit, and I
wondered how you were going

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.740
to handle doing that
as a soloist,

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.080
when there were actually more
singers on the field recording?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that style is very
common across Africa and Brazil,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.480
which is the call and response,

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.750
and that's basically
what she was doing.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:53.900
And I just treated it more
like a song, and I repeated it,

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.340
and I kind of did the call
and response myself, I called

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.180
and I responded by myself.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.830
And it worked, then
I tried to change,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.450
change the harmony a little
bit, so that it would sound

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:10.150
like some layers on there, even
though it's just one voice.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:14.260
&gt;&gt; What was it like, trying
to transcribe the words

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.250
to [foreign word spoken] and
[foreign word spoken] material,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:23.760
that might not be in
your spoken vocabulary?

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know,
what's interesting is

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.050
that I don't know
what the words say,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.240
and there was no translation in
the materials that I had, so I--

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.290
but at the same time, when I
was listening and reading it,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.010
I could feel a familiarity
with the sounds,

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.740
because I am familiar with a lot

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.460
of the [foreign word
spoken] music,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.100
the [foreign word spoken]
tradition and the Congo,

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.680
and what they call the
[foreign word spoken] tradition

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.220
in the north.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.020
It's all in my blood already,
because I have been listening

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.750
to it since I was little,

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.610
even though I don't really know
exactly what they're saying,

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.090
but I do understand a
few words here and there,

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.170
and so it wasn't too difficult.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.470
It was actually harder

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.770
to understand the
[foreign word spoken] song,

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.070
which was in Portuguese.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.370
&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.670
Okay.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:11.970
&gt;&gt; Only because he was
slurring his words,

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.270
and he had a very thick accent,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.620
and the recording was
difficult to understand.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.220
&gt;&gt; So I had to make
some of that up,

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.520
because I'm like I don't know
exactly what he's saying,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.820
I'm kind of getting some words,

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.020
but I'm not getting
everything he's saying.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.230
But the [foreign words spoken]
was shorter, and it was more--

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.260
it was easier to make
out what she was saying.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.050
&gt;&gt; And what language
was that in?

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.350
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that was
[foreign language spoken].

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.040
But I could be wrong,
I could be mistaken,

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.530
because I didn't find
information on that,

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.520
on the materials I had.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.820
So.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.970
&gt;&gt; So tell me about the process

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:46.800
of incorporating
Fernando into the work.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.890
Once did you do the work first,
of deciding on the chords?

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:57.200
Deciding on the words, and then
did you bring Fernando in later?

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.080
So Fernando is very
talented percussionist,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.960
and he is very creative with the
instrumentation that he uses,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.570
and the ideas that he has,

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.500
and actually we didn't get
a whole lot of time to work

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.200
on this, but I think we're
going to continue to work

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.590
on these songs in the
future, and he was talking

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.900
about maybe making, doing a
percussion arrangement to one

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.500
of these songs, and
maybe we will record it

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.800
in the future, who knows?

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.980
&gt;&gt; Oh that's wonderful news,
and make sure you tell us,

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.470
if you do, put it
on a recording,

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.800
because we will brag about you.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.330
&gt;&gt; I will, yay [laughs].

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.630
&gt;&gt; So when did you
come to this country?

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.270
&gt;&gt; 1994.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:35.870
&gt;&gt; Long time ago.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.170
&gt;&gt; And where were you born?

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:38.470
&gt;&gt; I was born in Belgium,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.190
because my father
was working there,

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.750
so I was born there by chance.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.980
I didn't get to have
Belgian citizenship,

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.240
but my Brazilian friends
make fun of me, they're like,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.380
you're not a real Brazilian,
and I'm like, where am I from,

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.590
then [laughs], but I was
raised there from age 2,

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.060
and then I moved here
when I was like 17, 18.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.860
&gt;&gt; You were raised
in Brazil from age 2?

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.490
&gt;&gt; And then you came
here when you were 18?

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.400
&gt;&gt; 18, 17, 18?

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.370
Yeah, and it was a really
difficult culture shock

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.030
when I first arrived, because
that age is just really

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.450
difficult to be moving when
you're just kind of discovering

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.000
who you are, and what you want
to be, and what your place is

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.190
in the world, and
then you're displaced

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.620
into a brand new culture,
brand new language, brand new--

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.000
I already spoke English,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.680
but everything else
was really difficult

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.780
to understand, and
kind of adapt to.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.390
It took me a little while.

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:30.690
Yeah. Now, I'm happy.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:31.990
Now I like living here.

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:34.250
&gt;&gt; Great. Have you found a
large Brazilian community?

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, huge, and I've always
been very, very connected

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.010
to the Brazilian community,
very in love with my culture,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.900
and that was one of the things
that was hardest moving here,

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.410
was that I just really wanted
to participate in the culture,

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:51.930
and I wanted to make
sure I knew the dances,

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:55.680
and I knew the music,
and I knew the culture,

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.930
and it was just very,
very important to me.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.880
So I've always remained
very connected to that.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.750
And always traveled a lot,
back home, all the time.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.410
I would take semesters
off from college,

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.710
and go back all the time.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.750
So always connected.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.990
&gt;&gt; And your usual
performing repertoire,

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.400
how would you characterize it?

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.000
&gt;&gt; I do a lot of...so, when I
do like, let's say a club gig,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.850
for example, I will
do a lot of covers,

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.910
because I know that's
what people want to hear.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.440
[Foreign word spoken] is
something that is very popular,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.170
and it's similar
rhythm to the Coco,

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.590
which is the [foreign
word spoken] song.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.890
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.690
&gt;&gt; That we played, and
people loved to dance

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.520
and it's a very easy
dance, and just fun.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.820
It's just fun.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.250
And the name comes from when

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:44.120
in the northeast they would
welcome the military Americans

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.180
that would be there, working, to
the party by naming the parties

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.400
"For All," and right in
front of the party door,

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.640
it would say "for all,"
and it became "For All,

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.230
for all, for all [mumbling].

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.880
It became fo-ho [phonetic
spelling],

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.810
and that is kind of
how it came about.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.110
And it's just something
that never dies.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.370
In Brazil, there is a lot
of fashions that go through,

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.560
you know, oh now this
music is super popular,

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.450
[foreign word spoken] is
super popular right now,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.370
then there was Lombado [phonetic
spelling], a long time ago then,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:17.790
there's always something new.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:22.020
But fo-ho, some of
these artistic,

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.280
what they call [foreign
word spoken] kind of music,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.350
just stays with us, and that's
a beautiful thing that it does,

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.880
and fo-ho is one
of these things.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.210
So I play a lot of-- some fo-ho,
and I play a lot of samba,

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:36.320
samba is one of the things that
are very close to my heart.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.340
Samba is very, very,
very dear to me.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.100
So I always do a lot of Samba.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.720
I do a lot of fo-ho, sometimes
I'll play a little [foreign word

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.720
spoken], I'll play
the songs from my CD,

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.980
which are mostly
originals, and different,

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.900
but people really enjoy it,
so it's a blessing to be able

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.850
to perform here, and have
people appreciate the music,

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.430
and seek it out, and support.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.450
It's just, I feel
really fortunate

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.670
that people enjoy the music.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.290
&gt;&gt; Well we feel really fortunate

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:06.860
that you took the Archive
Challenge, accepted it, and came

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.720
and performed these
amazing field recordings

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.360
from the late 1930s,
recorded in northern Brazil,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.510
as part of the Discotheque
Collection.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:24.380
And I know that people will
enjoy for generations on,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.960
enjoy the recordings of
your performance today.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.260
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.560
&gt;&gt; So thank you, Cissa Paz.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.160
It's a blessing to be here.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.920
&gt;&gt; September 20, 2017, and we've
just had the Archive Challenge

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.800
concert, at which we
asked a group of musicians

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.250
to learn material from the
American Folk Life Center

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.380
Archive, here at the
Library of Congress.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.570
And one of those musicians
was the great Phil Wiggins,

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.690
who is a blues harmonica
player, and singer,

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.580
and who is a 2017 recipient

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.260
of the National Heritage
Fellowship,

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.270
from the National
Endowment for the Arts.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:58.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.870
&gt;&gt; And this is Phil Wiggins.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.540
And Phil, I gues the first
question I'll ask is how does it

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.110
feel to be an NEA
National Heritage Fellow?

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.410
&gt;&gt; It's just amazing.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:08.310
You know, it's probably
going to take a while to come

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:13.310
into complete focus, but just
to be recognized like that way

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:17.050
in my own home, it was,
it was pretty amazing.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.350
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.510
And Phil is a resident
of Tacoma Park, Maryland.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.890
So he's from the D.C. area, and

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.190
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.630
&gt;&gt; This is his home town.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.730
And he picked some music,
some interesting music

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:30.260
from the archive
to perform for us.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.370
So why don't you tell us about
the songs that you chose.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:36.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, well Jennifer
Cutting was very helpful to me.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.020
She sent me some great choices

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.670
of this one particular
harmonica player,

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.270
whose name I can't
remember right now,

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.330
and who I had not
heard of before,

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:48.840
and so it was great
getting to know his music,

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.470
but I was more kind
of interested in kind

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:55.940
of doing music that didn't
already have harmonica.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.100
So I chose two songs
that were both recorded

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:05.150
at Parchment Penitentiary
by Alan Lomax,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.450
as far as I could tell,

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.990
they seemed to be
recorded 20 years apart.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:16.360
So the first one was recorded in
1939, which was Charles Butler,

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.230
singing this beautiful
song, Diamond Joe,

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:26.740
which I had heard once before,
and fallen in love with it,

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:33.860
from the same recording
just well, I mean, I could,

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.830
I guess the main point
that I'm getting at is

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.410
at the time I first heard it,

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:44.140
I never imagined myself actually
trying to sing it in public, so,

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.810
so it was a great
opportunity for me,

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.190
because between what has
happened to me between now

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:53.470
and then is that my
partner, John Cephas,

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.250
of over 30 years, passed away.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.290
And as you probably remember,

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:02.050
John had that beautiful baritone
voice, and so at that time,

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:04.700
I wasn't doing much
singing at all.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:10.730
But since John has passed, I've
been doing a lot of singing.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.220
I guess you could say I've
been getting better at it,

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:17.570
but at least I've been gaining
more confidence about it.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.820
And so, so, you know,
it was a challenge,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.840
but I really enjoyed
learning that song,

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.810
and working up the courage to
actually sing it in public.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.720
&gt;&gt; And what appealed to
you about Diamond Joe,

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.020
so much, do you remember?

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:37.110
&gt;&gt; Ooh, well, it's, you know,
it's acapella, and that,

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.980
this guy Charles Butler
has a beautiful voice.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.200
Someone today described him
and said it's like right almost

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.760
on the edge of yodeling
some of the time.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.230
And it's a beautiful melody.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:54.610
It's, you know, it's
not a simple melody.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.270
I mean, you know,
when you listen to it,

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.570
at first it sounds simple,

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.940
but he is doing some pretty
cool things with the melody.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:04.170
There's a couple times where you
think he's going to hit a note,

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.710
then he hits the
note a half step flat

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.860
from what you thought
he was going to hit,

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:14.070
and so it's got some
nice surprises in it,

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.600
and it's just beautiful.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.650
Well, the recording is
interesting, because you know,

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:23.050
he's performing it at
Parchment Penitentiary.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:27.810
And you can hear Alan Lomax's
voice in the background,

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.100
and in a way, he's kind of
shouting at him, you know?

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.400
I mean it doesn't, it
doesn't sound like you know,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.820
I guess it seems almost to
me like he's talking to him

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.070
in a way that he thinks he's
used to being spoken to in

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.410
that setting, it's not--

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.060
it's not, doesn't seem that
respectful or anything to me,

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.120
it's kind of distracting
in a way--

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll say
one thing about that.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.110
I think if I'm not mistaken,

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.410
that's actually the recording
was actually made by John Lomax,

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.710
who was Alan's father.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.520
&gt;&gt; John-- that's
what I, I'm sorry.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and John had a way of
speaking that sounded that way.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.380
I'm sure he didn't mean
it to sound that way,

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.740
but I know what you
mean, when you talk

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.040
about that tone of voice.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.340
Yeah.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But yeah, it was pretty
amazing, I mean, you know,

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:17.510
you immediately feel that it's a
very different time, than when,

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:19.560
than we are living in now.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:26.070
And I mean, you know, it's, it's
amazing that he captured that.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:31.010
And of course, you know, so
there's no harmonica in it,

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.420
and the song has this
great verse that is just

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.480
like custom made to intro a
harmonica solo, says I'm going

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.150
up on the mountain,
give my horn a blow,

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.800
thought I heard my Maybelle
say yonder comes my bow--

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.500
you know, right after that,
there should be harmonica.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.800
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.400
&gt;&gt; So that's what
I took, you know,

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.250
because there's no other
instruments in it, but...and,

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.130
and it was surprising to me.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.700
There were notes that
he sang that I wished,

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.580
that I was wishing laid
in a different place

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.190
on the harmonica, where I
could really lean into them

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:09.750
and bend them and all,
but they kind of--

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.110
you know, worked against me.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.350
Which was cool, because you
know, I wasn't able just

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.210
to do my normal hot
dogging, you know,

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:21.120
my own normal comfort
zone, I had to just--

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.630
take those notes where I found
them, and figure out a way

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.960
to get the most expression out
of them, which was a challenge.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.540
But, I mean it made me play
completely differently,

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.030
and it made the end
result something different

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.980
than what I thought I wanted
at the beginning, but you know,

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.610
in the end, you know, I
liked, I liked the challenge.

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.790
And I liked where,
where it took me.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.090
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.390
Well, we loved it as well.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.200
And I'll tell everyone
who is watching this video

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.450
that you can see Phil's
performance on the Library

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.240
of Congress website,
in the Lomax--

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.570
or the Archive Challenge
concert video.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:02.140
And the original performance,
actually is on our website

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.150
as well, in the John and
Ruby Lomax collection,

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.800
The Southern Mosaic,
it's called.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.450
So you can search for that
as well, on our website.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.660
You can hear both Phil and the
source recording that he used.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.250
So that's a great story.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.020
So what about the second
one, which was years later,

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.320
but also at Parchment, right?

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, true.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.710
True. And that's-- it's just
kind of a funny coincidence,

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.800
but the second one is one that
I was pretty familiar with.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.630
I was surprised to find
the recording there.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:36.860
The performance, the person
performing it there was John

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:42.990
Dudley, who was, you know, I
guess serving time at Parchment.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:50.860
His version of that song
seems to be from here

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:56.290
and the Tommy Johnson
Big Road Blues, you know,

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:06.020
and it's got this great like
driving line, that for like,

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.240
about the first 8 bars
is real syncopated,

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.870
and then switches
kind of to a loping,

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:18.100
more of a steady loping beat,
and it's so distinctive,

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.010
and it just makes you
want to get off your butt,

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:24.660
and just like, and you
know, I've been aware

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.310
of that song for a long time.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:31.270
So it was great to find
that version of it,

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:37.800
and then there are some other
songs where people just like,

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.450
just like John Dudley did,
heard Tommy Johnson's version,

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.060
and then took from
that, you know,

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.840
and made their own version.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.000
There's a version of it that
I kind of blended into that,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.790
called Stop and Listen, that is
done by the Mississippi Sheikhs,

00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:03.080
and it's that same groove, but
it's completely different words.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.860
And you know, they're
really great,

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.670
really good lyrics,
and so I like that.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.680
So I mixed the two.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.920
And also mixed in
there is a little bit

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.240
of Smokestack Lightning, the
Howlin' Wolf song, so you know,

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.950
it's all you know, it's, I
mean it's interesting to me

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.400
because I'm aware that
there are some people

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.550
that take those Lomax recordings
and that are basically,

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.370
you know, frozen in
time, and they just try

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:34.970
to recreate them note for
note, but those, those people

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:37.140
that they recorded,
you know if you record

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.460
with them the next day you
would have gotten something

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.760
completely different.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.060
&gt;&gt; And sometimes Alan did that.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.360
Yeah.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so to me, it's
that, that's the tradition

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.920
that I want to follow.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:55.520
Is to you know, just take the
influences, do my own thing

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:01.350
with them, improvise with them,
and come up with something,

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.510
you know, that's living,
that's not you know,

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.340
like frozen in time,
or carbon copy of--

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.950
like I said today when
I was doing Diamond Joe,

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.400
I said basically "I don't
know what's about to happen,

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.900
so there might be a little
bit of Bessie Jones mixed

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:22.190
in with the Charles Butler,"
and that turned out to be true.

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:23.490
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.790
&gt;&gt; I didn't know if I was going
to be able to pull it off,

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.290
but I mean, that to me is
what I love about music.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:32.320
Is the improvisation,
the spontaneity of it.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.620
You know?

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.090
&gt;&gt; And how did you decide
to add a piano to that one?

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.840
&gt;&gt; You know, that, that bass
line that I'm talking about,

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.750
I mean, you just-- I mean
to me, because I love piano,

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.630
piano is probably about
my favorite instrument.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.690
I grew up, you know, my
parents loved piano music,

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.260
most of the records they
collected were piano,

00:47:53.260 --> 00:48:01.020
and that syncopated bass line,
I think probably Tommy Johnson

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.810
and whoever else, I think
they were mimicking piano.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:05.140
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.620
&gt;&gt; On that, you know,
so I just heard piano.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:12.760
And so because I mean I had a
choice, I could have brought,

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.770
you know, a guitar player, but I
wanted that piece done on piano,

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.530
because it lays so
nice on the piano,

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:21.100
and I just think that's
the way it was meant to be.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sounds great, yeah.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.590
And I think, you know,
you really touched

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:27.010
on something important there,
which is that these guys,

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:31.290
in 1959, and even in 1939,
were already listening

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.150
to commercial recordings, so
they, they were being influenced

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:35.450
by more than one thing--

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:36.750
&gt;&gt; Right, yes.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.100
&gt;&gt; When they played
it, and the people

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.720
who originally recorded it
were probably influenced

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.930
by piano players they heard,
and other people, so to keep it,

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:48.560
you know, as you say, frozen
in time, just doesn't--

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.600
doesn't really continue the
tradition in the same way

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.380
that the tradition was
going back then I think.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.360
And like that song Diamond Joe,
I don't-- I couldn't really,

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.040
or I haven't yet found out where
Bessie Jones got her version

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.330
of it, but I could tell
that Charles Butler, I mean,

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.990
it was just a couple
of tiny little things,

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.570
almost like incidental, like you
could miss them, but that kind

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.540
of clued me in that he
definitely had heard the version

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.500
of it that she's singing.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.800
So--

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so those
influences are always there.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.070
&gt;&gt; Well thank you so much
for playing in the concert,

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.370
we really enjoyed having you.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.010
And it is an honor to have
a National Heritage Fellow

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:29.310
[chuckling] on our stage always.

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.610
&gt;&gt; Well thank you.

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:31.910
&gt;&gt; And it's an honor
to have you,

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.210
even before you were a
National Heritage Fellow,

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.190
we had you several times,
and I was an honor then too.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:36.490
So.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:37.790
&gt;&gt; Well it's always a pleasure
to be here, I was just,

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:40.390
you know, and as soon
as I get a chance,

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.420
I'm going to go get my Library

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.370
of Congress Library Card
renewed, I think it's--

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:47.610
&gt;&gt; Please do, and come see
us in the Reading Room,

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:48.910
we'll find you more great stuff.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.210
&gt;&gt; All right, great.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.350
Thank you.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.520
&gt;&gt; September 20, 2017,

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.920
and we just had the American
Folk Life Center Archive

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.010
Challenge Concert in
the Coolidge Auditorium,

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.760
here at the Library of Congress.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.870
And for that concert, we asked
five different individuals

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:09.640
or groups to record songs that
they learned from our archive.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.430
And one of the artists
that we asked

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.480
to do that was Dom Flemons.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.880
And I'm here with Don
Flemons now, and we are going

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.180
to have a little conversation
about the songs that he played.

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:21.370
But the first question I'll ask
you is, Dom, since you've been

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:24.270
at the Library, since the last
time you played here, I think,

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:26.410
you've started to
perform under the rubric

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.290
of The American Songster.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.380
So why don't you tell us a
little bit about the name,

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.600
the American Songster, and
the Songster tradition.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.900
&gt;&gt; Well, of course.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.430
Thank you so much for
having me, Steven,

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:39.100
and well the American Songster,
well first, that was actually--

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:44.130
I'd named one of my albums,
just American Songster.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:48.880
And what got me to do that was,
well, specifically it was one

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.390
of the artists whose tune
I performed, Lead Belly.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.090
When I started studying the
music of not just Lead Belly,

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.750
but people like Mance
Lipscomb, and a couple

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:02.020
of the other performers, they
are under the umbrella term

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.660
of like, blues singers,
most of the time.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.100
But as I started reading
more about these musicians,

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.090
they were known as
songsters, and songsters were--

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:12.880
first they were like books of
song lyrics in the 19th Century,

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.260
and then the 20th Century,
a lot of different musicians

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.480
that could play and sing
a lot of different types

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.830
of numbers they became
songsters, like the book.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:22.890
So it was kind of
like a human jukebox.

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:27.960
And as, well, you know, as
a musician that has come

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.830
up in the time as the
20th Century ends,

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.200
and the 21st Century started,
the full consciousness

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.950
of that people are into a lot
of different types of music,

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.300
that's something I've always
tried to emphasize in my work,

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.370
just because I'm not just a
blues singer, or folk singer,

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:43.900
or country singer, I play
a little bit of it all.

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.710
I love the term songster,

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.760
because it was just something
people hadn't heard before,

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.440
but it was actually
something a lot older.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.780
So it was really cool to have
that juxtaposition of both new

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.820
and old at the same time,
and then American, of course,

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.960
is that's where I'm
from, you know,

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.390
and to really emphasize
American identity with songster,

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.940
and being able to bring all
these different ideas together,

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.240
it was appealing to me.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.690
So when I broke away
from my previous group,

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:12.060
the Carolina Chocolate Drops,
I wanted to figure out how

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:16.830
to put a bigger idea out there,
instead of just saying hey,

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:18.130
I'm Don Flemons,
all right, you know,

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:19.430
I wanted to have a bigger idea.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:21.950
So The American Songster
ended up being something

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:25.290
that people could latch
onto that term, or my name,

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:28.410
and it just gave something
a little bit bigger

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.130
than just myself.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.730
I'm trying to represent
a larger tradition.

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm, and you've recorded,
you're one of the few artists

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.770
in the concert who
recorded material

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:41.090
from our archives before,
so in this case, you were--

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:43.980
you sort of were
on familiar ground.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.150
And the first song you
chose was Poor Howard.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:49.830
So explain a little bit about
that, and how you found it.

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:52.650
&gt;&gt; Well, Poor Howard is
an interesting number

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:53.950
in the way that, you know,

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.250
the first time I
actually heard it was

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:58.360
on the great three-record
set that Electra Records put

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.210
out of Lead Belly, of the
Library of Congress recordings,

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:06.070
and my first introduction to
Lead Belly's music, you know,

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.800
was when I got into Bob
Dylan's music, and his song,

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.560
Song for Woody, mentions,
you know, Cisco,

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.900
and Sonny, and Lead Belly too.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.480
So you know, being this sort
of inquisitive person I am,

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.040
I decided to figure out
who these guys were.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.410
And of course that led me
to Smithsonian Folk Ways,

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:24.010
and then Lead Belly, I
always like to describe him

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:29.410
as like the Rosetta Stone of
African American folk music,

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:32.150
just because, especially
since I was, you know,

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:33.920
born in the late
20th Century, of,

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.700
most African American folk
music, a lot of it is blues,

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.510
and jazz, and spiritual music,
church music of different types,

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:45.420
and Lead Belly just represented
this sort of bigger idea.

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.320
Just like the Rosetta Stone,
to this sort of ancient world

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.820
of music, and also
that he recorded

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.990
so many different versions
and different types of songs,

00:53:54.990 --> 00:54:00.670
that it really let me be
able to delve into, you know,

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.500
just not just a bunch of
different types of material,

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.810
but Lead Belly also
performed many of the songs,

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:09.010
different tempos,
different styles,

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.770
and just different
ways of doing it.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.290
And so Poor Howard, there is
this one particular version

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:18.810
that he did, that Larry Cohen
compiled for the Electra set,

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.460
that just really blew me away.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.800
And it's all a section on
the record that is listed

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.530
as Sookie Jumps, which was kind

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.850
of square dance music
for Lead Belly.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:34.430
And it featured that song,

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:38.140
and well as Gonna Dig a
Hole to Put the Devil In.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.260
And I thought that those two
songs would go really great

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.110
as a medley together.

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:45.390
So I decided to put
Poor Howard together,

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:48.300
and of course the story
that he told, Alan Lomax,

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.900
he said that Poor Howard was
the first negro fiddler from,

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.880
that was freed from
slavery and that was

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.180
like his main theme song.

00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.480
It was Poor Howard.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.780
So I thought that was
great, and the idea

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:02.210
of being Poor Howard is dead
and gone, he left me here

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:04.890
to sing this song, and
as the American Songster,

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.920
I can kind of make it
reflective, so that you know,

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.880
because in my shows, when I play
it, I can tell people, you know,

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.590
this is a song that really
symbolizes what I try to do.

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:19.590
Because I try to get the
impression, the emotion,

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.090
maybe the rhythm, the
whatever it might be.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.640
The raw essence of what that
original field recording had,

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:31.820
and be able to present it
in a way that is both--

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.460
it both emphasizes what I do as
a musician personally as well

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.690
as what that original
recording put out there.

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:42.740
Because you know, when I started
studying Alan Lomax's material,

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.860
especially after working
with the Library of Congress,

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.510
talking about, you know,
coriemetrics [phonetic spelling]

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:50.080
and cancer metrics, and
all that, he talks a lot

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:54.280
about how they are sort of like,
they're nuances there, right?

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.920
Below the surface that really
they resonate with people,

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.310
so when you see certain
nuances or subtleties to music,

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:04.380
you can relate to them,
especially if you're familiar

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.860
with it, like if you hear
a blues song, and they hit

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.380
that blues lick in
the right way,

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.210
you can just say
that's it, that's it.

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:14.650
So I've always just tried
to have that in my music,

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.370
and so Poor Howard is
a great one for that.

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:18.150
And Wanna Dig a Hole
to Put the Devil

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.400
In is just a great little
fun square dance number.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.450
So I wanted to have
both those together.

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:29.610
And I also wanted to
reference Pete Seeger as well.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:32.550
Because Pete was really
close with Lead Belly

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:34.670
and Lead Belly really
helped Pete get

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:36.560
on the trajectory that he did.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.350
And the idea of the banjo being
an African derived instrument,

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:48.450
and also it being, there's
a proverb called Sankofa

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.310
and the banjo does that,

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:53.380
it brings the past
into the present.

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.810
And that's something that Pete
did as well with his music,

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:59.130
bringing the past
into the present,

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:00.990
creating a new wave
for the future.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.740
So that was what I was
thinking about with that one.

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.150
And yeah, it's one I've
been able to say I'm proud

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:10.670
to say I was able to take
to the Kennedy Center,

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:15.510
with the Lead Belly at 125, that
was a big thing, and being able

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:16.810
to take it to Carnegie Hall,

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:20.090
when they did the Lead
Belly tribute concert.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:21.390
That was something as well.

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:25.160
So on top of what I learned
with that original recording,

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.900
being able to take it into
my own personal repertoire.

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.420
I've then been able
to take it out there

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.190
and show people what this
music is all about too.

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:33.490
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:35.080
Yeah, and Lead Belly of
course was a songster

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.430
in the same sense,
and the song is

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:39.040
about being a songster
[laughter],

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:43.280
so it's very much
reflective of what you do,

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.960
and sort of a perfect
fit for your repertoire.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.590
So we are really glad that
you brought that one for us.

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:53.830
The other song that you sang
is related to some extent

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.590
to a project that you're working
on now, about cowboy songs.

00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:59.510
So tell us a little bit
about how you got interested

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:02.080
in cowboy songs in
the first place?

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.380
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:04.680
Well, you know, I'm originally
from Phoenix, Arizona,

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.350
so cowboy songs, and
cowboy culture is something

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:10.530
that I've just known about ever
since I've gotten into music,

00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:12.900
even before I played
guitar, like cowboy poetry

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.340
and cowboy songs, it's something
that I was interested in.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.580
I mentioned I was into Bob
Dylan, that easily gets you

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.880
to Rambling Jack Elliott,

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.510
so he was also a
conduit to get in there.

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:26.580
Also you know, in my college,
at Northern Arizona University,

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.980
they had all of the Library of
Congress records, all the LPs,

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:35.010
and so I first heard Goodbye
Old Paint on the cowboy songs,

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:38.480
ballads, and cattle, you
know, cattle calls from Texas.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.460
That's that great record
there, so I was interested

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:44.720
in cowboy music, and also
the New World Records album,

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.640
Back in the Saddle, which is a
great anthology of cowboy stuff,

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.630
so I never played much
cowboy music at first,

00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:53.940
but it was an idea that
was interesting to me,

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:57.960
because my family has
roots deep in Arizona.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.100
My dad is from Flagstaff,
Arizona, and then his father was

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:07.250
from East Texas, then came over
to Flagstaff in the early 1950s,

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:10.200
and then he started his
church, Church of God

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.260
in Christ in Holbrook, Arizona.

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.980
So he was called by
God to go to Holbrook,

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.160
which I then studied
Holbrook is one

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.080
of the baddest towns
in the west.

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:23.810
And it was also the first
place where cattle were brought

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.920
into Arizona via the train.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.930
And so there were a lot of
just interesting little stories

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:30.970
that were wrapped up, so
my own personal interest

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:34.650
in black cowboys, when I
first saw that was a piece

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.760
of the puzzle, you know, even
though you don't see them a lot

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.900
in book and movies, the African
American culture has purveyed

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.660
in the west for a long time,

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.710
even before the southwest was
part of the United States,

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.130
and it was a part of Mexico,

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:52.480
there is a big history
deep within that, then.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.530
So the album just started
expanding into this bigger idea.

00:59:56.530 --> 01:00:00.820
I was traveling on I-40 from
North Carolina, where I lived

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.530
for a lot of years, to go
visit family and I came

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:07.250
across a book called The Negro
Cowboys, by Phillip Dunham,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.360
and it was a really-- just
started expanding my idea

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.740
of what, how big this
story of black cowboys was.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.430
Also the Lomax's did some
wonderful field recordings

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:22.290
of you know, people like, I
don't know, Big Charlie Butler,

01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:25.350
who did Diamond Joe like
Phil Wiggins did earlier

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:28.550
in the concert, and then
also there were people

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:32.540
like Pete Harris, who had
a style that was similar

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.990
to another musician who recorded

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:37.880
in the 1920s, Henry
Ragtime Texas.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.180
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.480
&gt;&gt; Thomas.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.260
And so there was just sort
of like a lot of material

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.520
and a lot of stylistic things.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.300
Then, of course, the cornerstone

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:51.400
for my project Black
Cowboys is Goodbye Old Pain,

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.810
and Jess Morris' story about
how these black cowboys

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:57.200
that he met early on in
his life taught him how

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.640
to play Goodbye Old Paint,
and also taught him how

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.300
to play the fiddle too,
and that was something

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:06.020
that was really a part
of his musical education,

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.910
and of course, that's
something that I've talked

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.790
with a lot in my career.

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:14.110
Talking about how you
have these situations,

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:17.800
where you have performers
that are not African American.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.310
They will take the
music a certain place,

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:24.410
and it will become very popular,
but by their own admission,

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:28.460
the roots of their music has
kind of a cultural interchange

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.010
within it, and of
course, that's something

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.530
that we all know
on a ground level.

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.370
People love music, and they all
get together because of that.

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.430
But with the cowboy story,
that's hadn't been something

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.420
that had been talked about in
an album form, and so I wanted

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.490
to try to just, I don't know,
fill the gap in that way.

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:46.630
&gt;&gt; I mean I think it's
similar with country music too,

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:50.370
that A.P. Carter learned so
much from African American folks

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:53.170
as well, and it kind of
got erased from the history

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:56.410
for a while, but people like
Mike Seeger, and yourself,

01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:58.330
are you know, bringing
that history back.

01:01:58.330 --> 01:01:59.630
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:00.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's great.

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:03.780
So how did you decide to do
Goodbye Old Paint on the banjo?

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.080
Oh-- I'm sorry, you
did that on the guitar.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.380
Yeah.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.680
&gt;&gt; Well funny enough,
with Goodbye Old Paint,

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.450
that is something that has
to do with keys, you know?

01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:12.500
Like at first of
course, I had the song,

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.810
and I knew that I wanted
it to be a part of it,

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.190
so then I went back to
the field recording.

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.190
And I started listening
back to it.

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:22.050
And I realized that it
was in the key of E flat,

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.350
when I listened to it.

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:25.780
And E flat happens to
be a key that I can--

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.250
it's kind of like the top of
my range, so I can kind of do

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:30.560
like a-- kind of
like a bluegrass sort

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.310
of yell with-- in E flat.

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:36.120
So when I heard that,
I said, great!

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.130
It will be in E flat.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.040
And Jess Morris has--

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.120
it's a really loopy little
tune that he records.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.850
And it's different
every verse [chuckling].

01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:48.850
So I had to, I just
straightened it out in that way.

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:52.920
And you know, when starting
to play it on the guitar,

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.580
I ran into a wonderful fellow

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.940
at the National Cowboy Poetry
Gathering, named Don Edwards,

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.040
and he's just a-- I mean,
he's just a phenomenal player,

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.410
great singer, of
all different types,

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:07.160
and he was very much
someone who helped me think

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.010
about how I wanted to
craft this whole project,

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:12.770
because he's very multi-faceted
with how he handles cowboy music

01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:16.800
as well, but we got to
talking about black cowboys.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.350
And for him, he was
telling me how, you know,

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:24.010
a lot of times a scholarship
around cowboy music tends

01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:25.960
to be focused on
the British Isles,

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.660
and the ballad traditions, which
is a very strong part of it,

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.840
but he also mentioned
that several of the songs

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.470
that he heard had kind of a
sense of the blues, almost like,

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:39.290
kind of a song going down
the road feeling bad.

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:42.550
Not really like blues as we
think of blues, blues, 12 bars,

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:46.810
but kind of just, had a bit of
that feeling, and that sort of,

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:52.390
sort of structure, melodically
that would really be emphasized

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:55.860
with the blues later, and so
the conversation he and I had

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.280
about it, it just got me
thinking, okay well if I think

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.130
about Jess Morris learning
from this black cowboy,

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:06.330
how might he have sung it
if he had just a tonality

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:09.550
of the blues, that's
not quite the blues,

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:11.250
but it has a little
bit of that tone.

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:16.010
So Goodbye Old Paint happens
to be a great number for,

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:18.010
because in string band music,
you have the same thing,

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:19.670
where there's not a
lot of chord changes,

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:23.560
but you can bend little notes
up and down, and create a lot

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.010
of really nice give and
take, and a lot of suspense,

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:31.620
with just what would be
a very monotone song.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.840
And so Goodbye Old
Paint, I thought,

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.570
was just a wonderful one
to be able to do that,

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:39.010
stretch a couple notes up,
have a couple of short notes,

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:42.470
and be able to tell a
very interesting story.

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:45.910
Because it's like I still--

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:49.250
it still surprises me
when I'm performing it,

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.510
how emotional the song is.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:55.210
Because it's-- it's very
simple words to it, you know,

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:57.940
but when you get about three
or four verses into it,

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:02.170
all of a sudden, it's
like a movie that plays

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:06.900
out in your mind, and it's a
very beautiful song in that way.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.780
And that's where it has that
really great juxtaposition

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.870
of what would become the blues,
but also the same qualities

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:16.340
that narrative ballads,
and you know,

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:19.840
the British Isles
traditions have.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.310
So it's kind of a really
nice mixture of both.

01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:26.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, you really get a
sense of the reluctance to leave

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.570
through him saying
"I'm leaving,"

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.800
so many times, but not leaving.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.540
You know, things are-- he says
what's in his hand, he's all set

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.530
to leave, but he doesn't
leave for a long time.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.600
And you can feel that
emotion in there.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.250
&gt;&gt; Well you know, that's a big
part of the theme that I found

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.440
when I started delving into the
black cowboy story is you had

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.960
this sense of movement.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.610
Because you know, one of
the things that, you know,

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:52.620
like a lot of times, we
think of the United States

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:57.150
as being the whole land
mass, but before the 1840s,

01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:00.800
it went pretty much out
to Tennessee, then it went

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.700
up to the Ohio River, and then
slowly it steadily started

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.590
having, you know, the land mass

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.790
in the states begin
to move west.

01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:11.320
One of the things that happened,

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.440
especially with African
American culture,

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.500
is that each time they
added a new state,

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.450
they'd have to decide
whether it was going

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:20.920
to be pro-slavery
or anti-slavery.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.910
&gt;&gt; Then even Texas, for a long
time, before the Civil War,

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:27.490
really you know, started really
going into full force, you know,

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:30.550
you had plantation owners,
they would take their slaves

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.150
and bring them to Texas, because
it was literally outside the

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:34.740
borders of the United States.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.040
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.340
&gt;&gt; but because of all
these different things,

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.520
it led to this huge
African American population,

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.540
and you know, again you have
things like Catholicism,

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.370
as well, that was a big
part of the Mexican hat,

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.840
and you had this mixture
of cultures that happened,

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.780
and this, right again,
right below the surface,

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:54.750
and the black cowboy
story is wrapped up in all

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:57.240
of these things, but you know,
Goodbye Old Paint kind of has

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.180
that feel, because you know,
going from Cheyenne, Wyoming,

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.740
you know, that was all
the way from Texas,

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.500
and they'd go all the way
up to Abilene, Kansas,

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.440
to get the cattle, to the
train, because at first Abilene,

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.720
Kansas was the one
place you could have,

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.530
you had the cattle
going on the train.

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:16.870
&gt;&gt; You had the rail, yeah.

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:20.200
&gt;&gt; So this idea that you had
to keep moving in spite of all

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.060
of it is just something that is
a big part of cowboy culture,

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.800
then also of course African
American culture, with cowboys.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.760
So Goodbye Old Paint really
grabs all of those themes,

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.200
and again, in a very subtle way,
which is again, what makes it,

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.300
you know, probably why it's one

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.680
of the most well-known cowboy
songs, and then of course,

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.420
that's part of the
joy in performing it.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.060
&gt;&gt; Right. Well thanks so much

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.450
