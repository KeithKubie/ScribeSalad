00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580
 
 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.610
 
so when we think about what motivates

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620
so when we think about what motivates
 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.530
so when we think about what motivates
people maybe the first thing to think

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
people maybe the first thing to think
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.020
people maybe the first thing to think
about is what we think motivates people

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
about is what we think motivates people
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.140
about is what we think motivates people
and what don't we understand motivates

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
and what don't we understand motivates
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.680
and what don't we understand motivates
people and maybe the first

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690
people and maybe the first
 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.240
people and maybe the first
misunderstanding is about the pleasure

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
misunderstanding is about the pleasure
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.840
misunderstanding is about the pleasure
principle so we have this idea of we

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
principle so we have this idea of we
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.849
principle so we have this idea of we
have the right to pursue happiness and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
have the right to pursue happiness and
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.050
have the right to pursue happiness and
we're trying to be happy and that's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
we're trying to be happy and that's
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.740
we're trying to be happy and that's
really what we're pursuing happiness but

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
really what we're pursuing happiness but
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.110
really what we're pursuing happiness but
think about it what what gives you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
think about it what what gives you
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729
think about it what what gives you
happiness in a way that is observable

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
happiness in a way that is observable
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.680
happiness in a way that is observable
maybe sitting on the beach drinking

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
maybe sitting on the beach drinking
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600
maybe sitting on the beach drinking
mojito or maybe sitting on the sofa

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
mojito or maybe sitting on the sofa
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.569
mojito or maybe sitting on the sofa
watching a sitcom but if you do almost

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
watching a sitcom but if you do almost
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.680
watching a sitcom but if you do almost
anything that is useful meaningful that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
anything that is useful meaningful that
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.869
anything that is useful meaningful that
you take pride of it's not the same

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
you take pride of it's not the same
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.850
you take pride of it's not the same
things but imagine you have a whole life

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
things but imagine you have a whole life
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.319
things but imagine you have a whole life
of sitting on a on the beach drinking

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
of sitting on a on the beach drinking
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.520
of sitting on a on the beach drinking
mojito how how happy would that life be

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530
mojito how how happy would that life be
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.889
mojito how how happy would that life be
so the first I think mistake is that we

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
so the first I think mistake is that we
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.920
so the first I think mistake is that we
pursue momentary happiness rather than

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
pursue momentary happiness rather than
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560
pursue momentary happiness rather than
longer-term happiness so we do this the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
longer-term happiness so we do this the
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479
longer-term happiness so we do this the
things that will make us laugh out loud

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
things that will make us laugh out loud
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.510
things that will make us laugh out loud
today kind of not always laugh out loud

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
today kind of not always laugh out loud
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969
today kind of not always laugh out loud
but you know kind of like that and we

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
but you know kind of like that and we
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.410
but you know kind of like that and we
don't do the things that are difficult

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
don't do the things that are difficult
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.080
don't do the things that are difficult
and complex and challenging but give us

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
and complex and challenging but give us
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.850
and complex and challenging but give us
a very different sense of happiness

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
a very different sense of happiness
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740
a very different sense of happiness
think about something like running a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
think about something like running a
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570
think about something like running a
marathon you don't see anybody happy

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
marathon you don't see anybody happy
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.690
marathon you don't see anybody happy
like if you came is an alien and you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
like if you came is an alien and you
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.240
like if you came is an alien and you
image people's brains and you looked at

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
image people's brains and you looked at
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.410
image people's brains and you looked at
your facial expression as they're

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
your facial expression as they're
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.640
your facial expression as they're
running a marathon you would say

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
running a marathon you would say
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160
running a marathon you would say
somebody's punishing them like they are

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
somebody's punishing them like they are
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.690
somebody's punishing them like they are
paying for something terrible they've

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
paying for something terrible they've
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460
paying for something terrible they've
done and this is how they're you know

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
done and this is how they're you know
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.130
done and this is how they're you know
paying their debt to society and it it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
paying their debt to society and it it
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.210
paying their debt to society and it it
is it is kind of miserable but it's also

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220
is it is kind of miserable but it's also
 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.590
is it is kind of miserable but it's also
meaningful and create a sense of

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
meaningful and create a sense of
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.050
meaningful and create a sense of
achievement and so on so we're pursuing

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
achievement and so on so we're pursuing
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179
achievement and so on so we're pursuing
momentary pleasure rather than truly

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
momentary pleasure rather than truly
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.179
momentary pleasure rather than truly
understanding the depth of what

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
understanding the depth of what
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.139
understanding the depth of what
happiness is or what meaning meaning is

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149
happiness is or what meaning meaning is
 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.109
happiness is or what meaning meaning is
and then the second thing is that we're

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
and then the second thing is that we're
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.590
and then the second thing is that we're
trying to figure out how we externally

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600
trying to figure out how we externally
 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.300
trying to figure out how we externally
motivate people and we have usually a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
motivate people and we have usually a
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.300
motivate people and we have usually a
very simple equation that says

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
very simple equation that says
 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.219
very simple equation that says
motivation equals money and if you're

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
motivation equals money and if you're
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960
motivation equals money and if you're
not working hard enough doing something

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
not working hard enough doing something
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.490
not working hard enough doing something
I'm not just not paying you enough I'm

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
I'm not just not paying you enough I'm
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.589
I'm not just not paying you enough I'm
not not giving your bonus in the right

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
not not giving your bonus in the right
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.610
not not giving your bonus in the right
way

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
way
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890
way
we just jigger around bonuses and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
we just jigger around bonuses and
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720
we just jigger around bonuses and
payment and we say oh let's change the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
payment and we say oh let's change the
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.190
payment and we say oh let's change the
payment this way change payment this way

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
payment this way change payment this way
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.780
payment this way change payment this way
and give a slightly big bonuses here and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
and give a slightly big bonuses here and
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.490
and give a slightly big bonuses here and
slightly big bonus there and we'll

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
slightly big bonus there and we'll
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.920
slightly big bonus there and we'll
create point systems for evaluation and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
create point systems for evaluation and
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.649
create point systems for evaluation and
all kinds of things the beauty of human

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
all kinds of things the beauty of human
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.470
all kinds of things the beauty of human
nature is that lots of things motivate

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
nature is that lots of things motivate
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050
nature is that lots of things motivate
us and sense of accomplishment and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
us and sense of accomplishment and
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.630
us and sense of accomplishment and
achievement our title our connection to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640
achievement our title our connection to
 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.050
achievement our title our connection to
work and connection the people at work a

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060
work and connection the people at work a
 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.280
work and connection the people at work a
competing with other people all of those

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
competing with other people all of those
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.589
competing with other people all of those
things motivated so we routed a

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599
things motivated so we routed a
 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.360
things motivated so we routed a
motivation equation we would write

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
motivation equation we would write
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.550
motivation equation we would write
motivation equals yes money is important

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560
motivation equals yes money is important
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.589
motivation equals yes money is important
but so is achievement sense of progress

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599
but so is achievement sense of progress
 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.930
but so is achievement sense of progress
competition that adhara and the question

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
competition that adhara and the question
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.759
competition that adhara and the question
is how do we use all of them how do you

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769
is how do we use all of them how do you
 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.890
is how do we use all of them how do you
use all of them to to create motivation

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
use all of them to to create motivation
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.789
use all of them to to create motivation
and you know in physics people look for

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799
and you know in physics people look for
 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.250
and you know in physics people look for
the perpetual motion machine how do we

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
the perpetual motion machine how do we
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.660
the perpetual motion machine how do we
get energy from nothing right and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
get energy from nothing right and
 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.899
get energy from nothing right and
continue going and in motivation there

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909
continue going and in motivation there
 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.330
continue going and in motivation there
is something like that so imagine two

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
is something like that so imagine two
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.399
is something like that so imagine two
businesses in one of them the business

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409
businesses in one of them the business
 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.830
businesses in one of them the business
doesn't care about motivation in one of

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
doesn't care about motivation in one of
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.020
doesn't care about motivation in one of
them they care deeply in the first

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
them they care deeply in the first
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.030
them they care deeply in the first
business people are miserable and the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040
business people are miserable and the
 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.409
business people are miserable and the
business is miserable and they're not

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419
business is miserable and they're not
 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.509
business is miserable and they're not
making lots of money in the second one

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
making lots of money in the second one
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.400
making lots of money in the second one
people could be happier management could

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410
people could be happier management could
 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.080
people could be happier management could
be happier and they could be much more

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
be happier and they could be much more
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.259
be happier and they could be much more
productive inefficient everybody wins

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269
productive inefficient everybody wins
 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.030
productive inefficient everybody wins
when we invest in deep motivation one of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040
when we invest in deep motivation one of
 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.830
when we invest in deep motivation one of
the first experiments we did on the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
the first experiments we did on the
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.839
the first experiments we did on the
question of meaning it wasn't like big

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849
question of meaning it wasn't like big
 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.150
question of meaning it wasn't like big
meaning was little mini and here is what

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
meaning was little mini and here is what
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.309
meaning was little mini and here is what
we did we got people to come to the lab

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319
we did we got people to come to the lab
 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.069
we did we got people to come to the lab
and we say would you like to build a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079
and we say would you like to build a
 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.430
and we say would you like to build a
Bionicle and we'll pay you $3 for this

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
Bionicle and we'll pay you $3 for this
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.189
Bionicle and we'll pay you $3 for this
Veronica and people build it Bionicle we

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199
Veronica and people build it Bionicle we
 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.860
Veronica and people build it Bionicle we
took it we put it under their desk and

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870
took it we put it under their desk and
 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.059
took it we put it under their desk and
we say would you like to build another

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069
we say would you like to build another
 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.729
we say would you like to build another
one for 2 dollars and 70 cents if they

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739
one for 2 dollars and 70 cents if they
 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.439
one for 2 dollars and 70 cents if they
say yes we gave the next one and then

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449
say yes we gave the next one and then
 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.629
say yes we gave the next one and then
the next one for 30 cents less and less

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639
the next one for 30 cents less and less
 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.599
the next one for 30 cents less and less
and less diminishing wage until they

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609
and less diminishing wage until they
 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.039
and less diminishing wage until they
said stop no more right and we told all

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049
said stop no more right and we told all
 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.330
said stop no more right and we told all
of those people that when they finish

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
of those people that when they finish
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.099
of those people that when they finish
the task we'll take all the Bionicle

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109
the task we'll take all the Bionicle
 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.809
the task we'll take all the Bionicle
we'll break them into pieces and prepare

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819
we'll break them into pieces and prepare
 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.059
we'll break them into pieces and prepare
them for the next participant that was

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069
them for the next participant that was
 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.650
them for the next participant that was
that what we call the meaningful

it is meaningful compared to the next
condition in the next condition which we

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930
condition in the next condition which we

started the same way we said to be

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160
started the same way we said to be
 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.590
started the same way we said to be
would you like to build a Bionicle for

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600
would you like to build a Bionicle for
 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.450
would you like to build a Bionicle for
$3 and they started doing it and they

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460
$3 and they started doing it and they
 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.000
$3 and they started doing it and they
finished we took it from them we kept it

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010
finished we took it from them we kept it
 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.360
finished we took it from them we kept it
on our on the desk on the desk and then

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370
on our on the desk on the desk and then
 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.380
on our on the desk on the desk and then
we said would you like to build another

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390
we said would you like to build another
 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.990
we said would you like to build another
one for 270 if they say yes they started

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000
one for 270 if they say yes they started
 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.240
one for 270 if they say yes they started
building the second Bionicle but as they

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250
building the second Bionicle but as they
 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.010
building the second Bionicle but as they
were building the second manacle we took

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020
were building the second manacle we took
 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.170
were building the second manacle we took
the pieces apart from the first Bionicle

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180
the pieces apart from the first Bionicle
 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.150
the pieces apart from the first Bionicle
so we got destroyed it in front of their

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160
so we got destroyed it in front of their
 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.420
so we got destroyed it in front of their
eyes and then we put it back in the box

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430
eyes and then we put it back in the box
 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.280
eyes and then we put it back in the box
and then this we said would you like to

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290
and then this we said would you like to
 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.010
and then this we said would you like to
build a third one for 30 cents less and

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020
build a third one for 30 cents less and
 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.540
build a third one for 30 cents less and
if they said yes we gave them back the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550
if they said yes we gave them back the
 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.580
if they said yes we gave them back the
first one that they assembled we broke

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590
first one that they assembled we broke
 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.770
first one that they assembled we broke
and this way we continued back back and

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780
and this way we continued back back and
 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.200
and this way we continued back back and
forth now and we call this the sisyphic

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210
forth now and we call this the sisyphic
 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.310
forth now and we call this the sisyphic
condition because if you remember

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320
condition because if you remember
 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.500
condition because if you remember
Sisyphus from the mythology he was

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510
Sisyphus from the mythology he was
 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.570
Sisyphus from the mythology he was
sentenced to push a rock up the hill and

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580
sentenced to push a rock up the hill and
 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.430
sentenced to push a rock up the hill and
we almost go to the top the rock would

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440
we almost go to the top the rock would
 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.110
we almost go to the top the rock would
roll back and head to the same Hill and

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120
roll back and head to the same Hill and
 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.450
roll back and head to the same Hill and
the idea was it if there were different

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460
the idea was it if there were different
 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.950
the idea was it if there were different
hills right if you were just going over

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960
hills right if you were just going over
 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.110
hills right if you were just going over
different hills maybe he would felt some

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120
different hills maybe he would felt some
 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.180
different hills maybe he would felt some
progress but having to the same Hill

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190
progress but having to the same Hill
 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.820
progress but having to the same Hill
over and over was directly the depth of

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830
over and over was directly the depth of
 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.620
over and over was directly the depth of
demoralizing people and what happened

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630
demoralizing people and what happened
 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.610
demoralizing people and what happened
kind of a couple of interesting things

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620
kind of a couple of interesting things
 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.260
kind of a couple of interesting things
the first one is that people stopped

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270
the first one is that people stopped
 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.700
the first one is that people stopped
much faster in the sisyphic condition

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710
much faster in the sisyphic condition
 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.170
much faster in the sisyphic condition
the second one is we asked people how

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180
the second one is we asked people how
 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.930
the second one is we asked people how
much they enjoyed Legos in general and

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940
much they enjoyed Legos in general and
 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.550
much they enjoyed Legos in general and
we wanted to see whether there's a

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560
we wanted to see whether there's a
 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.750
we wanted to see whether there's a
correlation between how much they

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760
correlation between how much they
 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.220
correlation between how much they
enjoyed Legos and how much they

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230
enjoyed Legos and how much they
 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.650
enjoyed Legos and how much they
persisted in this task and what we saw

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660
persisted in this task and what we saw
 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.940
persisted in this task and what we saw
was that in the meaningful condition

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950
was that in the meaningful condition
 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.040
was that in the meaningful condition
there was a correlation people who loved

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050
there was a correlation people who loved
 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.650
there was a correlation people who loved
Legos did more Bionicles people who

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660
Legos did more Bionicles people who
 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.420
Legos did more Bionicles people who
didn't like Legos internally didn't like

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430
didn't like Legos internally didn't like
 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.850
didn't like Legos internally didn't like
so much in the sisyphic condition the

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860
so much in the sisyphic condition the
 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.880
so much in the sisyphic condition the
correlation was zero which means that we

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890
correlation was zero which means that we
 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.450
correlation was zero which means that we
have sucked away the joy of assembling

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460
have sucked away the joy of assembling
 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.550
have sucked away the joy of assembling
Legos because you see the people who

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560
Legos because you see the people who
 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.440
Legos because you see the people who
love Legos did not do any more than the

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450
love Legos did not do any more than the
 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.630
love Legos did not do any more than the
people who didn't somehow the joy of it

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640
people who didn't somehow the joy of it
 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.470
people who didn't somehow the joy of it
just went away the other interesting

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480
just went away the other interesting
 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.300
just went away the other interesting
insight from this study is with another

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310
insight from this study is with another
 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.580
insight from this study is with another
version of this experiment in which

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590
version of this experiment in which
 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.530
version of this experiment in which
people did not engage in building

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540
people did not engage in building
 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.080
people did not engage in building
Bionicles but we did this in business

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090
Bionicles but we did this in business
 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.570
Bionicles but we did this in business
school and we asked the students to

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580
school and we asked the students to
 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.060
school and we asked the students to
predict how other people would behave in

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070
predict how other people would behave in
 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.040
predict how other people would behave in
those two environments right so you say

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050
those two environments right so you say
 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.480
those two environments right so you say
okay you have an environment with more

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490
okay you have an environment with more
 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.830
okay you have an environment with more
meaning environment with less meaning

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840
meaning environment with less meaning
 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.110
meaning environment with less meaning
how many Bionicles will people build

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120
how many Bionicles will people build
 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.480
how many Bionicles will people build
differently in those two environments

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490
differently in those two environments
 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.640
differently in those two environments
and we paid people for the accuracy of

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650
and we paid people for the accuracy of
 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.219
and we paid people for the accuracy of
their predictions what happened

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229
their predictions what happened
 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.589
their predictions what happened
people predicted that the difference

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599
people predicted that the difference
 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:44.670
people predicted that the difference
will be in the meaningful condition

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680
will be in the meaningful condition
 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.800
will be in the meaningful condition
people would build more but they

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810
people would build more but they
 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.629
people would build more but they
predicted would be only one Bionicle

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639
predicted would be only one Bionicle
 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.059
predicted would be only one Bionicle
more so we understand that meaning

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069
more so we understand that meaning
 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.249
more so we understand that meaning
matters but we think it matters very

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259
matters but we think it matters very
 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.550
matters but we think it matters very
little in fact it mattered a lot people

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560
little in fact it mattered a lot people
 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.489
little in fact it mattered a lot people
build almost four more Bionicle so

00:06:59.489 --> 00:06:59.499
build almost four more Bionicle so
 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:01.830
build almost four more Bionicle so
there's a big a big gap and people don't

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840
