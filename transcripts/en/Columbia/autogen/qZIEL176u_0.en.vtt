00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:05.260
drawn above like this so I'm so is the
 

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.690
drawn above like this so I'm so is the
infinite or the unchanging power of the

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:09.700
infinite or the unchanging power of the
 

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.380
infinite or the unchanging power of the
divine is above the Saffir out and they

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:13.390
divine is above the Saffir out and they
 

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.860

without any sense of edges so that
 

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:03.400
without any sense of edges so that
you're in a sense become like a being of

you're in a sense become like a being of
 

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.500
you're in a sense become like a being of
light within this space that Tyrell

light within this space that Tyrell
 

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.810

of like being within that vessel of
 

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.550
of like being within that vessel of
light at the time of creation when these

light at the time of creation when these
 

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.060
light at the time of creation when these
the light first emerges and this was the

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:16.070
the light first emerges and this was the
 

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.620
the light first emerges and this was the
the Guggenheim itself where he

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:17.630

synagogue and the rabbi said he actually

00:32:41.579 --> 00:32:41.589
synagogue and the rabbi said he actually
 

00:32:41.589 --> 00:32:43.919
synagogue and the rabbi said he actually
referred to the Zohar to the medieval

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:43.929
referred to the Zohar to the medieval
 

00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:47.579
referred to the Zohar to the medieval
book of the Kabbalah and he mentions

00:32:47.579 --> 00:32:47.589
book of the Kabbalah and he mentions
 

00:32:47.589 --> 00:32:52.319
book of the Kabbalah and he mentions
five colors that the the original that

00:32:52.319 --> 00:32:52.329
five colors that the the original that
 

00:32:52.329 --> 00:32:54.989
five colors that the the original that
the Ain soap or the light from above is

the Ain soap or the light from above is
 

00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:58.819
the Ain soap or the light from above is
pure white and as it comes into the

00:32:58.819 --> 00:32:58.829
pure white and as it comes into the
 

00:32:58.829 --> 00:33:02.339
pure white and as it comes into the
reality of of the world as we know it it

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:02.349
reality of of the world as we know it it
 

00:33:02.349 --> 00:33:05.099
reality of of the world as we know it it
becomes different colors so we can only

00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:05.109
becomes different colors so we can only
 

00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:07.919
becomes different colors so we can only
understand the divine light through its

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:07.929
understand the divine light through its

understand the divine light through its
it has its trains into the colors of the

00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159
it has its trains into the colors of the
 

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:16.049
it has its trains into the colors of the
rainbow and so this is the chandelier of

00:33:16.049 --> 00:33:16.059
rainbow and so this is the chandelier of
 

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:19.229
rainbow and so this is the chandelier of

with the five colors that the rabbi

00:33:21.869 --> 00:33:21.879
with the five colors that the rabbi
 

00:33:21.879 --> 00:33:28.409
with the five colors that the rabbi
mentions from the Zohar now this is then

00:33:28.409 --> 00:33:28.419
mentions from the Zohar now this is then
 

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:30.329

actually a lot of the research became

00:33:30.329 --> 00:33:30.339
actually a lot of the research became
 

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:33.719
actually a lot of the research became
very interesting because this is the

00:33:33.719 --> 00:33:33.729
very interesting because this is the
 

00:33:33.729 --> 00:33:38.129
very interesting because this is the
great painter Rothko who used light as a

00:33:38.129 --> 00:33:38.139
great painter Rothko who used light as a
 

00:33:38.139 --> 00:33:42.449
great painter Rothko who used light as a
kind of live phenomena and I discovered

00:33:42.449 --> 00:33:42.459

things that struck me as Kabbalistic in
 

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.420

with the lighting I can't imagine it was
 

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:17.210
with the lighting I can't imagine it was
intentional but I wonder whether you are

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220
intentional but I wonder whether you are
 

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.770
intentional but I wonder whether you are
aware of any churches or other kinds of

any of these aspects because there is a

any of these aspects because there is a
 

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:33.140
any of these aspects because there is a

light in Japan in which he literally cut
out across through the concrete and so

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700
out across through the concrete and so
 

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.270
out across through the concrete and so
in this case the light is creating the

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280
in this case the light is creating the
 

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.760
in this case the light is creating the

probably in the Renaissance there was

because there is a great theme of a
history of Christian Kabbalah as well

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:16.950
history of Christian Kabbalah as well
 

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:28.460
history of Christian Kabbalah as well
which I didn't touch on here

yourself I had a similar question some

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140
yourself I had a similar question some
 

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.800
yourself I had a similar question some
of the artistic examples you showed

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:35.810
of the artistic examples you showed
 

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.569
of the artistic examples you showed
certainly predated the 20th century but

certainly predated the 20th century but
 

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:39.980
certainly predated the 20th century but
almost all of the I think all of the

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:39.990
almost all of the I think all of the
 

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:43.040
almost all of the I think all of the
architectural examples were not just

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.050
architectural examples were not just
 

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.109
architectural examples were not just
20th century but post Holocaust and you

00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119
20th century but post Holocaust and you
 

00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:46.849
20th century but post Holocaust and you
earlier in your talk referenced the

earlier in your talk referenced the
 

00:50:46.859 --> 00:50:49.910
earlier in your talk referenced the

importance of the Holocaust to one of
the artists I'm wondering if there is

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660
the artists I'm wondering if there is
 

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.020
the artists I'm wondering if there is
some connection between the the kind of

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:54.030
some connection between the the kind of

many of these themes that previously
were not accessible I mean there were

painters who studied this really were
 

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.460

the ones who then brought it to the fore
 

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:08.990
the ones who then brought it to the fore
like Newman so I think that was what

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000
like Newman so I think that was what
 

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.349
like Newman so I think that was what
kind of sparked the interest in these

00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359
kind of sparked the interest in these
 

00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:14.930
kind of sparked the interest in these
Kabbalistic themes in contemporary but I

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940
Kabbalistic themes in contemporary but I
 

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.599
Kabbalistic themes in contemporary but I
mean since the 50s I would say and it's

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:17.609
mean since the 50s I would say and it's
 

00:52:17.609 --> 00:52:19.220
mean since the 50s I would say and it's
it's really growing what's it's

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:19.230
it's really growing what's it's
 

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:20.720
it's really growing what's it's
interesting is because it's really

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:20.730
interesting is because it's really
 

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.339
interesting is because it's really
contemporary phenomenon it's not

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:22.349
contemporary phenomenon it's not
 

00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:25.490
contemporary phenomenon it's not
something that was apparent earlier I

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500
something that was apparent earlier I
 

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.650
something that was apparent earlier I
would say

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:29.660
 

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.180
I mean that Daniel maths translation has

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.190
I mean that Daniel maths translation has
 

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.839
I mean that Daniel maths translation has
just been completed this year really and

00:52:36.839 --> 00:52:36.849
just been completed this year really and
 

00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:39.190
just been completed this year really and
I think it's one of the most poetic

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200
I think it's one of the most poetic
 

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.799
I think it's one of the most poetic
translations of the of the Zohar
