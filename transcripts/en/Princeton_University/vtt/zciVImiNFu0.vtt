CHRISTINA RIEHL: My
name is Christie Riehl,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.690
and I'm an assistant professor
in the Department of Ecology

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.770
and Evolutionary
Biology at Princeton,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.640
and my research focus
is on animal behavior

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.530
and behavioral ecology.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.560
My main study system
is the greater ani.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.450
They are a bird that
breeds cooperatively.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.420
So unlike most birds, where a
male and female build a nest

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.710
and share parental care
of their nestlings,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.020
anis breed in groups
where several pairs build

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.690
one nest together and all of
the individuals in the group

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.380
reproduce.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.280
The females lay their eggs
in the nest, more or less

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.410
synchronously.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.040
And they share parental care
of the mixed clutch of young.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.310
But the females also
compete with each other.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.110
And the way they do this
is before each female lays

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.900
her own first egg, if
she goes to the nest then

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.160
she hasn't laid yet,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.050
and sees an egg in the nest
that anther female in the group

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.760
has laid, she'll push
that egg out of the nest.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
I was able to film this
behavior for the first time two

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.500
years ago.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.090
And we've been trying
actually for a couple of years

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.400
to get this behavior on film.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.140
And when I saw it
for the first time,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.170
it was really a
special moment for me

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.970
because it was a behavior
I had studied for years.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.020
I knew that this egg
ejection happened

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.480
and I knew it was
an important fitness

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.210
cost to females in the group.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.810
But I didn't know what it
looks like or how they did it.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.360
Anis are very unusual among
cooperatively breeding birds

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.620
because the adults that form
these reproductive groups

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.810
together are not genetically
related to one another.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.780
They're not family members.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.390
In most cooperatively
breeding birds,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.240
one of the benefits
of cooperation

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.960
is through kin selection that
you help pass on your genes

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.030
by helping relatives that
also carry your identical gene

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.420
copies because you had
a parent or an uncle

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.010
or another relative in common.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.640
And anis don't have those kin
selected or indirect fitness

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.760
benefits.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.200
There are very strong direct
benefits to breeding in groups.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.150
So what I found
in my Ph.D. work was

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.160
that the probability that a
group will escape predation

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.310
and successfully fled young
is related to group size.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.080
So the larger the group you're
in, the more likely you are to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.480
fled young successfully
from the nest.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.550
Predation is very high in
tropical birds in general

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.080
and in Panama about
70% of ani nests

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.060
are predated mostly by snakes.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.210
I got interested in biology
solely through birds.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.870
I've always loved birds.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.920
And when I was about 11 or
12, I was an avid bird watcher

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.810
and I still am.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.190
So the thing I wanted to
do more than anything

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.920
was just go outside
with binoculars

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.120
and identify all the
bird species I could see

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.470
and I still love doing that.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.040
I think one of the things that's
most special about Princeton

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.300
is the independence it affords
its researchers and the amount

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.410
of interaction
between researchers

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.020
and graduate students
and colleagues.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.100
It's a kind of place where
you can work with undergraduates

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.570
and help them design their
senior thesis projects

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.900
on a topic that interests them.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.770
Graduate students have
a lot of independence.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.320
They are not
constrained by working

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.290
on their advisers'
grants, for example.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.710
So I think it's a place where
the community and the resources

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.750
make a lot of exciting
research possible.
