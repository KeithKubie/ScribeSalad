Moffat: I'm Alex Moffat,
the chief engineer

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.300
for Lombardi Blueprint,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.834
and I'm gonna show you
Blueprint,

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:06.734
an app that we built
with Google Web Toolkit.

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:10.501
So Blueprint is a business
process mapping tool

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:12.501
for business users

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:15.133
to collaboratively describe
their processes,

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.334
and try
and get agreement

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:18.334
about what
the processes actually are.

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:21.167
So the tool--what they'd
be using instead of Blueprint

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.167
is probably PowerPoint
or Visio.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:24.601
You can see here
in the app

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.701
that on the left-hand side

00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:27.901
we have an outline
of the process,

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.267
and on the right-hand side,
we have sort of a map view.

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.767
I can, uh, enter items
into the outline.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.267
And then I can do
some drag and drop.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.634
We also have, um,
a diagram view,

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:39.200
which looks a lot more
like Visio.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.801
I can switch to that now.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:43.567
Now the diagram
actually does

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.868
automated, uh, layout
of the boxes

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:47.334
and routing
of the lines.

00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:49.534
And all of this is happening
on the client in JavaScript,

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.467
which is pretty remarkable.

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:53.400
Everything that
you're seeing here is done--

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.834
is executing
in an ordinary browser

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:57.300
in JavaScript.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200
There's no Flash or other
client-side plugins required.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.234
And really, that's the benefit
that we get

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:03.868
from Google Web Toolkit.

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:07.834
We don't have to worry
about all of the browser quirks

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.567
that you fight with when
you're writing pure JavaScript.

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:13.367
We just write in a language
that we like to use,

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:15.467
and they take care of all
the difficult bits for us.
