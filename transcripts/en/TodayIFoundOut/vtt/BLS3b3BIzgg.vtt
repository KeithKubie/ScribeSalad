00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.130
In the video today, we're looking at the surprisingly
recent time when boys wore pink, girls wore

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.139
blue and both wore dresses.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.330
Gender identification by color began in the
early 20th century in the Western world.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.350
Before this, pink and blue did not hold any
gender specific connotations and there are

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.939
numerous examples of men wearing pink outfits
and girls wearing blue; one French author,

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.150
Xavier de Maistre (mait-r)in his work, A Journey
Around My Room published in 1794, even recommended

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.790
that men choose to paint their rooms pink
and white to improve the mood.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.900
Fast-forward to the early 20th century and
this began to change.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.140
When it did, starting just before the 1920s,
pink was deemed by many guides to be more

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.110
appropriate for boys and blue for girls, although
this wasn't even remotely as popular as the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.640
"pink is for girls, blue is for boys" association
that exists today; many people completely

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.210
ignored the gender recommendations altogether.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.870
One of the earliest references to this original
color scheme appeared in a June of 1918 edition

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.720
of the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants’
Department,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.720
“The generally accepted rule is pink for
the boys, and blue for the girls.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.350
The reason is that pink , being a more decided
and stronger color, is more suitable for the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.690
boy, while blue, which is more delicate and
dainty, is prettier for the girl.”

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.620
In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart highlighting
gender-appropriate colors for girls and boys

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.400
according to leading U.S. retailers.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.780
Filene's (in Boston), Best &amp; Co. (in New York
City), Halle's (in Cleveland), and Marshall

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.560
Field (in Chicago) all advised parents to
dress boys in pink and girls in blue.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.680
Why did they care at all?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.820
It is generally thought it was simply because
if parents followed such a color scheme, they

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.940
would have to buy a whole new wardrobe and
set of baby accessories in the "appropriate"

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.160
colors if they had a boy and a girl at some
point, rather than just going with reusing

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.190
the one set for both as before.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.800
For reasons unknown, this all started to change
around the 1940s when clothing manufacturers

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.460
decided on pink for girls and blue for boys.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.540
It has been suggested that boys simply like
blue more and girls like pink more, but studies

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.640
to date trying to see if this is true have
come up with mixed results, except firmly

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.400
showing that the vast majority of humans prefer
blue to pink, and pink is actually one of

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.539
the adult world's least favorite colors.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.120
(Although as you might imagine, it's difficult
to perform large scale studies to determine

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.500
if boys and girls are naturally predisposed
to one color or another without the introduction

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.280
of existing learned color biases, even in
countries that don't popularly follow the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.950
pink-girl/blue-boy scheme.)

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.760
Whatever the case, the women's liberation
movement of the 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.670
of more unisex or perceived gender-neutral
clothing colors.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.170
In fact, in the 1970s, the Sears and Roebuck
catalog even went two full years without showing

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.400
any toddler wearing pink, in stark contrast
to a couple decades before.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.380
But these gender neutral efforts were undermined
with advancements in prenatal testing where

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.040
parents could find out the gender of their
baby before needing to buy clothes and accessories.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.170
Once again, manufacturers and retailers started
pushing hard for the "pink for girls" and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.349
"blue for boys" phenomenon that continues
to be entrenched in our society today.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.020
So what did people do before this color association?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.040
Prior to the invention of cheap chemical dyes
that allowed clothes to be washed in hot water

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.819
over and over again with minimal fading, most
infants were simply dressed in white for everyday

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.319
life and sometimes in random colors for more
formal occasions, with no one color being

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.520
favored for boys or girls.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.150
Regardless of color, in both cases, they wore
dresses.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.510
Why white dresses?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.540
White was easy to bleach and, at least in
the beginning, changing diapers is much easier

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.989
in dresses than pants.

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.040
Further, with children growing rapidly, dresses
were a bit more practical in terms of not

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.099
needing to get the sizing as precise.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.270
Even beyond the diaper stage, which was discarded
much earlier back then, gender differences

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.390
were not highlighted until children were much
older.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.840
In fact, it wasn't at all uncommon to have
both boys and girls wear dresses or short

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.410
skirts until age five or six.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.020
In the early 20th century, as noted, this
began to change.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.239
Beyond the introduction of more colors and
loose guidelines about which color went with

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.190
which, boys started wearing garb associated
with men at a younger and younger age, resulting

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.180
in a shift away from dresses and a move towards
pants.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.830
A similar significant shift happened during
the women's liberation movement, but instead

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.830
of going back to dressing boys in the more
convenient dresses, many started dressing

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.599
their girls the same as boys- in pants.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.560
Of course, today for many in the Western world,
girls wear pink dresses and boys wear blue

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560
pants.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560
Period.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.739
This curious phenomenon is so firmly entrenched
that if you tried to dress a two year old

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.150
boy in a pink dress, regardless of the child
perhaps having a traditionally male hair style

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.780
with male-centric accessories hinting that
your toddler is a boy, absolutely no one would

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.770
think they were looking at a male child until
you told them.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.629
And when you did tell them, you're likely
to get some funny looks if not get eviscerated

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.889
if you posted a picture of it in modern social
media.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:40.889
Humans are a funny bunch.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.080
Bonus Fact:
• Through most of history, and still today

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.229
in many countries in Africa and Asia particularly,
the average age a child would be fully daytime

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.020
potty trained was typically around 18 months
old, instead of about double that today in

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.020
the Western world.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.919
The change began to happen around the mid-20th
century thanks to the introduction of disposable

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.389
diapers and heavy marketing campaigns from
the manufacturers, which included widely promoted

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.470
(sponsored) so-called "scientific" studies
that showed that it was bad for the child

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.680
to potty train earlier (something still often
repeated today, even by some doctors, despite

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.409
a complete lack of evidence supporting such
a notion).

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.090
With the effort needed to potty train the
traditional way over waiting and the relative

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.789
ease and cleaner nature of disposable diapers
over having to wash cloth ones, people didn't

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.259
take much convincing to simply wait until
the child was much older and showed an active

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.780
interest in potty training.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.460
However, recently with advancements in diaper
technology and pull-ups, this has started

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.509
to become more of a problem (mainly environmental,
but also sometimes financial) as kids show

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.030
interest in potty training later and later.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.969
For reference, in 1957 in America, it was
typical to start potty training at 12 months

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.869
with the vast majority of children fully daytime
potty trained within 6-12 months of that and

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:53.259
nighttime potty trained by 3 years old.

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.389
Today, according to the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the average is to start potty

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:03.249
training at 24-25 months, achieving daytime
potty trained at 36 months and night time

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:20.590
around 5-6 years old.
