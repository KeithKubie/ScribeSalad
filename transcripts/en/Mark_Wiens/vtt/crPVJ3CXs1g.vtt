00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Mark Wiens I am in Saigon Vietnam, and I'm sitting down for Vietnamese breakfast at a place called

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.759
Banh Mi Hoa Ma

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.799
The environment here could not be more spectacular

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.519
The restaurant is located on the main road, but then they set up tables only in the morning in this alley

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.990
Along the in the alley along the side of the wall, so I'm sitting on at one of the tables the environment is spectacular

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.569
It's it's busy yet at the same time

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.500
It's calm and peaceful, and this is like a haven of food

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.830
But thank you all for recommending this restaurant to me. I am excited to be here for breakfast

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.130
I think they opened at about 7 a.m.. And there they sell out

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.179
Pretty early so you have to come you have to come for breakfast

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.829
Breakfast only here, and it looks like a lot of people are not only

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.059
full

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.429
It's full now when I came I guess we go

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.939
I came right as it open so we were the only ones here, but now the tables are full

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.859
But it also looks like a lot of people. Just do take away then just park their motorbike there

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.860
I wish you could smell this it smells

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.050
unbelievably good

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.080
I ordered the hoa la which are eggs and it's in a little it's in a little skillet a flaming hot skillet

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.760
and I got two eggs there are some fried pieces of meat and

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.969
Then some onions, and then yeah topped with some onions, and it looks incredible

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.620
This is one of the most beautiful breakfasts

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.060
I think I've eaten or I'm about to eat in a long time and it's served with some toasted bagettes

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.040
Really crusty loaves and also I got a little extra little full of pate and mayonnaise

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.619
To go with my bread and then finally there are some

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.380
pickled Vietnamese vegetables

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.770
as well as

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.740
uh tea, okay, I think I'm first just gonna take some pepper

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.178
And let me let me pepper it up first

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.719
You never go wrong with pepper and eggs

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.440
Hahaha, yes, okay, that looks good, and maybe I should go in with uh

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.680
oh no, okay, let me just go in for a bite first, first steak, for a steak bite

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.640
All that is amazing. Thank you.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.720
oh that's beautiful

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.560
Oh yes

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.210
that egg

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.759
That egg is perfect. It is runny on the inside and then crispy on the edges

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.740
That meat tasted like spam, so it must be some kind of fried luncheon meat

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.169
And then yeah that egg is just perfect with the black pepper

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.299
tear into this aw it's so it's so crusty

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.770
And

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.420
Let me dip into that I'm gonna, try to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.119
oh the bagette the bagette is so crusty. You can actually like use it and cut your egg

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.050
ohh man just that is just a beautiful thing

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.579
Oh yeah, that's awesome

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.989
Okay next up. I'm gonna try some of this pate. I'm not a huge mayonnaise fan though, but

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.459
tried to take a bit of that pate and put it onto my

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.580
crusty loaf...oh yes

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.540
and I might add. I might add a piece of egg a piece of egg to that as well

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.989
to go the extra mile

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.420
mmmh

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.350
Oh, that's so good

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.769
the pate is so light and like fluffy

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.330
the egg again

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.960
Is just cooked perfectly a little bit crispy, but then soft... soft through and through

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.609
So good, I'm gonna add a bit more pepper

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.230
And then maybe some pickled

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.699
That was an absolutely outstanding breakfast I did not want that to end

00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:00.800
um, it was so simple

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.519
But just so good and hot and fresh, the eggs were cooked perfectly just kind of kind of crispy on the edges

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:14.809
But then soft and gooey and and runny on the inside, and then I think what really made it amazing

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.689
are the caramelized onions

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.518
So the caramelized onions just gave it a little like oniony, uh, sweet flavor

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.509
but just

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.208
Absolutely a beautiful breakfast. I think this is one of the top egg breakfasts

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.778
I've had in a very very long time if ever

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.230
That was delicious the food is amazing and the atmosphere here is

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.059
could not be better. Again huge thank you for recommending this restaurant I

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.439
absolutely loved it a great way to start the morning in Saigon
