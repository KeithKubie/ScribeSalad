Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       All right. Youtube. We're live. We're going old school today. I'm doing something that I've only done I think one time before an interview via Google hangouts. We've only done this once before we did it right when I moved into this house when we were building out the studio and we didn't have a studio. My first ever interview with Jordan Peterson, which was the first time that I ever talked to Jordan. We did via Google hangout sitting in my living room over there yesterday. I was supposed to have Avi Yemeni who is in that box right there who I'll introduce to you in a second. I was supposed to have him right here in studio for a normal show and he was on his way a couple of days ago from Australia to the United States, which is a freaking long, and I took a, I took a 15 hour flight from a, I guess it was from Sydney to uh, to Texas a couple of weeks ago after a five hour flight I think from Perth to Sydney or something like that. I mean it was like 30 something hours of total travel. Anyway, it's a long ass flight. He tried to enter the United States and he was denied entry. Now why did it all this happen? While I'm going to kick it to Abi Right now, Abi, first off, before we do anything else here, for any of my audience that does not know who you are, what's the best way to describe you? Consider yourself a youtuber or you are provocative tour or your, your sort of, uh, a quasi 20, 19 journalists. What do you consider yourself?

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       I'm actually a journalist, a freelance journalist. I work mostly with Dr News. Um, I started on a, I wasn't getting sign up and uh, the guy bought the uh, Eh tag audit Riley's on Australian Israeli, uh, proud of Bo love, the three western way of life. Um, I kind of fell into this. I was, I was a gym owner that ran Krav Maga gyms if you know what they are. Yeah. Optimize Riley army service. And to be honest, it was a really, when one of the operations in Gaza kind of kicked off, then I was watching like the mainstream media report on it and I was getting started frustrated with their reporting and I'd really popular gyms at the time. I just started kind of commenting and writing what I experienced myself and what I knew to be true from the ground, from someone who actually served on the front line then.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       And I guess it kind of started a conversation. I lost a lot of members at the time. I also gained a few, but, uh, um, I guess after that I kind of found a voice and I continue kind of commenting on all sorts of political issues and people kind of gave me some constructive criticism. People that are alive, people that I trust, so maybe don't use your business page for that. So I opened a Facebook page, I just started speaking. And, um, now youtube is a new thing for me to be honest, because before that I was 100% on until they, uh, they kicked me off and, uh, apparently hate speech, which I don't believe I ever engage in, you know, but obviously, uh, it's very broad, those terms. So that's where I am today. I work mainly put Tommy Robinson who, uh, is, he's very well known obviously in the UK.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       Yeah. And I think Tommy, we were trying to get him in here and uh, you know, I interviewed him once years ago on Skype and I don't even think he's allowed to come to the United States either. So you're, you're in company with people that can or can't get into the good old United States. Okay. So, uh, I want you to tell exactly what happened with Jim Jefferies and comedy central. I should preface this by saying that until, uh, the clip that I saw of you, which now has millions and millions, I think over 3 million views on youtube. I have never seen Jim Jeffrey show. I don't really know who he is. I know he's a comedian, but I don't really know who he is, so I have no, um, you know, dog in this fight one way or another. It's not like I'm a fan of his or a hater of his.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Um, I don't really watch comedy central. I don't think anyone really watches comedy central anymore. I think pretty much, pretty much. I, I think, I know the last time I watch comedy central, um, was when, uh, when Jon Stewart was still hosting the daily show. He had ion Hirsi Ali on and he threw her under the bus in Wa. I don't know if you've seen it. It was one of the most disgusting interviews I've ever seen. It's really, really awful. Um, and I pretty much just tuned out a comedy central than, and you know, uh, I think since then, well, I guess maybe it's Futurama still on there.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       I've no idea. I didn't even watch it to be honest, to be honest. Jim Jeffries is an Aussie who, um, who got famous in America. It wasn't, he was kind of crappy. Yeah. He just, he likes to drop the C bomb a lot, I guess in America. You folks go in and find that fascinating and funny. Um, well one thing I did, like I was a fan of these ones because he wa he would push the boundaries. He wasn't, he wasn't politically correct. Um, he would make jokes about kind of anything. Uh, but, uh, I think over the last few years, especially when it comes to the gun debate, uh, he's found he's, he's a little place in Hollywood. And even in some of the clips that I released after that, or if you watch the whole clip, you can see, I challenge him on it. I call him, I'll tell him he's a, he's a sellout and he admits he admitted the life in Hollywood is nice. So you can't really like, I don't blame him for that part of it. Like I, I can understand it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:25       Okay. So, yeah. So before we get too, too far ahead though, and I have no doubt that at the Viacom building in New York City and in La Right now, there are plenty of executives watching this. So you can talk, you can talk directly to them and you can talk directly to Jim. Uh, I suspect Jim is not going to retweet this, although I did tag him in it. But anyway, I preface it that way just to say I brought in, you're not blocked. Yeah, I know. I'm sure I'll be boxing it up. But I preface it that way just to say I have nothing against the guys specifically until I saw what happened. And now it's like, this is just such, the reason I wanted to have you on was that it's such a perfect example of fake news of media manipulation, the way that these people often these media personalities privately do one thing and publicly do another. I mean it's just, and then really to your credit that you were smart enough to videotape the whole thing. So just start at the beginning. How did you even get on the Jim Jeffrey show? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       traditionally did call me out into is a December time. I'm always in Israel at the time, if I remember correctly. Well, maybe I was in Europe, but it gave me a call and said, listen, Jim is the traveling Australia at the moment. He's uh, he's organizing, he's doing a tour in Australia, but he was running a special for a Netflix or one of them, one of these comedy central specials. Um, and he was wondering, you probably would be willing to come on to discuss immigration, to discuss the border wall. And I, I know who Jim Jeffries is and I know where he stands or at least publicly where he stands these days on issues. And I'm not, I'm like, I'm somebody that's confident in my beliefs. I have no problem, you know, discussing anything with anyone. But I also know he's on trustworthy and I've been involved in the media for long enough to know that I need to set out some conditions and I set out to basic conditions.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       One, don't put me with neo Nazis or anyone who believes he had learned he wouldn't do. And two is just put my answers to the questions that you asked me. Don't cut it up. And with a technique that they love doing. And you know, I, I do a lot of street interviews myself and I would never do that to somebody because there's no point. The whole idea is if somebody is stupid or if somebody answers something ridiculous ridiculously, you don't need to cut it. Yeah. You can actually just put it out there and everybody, the world is there to judge.

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       Yeah. But that's kind of the game these guys have been playing for a long time. Right. Like I interned, I interned at the daily show back in 1999 it's a long freaking time ago and I remember, you know, I don't know that they were doing what he did with you, which is taking an answer to one question in placing it to another. But I always remember thinking when they'd get these local Republicans on and then mock them the whole time, it's like, what, what were these idiots thinking? Like, you know, you're walking into the daily show, like you know you're going to be selectively edited or they're going to put a pause on you in a weird way for a laugh or, or just some, some level of manipulation. So you went out your way.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       Just don't expect it to be so bad like it to be honest. The last one I'd seen of Jim Jefferies, he's what he did to Jordan Peterson and I thought to myself, you know, I look at someone like Jordan, Jordan Peterson, and I look at him and he's an academic. He's far smarter than me and if Jim Jefferies could make him kind of look like a dumb ass, then obviously he's out to get me. So they agree to those terms. And I went to, they flew me to Singapore. I, I told him that the third issue is that I'm just not in Australia at the moment, so I'm happy to do it. If you, if you agree to those two conditions, I'm happy to do it. But obviously it has to be the term that I can, it worked at that, that flew me to Singapore. Pay For my hotel and paid all my expenses.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       It was great little trip. I walk in there and I knew, I also spoke to my good friend Tommy Robinson, who's had a lot of experience with fake news and great straightaway. He said, make sure you've got footage on it. So I went in there and I thought I had two phones. I don't want them to phones. I went in there because I wanted to make sure in case one collapse, which it actually did. That's why if you look at the footage, some of it's blurry because the very one actually recorded the whole thing and I walk in and I was thinking if they stop me and I started recording from the moment I walked in because I said if they stopped me, I didn't care at that point. If they kicked me out while I'm setting up my cameras to film myself, then that's not video show that they're not even willing to engage me without trying to screw me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       But nobody noticed, nobody noticed anything and I set it up. It was like it was couches and I put these pillows. There was, it took me a good minute and I went even went back and reset it. It was, that was so self absorbed on their, on their egos or their importance or something. Absolutely. And I just filmed the whole thing. It was, it was a couple of months I think too. I just held onto it. I didn't, I could've put that Mohammed stuff out straight away, but I thought, you know what, I'm going to wait. I want to see how this plays out. And I was actually at a Purim event, so what is it, a couple of weeks ago, and I didn't even know the, the segment at Baym released and some, you know Habad rabbi walks up to me, he goes, Oh, I saw your Jim Jefferies thing last night. They totally, he screwed you or he, I think his wording was more like he wrecked you.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       Lucky it was as if he even, he believed the context of the, of the interview and that all the cuts were actually true. I'm sitting there like after a few, you know, poor him drinks, I'm just open up my phone and I'm just watching. And I'm going, I can't believe this. He's literally put me in the context of Christ's Church of the Cross church massacre with some crazy white supremacists who hate my guts a hundred percent. He believes that you should be in Israel. He doesn't think of Israeli is a good thing. Just to be very clear, you taped the interview, what a good two, three months before.

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       And I'm looking at it and I'm in shock. I'm saying that cut up. My aunt is in 20 seconds of the clip. They have the most prominent neo Nazi in Australia. Um, they, they've, uh, cut up even not even just my aunties, even my facial reaction, my expressions, I took expressions when he would say something bizarre and I would, I would like cringe up my face. He, he's taken that and cut it with, you know, reasonable questions that he's asked and he's even saying the best part was I got him saying he will, um, he can cut it up to make himself look perfect. So I, I honestly, I went home and, and, and I just myself, I went and I said, I told her how bad guy there, the rabbi, I said, wait till tomorrow, you'll see you'll see the tree. Then I went back and now what's odd to me is I expected that once they see that that will will retract immediately that you apologize, they will remove the defamatory content.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       No, they didn't do any of that and they still haven't done any of that. In fact, I managed to get banned on Youtube. It picked him up. I managed to get band within 24 hours from posting that on Facebook. Facebook denies it has anything to do with that, but they won't give me any proof on any other posts. Um, that has, uh, that, that bridge their terms and conditions. In fact, I didn't post anything for a good period besides for the Jim Jeffrey stuff. So I don't know what it possibly can be. Um, okay. So for the, for the people that haven't seen it, so he splices answers that you give to other questions to make it seem like you're, you're racist basically. I'm a radical, I'm crazy. And the fact is, if I watched that, if I watched that, I don't like that guy. Oh, that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       And that was what it was designed to do was to make me look like a bad job, you know? And he tried to, he tried to make it like he literally says, Gee, the only thing that could bring Jews and white supremacists together is there shared height from was absolutely outrageous. Disgusting. The fact is, I don't, I've never shown hate from Muslims ever in my life because I think hating on a people is wrong. As a Jew, I find that offensive to hate on us, to target a people to criticize Islam. I always do it because I think any idea should be tested, tried and tested and discuss. But um, it wasn't just though that he manipulated what you said, what you also caught him saying off camera and this really to me, this is the beauty of it because I think even if beforehand you said to them, guys, don't sandbagged me, you know, don't edit my stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       And they promised to do all that. Like, I live in Hollywood, I know how this business works. They're all liars and frauds and they'll say anything and do any of that. The real, the real meat of this is what you caught him saying because that really shows the one 80 on reality. So could you lay out some of that is, look, Jim Jefferies used to say a lot of that stuff publicly in a lot of his original shows, um, lightly. Obviously he's, uh, he's become a very good liberal lovie dovie. It's all about, uh, you know, and the thing is that segment, that specific segment was about pointing at people like me and blaming us for radicalizing people like that crazy Christchurch killer. Um, he's gone in there, he's drawn Mohammad, you know, he's um, he even went as far as making it, he made a few jokes and said how much you hate Islamic fallen.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       Fair enough. I actually have no problem with what he said. And especially in the context of comedy, I think it's fine. I just don't think you have the right then to turn around and point fingers at someone like me. You would never even say anything close to what he said. Even as a joke. In fact, I had to pull him up at one point where he was joking about dingoes killing little Muslim babies and vomiting, which is just not even funny. And now for those who are out there who were claiming that he only said it to bait me, well no actually originally he used to, he used to be like that. He used to say that publicly is changed because now that's where you know he's following the money. He obviously doesn't believe anything he preaches. He's two faced is exactly the definition of two faced and fake.

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       But also if he was trying to beat you to do the baiting off camera and then your answers aren't coming. I mean that in and of itself, again, this is not surprising how these guys operate, but that would show you a little bit of the motivations there. Absolutely it, he came in with certain intentions and the thing is he couldn't, he didn't get the outcome he wanted. So the only way to produce it was literally to reproduce it, to cut it up. And anyone can look stupid when you do that and anyone can look bad and you can literally ruin someone's life. If I didn't capture that, my life would be ruined. There's no way for me to be able to defend against any of what he's put out there. I still find it crazy that till today they've not only not responded, they blocked and banned any, you know a lot of people and you can look, you know, some people aren't getting banned, you or may so far not. But if you look at my Twitter, there's posts up that I keep re tweeting of people just bad. And for what they're saying is literally, can you at least faced what you've done? Jim Can, can comedy central make a statement? Can you do something? But nothing, they just blocking their vaccine restricted comments on Instagram. So that's what I think is so interesting here because it's such a perfect storm of all of the crap that I'm always talking about. Hearing what's wrong, the media and then,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       and then how people, individuals online are able to fight back. Because right now if you look at comedy central's a Twitter feed or the Jim Jeffrey show, typically if you look at your mentions, it is no matter what he tweets, it's real people, decent human beings saying, are you going to address this and all that. So before we get to what happened when you tried to get to the United States to be in the studio yesterday, um, if, if comedy central today or Jim Jefferies personally issued an apology, admitted the whole thing, which app, which now everyone knows to be true. So it's not much of a mia culpa because it's like, yeah, you're just admitting what blatantly is obvious. Would you accept that and then just move on from this situation?

Speaker 1:          00:18:33       Well, what we'll everyday that passes, the bigger the apology is going to have to be, the more, the more, the louder it's going to have to be because it now on their, all their social media platforms, that defamatory video has been up, what is it, two weeks now? Um, they'd been running it on cable TV. It's been everywhere. So you, they've kind of got to reach everyone reached to in and out. Having said that, I think my video has reached more than this, but I don't know if it's the same audience. They need to really show that they finally accept what they did and that it was wrong and it is not, you know, I've heard a lot of people turn around and go, oh, but how can you type comedy central series after all, it's called comedy central, but I don't accept that because one, it wasn't a joke what they were discussing.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       It wasn't a joke the time that they were discussing, it wasn't a joke that they were pointing at me. For someone who was partly responsible in making that happen, it's not a joke to cut somebody up. I don't mind. I make fun of myself all day every day. If you watch my youtube, I like, I have no problem doing that. But there were certain lines that even I like, I don't get offended easily, but I am freaking offended by the content that they produce. So yes, in theory it would accept an apology and then taking responsibility. But it has to match the amount. They pushed the fight news till now.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       Yeah. And I don't even know how they could do that at this point. I mean I, you know, it's so interesting also because that's why I decided to do a long form interview show in the first place years ago. Cause I was like, I'll do these things. We won't edit for content. I liked doing them live. You can say whatever you want. I can edit you. And ironically when I do I'll get 10 his camera off man. I know. Yeah, exactly what? Like when I, when I do television, it's so funny because Fox News is the only one that'll put me on. I was on Tucker last night, but it's live. There's no chance that they're getting, they could sandbag me, you know, ask me something intentionally inflammatory. It's all live and absolutely. I know, I just wouldn't go on the shows anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       That wouldn't be a problem. I know people were criticizing me for going. Why, why would you even, why would you even do it? Well, there's two things. One is I knew I was going to record it, so it was a win win. I was going to either get a good segment where I actually got to, uh, reach an audience that I wouldn't typically be able to reach and have my say and present my opinions, um, and maybe change a few minds, maybe not, whatever, um, but at least be presented properly or I'm going to get to expose the fake news. And that's exactly what I did. And I'm gonna call on fake news even though they are comedy central because that is what they did. And people come to those shows to get the newsies. It's sad. It is sad. But people come to those shows to get their news and the fact is if they presented as real news than it is just the same meetings all the time and they have that platform that I have that responsibility.

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       Yeah. Well I, I completely agree with that because you know, remember when, when Jon Stewart was hosting the daily show, I mean, I know no one watches it anymore. It's completely irrelevant. But when, when Stewart was hosting the daily show and Obama was president, the meme out there on all of mainstream media, every article that was written about daily show was more young people get their news from the daily show. Then from CNN, New York Times to have it both ways.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       But it's true. Like even here in Australia, we have a, I don't know, I don't know if you were experienced in the project. I don't know if Jordan was he, when you guys were here on the project, the project is assigned knees. It's meant to be, you know, a lot harder to comment and it does reach the younger people and it's, it's just not funny to take people out of context to ruin people's lives. It's wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:22:31       Okay, so now you get on a plane, you, so the video goes viral. Everybody seeing this, you're getting, you're getting retweeted I think by, by all the people that I know really try to push back against this. This means media nonsense. And you know, I, I didn't know who you were before. So I watched it and I was like, all right, this, this is legit. Like I'm watching. I didn't know. I didn't know you're going to make hurtful statements in this interview. And you didn't know him, even from Jay's says, Hey, I know you now. I know, you know, you know. Um, but you know, I'd seen this game before, so I was, I was more than happy to just spread awareness about this. Okay. Yep. So then you reach out and you say, uh, well, I think maybe I reached out to you first. And I said, you know, if you want to come in studio, let, let's make this happen. Yeah. Within a day you were like, all right, I'm coming to the states. Uh, so what, say it was

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       actually, it was you that, uh, that, that inspired me to come. Um, when, when you said, when we had, we started the conversation, I can't remember exactly how it started, but, um, I said, you know what? And I spoke to Sydney Watson, who's a good friend here, who is very publisher, you know, she's a Sky News contributor. She has her own uh, following and she was like, yeah, let's do it. She's hot. She's a jewel citizen, American, Australian. And we said, let's do this. Let's go, you know, we already had sapling. We have something in place. We're going to go Reuben, and then we're going to go, you know, my idea was to go to comedy central, just walk in the door, you know, talk to somebody with the comedy central logo on a moment. You know, anyone can watch any of my content. I, when I'm asked to leave, I leave. But that, that, that's good enough for me. I'll walk into comedy central and if I bring up some content that you've got and you asked me to leave, that's telling, that's enough visual. Let somebody come in the central ledger, you know, right now that's been my problem is no one even wants to respond. The same producer that was so open to talking to me before is not responding to my whatsapp messages anymore. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       What's, what's so interesting to me, it's like they don't even understand the Internet game that they think that they're a part of. Like they think that if you just ignore this long enough that it's going to go away. But I mean they're, they're messing with the wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       I can't, I keep telling me there's two people they need to talk to. I can talk to my mom, ask her how persistent on am I'm a pain in her eyes to speak to my officer in the army. Like I flew halfway around the world just to join the IDF to be on the front line in a specific unit. And I got there, I'm going to go till they respond and they, they need to know that. Um, so we decided to do this, we call it the American tour against fake news. We're going to come to you on your show. A few other shows that are organized. Um, and it was just growing. It was you in the beginning. And we just don't, we're built around that. Well, I was going to go do his, uh, Jim Jefferies show in Maryland, see if I can actually engage him.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       Oh Man. Um, and I was going to talk to just, even the people lining up in the audience. Now I want to make it clear I was going to do it. I'm not in a threatening manner on tiny, like I'm, I'm, I'm a little guy. I'd never end and you can say are going to supplies in the, you know, online. You see that brand is a lot bigger than me. Generally, I'm the smallest guy in the room. I'm not very threatening and I'm willing to talk to anybody and only talk. I only ever talk. So there's no basis for any, um, perceived real threat. But, uh, when we got to the states, it was myself and Sydney. Sydney's even Sydney is bigger than me, but it'd be a tall girl and we get there and they've, Abi, you, she's with her. She's got an American thing, was always split up straight away.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       Um, I've gone into the line now, as soon as I've come to the, uh, to the immigration desk, the, something's obviously popped up on your screen. As soon as he's a swat my passport and he goes, are, you just need to come with me. We need to update some details about your, uh, about your, I think it's called STV, like the visa waiver program that we had here with Australia. So I'm, I'm fine at this point. I still think it's okay. The acting quite normal. Take me to a back room. His superior officer is there and I found that interesting because he kind of seemed like he knew my name already and he was expecting me, but I went with the flow and taking me around and lax to an area where it's more secluded. Put your bags on a thing. He's been going through my bag, checking if I've got over $10,000, I'll wish I did.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       Not, nothing close to it. Um, they're asking me more questions about what I'm doing here and it's all still, um, reasonable. I'm starting to get a little bit more suspicious. They've written down a bunch of stuff and then I got, okay, we just got, we've got a few more questions. We'll go sit in this room and talk because I knew it's on, that opened the door to this back room. There's two FBI agents, you know, there's one man in a suit and then a woman behind a computer and a, they shined. Their idea got everywhere. I looked, I saw that and I just cracked up laughing. I looked at him and I'll just go to comedy central and the, the, the agent tends to be guys, we are actually a separate entity to comedy central. Blackie had to say that like he had to tell me now. And um, I've got, I've said, I've responded going, we'll uh, but comedy central is the informant. Yeah. And he just responded straight away. And this is when people ask me, how do you not comedy says, well, he's gone. He said to me, literally, we've received a number of complaints from comedy central about certain things that we just want to clarify.

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       Okay. So we got to really drill this one home. That means that comedy central contacted either the FBI or the Tsa or whatever else is going on there. The three I's, what are and as hell man, maybe that called law enforcement who decided it's in the jurisdiction of FBI because they knew that you were coming to the United States, I guess to do a couple of shows including this one. And you are going to just talk.

Speaker 1:          00:28:27       I know, I don't know if you saw my description on the, it was on my website, the description of what we were doing there. So we're coming on your show. We're going on Steven Crowder. We're going to move, we're going to go confront. Exactly. So they've called and they literally given screenshots. I've taken screenshots of different posts I've made, including one from Eylea, a British, uh, Eh, uh, conservative, the news site, which, how did I use an image of me as an IDF soldier with my, uh, with my rifle. And they've basically taken everything and gone through it as in are they 20? Am I trying to obtain weapons? I turned him, I go, the only weapons I have that I need in this tool is my microphone and my camera. That's all. And look, by the end of it, the FBI had cleared me, the FBI were laughing with me about it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       They actually said to me, I understand why you want to come and clear your name. Yeah, that's fine. They got they, they got it. They were actually really nice. Like I have no problem with them. I have no problem with that. With the uh, the border protection either. My problem here is that comedy central who have been ignoring all these had the time to go to the FBI. You know, they've gone out of their way to just silence at first online when all these people are uh, you know, responding back, asking him just to make a statement. They blocking people by the hundreds and then on top of that, when they hear them coming to the states, they literally contacted the FBI to try get them to stop me from coming on the, on the premise that I am coming there to violently assault somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       Okay. So going on the assumption you we're not here to violently assaulted and that the FBI was on board that and that they accepted what you were laying out, that you were just here to do interviews and that sort of thing. Obviously all true and Co and the fact that comedy central, I mean it really like, it shows some other layer of really perverse collusion between networks and the FBI. I mean, how insane is that? But they did catch you on, on a technicality related from years ago. So it's important. I think it's important to talk about. Otherwise people are going to think, Whoa, the FBI's in on some real conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       Right? So once that happened, it obviously triggered whatever process, the, uh, border protection hat, which is to go through everything within your visa, visa or visa waiver, whatever it is that you're coming in on. And what they found, we had a few, you know, it was over. The interrogation with the FBI was for about an hour. Then there was a couple of other, you know, interviews with the different border protection, um, with the highest levels in lax. And actually I'm not going to, boy won't hurt their, their jobs, but they were actually really good papers. I have no problem with them. And I believe in border protection and if somebody makes a mistake, like what I found. So what it turned out is two years ago when I filled out this visa waiver application on online, which I want to point out, I had come even seven months ago, the New York, um, I was, I, I'd been in the states, only sign these up from that same application.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       So there was no problem and it was an absolute technicality. So what they found is when you fill out these visa waiver forms online, there's a bunch of crazy questions and you know, you just like, um, I rate him out. No, no, no, I'm not a terrorist. I'm not this, I'm not a neo Nazi or not there to create balance. I've never been to just do, no, no, no, no. One of them happened to say, um, have you ever been denied a visa to the US? Now is about 15 years ago. Um, I came on a visa waiver and right after I got back to Australia, I applied for a visa. They thought that implied that I was trying to come there to live. So I was trying to immigrate to the u s and I got denied a visa. Now, I don't know, I don't even remember filling in the phone, so I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       But that happened. Um, and I said that openly to the uh, the, uh, the border protection officer. That technicality means that it makes the, the application void and now it means, so that was saying to me, look, you're not getting banned. There's nothing wrong. It's an accident. In fact, they, they said to me, if we, um, basically investigate the same way we did your scrutinize, every app, every person that comes here on a visa waiver, probably half of them will end up doing a mistake on that upper gudgeon. There'll be thrown out as well. Or are you going to do is go back to Australia and apply for a visa? He can't use the visa waiver program anymore. You've got to actually have a visa because you have been denied. Now just to remember that this is a technicality on a technicality because irony got refused the visa back then because I was trying to immigrate.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       Well in their minds it was the risk that I was trying to immigrate to the US. Now obviously when I was there seven months ago, I didn't immigrate to the u s so even that was wrong. Um, but I accept that this, listen, I have no, I have no problem with that. I'm here. I'm going to reapply and everything you're saying is true. I'm going to get in because I have no criminal record. I'm not, there's no reason for me not to get the visa. Um, my problem with it all is that practically on a practical level, comedy central got me kicked out even in the short term. Even in the short term, they managed to get me kicked out because the fact that they were able to go to the FBI and complain, they triggered this investigation. They got me out on a technicality that in their own words, most people, or at least half the people that come into the US would, um, would file as well.

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       Right. So the point here is, the point here is that seven months ago you got in with no problem and that comedy central then triggers this by contacting the FBI shows that they have some level of power even if the agents are going, yeah, this is nonsense. It was 15 years ago. And everyone knows when you're, when you're going, you know when you're landing in another country or you're filling out these things, sometimes they're written in very confusing ways where you almost think know me. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Um, I'm not even going to take that experience cause I've got a nice shirt. They printed it out for me. It was very clean. But there are so many questions that most of them are crazy. So you just kind of do, no, no, no, no, no, no. In the time, I wouldn't have lied about it for nothing because I, I would have thought if I'd seen that one that obviously they'll know if about being denied or not. It's there. It's their immigration. I can't believe that in pick it up automatically. Yeah. Yes. So that's exactly what's happened.

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       So have you, um, you know, this is a weird thing that I think the free speech crew is now confronted with where, you know, when we're the ones that are getting liable than slandered all the time and having reputations destroyed and having a media manipulated and, and video editing and all of these things, uh, it's a weird place for us to be the ones having to talk about legal remedies. But have you thought about this at all?

Speaker 1:          00:35:40       We are at the moment, yes. We've got a few things down on and a that we're working with. We're going to pop these from a few friends. Then my main objective more than anything is to get them to face up to what they've done and to respond and take responsibility over it because it is wrong. I don't care if you're from the left, if you from the right, I don't care to do that, to do what they've done. And further to add insult to injury to at every point that you have a chance to stand up and take that responsibility. Take and, and apologize not only to me apologize to your, to your fans. I've seen so many people on Jim Jeffrey, things that have actually said, I don't even like avi, I'm even like what he stands for. I don't agree with anything, but what you did is wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       At least give those, you know, do the right thing. And you know, when I was in the airport at the time, I was there always the time for about 15 hours. And the hardest part for me in that time is, besides being treated like a criminal, was the fact that it Sydney walks and we're sitting in, in the airport, lost in, you know, waiting for, we had a flat together to New York that she just sitting there not knowing what's going on. I kept asking a border protection if they were informing her. They said, yes, I've got one phone call. In fact, they were good. I actually got me two phone calls and, and, and he let me tweet and you said, don't tweet anything about me brother. Uh, but that, that, that will, that will nicely. But the fact is that, you know, I was sitting there going, is she all right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       You know, it's a, it's a foreign country. Might have American citizenship, but she's an Ozzie put friends from he here and we went into trouble together. We're not creamy. I'm suddenly being, the time she got questioned as well. She was also investigated, but they couldn't do anything. She's American. Um, so it was for her, since I've seen on her, you know, I didn't even really know everything. She went through tool. I watched her youtube summary of what Ha, what she gone through on that day. And it's, it's horrible and it's painful for me to watch it because it's all comes down to comedy central doing literally trying to silence us.

Speaker 2:          00:37:56       What's also crazy to me is the, the way that they don't know how this game will play out. It's like if they would've done, well first I'm doing the right thing, would've been not selectively editing, but okay, let's say they can't, they can't do it that way cause they're playing a certain game. Well then once you call them out on it, you just immediately, you know, we messed this one up, especially after the Christchurch thing where we're emotions were so high. It's coming off a horrific, horrific, horrific tragedy that you had taped this thing way before. I mean there was a way they could have gotten out. You know, we just, we just botched this one. That's it. But now they've got it to the point and that's why I wanted to do this with you. Where are the longer they let this stew? It's not just that at this point, you know, in a way, Jim Jeffrey should be fired or at least his, and I don't like calling for this kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:38:41       This is so not how I do this, but it's like his executive producer or whoever made those decisions should be fired. But the longer they go on, you're getting this to the place where you're gonna have to take out. Major executives are going to have to be fired because somebody is now making these decisions and the way these corporations work, it's going to be pretty obvious through emails and meetings. Who made the decisions to to throw you under the bus? Who made the decision to contact the FBI and I'm looking up, we're going to get there.

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       We're going to get to the bottom of all that. We are going to point out at the end of it, because I am persistent. Like I say, what's bothering me is that the mainstream media are not talking about and that he's obviously, like I said to you before we came on is that I believe they think it's a nonsteroidal. They're scared to report on it because suddenly the camera's going to be on them because they all do it. And that's why so important. I've been like, I feel grateful that people like you and there's been a few of them, phew. You know, alternative online media, people who actually have integrity, who have reported on it. And they're as outraged about it as I am. Look, I'm watching it from the slide, like not even in my, if I just saw that from the side, I would be disgusted because it is so wrong. And I like, even if it was somebody I absolutely disagree with, I would be in his room.

Speaker 2:          00:40:01       Well that's what I was saying to you before. It's like, it's the perfect storm of craziness. It's media manipulation. It's leftist insanity. It's dishonest hosts. It's all of these things at once. Do you remember, uh, about two months ago a alley Stucky who was actually on my show last week who's a conservative, a podcast here. She did a fake interview with, uh, Alexandria ocozzio Cortez where they just sliced alleys, questions with, you know, uh, I say shipping here. I did one lot that is similar and it's like Allie posted and it was so obvious that it was fake and it was so obvious that this is exactly what comedy central does all the time. And this is exactly what comes, you know, daily show and all these things do all have. But the media went bananas that it was the Conservatives spreading a fake interview to make AOC look ridiculous. And it's like, you guys do this to people on the right every single day that your number one motivation. I think that's pretty much the only person. You don't need a cut in meeting up to me. Yeah, exactly. She's doing a, she's doing a fine job. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:41:12       I don't have it. And they're all hypocrites. And look, I have, I'm telling you, I'll watch it. I actually thought within a day there would be mainstream media and there's been a couple that are going to Australia. There's a, uh, a for the Daily Telegraph and man called Tim Blake. He's written a few times about it, but you know, channel 10 years in Australia. They, they only wrote it in the

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       context of bum me being deported. In fact, it was, it was disgusting story at first. Then I called her out on Twitter and within two minutes she called me back and you know, she, she in her report, she actually wrote, we reached out to RB for comment with no response and it was like, um, I was in the tension. How the hell did you want me to respond? You know, they're just so full of it. Everything they do, they, this is one of the hallmarks of what they do. I've had this happened to me many times. They'll, they'll reach out for you to comment about a half hour before the article goes up. You can be at the freaking dentist, you could be walking your dog. But in our own, in our own report, she was reporting that I was in detention.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       How dumb do you think everyone is? They think people are pretty dumb and I hate to tell you, but I can already predict what's going to happen here. There'll be a couple of weeks, there'll be a couple of hit pieces about this. You'll be said, oh, they put you on all right, Ruben show. And, uh, but I mean the Jewish non Jewish Nazi in Australia. So I think you might be the one in for approval. That's fine. Listen, I've, I've taken the, uh, what do you think this says about the way this nonsense is spreading across borders? Because, uh, you know, as you know, I was on tour with Peterson for the last year and we went to a ton of countries, including about 10 stops. And the Australian shows were absolutely phenomenal. I mean, just the audiences were incredible. I just love you guys.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       Well, there was just such a zest for life and fun. I went out with audience members almost every night after the show. I just, I seriously just had a, had an absolute blast. Um, but, but what I'm amazed by right now, after the last year is that I've seen the way the world operates online and on Twitter and on Youtube. But then I've traveled the world and I've been to Sweden and to Denmark and you know, Canada and us and, and all and Ireland and all over the place. And the fact that there are people in all of these places that are, you know, thousands of miles away from each other thinking the same exact things. It's pretty powerful. And I think, I think that right there is what these guys fear more than anything else. That there actually is a worldwide push back against their nonsense. Are you feeling that?

Speaker 2:          00:43:54       Absolutely. And that's why they're shutting people down or they're trying to, you see, um, you know, personally I've been shot off Facebook for things that they can't even, they can't even back at they, you ask them for any evidence and they can't show you what it is exactly. And that's the way that they are trying to solve once you all these different organizations in the fact that the fact again that that within 24 hours a month, my video with my whole page, which again shows me that there is a collision there between comedy central and, and that's not some crazy conspiracy theory that that is just common sense though isn't easy. Um, dots to connect day. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Why do you think youtube left the video up? If a, if Facebook took it down, cause I'm sure we'll try it on youtube too.

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       I Dunno. Maybe it's earning of money. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why, but you know, Youtube I've found over the last year has been better. Um, then Facebook or they, you know, until they get pressured. W for example, my good friend Tommy Robinson, they proved his page on Facebook. Youtube actually defended keeping his channel up until a number of labor mps really bullied Facebook into, into, they will, they didn't want to backtrack. They defended this, this, as I said, he never breached their terms and conditions. So, um, then they backtrack once there was about two months of lobbying, I'll call it bullying, bullying by Labor MPs in the UK. And then suddenly they didn't want to say that Berlin. So they restricted, heavily restricted his channel. Um, youtube, I don't, I think unless there is some political been done so far, they see, I think they're starting to recognize that, um, you're gonna, you're running your business into the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       Facebook is running their business into the ground and you can see it even just in a shed, but it is a dying thing. We've all gone to telegram. We've gone to a lucky basically the whatsapp that's protected not by Facebook but by a Russian to Russian brothers and we're finding it fantastic. You know the, the, you get the response, you so much ready, you see the click throughs. It is absolutely unbelievable, but it is crazy that we're being forced to the other platforms that are meant to be messaging apps instead of using actual social media because these different organizations in different institutions have hold so much power.

Speaker 2:          00:46:22       Yeah. Wait, did you mean that you're, you're actually spreading your videos through telegram? I mean I know, I know it's a messaging APP, but you're saying you're building an actual audience there. I didn't even know that was a great

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       got, we've got, we've got a group, Tommy, Tommy Robinson use, we call it Tommy Robinson news and your members join like any page and you can, you can even embed likes and things that people can actually interact. It's a one way wall and you can link out, you can do it. It's so much better than, so you can put, we can literally upload videos there and say, okay, they're not letting us put videos on Facebook, but we'll upload it here with a little download button. We don't need our one page. You guys all have your own pages. You go upload and flood their, their um, different platforms with these content and it is so much more effective and I think that that is going to be the future, to be honest. It is. That is the future of social media. If they continue down this park, all of them are going to crash from the Twitter, youtube, Facebook, they're all going to crash unless they allow people to actually have a fake gun.

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       Is the perverse part of this? I always say that it's, you know, if they would just not be totally horrible, we would all have nothing to talk about. It's like if they were 30% horrible or like 50% horrible, we'd kind of complain every now and again and people would be like, ah, they're always complaining. But then they do these sorts of things. It's like you guys are, it's not that you're just going all the way horrible. It's not just that you selectively edit and you manipulate and you throw people under the bus and you try to just spread this chill effect so that, cause it's not about destroying you. Right. It's like they know, well, if we can destroy a hobby, it's like we can take out thousands of other people that will never speak up again. And it's like, man, if you guys would just not be all in on the bullshit, then we'd probably have other things to be talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       Yeah, look it. It absolutely is that the fact is I think they thought I was an easy target. They'll probably be like you. They didn't really know who I was. Um, they just knew, you know, if you look in Australia on probably the biggest name for alternative media here, none. That's not because I'm that great. You know, I think I am just that we don't have a big alternative media thing here. So I think they, they, they thought I'd be an easy target. And I totally underestimated the practice. I am not an idiot. And you know that, that today to fight back, he's not that hard because I think science needs to be, boy is actually, I think people are looking for the truth. It's kind of the Trump effect and the whole idea of fake news, you know, they, they said Trump, it's so nuts and he keeps going on about fake news and it's like they literally create fake news that is actually a thing. And anyone that's had anything to do with media will know that fake news is a real problem. And that's not to say Trump is the best guy in the world or on the most innocent person in the world. I've done my fair share of things. But the fact is that these in these organizations are corrupt, so corrupt, and they act like they are so much better than us. They hold the moral high ground when they are the biggest scam in the world. They are literally worse than the worst people. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       it's so strange. Guy tweeted something the other day about, it's like Trump for his orange skin and his hair plugs and the crazy way he speaks. It's like somehow despite all of that, he's more authentic than them. I mean that tells it right there. It's right. Like this guy looks fake. He doesn't look like a what a what a regular human being looks like. Like that's how fake he looks and the way he speaks the whole thing. And yet he can actually come off more authentic than these people because they're so polished and they got away with it for so long they don't even know how to, how to do it right anymore. I think it's the, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:17       I imagine on the Internet where, you know, look for that. When we saw something on TV, it was polished. It was perfect, and that's what we got. You know, if we seen something that was a little bit unpolished, it was kind of odd. That's rubbish. That's fine. Now we're in an age where, you know, Google hangouts, you can do a conversation from across the world. Even if they deport someone and you know, it's the content. It's the words, it's the, it's the substance. People are listening to, um, that nobody cares what Trump looks like. Nobody cares. Even though he's rough around the edges and he's not that articulate and either nobody cared because people are like, what's he saying? What's he telling me? What's he depending? What's he standing up for? What is Danny against? And I think that's what shines really. Like I'll personally, I see it in myself, I'll look at him and I go, I like that. And it's just a bonus. He triggers the people I don't like a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       Just so I have an idea here because there's no doubt that there are dozens. I have no doubt, dozens of comedy central employees and executives watching this right now sitting in their cubicles with their headphones, cause they don't want anyone to know that they're watching. But what I find is that over the course of this show, I have found people over the years, James Damore, Lindsay Shepherd, Bret Weinstein, people who have, you know, taken unpopular positions or, or basically stood up to the mob, I would say more than anything else. And they've survived. And you're obviously going to survive this, so why don't you talk directly to the comedy central employees right now, the executives who are going to have to make some decisions on that are we are, we are, we got about eight minutes left. I mean, let's tell them what to do. We got it that you want the apology, but, but if they're there, if they're in the belly of the beast, what do you think they should do?

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       Good. Hi Guys, my name's Avi. Can you probably recognize me from the last two weeks of headaches and sleepless nights? Um, do the right thing. You know, it'd be a person for once, you know, step back a second. I'm thinking about it because almost up person, you might not agree with my positions. You might not like what I have to say. You might, you might really this Walkman, but what you did was wrong. What you did was like, and you know, it's, if anything, hopefully you've learned something that hopefully you just turned around and looked in the mirror for a second and gone that that makes me a bad person. Like, if that was my idea or if I'm the editor, whoever it is. And now also Jim Jefferies, I've heard people say, um, you know, excusing in Jeffries, he's not the one that cuts it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       You know what he's, he's certainly seen the final cut is also, you know, had had to do the pieces to camera where he knew he was throwing me under the bus. Look at yourself for a second night. You were sitting there at the log in, you're my best, my, we did a photo op. Uh, you would show, you know, and there was, I walked out of that that day going maybe this is not going to end up the way I expected it to. Maybe you're actually going to be decent. And when I say decent by just representing the, you interviewed the person who blew half way around the freaking world to be a part of your little show just represented. You didn't do that. So now is your chance to do the right thing and don't even do it because you're scared of what's to come. And I promise you there's a lot to come, but do it because it is actually your chance to recognize what you did and there are millions around the world who are watching. If that's your incentive, then so be it. But if it makes you actually recognize an and become a bigger person out of it, then my job here is done.

Speaker 2:          00:54:04       Not Bad man. Some somebody heard that, I guarantee you. And that's all it takes is a little spark with some of these people to, to get the inertia going, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       Well they, you know, they, they often claim to be, to work from an emotional place. I'm speaking to them right now on an emotional level because, you know, I'm grateful I caught it. I could not imagine where I would be emotionally. Where would I be as a person emotionally if what was put out was just their version of the veins. No, well your career would be over basically. Not even in my career, my mental, I don't think there's anything worse then, um, you know, being blamed for something you didn't do. Um, knowing like, seeing what they produced and knowing the truth, me knowing only may not, I mean not being able to prove it to anyone. I couldn't imagine not just, I not consider myself a pretty strong person, uh, like mentally strong and I'd been through a lot in my lab. I don't know if I would have survived that and that, you know, they talk about, they often talk about people, you know, pushing people over the edge because how dare you criticize their religion or criticize ideas though, did say something against transgender or gay marriage because you're going to ruin people's psychology, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       What were you going to do to me? What were you going to do to another human being?

Speaker 3:          00:55:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       How long is it going to take you to get back into the states? Did they tell you once you fill out all this stuff,

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       the bad visa thing? And I've had a few great people reach out to me already. Uh, you know, from, I don't want to, um, highlighting are, but people who wield power in the US. So I don't think it's going to be too much of an issue and uh, as Ani would say, I'll be back.

Speaker 2:          00:56:04       Um, I think, I think we hit the main points here. Uh, hopefully. Yeah, hopefully this does a little something. I mean, just this, I will ask you one other thing actually before we wrap up. So I find that

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       I, am he just a, anyone knows anyone are you judging? May Not. Only for my action will for the way I'm stringing my sentences together now. It's 2:00 AM

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       all right. We got all right. You got to get to bed. So I'll just ask you one other thing then, which is where do you think, uh, you know, I know you're not going to view it this way because I asked this question to a lot of people and they never accept the premise, but where do you think the bravery comes from within you that you're willing to fight this? He could because everyone that I know that it stood up to the mob has survived and not only has survived has actually thrive, thrive yet. When I go out, when I go out to colleges, when I do speak in gigs, the number one thing I get from people is I'm afraid they're afraid to lose their job. They're afraid to lose family members, they afraid to lose friends, etc. Etc. So, so where do you think it comes from within you?

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       Uh, I honestly, I do not. I don't think of it as bravery running. Think of it as stupidity. Yep. I'll, I'll leave you with one story that pretty much sums it up for me. It actually, um, it's, it's kind of how I feel every day. We're not served in the Israeli army. I was in a, we, we were, um, we were ambushed. I had an Arab, it really good friend of mine, he's an Arab office, I Christian officer, and this just described exactly how I feel every single day. Um, and he says, so we were ambushed from in front and we were actually leaving the Gaza Strip from him from, from about five meters and treated as a pod terrorists and from behind where they were in long range artillery that were firing from two site. Now, there was about 18, probably in the class my gun, and it was an American and for um, I'm not gonna swear on these shows. I'm not gonna say

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       you can swear all you want

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       it jammed. So I was basically standing on the sea on these June, jumping from side to side, just dodging bullets. Now at the end of the, uh, the, the chocolate had come and I thought that was the game, that night logo. I don't really believe in God really. I'm a proud Jew, but that's a separate story.

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       That's a whole other show

Speaker 1:          00:58:22       that not, I was praying to God. And then when I heard that helicopter come in, the United started firing and finally things had settled and two of my friends had been hit. Um, the, I was a marksman. Now there's two marks means in every class when you go into combat, the monument at the front, there's one at the front and one in the, in the middle. The management at the front was hit. So my officer who didn't know my gun had jammed, had called me, said Avi, because you've got to go around to the, to the bodies to make sure, because obviously a, a lot of time they detonate as you will buy or whatever it is. So just to make sure the buddies and that they're actually dead. Um, and he calls me over and this is my answer to you as you, as we're walking around to the body, it due to the body as I've said to the officer, um, the Mike, just so you know, I have no gun.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       I had the scopes. The reason why they take the margin is because I had the night vision and all that. I, um, I come Ron and I, and coming around and it's just me and him is I said to him, I have no gun cause what do you mean you have no gun? I said to him, my gun is jammed and he's an Arab. Say he starts cursing me in Arabic and telling me to get back to the line of what now, after all that, and we got out, he tilled today. Thinks I deserve a medal for that stupidity and I can't convince him. I've said to him, and I'm telling you genuinely, I have never been more shit scared in my life. I think I actually crapped myself that night, but he was the aura and it was just not, the job needs to be done. And that's what I feel like. Um, you know, so often now I don't know what I'm going into. I don't know if, you know, if you tell me to go back to the days where I just own gyms and just focused on, you know, my life, then would I go back? It's a tough question. I don't want to think about it because some days, some days you're in battles that you feel are overwhelming, but if I don't do it, who will?

Speaker 2:          01:00:27       I think the moral of the story is everyone should have an Arab Christian yelling at them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       Uh, he, he was, he's a legend.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       Yes. Listen, I hope, I hope we've moved the dial for you a little bit here. I look forward to getting into the state so that you can sit in the seat right across from me and I can shake your hand and good luck with everything. And A, and Jeffery's, you're welcome here too. I'll gladly be a peacemaker. We got an extra chair, so let's see if we can do that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       I reckon we should sit together, have a coffee and talk this one out. Hey Jimmy. Boy, we'll have a foresters. Have a good night. [inaudible] you been seeing those names, but uh, I've seen him. I've seen him yet. All right.
