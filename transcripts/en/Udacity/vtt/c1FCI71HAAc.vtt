A surface is a container for
your content and provides grouping and

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:05.619
separation from other elements, but

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:09.350
there are other lighter weight ways
to visually group the content.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.590
So when should you create a surface?

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.040
Let's look at an example.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.760
Here, we have a surface for the app
bar and a surface for each list item.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.170
The issue here is that the surfaces
act as a kind of cognitive speed bump.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.540
While it's useful to visually separate
the app bar from the content,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.210
placing each item on
an individual surface

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.780
lowers your speed in
scanning down the list.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.080
A much cleaner approach is to simply
draw the content on a single service

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.660
using a subtle separator.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.570
Conversely, in this example, placing
each of these very different items onto

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.670
their own separate surface let's you
visually process each one individually.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.870
A good rule of thumb is if content
is homogeneous, when scanning and

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.700
comparison will be important, then it
likely belongs on a single surface.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.070
If you need to present a collection
of heterogeneous items,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.030
then individual surfaces
are appropriate.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.510
Directing attention is
a powerful technique, but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810
needs to be used judiciously.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.230
Having too many separate surfaces on
a screen at once can be distracting.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.190
As a very rough rule of thumb,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.490
try not to have more than around
five surfaces on the screen at once.
