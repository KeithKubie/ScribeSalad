Craig: Hello, I'm Craig, and this is Crash
Course Government and Politics, and today

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.090
we're gonna look at the Supreme Court from
a different angle. We're gonna try to get

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.320
inside the justices' heads. Bwahahahahah!

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.799
Not literally, obviously, but we're gonna
look at the factors that influence the way

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.639
they decide cases, other than the structure
of the court system. So we're pretty far away

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.560
from the Constitution here and straddling the nebulous
world of government, politics, and dare I say it, history.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.460
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.480
Justices, especially on the Supreme Court,
are supposed to be independent, but that doesn't

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.500
mean they make their decisions in a vacuum. They
make them in an office, just like most people who work.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.440
More importantly, they're influenced by a number
of factors other than the case that's in front of them.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.829
In terms of their role in government, justices
might be influenced by Congress, because they

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.300
know that, unless the case involves the Constitution
directly, congress can respond to a decision

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000
overturning a law by passing a new law.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.969
Once justices have been selected and confirmed,
the President has minimal effect on judicial

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.640
decisions although he's somewhat influential
on lower court justices who might one day

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.840
want to be on the Supreme Court. So you lower
court justices, you be nice to that prezzy, OK?

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.520
Knowing that the President get to make the
call on who gets to be a justice with the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.490
help of the Senate of course, federal judges
are more likely to make rulings that are more

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.220
likely to get them considered for the court.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.740
Since the president only serves eight years
maximum, though, it's hard for judges to know

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.350
who will be President when a vacancy in the
court opens up, so the President isn't much

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.229
of a factor. Much more influential on justices
is history, which works in two ways. First,

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.490
the principles of precedent and stare decisis
constrain the possible decisions that justices

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.490
can make. Second, and more historical in the
sense we think of history, justices know that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.520
their decisions will be studied by generations
of historians, and lawyers, and YouTube viewers,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.509
and they are very well aware that some decisions,
like Dred Scott, Brown V. Board, and Roe V.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.689
Wade, can have an enormous impact on American
history. And now the historical stakes are

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.659
even higher, because they know that their
decisions will be talked about by a bearded

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.250
balding man on YouTube forever.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.579
Judges may behave strategically and consider
the way that their decisions will be implemented

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.450
by the executive branch or how a part of one
decision will lay the foundation for a change

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.200
in the law in a decision later. Although it
isn't supposed to matter, judges are influenced

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.180
by their political ideology, whether they're
liberal or conservative or possibly by their

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.950
party affiliation, whether they're Democrats
or Republicans or the Tea Party or the Green

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.990
Party or they're party animals, like Ruth
Bader Ginsberg. Party affiliation and political

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.970
ideology are certainly important in the selection
process -- it's pretty rare that a Democratic

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.840
president selects a Republican judge to be
on the Supreme Court, especially these days,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.910
although sometimes it happens that a justice
turns out to be more or less conservative

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.550
or liberal than the president thought. Former
Justice David Souter is a good example of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.330
a judge appointed by a Republican who turned
out to be much more to the liking of Democrats.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.380
Finally, and perhaps most important, judges
are influenced by their philosophical orientation,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.300
by this I mean their judicial philosophy,
not whether they're existentialists or logical

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.260
positivists. While I'm sure that there are
many judicial philosophies out there, the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.840
two which matter most, at least in terms of
the way commentators talk about the Court,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.670
are judicial activism and judicial restraint.
Let's not show any restraint in actively going

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.690
to the Thought Bubble right now.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.170
Judicial activism is the idea that the Court
should act as an instrument of policy, making

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.530
it much more like the other two branches of
government. Judicial activists tend to look

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.070
beyond the text of the Constitution and statutes,
instead choose to consider the broader social

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.200
implications of the decisions they render.
Activist judges are supposedly eager to overturn

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.290
Congressional legislation to further their
policy goals, and they're often accused by

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.490
opponents of making law from the bench. Judicial
activism is often associated with liberal

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.970
or Democratic justices, but it's not that
simple.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.580
Judicial restraint, as the name implies, is
the idea that judges should pay close attention

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.720
to the precedent when they make their decisions,
and that any changes that they make to the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.750
law should be incremental. They are the judicial
tortoises to the activist hares. Judicial

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.620
restraint is sometimes confused with originalism,
the idea that any new law should be interpreted

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.880
in the light of the Constitution as it was
written in 1787. Basically a 'What Would James

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.600
Madison Do?' orientation. Although advocates
of judicial restraint often rely on the Constitution's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.110
text, it's later precedent that restrains
them more than the Constitution does. Judicial

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.750
restraint is often equated with conservatism,
which makes sense, as conservatives generally

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.270
are against change, but as with judicial activism,
the equivalence isn't perfect.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.880
The two different philosophies are each associated
with different historical moments. The high

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.830
tide of judicial activism occurred between
the 50s and the mid-70s, when Earl Warren

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.620
and Warren Burger were the Chief Justices.
During this time, the Court made important

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.940
decisions: expanding civil rights, voting
rights, the right to privacy, and the rights

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.870
of people accused of crimes. From the 1980s
through the early 2000s, the Court led by

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.040
William Rehnquist was known for its judicial
restraint, dialing back civil rights, affirmative

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.690
action, and desegregation programs and attempting
to rein in the power of the national government

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.420
and devolve some power back to the states.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.150
So a minute ago, I said that activism wasn't
the same as political liberalism and restraint

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.730
wasn't the same as conservatism. Let me try
to explain what I meant. Mainly, the issue

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.480
here is the claim that conservative justices
practice judicial restraint. If you've been

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.530
paying attention to the Court recently, you'll
see that this isn't always the case. The current

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.620
Supreme Court led by Chief Justice John Roberts
has five generally conservative justices and

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.410
four that are usually considered liberal.
The conservatives were all appointed by Republican

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.750
presidents and the liberals by Democratic
presidents. These conservative justices have

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.600
been pretty activist in some of their decisions,
however. For example, the Citizens United

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.210
case broke with previous precedent and allowed
much more campaign fundraising than prior

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.910
court decisions had, which is something that
political conservatives wanted. Recently,

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.530
the Roberts court invalidated parts of the
Voting Rights Act, which had been passed originally

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.620
in 1965 and renewed by Congress in 2010. Here's
why this is problematic: one of the core tenets

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.940
of judicial restraint is that courts are not
supposed to overturn the decisions of a democratically-elected

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.690
Congress in order to make policy, unless Congress
has passed laws that are clearly unconstitutional.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.120
It can work the other way, too. While the
Warren court was generally pretty activist

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.340
and stocked with politically liberal justices,
Justice Breyer, who's usually considered politically

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.530
liberal and was appointed by a Democrat, believes
that judicial change should be incremental

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.510
and doesn't want to make decisions that will cause
sweeping changes. So he's exercising judicial restraint.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.880
So, I'm going to stop here, otherwise we're
going to fall into the trap of talking politics,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.390
and I don't want to do that with him around,
'cause he's always trying to sue American

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.840
Eagle Apparel for violating his right of publicity,
and I think it's fine, they've had that trademark

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.140
for quite some time! I'm sorry, but you don't
really have those rights, you're not human

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.700
or even a real eagle. So let me just remind you of
a few things in attempt to be as clear as possible.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.580
First, judicial philosophy is not the same
thing as political ideology, even though the

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.430
media, especially the television media, likes
to say they are. Judicial philosophy refers

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.000
to activism and restraint, while political
ideology refers to liberalism or conservatism.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.220
It's possible to be both politically conservative
and judicially activist, and vice versa.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.740
Second, there's lots of factors that influence the
way judges make decisions, and the judges

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.210
rarely let you know which one is at work.
Whenever you look at a Court decision, which

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.490
we're gonna do soon, think about which factors
went into that decision, especially in the

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.300
way that Congress and the Executive will react
to it. Remember, despite what you may hear,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.920
all decisions are highly political, except the decision to
end this video. Thanks for watching; see you next week.
