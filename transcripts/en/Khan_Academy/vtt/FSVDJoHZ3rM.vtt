00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.849
- [Instructor] Nadia wants to
create a confidence interval

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:06.159
to estimate the mean driving range

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:08.507
for her company's new electric vehicle.

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:10.984
She wants the margin of error to be no

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:15.151
more than 10 kilometers at
a 90% level of confidence.

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:19.097
A pilot study suggests
that the driving ranges for

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:20.980
this type of vehicle have a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.980
standard deviation of 15 kilometers.

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:27.635
Which of these is the smallest approximate

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:31.802
sample size required to obtain
the desired margin of error?

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.825
So pause this video and see
if you can think about this

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:36.825
on your own.

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:39.880
So the traditional way that we

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.639
would construct a margin of
error at a confidence interval

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:47.806
we take a sample and from that
sample, we construct the mean

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.413
and then we add or subtract a
margin of error around that to

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:55.494
construct the confidence interval.

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:56.442
And the way we've done

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:59.676
that since we're dealing
with means is we say alright,

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:02.974
if we don't know the standard
deviation of the population,

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:06.499
it's appropriate to use the T statistic.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.704
So, our critical value we
denote as t star and you'd

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:13.942
multiply that by that times
the sample standard deviation

00:01:13.942 --> 00:01:17.859
divided by the square
root of your sample size.

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:23.096
Now, this question is all
about what is an appropriate

00:01:23.096 --> 00:01:25.443
sample size, given that we wanna

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:28.204
have a 90% level of confidence.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.270
And what's tricky here is,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.658
when you're using a t
table right over here,

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.785
not only do you need to know
the 90% level of confidence,

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.709
you also need to know
the degrees of freedom.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.097
And the degrees of freedom
is gonna be n minus one.

00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:43.036
But we don't know what that's
gonna be without knowing n

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.069
so how would we determine an n?

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.528
Similarly, you don't know
what your sample standard

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:49.151
deviation is going to be until you

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:51.098
actually take some samples.

00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:54.078
So instead of that, what
we could think about

00:01:54.078 --> 00:01:56.920
we know that another
legitimate way to construct a

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.486
confidence interval
and the margin of error

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:02.859
is to say, alright I
can take my sample mean

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.109
and I can add or subtract a

00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:09.365
Z score a critical value at
this time using a z table,

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:13.263
where if I multiply that
times the true population

00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:17.430
standard deviation and divide
that by the square root of n.

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:20.476
Now, you might say well I don't know

00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:22.079
the true population standard deviation.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.960
But they tell us a pilot study
suggests that the driving

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.148
ranges for this type of
vehicle have a standard

00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:29.014
deviation of 15 kilometers.

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.770
So we could use this as an estimate

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.607
of our true population standard deviation.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:37.195
So this is 15 kilometers right over here.

00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:39.602
And then the good thing about a z table is

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:41.892
you don't have to think
about degrees of freedom.

00:02:41.892 --> 00:02:44.407
You could just look up
your confidence interval.

00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:46.438
And so then we could just say,

00:02:46.438 --> 00:02:49.521
that look, z star times 15 kilometers

00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:53.659
over our square root of n,

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.241
this right over here
is our margin of error.

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.281
This right over here
is our margin of error,

00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:01.072
that has to be no more than 10 kilometers.

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:04.655
So that has to be less
than or equal to 10.

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:08.716
And we can figure out what
z star needs to be for a 90%

00:03:08.716 --> 00:03:11.351
confidence level and then
so we just solve for n.

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.601
So let's do that.

00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:15.694
Now, do figure out z star
I could use the z table but

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:18.127
just for a diversity of methodology

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:20.639
let's use a calculator here.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.730
So to figure out the z
value that would give us

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.807
a 90% confidence interval I can

00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:27.915
use a function called inverse norm.

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:30.550
And you can see that right
over here, that's choice three.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.383
Let me just select that.

00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:33.991
And what it'll do is,

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:37.264
you give it the area that
you want under normal curve.

00:03:37.264 --> 00:03:39.910
You can even specify the mean
and the standard deviation.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.897
Although you want the mean
to be zero and the standard

00:03:41.897 --> 00:03:44.263
deviation to be one if you
really want to figure out

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:45.513
a z score here.

00:03:46.697 --> 00:03:49.463
And so it'll do is, it will
give you the z score that

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.635
will give you that corresponding area.

00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:53.433
And so I want and actually it's already

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:57.999
selected that I want the
center area to be 90%.

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.832
So I could say .9 right over here.

00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:05.113
If I use the left tail then
that means if I have 90%

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:07.558
of the center that means I
would have a 5% of either tail.

00:04:07.558 --> 00:04:09.479
So instead of doing it .9 in center

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.402
I could've done .05 and
used the left tail or used

00:04:13.402 --> 00:04:15.853
.05 and used the right tail.

00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:17.966
But this is exactly what I want.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.966
So let me just go and paste this.

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:25.133
And so this should give me
the appropriate z value.

00:04:27.147 --> 00:04:28.234
So there you go.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.552
If I want this middle 90%,

00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:33.847
the center 90%, I have to go one point,

00:04:33.847 --> 00:04:37.630
roughly 1.645 standard deviations below

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.673
the mean and that same
amount above the mean.

00:04:39.673 --> 00:04:42.652
So it's roughly our critical
value here is approximately

00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:44.819
1.6, let's just say 1.645.

00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:48.501
So we have

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:50.982
1.645 times times

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:57.746
15 over the square root of n

00:04:57.746 --> 00:05:00.748
is going to be less than or equal to 10.

00:05:00.748 --> 00:05:03.462
And so now there's a couple of
ways that you could do this.

00:05:03.462 --> 00:05:05.501
We could do a little bit
of algebra to simplify

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:07.627
this inequality and I
encourage you to do so

00:05:07.627 --> 00:05:09.516
or you could even try out some values here

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:12.743
and see which of these
ends would make this true

00:05:12.743 --> 00:05:15.195
and we want the smallest possible one.

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:16.853
I'll do it the algebraic way because

00:05:16.853 --> 00:05:18.641
if you're actually doing
this in the real world

00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:21.068
Nadia would not have a multiple
choice right over here.

00:05:21.068 --> 00:05:22.782
She'd have to figure out the sample size

00:05:22.782 --> 00:05:24.436
in order to conduct her study.

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:26.533
So let's do that.

00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:27.517
So let's see.

00:05:27.517 --> 00:05:30.684
If I divide both sides by 1.645 and 15

00:05:32.908 --> 00:05:33.819
what do I get?

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.942
I get one over the square root of n

00:05:36.942 --> 00:05:38.942
is less than or equal to

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.214
10 over 1.645

00:05:45.854 --> 00:05:47.021
over, over 15.

00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:53.116
And if I take the reciprocal
of both sides I get

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:56.352
the square root of n is
greater than or equal to,

00:05:56.352 --> 00:05:58.149
if I'm taking the
reciprocal of both sides,

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.316
and so this is going to be

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:02.127
1.645,

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.840
times 15 times 15.

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:11.085
All of that over 10.

00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:13.018
All of that over 10.

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:15.139
See 15 over 10 is just 1.5 so let me just

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.706
write that as 1.5 right over here.

00:06:17.706 --> 00:06:21.955
And then if I square both
sides I would get that n

00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:24.955
needs to be greater than or equal to

00:06:25.884 --> 00:06:27.051
1.645 times...

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.283
Times 1.5.

00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:34.342
And then all of that squared.

00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:35.755
I just squared both sides.

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:36.911
All of that squared.

00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:38.807
And so let's get our calculator back.

00:06:38.807 --> 00:06:41.474
We are going to have 1.645 times

00:06:44.548 --> 00:06:48.465
1.5 and then we want to
square it and we get 6.

00:06:50.414 --> 00:06:52.664
Approximately 6.0,

00:06:52.664 --> 00:06:53.497
6.09.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.920
So n has to be greater
than or equal to 6.09.

00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:02.909
And of course our sample
size needs to actually

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:04.274
be a whole number.

00:07:04.274 --> 00:07:06.299
So what's the smallest whole number that

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:08.250
is larger than 6.09?

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.368
Well that's going to be seven.

00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:12.936
So that would be this
choice right over here.

00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:15.199
This is the smallest
approximate sample size

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.015
required to obtain the
desired margin of error.

00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:21.095
And of course we won't
really really know until we

00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:23.282
actually conduct the study.

00:07:23.282 --> 00:07:25.223
We obviously here use an estimate of the

00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:28.307
population standard deviation.

00:07:28.307 --> 00:07:32.307
And we used a z table but
it will be interesting

00:07:33.372 --> 00:07:35.285
when Nadia actually conducts
the study to see if her

00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:38.997
margin of error is indeed
no more than 10 kilometers

00:07:38.997 --> 00:07:41.493
with a 90% level of confidence.
