know that that was not in Antarctica so

it's<00:52:11.170><c> the</c><00:52:11.290><c> geometry</c><00:52:12.130><c> of</c><00:52:12.160><c> the</c><00:52:12.490><c> of</c><00:52:12.910><c> the</c><00:52:13.240><c> orbits</c>

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:13.660 align:start position:0%
it's the geometry of the of the orbits

all<00:52:14.080><c> right</c><00:52:14.290><c> so</c><00:52:14.440><c> as</c><00:52:14.560><c> I</c><00:52:14.710><c> said</c><00:52:14.980><c> that</c><00:52:15.220><c> does</c>

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:15.460 align:start position:0%
