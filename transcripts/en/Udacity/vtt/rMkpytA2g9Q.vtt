00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.319
Remember that the numerator of the f statistic is the between subjects

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.922
variability. Because as that increases, the f statistic will also increase. And

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:16.091
that means we're more likely to reject the null. And the denominator is the

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:21.538
within subject variability. If we divide them, we get 15.72. Good job.
