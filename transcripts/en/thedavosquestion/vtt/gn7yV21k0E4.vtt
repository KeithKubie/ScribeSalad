Muhammad: Yeah, it's very important in our
work.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.439
We have been working with women, working with
children, we are working with girls.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.730
When we started, we encouraged families to
send their children to school, making sure

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.519
everybody went to school, girls are not left
behind.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:22.390
As a result, we could achieve that 100% of
went to school.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.550
Today we have seven and a half million [inaudible]
all over the country in Bangladesh.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.190
And all their children are in school, and
we give them a scholarship, those who are

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.210
top performers.
And we reserve half of the scholarships for

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.760
the girls, and the other half is open for
both girls and boys.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.140
As a result, 65% to 70% of the scholarships
go to girls because we see a tremendous impact

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.770
in the family and the person's life, in the
future of the girl.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.350
And now we have created health -- we are in
the process of bringing healthcare where women

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.360
and children and adolescent girls will be
the focus.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.670
Because it's very important if you can build
up the health of the women and the children

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.750
and adolescent girls, that changes the whole
scenario of the ill-health and malnutrition

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.690
and so on.
So this we want to do it.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.479
In a way those who are the victim of the neglect
of healthcare, the real victims are again

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.511
the mother of the children and the adolescent
girls.

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:26.840
We'll be using the mothers and the adolescent
girls to be at the forefront of delivering

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.890
this service, so that those who are the sufferers,
they'll be the deliverers.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.759
So this is not the professional people coming
from outside telling you what to do, they

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.369
themselves will be -- since they are the sufferers
they understand those issues so they will

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.310
be doing that.
So this is what we're looking forward to redesign

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.020
the entire healthcare system in Bangladesh.
In the same way that we have done the redesigning

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.070
of the financial system to come to the poor
people, particularly poor women.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.689
And it will be a social business so that it
covers its cost like we did with the financial

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.140
services.
And that's what we are looking for.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.570
I think we'll succeed.
Even the technology of it, the technology

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.079
of delivering healthcare is now possible because
amazing technology is waiting.

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.469
So the doctor doesn't have to come in physical
contact with the patients anymore, we can

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.359
make the contact possible through information
technology.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.970
Like just now I am talking to you, using same
technology, and doctors can be doing the same

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.829
kind of thing, using information technology,
bringing all the health services to all the

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.599
people in the country.
Thank you very much
