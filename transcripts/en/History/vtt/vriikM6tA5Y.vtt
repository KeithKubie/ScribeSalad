COREY: Hey, how's it going, man?
JOHN: OK.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:02.830
How are you?
- Good.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.210
What do we got?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.830
I got something you're
not going to believe.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.620
I've got a plaster impression
of Joe DiMaggio's feet,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.670
and I've got them right here.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.670
COREY: OK.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.120
So Joe DiMaggio's feet, huh?

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.790
JOHN: Joe DiMaggio's feet.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.170
That's a bad case
of athlete's foot.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.380
[laughing]

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.540
I came down to the pawn shop to
sell a plaster cast impression

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.420
of Joe DiMaggio's feet that
were credited with saving

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.080
his baseball career.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm a fan of Joe DiMaggio
because he was an amazing guy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.670
I'm looking for $10,000.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.580
That seemed to be a very recent
price, considering the, uh,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.170
uniqueness and
historical significance.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.830
COREY: Tell me the
story behind it

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.830
here, because it's kind of
weird that you have his feet.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.880
JOHN: My uncle was
his foot doctor,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.580
and he created these casts
to develop inserts for Joe

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.750
DiMaggio's baseball
shoes that would

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.500
relieve the bone
spurs that almost

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.250
ended Joe DiMaggio's career.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.620
COREY: Now, was this
before the streak or after?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.080
JOHN: This is after the streak.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.790
CHUMLEE: What streak
are you talking about?

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.380
Joe DiMaggio-- I mean, it's
considered one of the last,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.290
like, unbreakable
records there is.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.540
I mean, he went,
uh, 56 games and got

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.120
a hit in every single game.
CHUMLEE: Wow.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.460
That's impressive.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.790
COREY: During the
course of that streak,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.790
his batting average
was, like, over .400.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.580
I mean, the guy was one of
the best baseball players

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.290
to ever live.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.540
DiMaggio helped the Yankees
win nine World Series titles,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.620
and in 1955 he was elected
to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.250
The man is a true
baseball legend.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.750
Do you mind if I
take a look at them?

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.120
JOHN: No, go ahead.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.960
COREY: Now is that supposed
to be his signature there?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.420
JOHN: That is his signature.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.960
COREY: OK.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.170
How much do you want for them?

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.330
JOHN: I'm looking
to get $10,000.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.790
COREY: OK.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.000
Um, I just never even
heard of plaster casts

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.920
of some guy's feet before.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.500
I just don't know what
they could be worth, man.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.250
I'll tell you what.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.460
Let me have a buddy of mine come
down and take a look at them

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.750
for me.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420
Because the problem
with one-of-a-kind

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.580
items is sometimes they're
only worth money to one person.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.620
[laughs]
- OK.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.670
Great.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.330
I'll be right back, all right?

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.960
JOHN: Thanks.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.120
I welcome expert opinion
because I've done my research,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.830
and it would be disappointing if
he believed the value of these

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.170
were less than my asking price.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.830
That would be disappointing.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.460
COREY: The guy was a legend.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.120
And I know there's a huge
market for his memorabilia,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.920
but this is such
an unusual item,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.960
I have no idea what it's worth.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.790
So I called Jeremy in to
come down and check it out.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.290
JEREMY: Yeah, I got to say, man.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.540
In all the years you guys
have been calling me in,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.790
I've seen some
extraordinary things,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.170
but this is by far the wildest.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.830
It's not every day
that you see plaster

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.540
molds of arguably the best
player during his generation.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.880
When he joined the New
York Yankees in 1936,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.380
you know, he batted
right behind Lou Gehrig.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.880
And, you know, right
away he just made such

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.540
a big impact with the club.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.040
Maybe next to Willie Mays,
he's the best center fielder

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.380
in the history of baseball.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.960
Joe DiMaggio is one of
those few names that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.830
has really transcended
generations, along

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.330
with Mickey Mantle, Babe Ruth.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.380
He was a 13-time
all-star, won nine

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.040
World Series
championships, and only

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.960
Yogi Berra has more than him.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.540
COREY: So what do you think?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.750
Well, when Joe joined the
Yankees, he had bad knees.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.500
And then over his career,
just after he achieved so much

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.210
stardom on and off
the field between,

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.920
you know, knocking in
runs for the Yankees

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.000
and winning championships to,
you know, marrying, you know,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.250
a Hollywood goddess,
Marilyn Monroe, you know,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.920
every single thing that Joe
did was known by the public.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.380
Late in his career, his
feet were a big problem.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.920
And, um, ultimately
a lot of people

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.880
think that it was his feet
that caused him to retire

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.420
following the 1951 season.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.250
COREY: OK.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.750
Here's my big thing.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.750
I-- it's a weird item for me.
JEREMY: No doubt.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.830
COREY: Um, what do you
think they're worth?

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.420
JEREMY: Well, we're dealing
here with two elements.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.250
I mean, first of all,
we have plaster molds

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.000
of arguably one of the
best center fielders

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.750
in the history of baseball.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.500
And then the second element we
have is the actual autograph.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.330
It's actually personalized
to your uncle,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.830
"Your pal, Joe DiMaggio."

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.380
OK.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.620
So I mean, these are
obviously, without a doubt,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.580
a one-of-a-kind
piece here, and there

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.790
is no shortage of
people collecting

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.250
Joe DiMaggio items out there.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.880
Plus, his feet were a
big part of his success.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.250
Uh, compared to
other DiMaggio items,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.750
I would put the value at
around $3,000 to $5,000 bucks.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.420
COREY: Well, Jeremy, I
appreciate you coming down,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.790
man.
- Absolutely, Corey.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.960
Good to see you, Chum.
- All right.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.540
See you, man.
- Good luck to you.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.120
Great.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.790
Thank you.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.460
You bet.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.210
The value of this item is really
tricky since it's not only

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.960
a one-of-a-kind item, but it's
a very unique item in the fact

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.790
that it's a plaster
mold, which is something

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.290
that collectors never ask for.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.750
COREY: So you heard my guy.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.250
He said, you know,
between $3,000 and $5,000.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.420
Not near what you're
actually looking for.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.880
You still interested?

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.000
Uh, not at that price, no.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.250
COREY: Um, no matter what I
pay for this, it's speculation.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.580
I'm guessing that
I'm going to be

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.830
able to make money
on it one day,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.670
but I really don't
have any idea.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.920
So I mean, for me to make
an offer at this point

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.670
is just kind of ludicrous.
You know?

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.080
OK.
COREY: All right?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.250
Understood.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.170
Appreciate you
coming down, man.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.750
JOHN: Great.
Thank you.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.170
You know, I have a different
view regarding the value

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.670
of the item, but
it is disappointing

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.670
that it was substantially
below the price

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.670
that we're looking for.
