♪ ♪

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.273
(cheering and applause)

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:09.075
All right.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.577
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Uh...

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.048
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm gonna be doing,

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.383
uh, some magic.
So I have some witnesses here

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.718
to, uh, keep me honest.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.387
-(cheering and applause)
-Uh, thank you, witnesses.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.790
And, uh, now...
Oh, I have to mention,

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.392
the last time we did this,
there was some, um...

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:29.996
(sighs) so-called... It's
called black reacting. Um...

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.398
Look, for those of you
that don't know what that is,

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.401
well, black people
are a bit suspect of magic,

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.805
and they tend to, what
scientists call, black react.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.807
Okay? This is a true term.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.443
Uh, here's an example of it
happening to David Blaine.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.445
-(laughter)
-Open.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.415
-Open it.
-(shouting, laughter)

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:52.552
It's true. What happened?

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.887
Okay, so this time,
I'm giving you fair warning.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.889
You guys black reacted
last time. But this time,

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.892
-remain calm, okay? -All right.
-Okay. -Okay, okay. No problem.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:02.829
-I do not actually have magical
powers, okay? -Okay. All right.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.164
This is only a demonstration. No
need to be alarmed, all right?

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.833
-We got you. We got it,
we got it. -Okay. -Yeah.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.835
-We're just gonna be calm.
-That's us. That's us, man.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.503
Okay. All right. Okay, guys,

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:13.439
let's imagine, uh,
these aces represent actors.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.843
Okay? Uh, I'm gonna show
you guys the power of focus.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.444
-Rory, can you hold out
your, uh... -Yeah, of course.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.646
your hand there? Okay.
Uh, I'm just gonna ask you

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.515
a couple questions, Rory.
They're very simple, okay?

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:25.184
-What is the color of this ace?
-Uh, it's black.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.386
Wrong. African-American. That's
okay, Rory. Take your time.

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.522
-Sorry. I'm sorry. -It's okay.
It's my fault. My fault.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.791
I know. It's my fault.
I should have been more clear.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.994
Okay, what is the... what
is the suit of this card, Rory?

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:36.796
And keep in mind I'm just
a little sensitive right now,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.531
so I'd be care...
No, it's a joke. It's a joke.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.199
It's a horrible joke.
It's a horrible joke.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:41.667
Okay, Rory, but here's
the trick question.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.669
Here's the trick question, Rory.
Which ace

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.139
should be on top? The ace
of spades or the ace of clubs?

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.074
It's a trick question.
Which ace should be on top,

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.276
-the ace of spades or the ace
of clubs? -Ace of clubs.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:54.147
Okay. See, you're really focused

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.149
on black right now, aren't you?

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.684
-Yeah. Yeah, I... Yeah.
-I know. That's why it's...

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:01.621
-But, see, the Academy isn't.
-No! -(indistinct shouting)

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.623
-What the (bleep)?! -Guys...
-(indistinct shouting)

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.692
Guys... Guys, no...
What are you doing?

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.162
Get the (bleep) out of here!
Get the (bleep) out of here!

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.230
-Stop it. Guys.
-Get the (bleep) out of here!

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:13.699
-Okay, guys, calm down. Calm
down. -What the (bleep) is that?

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.768
-You don't need to react... It's
not real magic. -What happened,

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.304
-Rory?! What the (bleep)?! Get
out of here! -It's just a trick.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.640
-Come on! Get the (bleep) out
of here! -Mike. Okay. Mike...

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.441
Guys... Mike...

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.911
This-this is a rare strain
of black reacting.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.313
He's the... he's the
aggressive insulter. It'll pass.

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.515
-No, no, no! You're a (bleep)
witch, Larry! -No. Calm down,

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:31.250
-Mike. Mike, calm down. It's me.
-No, you're a witch! No,

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:33.586
-listen... -It's Larry. It's
Larry. It's Larry. It's Larry.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.589
-It's me. No, no. It's Larry.
It's me, Mike. -But it was r...

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.925
It's okay. It's okay. Yeah.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.327
-Okay. Good? Okay. All right.
-All right. Okay. Okay.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.796
-He's good. Yeah. -I'm just
saying, it was black and then...

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.399
-I know. I know. Okay.
It's okay. -Okay. -Whew.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.401
-Okay, are we all back?
Okay. Okay. -Can I... 

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.270
-Yeah. I think so. We tried,
but... -We got it, we got it.

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:53.005
-Are you guys gonna be...
Can I do this? -Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:55.341
-You're gonna be okay?
You're not gonna react? -Yeah.

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:58.211
-'Cause I'll just leave.
-Just... No, no, no, no.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.146
Okay. All right.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.715
(sighs) Okay. All right.
Take a look, guys.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:05.384
This is Hollywood racism
we're talking about, okay?

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:08.521
And Academy voters aren't
just like any old magicians.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.856
They're practically Doug
Henning. Google him, bitches.

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.459
(chuckles)
Here, I'll-I'll show you, okay?

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:15.728
Let's say that these cards
are people of all stripes

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:17.396
who have given
great performances this year.

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.332
They could've been Latino,
they could've been black,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.200
they could've been Asian.
They could've been

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.069
any people of color.
All of these people

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.271
are people that could have been,
uh, performing this year.

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:28.774
But once the Oscars get mixed
into it, boom...

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:31.444
-Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Uh-uh.
-Oh... now.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:35.047
-White. White. -Uh-uh. -No, no,
no, no! -(indistinct shouting)

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.718
White. Now, look, that...
that...

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.387
-This is what I thought. This is
what I thought. -Come on, man!

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.456
-No... W... -What are you
doin'?! What are you...

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.992
How'd you do that?! How
the (bleep) you'd do that?!

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.527
She's giving her CPR.
She's giving her CPR.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.796
-(shouting) -I can't take it!
I can't take it, Larry!

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.733
The Academy members are covered
in cobwebs,

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.868
and spiders crawl out
of their eye sockets!

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.403
But those witches
are so powerful

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:59.739
because they made a pact
to never reveal their secrets!

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:03.009
-I told you he was the devil!
-Damn, Mike, stop it!

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.678
-We'll be right back!
Oh, thank you. -God help me!

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.647
(cheering and applause)
