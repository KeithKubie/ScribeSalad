KATHERINE KUAN: Hi, my
name is Katherine Kuan,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.890
and I'm a developer
advocate at Google.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.290
Today is Take Your
Parents to Work Day.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.150
Parents are going to
come in for a session,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.730
and we're going to teach them
the first steps in building

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.910
an Android app.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.424
We're going to be using a
simple tool called the Android

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:18.090
Visualizer, and we're
going to show them

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.210
how they can write XML and
have it appear on a phone.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.580
We hope that they can
continue by taking

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.060
our course on Udacity, which is
called Android for Beginners,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.500
and it's aimed at people with
no programming experience.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.320
TOM: My name's Tom, and I am
a civil engineer and a dad.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.990
ANTONIETTA MATTHEWS: My
name is Antonietta Matthews,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.752
and I'm an IT teacher.

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:42.210
MARILYN WALTER:
I'm Marilyn Walter,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.059
and I'm a registered
nurse by profession.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.350
BRENT WALTER: I'm Brent Walter.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.040
I'm a mortgage banker.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.820
MALE SPEAKER: I am [? Sastry ?]
[? Nori. ?] I am a retired bank

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.935
manager.

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:52.310
FEMALE SPEAKER:
I am [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.540
I am a housewife.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.550
MALE SPEAKER: I have
been using mobile

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.750
as well as tablet for
the last five, six years.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.310
I do not how to
build an app, but I'm

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.210
having curiosity to learn.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.890
That's why how come we're here.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.990
TOM: As the older
generation, who

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.090
hasn't grown up with apps, the
jargon and the lingo you hear

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.690
is very intimidating.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.780
But when you actually start to
get into it, it's very simple.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.800
It's very logical.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.130
And once you learn
the steps, they

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.300
follow one after the other.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.090
And so it's almost
like a cookbook recipe.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.420
If you can cook something
out of a cookbook,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.680
you could write an app.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.120
MALE SPEAKER: Today we wanted
to build the app of some recipe,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.914
that is, snacks.

00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:37.830
ANTONIETTA MATTHEWS: I
decided to do something

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.290
to do with Italian cookery
and introduce three tips.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.110
TOM: I have a real world problem
in trying to get my daughter

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.420
to call home.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.990
And so I would like an app that
after several days have gone by

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.650
and she has not called
me, she gets a reminder

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.352
on her phone to call Dad.

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:57.810
MARILYN WALTER: We have a son
who just went off to college,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.430
and he was calling me
this week asking me

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.740
how to do laundry, which I'd
already reviewed with him,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.573
but apparently he needed
some reinforcement.

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:05.800
So anyway, that was
kind of fun to put down

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360
different reminders or things
that could be in an app.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.270
And it really brought
it to light for me.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.820
It was just so nice to know what
everyone's talking about when

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.070
they talk about making an app.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.060
For someone like me, who's
pretty much a novice at it,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.143
it was a great experience.

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:19.268
I really enjoyed the class.

00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:20.851
BRENT WALTER: What
would be a good way

00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:22.800
to get in when I recommend
coding to somebody

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.880
and the best way is
just jump in and do it.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.588
ANTONIETTA MATTHEWS:
I am most definitely

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:30.187
interested in carrying on with
developing apps for an Android.

00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:32.270
TOM: The Udacity course
looked really interesting.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.000
I think it would
be fun to do that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.670
And quite honestly,
doing an app like that,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.110
as something we could do
together, would be a blast.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.120
I would really enjoy doing that.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: As long as
my rating's 10 out of 10.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.910
TOM: Yeah, that's right.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.366
You would get top
rating for that.

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.370
DAN GALPIN: Hi, I'm Dan Galpin.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.036
I'm a developer
advocate here at Google.

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:49.800
I help to build both Android
fundamentals and the advanced

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.180
Android class.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.250
This was a great day.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.070
We had an incredible
number of people,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.320
and everyone pretty much
got through the content.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.360
And that was the
exciting for me,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.901
was watching people's eyes light
up, who had never programmed

00:02:59.901 --> 00:03:02.390
before, who were now starting
to think of themselves

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.760
as being programmers
for the first time.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.800
And everybody danced at the end.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.316
That was really the key thing.

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:14.450
