00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:04.682
- [Narrator] This program is
presented by University of

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.803
California Television.

to keep up with the latest UCTV programs.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.996
- My name is Dylan Penningroth.

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:50.270
I'm professor of law and
history here at Berkeley

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.214
and I'm a member of the Jefferson Memorial

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:54.394
lectures committee.

00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:58.254
The Jefferson Memorial lectures
was established in 1944

00:00:58.254 --> 00:01:01.038
through a bequest from
Elizabeth Bonistelle

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:04.551
and her husband Cutler L. Bonistelle.

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.057
A prominent San Francisco
couple, the Bonistelles

00:01:07.057 --> 00:01:08.675
cared deeply for history.

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:11.259
And had hoped that the lectures
would encourage students,

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.391
faculty, scholars and
those in the community

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.094
to study the legacy of Thomas Jefferson.

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:21.457
And to explore values inherent
in American democracy.

00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:24.395
Past lectures including
ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick,

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:28.808
senator Allen Simpson,
representative Tom Foley,

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:32.321
Elizabeth Warren, Walter
LeFaber and Archibald Cox,

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.632
have delivered Jefferson Memorial lectures

00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:36.394
on early American history.

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:39.176
On Jefferson himself and
on American institutions

00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:43.343
in policies, in politics,
economics, education, and law.

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.553
And we are pleased along
with the graduate council

00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:50.584
to present this year's speaker,

00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:52.493
in the lecture series,

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:54.993
professor Annette Gordon-Reed.

00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:58.726
Professor Reed is a
renowned American historian

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:01.249
and law professor at Harvard University.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.120
Where she teaches criminal procedure.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.974
The legal profession and
American legal history.

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:10.558
In 2010, she was awarded the
National Humanity's medal

00:02:10.558 --> 00:02:13.631
and a MacArthur fellowship.

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.389
She is a fellow of the American academy

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.870
of arts and sciences.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.035
And in 2014, she was
Harmsworth visiting professor

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:24.535
at Queens College at University of Oxford.

00:02:25.434 --> 00:02:26.729
Now, I have a little

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.154
story to tell.

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:30.852
And that is that the first time I ever saw

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:34.235
professor Gordon-Reed was in 1999.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:37.212
I was a brand new assistant professor

00:02:37.212 --> 00:02:39.189
at the University of Virginia.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.476
And my mentor at the
time, Reginald Butler,

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:46.183
in the history department
in African American studies

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:49.119
told me about this big conference

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.273
that was about to go down
about Thomas Jefferson

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:53.773
and Sally Hemings.

00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:55.819
So I went.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.457
I sat in the back.

00:02:57.457 --> 00:02:59.621
Sort of in the right side of the back.

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.371
And I was astonished.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.532
On stage was professor Gordon-Reed

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:07.617
who two years earlier I
knew had published a book

00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:11.419
that had argued through
painstaking forensic analysis

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.648
of the available historical documents

00:03:13.648 --> 00:03:16.356
that Thomas Jefferson probably

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:20.682
had a long term sexual
relationship with Sally Hemings.

00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:22.909
One of his slaves.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.076
Now, a retired UVA scientist
had just released DNA tests

00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:32.300
that pointed to the same conclusion.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.109
Many of the people in the room that day

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.991
pronounced themselves convinced.

00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:40.458
Now that there was DNA evidence.

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:42.214
Me, I thought,

00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:45.258
why did it take DNA to convince you?

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.841
Just read her book.

00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:53.052
So that was my introduction
to Mr. Jefferson's university.

00:03:53.052 --> 00:03:55.190
But also to one of the
most brilliant minds

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.205
at the intersection of history and law.

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.302
And I've been an admirer ever since.

00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:03.748
If her first book revealed
that the historical

00:04:03.748 --> 00:04:06.911
profession could fall prey
to arguments from authority

00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.578
and assumptions about character,

00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:14.133
her second book, the
Hemingses of Monticello

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:17.579
an American Family recovered
the lives of four generations

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.951
of the Hemings family.

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.040
Now, we historians of slavery,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.386
that's what I do,

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:25.286
typically write about enslaved people

00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:28.349
or the slaved community
in a certain region

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.449
of at best, a certain plantation.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.199
This book was immediate,
specific, and human.

00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:38.932
It was about and I'll quote,

00:04:38.932 --> 00:04:42.703
how these particular African Americans

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:46.860
made their way through slavery in America.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.272
In a sense, it told American
history through the lives

00:04:50.272 --> 00:04:53.607
of specific African American people.

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:56.504
And it deservedly won
the national book award,

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.837
the Putlizer prize, and 15 other honors.

00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:03.896
Professor Gordon-Reed is now
working on a second volume

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:05.979
about the Hemings family
that will take them

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.316
into the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:11.364
Her Jefferson lecture
titled, Thomas Jefferson

00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:13.953
and the Empire of Imagination,

00:05:13.953 --> 00:05:16.908
will focus on Thomas Jefferson's vision

00:05:16.908 --> 00:05:19.032
for the United States of America.

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:21.604
And how race and slavery
complicated his views

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:24.038
of what kind of society was possible

00:05:24.038 --> 00:05:26.119
on the American continent.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.542
She'll speak for about 40 minutes.

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:30.822
And then we'll have about
10 or 15 minutes for

00:05:30.822 --> 00:05:32.222
question and answer.

00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:37.204
And I'm gonna ask that you
please keep your questions short.

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:40.537
And keep them in the form of a question.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.598
Without any further ado,

00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:47.506
please join me in welcoming
professor Annette Gordon-Reed.

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:49.756
(applause)

00:05:56.253 --> 00:05:57.253
- Thank you.

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:01.936
Thank you very much.

00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:04.320
Thank you.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.070
Thank you all for coming.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.793
Coming inside on this beautiful day.

00:06:08.793 --> 00:06:10.629
It's absolutely gorgeous outside.

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.710
And I can, kid my students
sometimes and say,

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.166
we should have class outside.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.975
But we will stay inside
and have this discussion.

00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:20.748
It's very very good to be here.

00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:23.230
And it's interesting for me
because I've been talking about

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.866
Jefferson recently with
my co-author Peter S. Onuf

00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:30.350
whom Dylan knows from the
University of Virginia.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.777
Peter was the Thomas Jefferson
Memorial foundation professor

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:35.777
at Virginia.

00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:39.391
He was the successor to Maryl Peterson.

00:06:39.391 --> 00:06:42.356
Who was in turn the
successor to Dumas Malone.

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:45.836
Who wrote the great six
volume biography of Jefferson.

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:48.549
Jefferson and His Time.

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:51.466
And I came to know Peter because of

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.169
my first book.

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.284
I wrote my manuscript and
I wanted to send it around

00:06:57.284 --> 00:07:00.086
to people whom I thought would be hostile

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.546
to what I was saying.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.637
The critique of the historiography,

00:07:03.637 --> 00:07:06.210
the way historians had
written about this subject.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.454
And I'm afraid I was a little
stereotypical in my vision,

00:07:09.454 --> 00:07:10.662
or prejudiced in my vision,

00:07:10.662 --> 00:07:12.609
I assumed because he
held that professorship

00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:16.431
that he would be inclined to
dislike what I was saying.

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.057
So I wanted people who would be skeptical

00:07:19.057 --> 00:07:21.608
to read the manuscript
so I sent it to him.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.705
And to my utter surprise,

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:25.751
he actually liked it.

00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:27.334
And he recommended that it be published

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:29.582
by the university press of Virginia.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:33.695
Which was important because
this was Jefferson's university.

00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:36.071
And I decided to go with them
instead of a trade publisher

00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:40.120
because I knew the significance
of that connection.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.935
Peter and I have had,

00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:44.234
been having a conversation
about Jefferson now

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:46.045
since 1995, it's a long time.

00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:49.097
We have been very very good friends.

00:07:49.097 --> 00:07:51.004
Peter is an intellectual historian.

00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:54.050
And I do social history
and political history.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.950
I read some of the same
things that he reads

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.078
and he reads some of the
same things that I read.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:02.105
But we have a different
focus for the most part.

00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:05.775
So when Peter decided that he
was thinking about retiring,

00:08:05.775 --> 00:08:07.275
which he as done.

00:08:07.275 --> 00:08:10.606
I said we should put this down on paper.

00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:13.146
We had been complaining, thinking
about the way people have

00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:15.045
written about Jefferson,
the way that people

00:08:15.045 --> 00:08:16.797
tend to write about him now

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:19.572
in terms of paradox, the hypocrisy.

00:08:19.572 --> 00:08:21.851
That word hypocrisy,
well he's a hypocrite.

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:25.901
And we thought that that
term was too dismissive.

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:29.862
That it sort of hid a lot of complexity

00:08:29.862 --> 00:08:31.862
and it missed the value,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.936
both the good points, and some
of the flaws of Jefferson.

00:08:35.936 --> 00:08:39.020
But it missed the complexity
of this individual.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.926
So what we thought we would
do would be to start anew.

00:08:42.926 --> 00:08:45.799
And look at Jefferson to
from the perspective of

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:48.713
what we thought he ought to be doing,

00:08:48.713 --> 00:08:49.754
he should have been doing.

00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:51.838
Because I have a whole
laundry list of things

00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:53.579
that he should have been doing.

00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:55.576
And Peter does too.

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:57.947
That it would be interesting
to sort of recapture

00:08:57.947 --> 00:09:01.507
if we could what Jefferson
thought he was doing himself.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:03.453
What he thought he was doing in the world.

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:05.711
And that that might give us some insight

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.781
into where he went wrong.

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:09.517
The ways we think of him going wrong.

00:09:09.517 --> 00:09:11.439
And the things that he did right.

00:09:11.439 --> 00:09:14.840
So Peter and I decided to
collaborate on this project.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.094
It's not something that
historians typically do.

00:09:18.094 --> 00:09:20.428
Although he has collaborated
with his brother.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:23.479
But this was something that
we wanted to do jointly

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:27.377
and our editor wanted us
to have a single voice.

00:09:27.377 --> 00:09:30.827
So we sat on this project,
set about on this project

00:09:30.827 --> 00:09:33.091
to do things in a collaborative way.

00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:35.421
Writing sections and then
rewriting other's work

00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:37.860
and going, to the point
that we don't really know.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.342
Except for a few ticks that we might have,

00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:43.142
we don't recognize who wrote what

00:09:43.142 --> 00:09:47.018
by the way time we had
gotten through all of this.

00:09:47.018 --> 00:09:50.143
And we decided that we wanted to use,

00:09:50.143 --> 00:09:52.571
as we would not be
using secondary sources,

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:54.720
that we would go back
to Jefferson's letters,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.509
Jefferson's own words,

00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:57.950
and to try to figure this out.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.676
To figure this person out.

00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:02.187
And to move beyond the ditch that I think

00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:03.648
that we have sort of run into

00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:05.053
in writing about Jefferson.

00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:08.241
Talking about hypocrisy,
which is a way of ending

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:11.862
the conversation instead of
opening the conversation.

00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:14.942
We take the title Most
Blessed of the Patriarchs,

00:10:14.942 --> 00:10:17.370
Thomas Jefferson and the
Empire of the Imagination,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.581
the second part is, we came up with.

00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:22.849
Most Blessed of the
Patriarchs is in quotes.

00:10:22.849 --> 00:10:24.962
And we had to fight with
our publisher about this

00:10:24.962 --> 00:10:27.325
because apparently it's
not a good thing to put

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:29.640
quotes in titles of books or whatever.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.087
But we said it's from Jefferson.

00:10:32.087 --> 00:10:34.377
And I particularly did not wanna be seen,

00:10:34.377 --> 00:10:36.824
it would be okay for Peter, perhaps.

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:39.060
To have called him the most
blessed of the patriarchs.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.400
It would not be something
that an African American woman

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.277
could do for a 18th
century white slave holder

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:47.326
and I wanted to make
clear that it was not,

00:10:47.326 --> 00:10:49.816
we were not calling him most
blessed of the patriarchs.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.735
He called himself that.

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:54.461
And we fixed on this title.

00:10:54.461 --> 00:10:58.678
It comes from a letter that
he wrote to Angelica Church.

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:02.592
Angelical Schuyler Church
of the Hamilton fame.

00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:04.344
If anybody's listening to the sound track,

00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:07.171
you know she's one of
the Schuyler sisters.

00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:08.866
Who Jefferson knew.

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:10.450
When he was in Paris.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.881
And it's in 1793, he writes
this letter to Angelica.

00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:17.294
He has been beaten up in the Cabinet.

00:11:17.294 --> 00:11:20.788
And Alexander Hamilton has
bested him in his battle

00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:22.705
for Washington's favor.

00:11:24.137 --> 00:11:26.587
And he's announcing his retirement to her.

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:30.509
And he talks about, I
have my feels to form.

00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:34.270
And to watch for the
happiness of the people who,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.821
those who labor for my happiness.

00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:38.247
Namely the enslaved people at Monticello.

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:39.247
He also says

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.318
if I'm there and if my
daughter has joined me,

00:11:42.318 --> 00:11:44.422
I will consider myself as blessed

00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:47.121
as the most blessed of the patriarchs.

00:11:47.121 --> 00:11:48.786
And we thought, that's
an interesting phrase,

00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:51.421
most blessed of the patriarchs.

00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:53.076
And then there's another
letter that he writes

00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:55.307
two years later where
he describes himself as

00:11:55.307 --> 00:11:58.603
living like an antediluvian patriarch.

00:11:58.603 --> 00:11:59.604
At Monticello.

00:11:59.604 --> 00:12:01.130
And we thought,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.136
a patriarch.

00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:03.705
When we think of patriarch,

00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:06.591
you think of someone
from a religious figure,

00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:07.838
from a long time ago.

00:12:07.838 --> 00:12:11.261
Or conjures up an ancient times.

00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.672
And he's supposed to be
the apostle of democracy.

00:12:13.672 --> 00:12:16.046
He is a republican statesman.

00:12:16.046 --> 00:12:18.957
He believes in democracy.

00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:21.522
Democracy with, you know, a democrat.

00:12:21.522 --> 00:12:23.583
He was a democrat with a little d.

00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:26.898
And how do you fit this notion

00:12:26.898 --> 00:12:31.065
of being a patriarch into this
notion of being a republican?

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.441
A republican life.

00:12:33.441 --> 00:12:37.038
Patriarchs have enormous amounts of land.

00:12:37.038 --> 00:12:39.552
They have a wife, maybe multiple wives.

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:41.612
A concubine, he had lots of land.

00:12:41.612 --> 00:12:43.094
He had enslaved people.

00:12:43.094 --> 00:12:45.941
And he did have a, that word concubine.

00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:49.136
He's sort of saying this openly.

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:51.572
Describing himself as this figure.

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:54.214
So we thought that we could
use this as the title.

00:12:54.214 --> 00:12:57.760
The Empire of the Imagination
is about Jefferson's vision

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.210
for the country that he helped to found.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.958
That this is a person
who did not travel west.

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.613
He set Louis and Clark west.

00:13:06.613 --> 00:13:09.278
He always believed that
America would move west

00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:11.460
and would go from sea to shining sea.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.059
And he had an understanding
about what the country would be.

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:18.291
And it was mainly through his
imaginative, his imagination.

00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:20.486
The books that he read.

00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:21.875
The things that were important to him.

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:23.697
His understanding of life.

00:13:23.697 --> 00:13:25.883
That's what the Empire of
the Imagination is about.

00:13:25.883 --> 00:13:29.858
Is this visionary person
who conjures up this image

00:13:29.858 --> 00:13:32.481
of what the new nation would be.

00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:34.343
In the future.

00:13:34.343 --> 00:13:37.760
So we decided to not to follow a sort of,

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:40.539
it's a chronology.

00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:43.622
It's a chronologically inclined book.

00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:48.665
But it is not a straight cradle to grave,

00:13:48.665 --> 00:13:50.982
he was born and then he dies kind of book.

00:13:50.982 --> 00:13:53.228
There's sort of thematic.

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:55.558
And the first section of
the book is called patriarch

00:13:55.558 --> 00:13:57.863
where we set out and try to discover

00:13:57.863 --> 00:14:01.446
what influences went
into making Jefferson.

00:14:02.902 --> 00:14:06.129
He is born into a slave society.

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:10.073
He is at the top of the social ladder.

00:14:10.073 --> 00:14:11.579
Member of the Randolph family.

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:13.744
A large and old family in Virginia.

00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:16.197
His father is not from,

00:14:16.197 --> 00:14:17.388
at the highest strata.

00:14:17.388 --> 00:14:19.132
But he was a self made man.

00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:21.196
Become wealthy, slave owner.

00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:25.594
And also a plantation owner
and owned a lot of land.

00:14:25.594 --> 00:14:28.678
But he made his money as a surveyor.

00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:30.645
And as a planter.

00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:32.939
He is intelligent.

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:36.311
He had the best kind of
education that you could have.

00:14:36.311 --> 00:14:38.807
For people in Virginia at the time.

00:14:38.807 --> 00:14:40.543
He was tall.

00:14:40.543 --> 00:14:43.179
Which seems like you know,

00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:44.993
I guess it makes a difference even today.

00:14:44.993 --> 00:14:47.075
But it certainly made a time

00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:49.652
to be six feet two and a half inches tall.

00:14:49.652 --> 00:14:53.408
And he was the actual
owner of human beings.

00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:56.858
He had the power, legal
ownership over human beings.

00:14:56.858 --> 00:14:58.344
And he was male.

00:14:58.344 --> 00:14:59.857
And he was a first son.

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.755
At a time when that mattered as well.

00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:04.846
So all of these influences, these things

00:15:04.846 --> 00:15:06.213
come into making him.

00:15:06.213 --> 00:15:08.846
Giving him his vision of himself.

00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:10.918
The society he is born into.

00:15:10.918 --> 00:15:13.072
His, the resources that he has.

00:15:13.072 --> 00:15:16.155
Physical, intellectual and financial.

00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:19.695
Make him who, give him an
idea of who he's supposed

00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:20.694
to be in the world.

00:15:20.694 --> 00:15:22.537
An enormous amount of confidence.

00:15:22.537 --> 00:15:23.959
Some people might say arrogance.

00:15:23.959 --> 00:15:25.953
But it's all there in this package.

00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:28.217
The other thing about him
is that he loves to read.

00:15:28.217 --> 00:15:30.910
And he considers himself to be a member,

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.638
a sort of adherent to the enlightenment.

00:15:34.638 --> 00:15:36.574
He believes in science.

00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:38.899
And science shapes his view of the world.

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:40.566
Scientific advances.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.040
We will discover things.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.423
We will know new things.

00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:46.284
We, he believed in something

00:15:46.284 --> 00:15:48.858
that I'm not sure that
we actually believe in.

00:15:48.858 --> 00:15:52.041
And that's sort of a
straight line of progress.

00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:53.783
That things are gonna
get better and better

00:15:53.783 --> 00:15:55.435
and better inevitably.

00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:57.901
While we know that it doesn't,

00:15:57.901 --> 00:16:00.597
that's not necessarily so.

00:16:00.597 --> 00:16:02.715
That it is, you know is
maybe three steps forward,

00:16:02.715 --> 00:16:04.926
four steps backwards.

00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:06.894
Side over here and it's...

00:16:06.894 --> 00:16:08.663
It's a rocky road to progress.

00:16:08.663 --> 00:16:11.991
He believed that progress
would come as people became

00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:13.040
more educated.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.091
They would become more enlightened.

00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:17.001
And that's the age that he lives in.

00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:18.574
Is reading all these books.

00:16:18.574 --> 00:16:21.383
Reading the books of famous scientists.

00:16:21.383 --> 00:16:22.300
Historians.

00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:25.274
Bacon, Lock, Newton.

00:16:26.732 --> 00:16:28.481
That this was inevitable.

00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:30.928
And that's difficult for us
to wrap our minds around.

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:33.368
And one of the tenants of...

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.083
Well, couple of the
tenants that he adheres to

00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:39.622
in the enlightenment is
skepticism about religion.

00:16:39.622 --> 00:16:42.977
Sort of a hostility
towards organized religion.

00:16:42.977 --> 00:16:44.917
People think Jefferson was an atheist.

00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:46.070
He was not an atheist.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.101
But he was hostile to organized religion.

00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:51.614
Because he thought
organized religion priests

00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:54.718
were people who put themselves between

00:16:54.718 --> 00:16:56.385
individuals and God.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.200
That everybody had to think
for himself or herself.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.576
And you did not need an interlocker.

00:17:02.576 --> 00:17:04.919
You didn't need that
intermediation between,

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:08.002
mediation between the person and God.

00:17:09.018 --> 00:17:10.812
So skepticism about religion.

00:17:10.812 --> 00:17:14.351
He sees as an enlightenment virtue.

00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:15.434
And then also

00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:17.359
anti-slavery.

00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:21.656
And this is a real problem
that Jefferson has today

00:17:21.656 --> 00:17:23.838
because people say how
could he be anti-slavery,

00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:25.338
that's all a ruse.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.053
But the question is,

00:17:28.053 --> 00:17:30.373
if that's the case, who is he playing to?

00:17:30.373 --> 00:17:31.639
Right?

00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:35.856
This sort of idea that
he's trying to fool us.

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.121
But he doesn't know who we are.

00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:41.049
He has no assurance of how
people are going to feel

00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:42.048
about that.

00:17:42.048 --> 00:17:46.053
He actually believed that slavery was a

00:17:46.053 --> 00:17:48.579
backward institution.

00:17:48.579 --> 00:17:49.616
And that if you,

00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:52.495
in believing in progress,
eventually it will go away.

00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:55.829
And this starts even
before he's in public life.

00:17:55.829 --> 00:17:57.442
When he was in his 20s, he writes

00:17:57.442 --> 00:17:59.281
in his legal commonplace book.

00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:02.145
He puts down, he copies down a poem.

00:18:02.145 --> 00:18:04.347
By a man named William Shenstone.

00:18:04.347 --> 00:18:06.343
Or actual stanzas from the poem.

00:18:06.343 --> 00:18:07.593
That talk about

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:12.320
an African ripped from his native land.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.675
Brought across the sea, forced to work,

00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:17.559
to labor for another.

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:19.489
And this is when he's in his 20s.

00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:21.779
There's nobody looking at this point.

00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:23.838
There's no public persona here.

00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:26.268
This is a part of his,

00:18:26.268 --> 00:18:28.951
the beginning of his
understanding of who he was.

00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:29.947
It's like,

00:18:29.947 --> 00:18:33.474
announcing yourself to
be a liberal, in a way.

00:18:33.474 --> 00:18:36.313
These are the things that we believe.

00:18:36.313 --> 00:18:38.655
And anti-slavery was one of them.

00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:41.141
My colleague and friend
David Conig is now working on

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.224
Jefferson's legal career.

00:18:44.434 --> 00:18:46.865
Something that has been,
couple of books have been

00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:49.695
written about it, but his
legal commonplace book

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.875
is now just been, is being edited.

00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:54.125
And so there's a lot
of material that David

00:18:54.125 --> 00:18:55.124
is going through now.

00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:57.561
And he is, it's his contention.

00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:00.911
That as a lawyer, Jefferson did things,

00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:03.342
made arguments that were designed

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:06.194
to sort of chip away at slavery.

00:19:06.194 --> 00:19:07.111
As lawyers,

00:19:08.196 --> 00:19:09.955
as far as he could go with the law.

00:19:09.955 --> 00:19:13.389
Howell v. Netherland is the
most famous of his cases.

00:19:13.389 --> 00:19:16.286
He was representing a mixed raced man

00:19:16.286 --> 00:19:19.325
who was seeking his freedom
and he tries to make this

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.921
argument about all men are created equal.

00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:25.473
He uses language that would
be in the declaration.

00:19:25.473 --> 00:19:27.442
This is years before

00:19:27.442 --> 00:19:28.559
the revolution.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.626
So this stuff is in his head.

00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:31.972
These ideas are in his head.

00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:32.973
Even as a young man.

00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:34.603
even before anybody's looking.

00:19:34.603 --> 00:19:37.021
So to say that this is just a pose.

00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:39.587
That this was just a pose
for later generations

00:19:39.587 --> 00:19:42.301
or even for people in the 1780s,

00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:44.829
when he's in France, is
really not quite right.

00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:46.420
Because he's doing this even before

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.033
all of this gets started.

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:51.298
So David's book will be
addressing all of this.

00:19:51.298 --> 00:19:54.349
So this young man, who
has this vision of himself

00:19:54.349 --> 00:19:55.766
as a progressive.

00:19:56.827 --> 00:19:58.951
And then something happens in his life

00:19:58.951 --> 00:20:00.796
that galvanizes him.

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:04.174
And really becomes the key to who he was

00:20:04.174 --> 00:20:05.363
for the rest of his life.

00:20:05.363 --> 00:20:06.911
And that's the American revolution.

00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:09.953
His involvement in the
American revolution.

00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:14.268
That was something that gave
Jefferson his sense of himself.

00:20:14.268 --> 00:20:16.849
And it was the most
important thing in his life.

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:18.017
There's no question about that.

00:20:18.017 --> 00:20:20.471
Besides his daughters, Martha
and you know, besides that.

00:20:20.471 --> 00:20:25.262
But the most important
political act of his life.

00:20:25.262 --> 00:20:27.762
It sort of defined who he was.

00:20:28.993 --> 00:20:31.496
He sees himself as a revolutionary

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:34.752
and as having been a part
of creating something great.

00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:37.172
And this is his obsession.

00:20:37.172 --> 00:20:38.767
For the rest of his life.

00:20:38.767 --> 00:20:42.330
Preserving that is his obsession
for the rest of his life.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.770
We are obsessed with slavery.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.635
And I think rightly so.

00:20:46.635 --> 00:20:48.287
Because it's such a,

00:20:48.287 --> 00:20:50.454
such an integral part
of the beginning of the

00:20:50.454 --> 00:20:51.912
United States of America.

00:20:51.912 --> 00:20:54.914
We are obsessed with race
because that's the problem

00:20:54.914 --> 00:20:58.413
that we have that we're still
trying to struggle with.

00:20:58.413 --> 00:21:00.988
He was not obsessed with
either one of those things.

00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:03.214
He was obsessed with the revolution.

00:21:03.214 --> 00:21:04.926
That we have created a country.

00:21:04.926 --> 00:21:06.426
And at some point,

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:10.518
he discovers, or he pretends
to comes to believe,

00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:14.685
that there are forces that
are counter evolutionary.

00:21:15.673 --> 00:21:18.898
That people who are trying
to destroy the revolution,

00:21:18.898 --> 00:21:21.733
namely that person who has the hit musical

00:21:21.733 --> 00:21:23.066
now on Broadway.

00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:28.418
And a number one soundtrack
whatever for cast album.

00:21:29.394 --> 00:21:30.390
Hamilton.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.532
And did somebody hiss?

00:21:32.532 --> 00:21:34.378
Somebody beginning to hiss?

00:21:34.378 --> 00:21:37.000
Boo hiss, Hamilton, no.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.940
None of the battle the
network founding fathers,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.512
we don't have to do that.

00:21:41.512 --> 00:21:44.546
So the revolution galvanizes Jefferson.

00:21:44.546 --> 00:21:46.725
It gives him his sense of identity.

00:21:46.725 --> 00:21:48.807
He embarks upon politics.

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:52.565
He gets involved with politics
to defend that revolution.

00:21:52.565 --> 00:21:55.609
As a politician, that's
what he thinks his job is.

00:21:55.609 --> 00:21:58.751
But something else happens
to him along the way.

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.576
He begins to see,

00:22:00.576 --> 00:22:05.131
he has to have a different
attitude about African Americans.

00:22:05.131 --> 00:22:07.055
He writes at some point,

00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:08.195
that before the revolution,

00:22:08.195 --> 00:22:09.615
during the colonial period,

00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:12.980
that we, meaning white Virginians,

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.147
thought of them as cattle.

00:22:16.136 --> 00:22:17.663
That they didn't have,

00:22:17.663 --> 00:22:20.598
that he didn't know,
Jefferson exaggerates.

00:22:20.598 --> 00:22:22.047
He has a tendency to exaggerate.

00:22:22.047 --> 00:22:23.993
But what he's basically
saying is that people's

00:22:23.993 --> 00:22:26.200
attitudes about enslaved people changed

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.752
after the revolution.

00:22:27.752 --> 00:22:31.863
And what's changed was
that blacks began to join

00:22:31.863 --> 00:22:33.342
the British.

00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:36.384
Blacks began to use their agency.

00:22:36.384 --> 00:22:39.167
Sort of voting with
their feet essentially,

00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:41.826
to join Lord Dunmore and anyone else

00:22:41.826 --> 00:22:44.621
who offered to give them freedom.

00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:47.241
And I'm reading, I've
read a wonderful book

00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:49.908
by a man named Robert Parkinson.

00:22:50.885 --> 00:22:52.566
It's called the Common Cause.

00:22:52.566 --> 00:22:55.018
Creating race and nation
in the United States.

00:22:55.018 --> 00:22:56.849
And so what he talks about is how

00:22:56.849 --> 00:23:00.007
the involvement of Native
Americans and African Americans

00:23:00.007 --> 00:23:03.959
on the side of the
British become a sort of

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:08.712
rallying cry for white
Americans who see this as,

00:23:08.712 --> 00:23:10.783
see this as sort of traitorous activities.

00:23:10.783 --> 00:23:12.799
And it's the beginning of creating

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:15.439
or making sure that blacks
and Native Americans

00:23:15.439 --> 00:23:18.540
are seen as being outside
of the American people.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.195
Something other than American people.

00:23:20.195 --> 00:23:23.362
So Jefferson begins to understand that

00:23:24.835 --> 00:23:27.803
they're living amidst enemies.

00:23:27.803 --> 00:23:28.818
Potential enemies.

00:23:28.818 --> 00:23:31.191
That is to say African Americans.

00:23:31.191 --> 00:23:34.351
Virginians who were about
40% of the population

00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:36.947
during Jefferson's time in South Carolina.

00:23:36.947 --> 00:23:38.538
It's two to one, by the time they get

00:23:38.538 --> 00:23:40.938
to the antebellum period,
it's three to one.

00:23:40.938 --> 00:23:44.038
So this is a huge internal enemy.

00:23:44.038 --> 00:23:46.075
What Allen Taylor, another
historian has called

00:23:46.075 --> 00:23:47.474
the internal enemy.

00:23:47.474 --> 00:23:48.639
That they are there.

00:23:48.639 --> 00:23:51.464
And he begins to see
them in a different way.

00:23:51.464 --> 00:23:53.446
So the urgency about ending slavery,

00:23:53.446 --> 00:23:57.358
which before was just sort
of a quiver in the arrow

00:23:57.358 --> 00:24:01.525
of progressives, becomes
something that he thinks in the...

00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:05.694
He begins to think is...

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:08.115
I should say an arrow in
the quiver of progressives,

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:09.722
I got that backwards.

00:24:09.722 --> 00:24:11.469
He sees as a threat.

00:24:11.469 --> 00:24:14.098
We have to do something about this because

00:24:14.098 --> 00:24:16.877
these people, we are at war.

00:24:16.877 --> 00:24:18.479
Slavery is a state of war.

00:24:18.479 --> 00:24:20.092
That's a locking in formulation.

00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:22.158
Most people became slaves
in the ancient world

00:24:22.158 --> 00:24:23.158
after a war.

00:24:24.486 --> 00:24:25.492
And they were taken prisoners.

00:24:25.492 --> 00:24:26.497
And you can, you know,

00:24:26.497 --> 00:24:28.540
it was almost a merciful
thing to make a person a slave

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.309
instead of killing them.

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:31.875
Which you would have a right to do.

00:24:31.875 --> 00:24:35.534
And certainly, slavery was a continuation

00:24:35.534 --> 00:24:38.534
or some form of continuation of war.

00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:42.882
So African Americans and
white Americans existed

00:24:42.882 --> 00:24:46.638
in the state of war so
long as you had slavery.

00:24:46.638 --> 00:24:49.220
And he did not believe
that African Americans

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.387
after emancipation, would
be able to love a country

00:24:54.633 --> 00:24:57.772
where they had been treated
as they had been treated.

00:24:57.772 --> 00:25:00.357
So you couldn't have love of country,

00:25:00.357 --> 00:25:03.466
which is required to be a patriot.

00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:05.604
Required to be a citizen.

00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:07.762
White people would never
give up their prejudices

00:25:07.762 --> 00:25:10.291
against black people.

00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:13.150
There could be no wholesale
mix in between black and white.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.476
We could talk about that later.

00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:19.037
He couldn't see that as a possibility.

00:25:19.037 --> 00:25:21.811
A country had to be comprised of people,

00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:26.246
a country was sort of a
larger version of a family.

00:25:26.246 --> 00:25:28.604
You start with a family as the basic unit.

00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:29.952
Then you have a community.

00:25:29.952 --> 00:25:32.652
And then you radiate out
to the nation as a whole.

00:25:32.652 --> 00:25:36.754
How can you be citizens,
equal citizens in a country

00:25:36.754 --> 00:25:39.544
if you cannot form families with people?

00:25:39.544 --> 00:25:41.560
It's those affectionate ties.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.053
It's that capacity is what
makes the people together.

00:25:45.053 --> 00:25:47.439
How do you say we're all
equal but you can't be

00:25:47.439 --> 00:25:48.526
my daughter-in-law?

00:25:48.526 --> 00:25:49.860
You can't be my son-in-law.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.606
You can't be in my family.

00:25:51.606 --> 00:25:54.235
He didn't know that we would
figure out how to do that.

00:25:54.235 --> 00:25:58.093
But at his time period,
he couldn't see that.

00:25:58.093 --> 00:26:00.745
Nor could he see the idea of having

00:26:00.745 --> 00:26:03.570
first class and second class citizens.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.114
You either are a citizen or you're not.

00:26:07.114 --> 00:26:09.662
That makes his understanding about

00:26:09.662 --> 00:26:12.912
what had to happen and the
thing that also gives people

00:26:12.912 --> 00:26:15.589
a problem about Jefferson, namely,

00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:18.407
you had to emancipate enslaved people.

00:26:18.407 --> 00:26:20.990
But they had to be expatriated.

00:26:21.867 --> 00:26:24.542
Blacks and whites could not
live together, he thought,

00:26:24.542 --> 00:26:25.959
without conflict.

00:26:26.942 --> 00:26:30.046
And those words in the state of Virginia.

00:26:30.046 --> 00:26:33.229
He thought that people
would be upset to the extent

00:26:33.229 --> 00:26:35.082
that he was thinking about posterity.

00:26:35.082 --> 00:26:36.534
And he did think about posterity.

00:26:36.534 --> 00:26:39.746
He thought that people might be upset.

00:26:39.746 --> 00:26:42.675
Certainly his contemporaries
might be upset about

00:26:42.675 --> 00:26:46.666
the criticisms that he made of slavery.

00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:48.421
He would be surprised, I think,

00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:52.300
to know the extent to which we focus on

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.950
that part of the equation.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.805
When he says emancipate.

00:26:55.805 --> 00:26:57.595
He thought he would be great.

00:26:57.595 --> 00:26:59.294
I'm for emancipation.

00:26:59.294 --> 00:27:01.625
But they have to go somewhere else.

00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:04.708
That's the part of the equation that,

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.850
that causes him problems today.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.542
But he did not think that
we could live together

00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:12.542
in harmony.

00:27:12.542 --> 00:27:16.234
Now, this has caused a lot
of criticism of Jefferson.

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:18.179
But if we're honest with ourselves,

00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:20.857
he also thought that
if you try to do this,

00:27:20.857 --> 00:27:24.808
that there might actually be a race war.

00:27:24.808 --> 00:27:26.488
That there would be conflict.

00:27:26.488 --> 00:27:28.999
And one side would kill the other side.

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:31.839
And he basically says,
sort of in a prophetic way,

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:34.000
there is no aspect of the Almighty

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.135
that could take our side in this struggle.

00:27:37.135 --> 00:27:38.888
Because whites were wrong.

00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:41.175
I mean, slave owners
were wrong to do this.

00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:44.213
So this is a problem we have with him.

00:27:44.213 --> 00:27:46.623
And we sort of, I think,

00:27:46.623 --> 00:27:49.068
congratulate ourselves in saying that

00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:50.293
we're better than that.

00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:51.419
But the truth is,

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:53.919
we may not have had a race war

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.094
like you know, the battle
of Antietam or whatever.

00:27:58.094 --> 00:27:59.220
Or Gettysburg.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.027
But we have had a huge
amount of conflicts.

00:28:03.027 --> 00:28:05.425
We are still having enormous
amount of conflicts.

00:28:05.425 --> 00:28:08.168
Between blacks and whites.

00:28:08.168 --> 00:28:12.046
And if you think about what
happened after reconstruction,

00:28:12.046 --> 00:28:14.213
about lynching, Jim Crowe,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.743
there's been a cold war

00:28:17.743 --> 00:28:20.840
and a hot war in a lot of ways.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.190
It has not been easy.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.803
So this notion that this was crazy,

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:28.315
that blacks and whites would
have difficulty living together

00:28:28.315 --> 00:28:32.481
without conflict is not
as crazy as we like to

00:28:32.481 --> 00:28:34.211
make it out to be.

00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:37.022
This is something we are
still trying to figure out

00:28:37.022 --> 00:28:40.705
how to bring black
people into citizenship.

00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:43.163
I mean, that is about a
lot of what is going on now

00:28:43.163 --> 00:28:46.685
with all of the terrible
videos that we're seeing.

00:28:46.685 --> 00:28:50.185
The police encounters with black citizens.

00:28:51.778 --> 00:28:53.461
The difference between,

00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:55.278
whatever you think about
the second amendment,

00:28:55.278 --> 00:28:58.085
it is pretty clear that
African American men

00:28:58.085 --> 00:29:02.252
do not have the same freedom
to carry weapons about

00:29:03.306 --> 00:29:04.639
as white men do.

00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:10.325
So black citizenship
today is still something

00:29:10.325 --> 00:29:11.902
that we're trying to work out.

00:29:11.902 --> 00:29:14.345
So Jefferson's born in 1743.

00:29:14.345 --> 00:29:15.912
Into a slave society.

00:29:15.912 --> 00:29:17.890
He's trying to figure
out how this will work.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.857
Not to make excuses for him.

00:29:19.857 --> 00:29:24.024
But I think we are not as
far along as we should be.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.650
This is a person who never saw a train.

00:29:29.837 --> 00:29:32.522
And we've had an opportunity,
many opportunities

00:29:32.522 --> 00:29:35.145
to know better than some
of the ways that we act.

00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:37.638
And we don't as of yet.

00:29:37.638 --> 00:29:39.638
So this is his vision of

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:42.905
what is going to be the solution.

00:29:42.905 --> 00:29:45.300
Even though as he gets
older, he understands

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.766
that it's really, it's
really not gonna happen.

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.153
The numbers are too great.

00:29:50.153 --> 00:29:52.317
One of the last letters that he writes,

00:29:52.317 --> 00:29:55.310
he talks about, he's
sort of doing the math.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.685
And figuring out that this
is not really feasible

00:29:58.685 --> 00:30:01.973
even though he thinks that
this is the best solution.

00:30:01.973 --> 00:30:04.085
He says we're gonna get to a point.

00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:06.257
We must do something
because we'll get to a point

00:30:06.257 --> 00:30:08.889
where one million he says, fighting men,

00:30:08.889 --> 00:30:11.576
will say we will not go.

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:14.614
African American men might
just say we're not gonna go.

00:30:14.614 --> 00:30:17.288
And then a problem really starts.

00:30:17.288 --> 00:30:21.455
So Jefferson has a conception
of the United States

00:30:22.507 --> 00:30:25.504
after as a revolutionary
then as a politician

00:30:25.504 --> 00:30:27.988
as he's trying to preserve this notion of

00:30:27.988 --> 00:30:29.247
republican government.

00:30:29.247 --> 00:30:31.528
And of course in republican government,

00:30:31.528 --> 00:30:33.516
the majority rules.

00:30:33.516 --> 00:30:35.070
People have to vote.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.903
People would have to vote slavery out.

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:41.323
He discovers and
understands pretty clearly,

00:30:41.323 --> 00:30:44.206
pretty early on as a young man,

00:30:44.206 --> 00:30:47.422
as a legislator, he
tries to introduce a law

00:30:47.422 --> 00:30:50.890
to put in place as
gradual emancipation plan.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.174
And it goes absolutely nowhere.

00:30:54.174 --> 00:30:56.451
And then later on, another
man, St. George Tucker,

00:30:56.451 --> 00:30:59.660
in the 1790s tries to do a similar thing

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.448
and it goes absolutely nowhere.

00:31:02.448 --> 00:31:07.057
So at some point, Jefferson
realizes that this is not,

00:31:07.057 --> 00:31:08.915
we're not gonna have
a republican solution.

00:31:08.915 --> 00:31:11.028
We're not likely to have
a republican solution

00:31:11.028 --> 00:31:12.201
to this problem.

00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:13.862
In his life time.

00:31:13.862 --> 00:31:16.339
Virginians were not
gonna vote slavery out.

00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:18.580
And people say well, you know,

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.691
there are plenty of
things that you could say

00:31:20.691 --> 00:31:21.745
are never gonna happen.

00:31:21.745 --> 00:31:23.826
But they won't happen unless you try.

00:31:23.826 --> 00:31:25.227
Right?

00:31:25.227 --> 00:31:28.118
He's faulted for not making the effort.

00:31:28.118 --> 00:31:31.926
But keep in mind what I said
about his real obsession

00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:34.752
and that's the United States of America.

00:31:34.752 --> 00:31:36.790
You created this country and
you wanna get this country

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.422
on its feet.

00:31:38.422 --> 00:31:39.502
And then you say,

00:31:39.502 --> 00:31:41.403
and what he says is this
is a problem that's gonna

00:31:41.403 --> 00:31:42.581
work itself out.

00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:45.381
And if you think about the way,

00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:48.118
it's not uncommon for people to say

00:31:48.118 --> 00:31:51.483
all right, there's this one
thing that I wanna fixate on

00:31:51.483 --> 00:31:53.530
and if I can just fix that,

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.650
this other little thing over here is gonna

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.050
take care of itself.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.992
And it's that little thing over here

00:31:58.992 --> 00:32:01.392
that's the real problem.

00:32:01.392 --> 00:32:03.267
And that's slavery.

00:32:03.267 --> 00:32:05.688
He thinks slavery is gonna work itself out

00:32:05.688 --> 00:32:07.105
by enlightenment.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.612
Education.

00:32:09.612 --> 00:32:12.484
People will come to understand
that this has to end.

00:32:12.484 --> 00:32:14.485
That this is a backwards system.

00:32:14.485 --> 00:32:15.770
And it will end.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.373
Now of course, we know it
wasn't a backwards system.

00:32:18.373 --> 00:32:21.242
We know with the cotton gin.

00:32:21.242 --> 00:32:24.403
When he buys Louisiana
and cotton becomes king.

00:32:24.403 --> 00:32:25.432
He doesn't,

00:32:25.432 --> 00:32:29.442
he lives long enough to see
the beginning of the rise

00:32:29.442 --> 00:32:31.545
in the prices of enslaved people.

00:32:31.545 --> 00:32:33.942
He doesn't live to see
the antebellum period

00:32:33.942 --> 00:32:37.615
when slavery is a really
prosperous institution.

00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:39.498
But he holds on to this idea

00:32:39.498 --> 00:32:42.245
that it is, because it's ancient.

00:32:42.245 --> 00:32:46.416
And it is backwards,
it is going to go away.

00:32:46.416 --> 00:32:47.997
That's his understanding of it.

00:32:47.997 --> 00:32:51.617
So I'm gonna focus on this
federalists over here.

00:32:51.617 --> 00:32:53.295
And he says when he's elected president,

00:32:53.295 --> 00:32:55.914
he's gonna sink federalism into an abyss.

00:32:55.914 --> 00:32:59.512
From which it will never
arise, and he does.

00:32:59.512 --> 00:33:01.563
He basically kills the federalist party.

00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:02.611
It's over.

00:33:02.611 --> 00:33:03.615
For them.

00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:05.317
And we have Jefferson.

00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:06.579
And then we have Madison.

00:33:06.579 --> 00:33:07.688
We have Monroe.

00:33:07.688 --> 00:33:11.130
There's a brief period
with John Quincy Adams.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.703
And then we have Jackson,

00:33:13.703 --> 00:33:16.379
who considers himself a Jeffersonian.

00:33:16.379 --> 00:33:19.654
So he has a record for his political party

00:33:19.654 --> 00:33:22.923
and his political ideals that
last longer than anybody.

00:33:22.923 --> 00:33:24.842
Nobody's ever replicated that.

00:33:24.842 --> 00:33:27.803
Had a political influence that lasted

00:33:27.803 --> 00:33:30.306
for as long as his did through himself

00:33:30.306 --> 00:33:31.811
and his various surrogates.

00:33:31.811 --> 00:33:32.811
Through this.

00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:34.985
So he's fixated on politics.

00:33:34.985 --> 00:33:38.770
Not upon you know, slavery,
politics in terms of

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.621
federalism versus republicanism.

00:33:40.621 --> 00:33:44.654
Getting rid of the
monarchy is the equivalent

00:33:44.654 --> 00:33:46.468
of fighting communism to him.

00:33:46.468 --> 00:33:47.639
That is his obsession.

00:33:47.639 --> 00:33:52.091
He thought most of human
history has been ruled by,

00:33:52.091 --> 00:33:53.696
people have been ruled by these monarchs

00:33:53.696 --> 00:33:56.491
who have dragged people into war.

00:33:56.491 --> 00:33:59.261
European battles of power
politics from you know,

00:33:59.261 --> 00:34:00.603
wars, kings.

00:34:00.603 --> 00:34:02.287
We're gonna get away from all of that.

00:34:02.287 --> 00:34:03.288
And we're gonna do something.

00:34:03.288 --> 00:34:05.294
We're gonna have an empire for liberty,

00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:06.467
is what he calls it.

00:34:06.467 --> 00:34:08.947
And he wants it to be
from sea to shining sea

00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:11.122
because he doesn't want Spain and France

00:34:11.122 --> 00:34:13.920
and other people interfering
on American land.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.091
If you had separate,

00:34:16.091 --> 00:34:18.099
if you had, country was divided up.

00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:21.897
That they would fall prey
to European power politics.

00:34:21.897 --> 00:34:23.094
So that's his vision.

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:25.806
And slavery is something that recedes,

00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:29.285
his anti-slavery recedes
into the background.

00:34:29.285 --> 00:34:31.443
After he becomes a politician.

00:34:31.443 --> 00:34:34.664
We also think, we talk about
the second part of the book.

00:34:34.664 --> 00:34:37.671
The other influence on him
is not just his republicanism

00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:39.197
and his revolutionary.

00:34:39.197 --> 00:34:43.355
His focus, his fixation on the
United States as a country.

00:34:43.355 --> 00:34:44.642
Is France.

00:34:44.642 --> 00:34:46.142
He goes to France.

00:34:46.979 --> 00:34:51.146
And while he is there, he is
shocked by French society.

00:34:52.852 --> 00:34:55.134
He's shocked by the women.

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:58.267
Who are, he says, out in the streets.

00:34:58.267 --> 00:35:00.466
Meddling in politics.

00:35:00.466 --> 00:35:04.043
Leaving what's important
in their nurseries behind.

00:35:04.043 --> 00:35:05.782
Searching for pleasure in the streets.

00:35:05.782 --> 00:35:09.311
Women, upper class women did
not go around by themselves.

00:35:09.311 --> 00:35:10.503
They went around escorted.

00:35:10.503 --> 00:35:12.797
So when he talks about
women in the streets,

00:35:12.797 --> 00:35:15.637
it makes it sound almost
like they're prostitutes.

00:35:15.637 --> 00:35:18.674
Because they are seeking
pleasure in the streets.

00:35:18.674 --> 00:35:20.591
And this horrifies him.

00:35:21.443 --> 00:35:22.482
When he comes to,

00:35:22.482 --> 00:35:27.306
I should say he goes to
France in a sort of foul mood.

00:35:27.306 --> 00:35:29.176
His wife has died.

00:35:29.176 --> 00:35:33.062
There had been, he had had
a terrible time as governor.

00:35:33.062 --> 00:35:35.417
Wasn't very successful as governor.

00:35:35.417 --> 00:35:39.702
And he was a little angry
with Virginians at this time.

00:35:39.702 --> 00:35:42.420
When he goes to France, he
had this sort of epiphany.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.289
The sort of thing that happens when you,

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:46.416
you have complaints about
your country and then you go

00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:47.911
to another country and then you say well,

00:35:47.911 --> 00:35:50.726
at least we're not doing that.

00:35:50.726 --> 00:35:54.262
That was his attitude about France.

00:35:54.262 --> 00:35:55.774
And he sees people starving.

00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:58.744
This is pre-revolutionary
France, the 1780s.

00:35:58.744 --> 00:36:01.142
People are starving in the streets.

00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:03.395
There are riots, there are bread riots.

00:36:03.395 --> 00:36:05.816
And he says, you know, we
don't have this in America.

00:36:05.816 --> 00:36:07.365
We have enslaved people.

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.866
But he thinks about himself.

00:36:09.866 --> 00:36:11.578
As slave owner.

00:36:11.578 --> 00:36:15.745
And he sees himself in that
term, that we sort of ridicule.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.057
As a benevolent patriarch.

00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:23.317
That's his construction of himself.

00:36:23.317 --> 00:36:25.761
And he says, well, what we could do

00:36:25.761 --> 00:36:29.678
is we can hold on until
public opinion changes.

00:36:31.623 --> 00:36:33.943
And we can do something about slavery.

00:36:33.943 --> 00:36:36.623
But we don't have women running crazy.

00:36:36.623 --> 00:36:39.650
We don't have people
starving in the streets.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.828
The other thing that happens
while he's in France,

00:36:41.828 --> 00:36:46.677
is that he's there with James
Hemings and Sally Hemings.

00:36:46.677 --> 00:36:50.037
James and Sally Hemings
are the half siblings

00:36:50.037 --> 00:36:53.188
to his wife, to his deceased wife.

00:36:53.188 --> 00:36:55.962
Martha Wayles Jefferson's
father, John Wayles,

00:36:55.962 --> 00:36:58.492
had six children with Elizabeth Hemings.

00:36:58.492 --> 00:37:02.137
And the youngest was Sarah
Hemings, or Sally Hemings.

00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:03.620
And James was one of the sons.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.534
Jefferson brought him to France
to learn how to be a cook.

00:37:07.534 --> 00:37:09.312
A chef, a French chef.

00:37:09.312 --> 00:37:10.981
And Sally Hemings came over

00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:12.877
accompanying Jefferson's daughters.

00:37:12.877 --> 00:37:14.741
As a companion to Jefferson's daughters.

00:37:14.741 --> 00:37:17.032
While they are there, he pays them wages.

00:37:17.032 --> 00:37:20.199
And James has free movement in France.

00:37:21.136 --> 00:37:23.709
So Jefferson, the other
thing that Peter and I argue

00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:26.826
is that they become the
faces of slavery to him.

00:37:26.826 --> 00:37:29.743
His understanding about
himself as a slave holder

00:37:29.743 --> 00:37:32.616
in this kind of weird state where people,

00:37:32.616 --> 00:37:34.789
he owns them by Virginia law.

00:37:34.789 --> 00:37:39.505
But they're in this place where
they are potentially free.

00:37:39.505 --> 00:37:43.244
Because any enslaved person
who petitions for freedom

00:37:43.244 --> 00:37:45.815
in Paris in the 18th century, all of them,

00:37:45.815 --> 00:37:48.187
the petitions were granted.

00:37:48.187 --> 00:37:50.574
So all they had to do was
to go to the admiral court,

00:37:50.574 --> 00:37:53.674
and they would be free people.

00:37:53.674 --> 00:37:55.652
At some point,

00:37:55.652 --> 00:37:57.862
Madison Hemings, who is the son of,

00:37:57.862 --> 00:38:00.111
was the son of Thomas
Jefferson and Sally Hemings,

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:01.942
who's telling the story of his parents.

00:38:01.942 --> 00:38:06.189
Says Sally Hemings becomes
pregnant by Jefferson.

00:38:06.189 --> 00:38:08.484
Near the end of their stay.

00:38:08.484 --> 00:38:13.001
And she does not want to come
back to the United States.

00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:14.293
With Jefferson.

00:38:14.293 --> 00:38:18.055
Because she knows that any
child she has in Virginia

00:38:18.055 --> 00:38:19.148
will be enslaved.

00:38:19.148 --> 00:38:21.972
Virginia followed the
rule, pardiseco ruvanchum,

00:38:21.972 --> 00:38:24.871
you are what your mother was.

00:38:24.871 --> 00:38:27.356
This was not the rule that
the colonists came over with.

00:38:27.356 --> 00:38:29.302
The English rule that they came over with

00:38:29.302 --> 00:38:31.717
which was you were what your father was.

00:38:31.717 --> 00:38:35.884
But you can think about how
pardiseco ruvanchum is better.

00:38:37.301 --> 00:38:39.233
It makes for things more manageable.

00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:41.379
If you're creating a slave society.

00:38:41.379 --> 00:38:43.889
The sexuality of women
was much more controlled

00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:45.806
by society than male's.

00:38:47.344 --> 00:38:48.790
You would have,

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.771
and of course men could
have many more children

00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:52.040
than women can have.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.252
You would potentially have
a large class of mixed raced

00:38:55.252 --> 00:38:58.074
free people, which they did not want.

00:38:58.074 --> 00:39:01.656
So she understood what
the situation would be

00:39:01.656 --> 00:39:04.239
if she went back to
France with this child.

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:07.239
And any other children that she had.

00:39:08.154 --> 00:39:10.237
So Jefferson promises her

00:39:11.588 --> 00:39:14.102
that if she comes back with him,

00:39:14.102 --> 00:39:16.139
she would have a good life at Monticello.

00:39:16.139 --> 00:39:19.203
And that the children would be freed

00:39:19.203 --> 00:39:20.447
when they were 21.

00:39:20.447 --> 00:39:23.384
They would live with them and
they would leave as adults.

00:39:23.384 --> 00:39:25.541
Now, she accepts this.

00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:27.492
And this was a sort of
a difficult thing for me

00:39:27.492 --> 00:39:30.675
when I was writing my
first book to understand.

00:39:30.675 --> 00:39:33.682
But it wasn't until I started
working on the Hemingses

00:39:33.682 --> 00:39:35.432
of Monticello that...

00:39:36.485 --> 00:39:38.686
When you're doing a
biography, you have to sort of

00:39:38.686 --> 00:39:40.649
move yourself out.

00:39:40.649 --> 00:39:44.143
Stand aside and not talk
about what you would do.

00:39:44.143 --> 00:39:46.679
Again, what you think
other people ought to do.

00:39:46.679 --> 00:39:50.856
Because I would have said, stay in France.

00:39:50.856 --> 00:39:52.990
But then I can't say that
because I know some of their

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.819
descendants and that would be like saying

00:39:54.819 --> 00:39:57.613
I wish you were not here.

00:39:57.613 --> 00:40:00.559
But you know, that would
be the logical thing to do.

00:40:00.559 --> 00:40:02.211
But when I began to work on the book

00:40:02.211 --> 00:40:05.853
and I saw how he had treated her family.

00:40:05.853 --> 00:40:07.936
Her brothers, James I
mentioned and Robert.

00:40:07.936 --> 00:40:08.853
And Martin.

00:40:10.013 --> 00:40:11.500
Even before he went to France,

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.331
James and Martin and Robert,

00:40:14.331 --> 00:40:17.774
lots of times Jefferson didn't
even know where they were.

00:40:17.774 --> 00:40:19.615
They hired their own time.

00:40:19.615 --> 00:40:21.182
They traveled around.

00:40:21.182 --> 00:40:22.956
They didn't live,

00:40:22.956 --> 00:40:24.748
they were enslaved by law.

00:40:24.748 --> 00:40:26.217
Obviously, they were enslaved.

00:40:26.217 --> 00:40:28.655
But they didn't have a
life like other people

00:40:28.655 --> 00:40:30.454
down the mountain.

00:40:30.454 --> 00:40:32.324
I think Jefferson,

00:40:32.324 --> 00:40:35.705
the word co-opted is maybe pejorative.

00:40:35.705 --> 00:40:39.524
But he treated the Hemingses
in a different enough way

00:40:39.524 --> 00:40:43.612
that they began to see
themselves as a cast apart.

00:40:43.612 --> 00:40:45.658
She had seen him

00:40:45.658 --> 00:40:47.893
treat her brothers in this fashion.

00:40:47.893 --> 00:40:51.282
And I think Madison Hemings said

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:53.176
she trusted him implicitly.

00:40:53.176 --> 00:40:55.068
And that's another thing
that you kind of pause over

00:40:55.068 --> 00:40:57.172
and say, why would you trust him?

00:40:57.172 --> 00:40:59.236
But when I began to look at the family

00:40:59.236 --> 00:41:01.150
and how he treated them,

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.033
if you're 16, which is another point.

00:41:04.033 --> 00:41:05.450
16 is very young.

00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:11.102
16 is not in the 1780s, is not 16 today.

00:41:14.515 --> 00:41:18.223
I mean, we've sort of extended childhood.

00:41:18.223 --> 00:41:19.481
To the 30s maybe.

00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:21.347
(laughter)

00:41:21.347 --> 00:41:22.365
40.

00:41:22.365 --> 00:41:24.572
I mean, the New York Times had an article

00:41:24.572 --> 00:41:27.193
few months back about
people who still go to their

00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:31.450
pediatricians when
they're like 29 years old.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.545
'Cause they're just used to them.

00:41:32.545 --> 00:41:35.448
And it's weird because
there are all kinds of adult

00:41:35.448 --> 00:41:39.730
problems that pediatricians
don't know anything about.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.661
But that's a diversion.

00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:42.662
The point is,

00:41:42.662 --> 00:41:43.934
she's 16.

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:44.767
And...

00:41:46.448 --> 00:41:47.703
When I was writing the Hemingses,

00:41:47.703 --> 00:41:49.556
my daughter was about 15 or 16.

00:41:49.556 --> 00:41:52.722
So of course I'm sitting
there thinking, like...

00:41:52.722 --> 00:41:55.225
You know, this is horrible.

00:41:55.225 --> 00:41:58.125
To contemplate, to think about.

00:41:58.125 --> 00:42:00.304
But she wouldn't have thought
of herself as a child.

00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:01.764
And he wouldn't have
thought of her as a child.

00:42:01.764 --> 00:42:06.612
The age of consent in Virginia
at this time period was 10.

00:42:06.612 --> 00:42:09.140
They raised it to 12.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.223
In the 1820s.

00:42:11.547 --> 00:42:14.271
There was a different
understanding about what women...

00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:15.878
I mean, women didn't go to college.

00:42:15.878 --> 00:42:16.986
They didn't have careers.

00:42:16.986 --> 00:42:19.499
There was a different understanding.

00:42:19.499 --> 00:42:20.859
But it was still young.

00:42:20.859 --> 00:42:24.017
For a person to make this kind of choice.

00:42:24.017 --> 00:42:25.521
Make this decision.

00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:28.419
And James Hemings, we
write about the fact that

00:42:28.419 --> 00:42:30.687
James Hemings was doing
things at this time.

00:42:30.687 --> 00:42:31.773
We don't have his words.

00:42:31.773 --> 00:42:33.866
But he's doing things at
the time that indicate

00:42:33.866 --> 00:42:35.170
that he wants to stay there.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.219
He hires a tutor.

00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:39.961
To teach him proper French.

00:42:39.961 --> 00:42:41.760
Now, he's been trained as a chef.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.185
And so it's much more
likely that the two of them

00:42:46.185 --> 00:42:48.989
had this idea that they
were going to stay.

00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:51.385
But Jefferson persuades them to come back.

00:42:51.385 --> 00:42:53.656
Persuades her to come back with him.

00:42:53.656 --> 00:42:54.788
And which she does.

00:42:54.788 --> 00:42:56.122
And Peter and I think

00:42:56.122 --> 00:43:00.023
that the combination of his
disdain for French society,

00:43:00.023 --> 00:43:04.190
his capacity to take these
two really anonymous people,

00:43:05.628 --> 00:43:07.597
people whose lives are not like,

00:43:07.597 --> 00:43:09.371
I mean, they're enslaved, there's the law.

00:43:09.371 --> 00:43:11.401
But he's not treating
them like other people

00:43:11.401 --> 00:43:12.880
down the mountain.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.545
And they are the faces of slavery for him.

00:43:16.545 --> 00:43:18.967
And by the time he comes back,

00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:21.718
he's thinking not about
getting rid of slavery.

00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:25.393
He's thinking about ways
to make slavery easier

00:43:25.393 --> 00:43:28.758
for African American women
by planting olive trees.

00:43:28.758 --> 00:43:31.597
So that, which were easy to pick.

00:43:31.597 --> 00:43:33.631
Olives were apparently not onerous.

00:43:33.631 --> 00:43:34.742
To pick.

00:43:34.742 --> 00:43:37.513
So he's thinking about
ways to ameliorate slavery.

00:43:37.513 --> 00:43:40.229
And once you begin to think
of yourself as someone

00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:42.468
who is making slavery better,

00:43:42.468 --> 00:43:44.218
you pretty much lost.

00:43:45.084 --> 00:43:46.351
I mean, you're...

00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:49.665
All of the kind of things
you do to help all the little

00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:52.527
gratuities that you give,

00:43:52.527 --> 00:43:54.082
all the leniencies that you give.

00:43:54.082 --> 00:43:55.944
All those kinds of things
allow you to pat yourself

00:43:55.944 --> 00:43:58.172
on the back and say

00:43:58.172 --> 00:43:59.984
I'm a good slave owner.

00:43:59.984 --> 00:44:01.520
And a good slaver owner is,

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.662
that's not something that
he would've as a young man,

00:44:04.662 --> 00:44:06.284
slavery was a state of war.

00:44:06.284 --> 00:44:07.578
Slavery was an evil.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:11.007
Slavery was not something
that could be made better.

00:44:11.007 --> 00:44:13.034
But after France,

00:44:13.034 --> 00:44:14.957
that's what he believes.

00:44:14.957 --> 00:44:16.771
And he comes back to Virginia

00:44:16.771 --> 00:44:20.058
determined to be a good slave owner.

00:44:20.058 --> 00:44:22.475
And by the time of his death,

00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:26.921
he is convinced that
that is what he's doing.

00:44:26.921 --> 00:44:30.588
He doesn't have the
faith in the end that...

00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:34.032
Even before the end,

00:44:34.032 --> 00:44:37.003
that this is gonna end in any kind of

00:44:37.003 --> 00:44:38.653
republican sort of way.

00:44:38.653 --> 00:44:40.261
But he keeps this faith.

00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:41.848
That something's going
to happen in the future.

00:44:41.848 --> 00:44:43.523
Now, again,

00:44:43.523 --> 00:44:45.581
this is not satisfactory to us.

00:44:45.581 --> 00:44:47.295
Because we want him,

00:44:47.295 --> 00:44:48.902
we want him to be better.

00:44:48.902 --> 00:44:51.735
I was at Monticello two weeks ago.

00:44:53.094 --> 00:44:54.103
It was just a week ago.

00:44:54.103 --> 00:44:55.795
It just seems...

00:44:55.795 --> 00:44:57.692
I've been so many places since this time,

00:44:57.692 --> 00:45:00.724
there was a summit there in Monticello

00:45:00.724 --> 00:45:02.888
that is actually online if you,

00:45:02.888 --> 00:45:04.543
I think it might be interesting to watch.

00:45:04.543 --> 00:45:08.822
It was a summit on slavery
and the legacy of race,

00:45:08.822 --> 00:45:11.068
the legacy of slavery and
race in the United States

00:45:11.068 --> 00:45:12.234
at Monticello.

00:45:12.234 --> 00:45:13.651
2100 people came.

00:45:14.704 --> 00:45:15.703
On the west lawn.

00:45:15.703 --> 00:45:17.357
People of all races.

00:45:17.357 --> 00:45:20.505
Members of the Hemings family,
descendants and so forth.

00:45:20.505 --> 00:45:22.202
And members of the public and everybody.

00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:23.973
There were two panels.

00:45:23.973 --> 00:45:25.601
Really an amazing time.

00:45:25.601 --> 00:45:27.800
I was given the chance
to sum everything up

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.036
and I had to say, I could not believe,

00:45:31.036 --> 00:45:32.037
I would never have believed,

00:45:32.037 --> 00:45:34.622
when Dylan was talking
about the conference that,

00:45:34.622 --> 00:45:37.970
summit walker's conference
that he's describing here.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.606
That we would be standing
on the lawn at Monticello.

00:45:40.606 --> 00:45:42.981
That there would be in
the visitor's center

00:45:42.981 --> 00:45:45.870
a gigantic family tree
of the Hemings family

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.523
with Jefferson on it.

00:45:47.523 --> 00:45:50.702
And a film that talks
about him being the father

00:45:50.702 --> 00:45:52.493
of Sally Hemings' children.

00:45:52.493 --> 00:45:55.894
And trying to reckon with
this legacy of this person.

00:45:55.894 --> 00:45:57.561
Who is good and bad.

00:46:01.169 --> 00:46:04.045
There's a lot of talk about moving statues

00:46:04.045 --> 00:46:06.624
and changing names and so forth.

00:46:06.624 --> 00:46:11.539
But he is so central to
American, the American story.

00:46:11.539 --> 00:46:14.142
That I think for me, it's better

00:46:14.142 --> 00:46:16.059
to sort of look at him.

00:46:17.117 --> 00:46:20.021
And talk about all of the
problems that we're having

00:46:20.021 --> 00:46:23.412
because every single thing
that we're talking about today

00:46:23.412 --> 00:46:26.188
were things that he anticipated.

00:46:26.188 --> 00:46:27.305
In the area of race.

00:46:27.305 --> 00:46:30.079
The difficulty of fitting
blacks into the society.

00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:32.698
The questions of gender.

00:46:32.698 --> 00:46:34.537
Questions of republicanism.

00:46:34.537 --> 00:46:35.818
And citizenship.

00:46:35.818 --> 00:46:38.063
All of this things are in his story.

00:46:38.063 --> 00:46:39.717
And what Peter and I wanted to capture

00:46:39.717 --> 00:46:43.107
to sort of recapture was why
this person was important.

00:46:43.107 --> 00:46:45.201
Not just as a whipping boy.

00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:47.063
Not as somebody to just criticize.

00:46:47.063 --> 00:46:50.754
But a person whose life can
explicate who we really are.

00:46:50.754 --> 00:46:52.644
There was a saying that,

00:46:52.644 --> 00:46:56.451
that sort of collapses
Jefferson into America.

00:46:56.451 --> 00:46:59.531
Jefferson is sort of
an exemplar of America.

00:46:59.531 --> 00:47:01.933
And I really do think that's true.

00:47:01.933 --> 00:47:04.091
It's sort of unfair to him as a person

00:47:04.091 --> 00:47:06.579
to sort of carry the legacy
of an entire country.

00:47:06.579 --> 00:47:09.409
Or to be compared to an entire country.

00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:12.777
But studying his life
is a way of studying us.

00:47:12.777 --> 00:47:15.506
And it's endlessly fascinating.

00:47:15.506 --> 00:47:18.769
And I think it's just
endlessly important as well.

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:21.503
So I would like to stop talking now

00:47:21.503 --> 00:47:23.413
and I would like to hear your questions.

00:47:23.413 --> 00:47:25.663
(applause)

00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:36.480
- You talk about Jefferson's
view of slavery evolving

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.980
over his lifetime.

00:47:39.426 --> 00:47:42.202
Do you see any connections
between his evolving economic

00:47:42.202 --> 00:47:46.499
circumstances and his
evolving view of slavery?

00:47:46.499 --> 00:47:47.332
- Well,

00:47:49.376 --> 00:47:52.126
his economic circumstances didn't

00:47:54.091 --> 00:47:57.687
really evolve other than
to get worse and worse.

00:47:57.687 --> 00:47:59.020
I don't think...

00:48:01.241 --> 00:48:02.722
The problem is, Jefferson didn't think

00:48:02.722 --> 00:48:04.639
enough about economics.

00:48:05.753 --> 00:48:08.132
Jefferson didn't really
understand economics.

00:48:08.132 --> 00:48:11.296
Jefferson had memorandum books.

00:48:11.296 --> 00:48:13.871
Where he kept a record of
every single expenditure

00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:15.471
that he ever made.

00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:18.318
But he never added anything up.

00:48:18.318 --> 00:48:20.568
(laughter)

00:48:21.504 --> 00:48:22.800
So it's like,

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.816
you go out and you buy three
dollars and 50 cents for

00:48:25.816 --> 00:48:28.894
a cappuccino and you put down the date.

00:48:28.894 --> 00:48:30.033
And everything.

00:48:30.033 --> 00:48:31.978
But you never...

00:48:31.978 --> 00:48:34.741
You never have any sense of where you are.

00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:36.344
When he left the presidency,

00:48:36.344 --> 00:48:39.081
there was one time he did
decide to total things up.

00:48:39.081 --> 00:48:40.799
And he was shocked.

00:48:40.799 --> 00:48:42.466
At how broke he was.

00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:46.063
He didn't, money...

00:48:46.063 --> 00:48:48.427
He talked a lot about money.

00:48:48.427 --> 00:48:49.701
And wanting money.

00:48:49.701 --> 00:48:50.784
But he didn't

00:48:51.814 --> 00:48:55.491
spend as much energy on that as he did

00:48:55.491 --> 00:48:57.741
writing about politics.

00:48:57.741 --> 00:49:01.817
And participating in
the republic of letters.

00:49:01.817 --> 00:49:04.435
Monticello was not a prosperous farm farm.

00:49:04.435 --> 00:49:06.769
Most of the people at Monticello,

00:49:06.769 --> 00:49:09.936
he had a very relatively few people...

00:49:11.353 --> 00:49:13.261
He didn't have as many
people in the fields

00:49:13.261 --> 00:49:14.594
as he should have.

00:49:14.594 --> 00:49:17.428
We're talking about this as he
should have been doing this.

00:49:17.428 --> 00:49:20.140
But many people in the fields as...

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.797
He needed to actually be prosperous.

00:49:21.797 --> 00:49:24.910
Most of the people there
were working on the house.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.790
And doing his mechanical things

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:30.038
that were not really prosperous.

00:49:30.038 --> 00:49:32.590
He had a nail factory.

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.252
That was prosperous for a time.

00:49:34.252 --> 00:49:36.291
And then the British started selling nails

00:49:36.291 --> 00:49:39.703
and sort of basically ruined his market.

00:49:39.703 --> 00:49:40.536
I don't...

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:44.641
I don't think his attitude about slavery,

00:49:44.641 --> 00:49:49.379
there's some arguments that
he became wedded to slavery

00:49:49.379 --> 00:49:50.963
because it was more profitable.

00:49:50.963 --> 00:49:52.396
He realized it was profitable.

00:49:52.396 --> 00:49:54.813
But it wasn't really for him.

00:49:57.318 --> 00:49:59.407
I guess the suggestion that he was making

00:49:59.407 --> 00:50:01.584
a certain percentage of money,

00:50:01.584 --> 00:50:03.797
a 4% plan or something like that.

00:50:03.797 --> 00:50:05.724
That he was making a lot of money.

00:50:05.724 --> 00:50:08.372
Which is not a great return on investment.

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.932
The people who were really
prosperous had seven or eight.

00:50:10.932 --> 00:50:13.899
I mean, it was much bigger than that.

00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:16.422
I just don't think that he...

00:50:16.422 --> 00:50:17.757
He talked about economics.

00:50:17.757 --> 00:50:20.114
But it really, money was not a driving

00:50:20.114 --> 00:50:21.720
force in his life.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.502
Because if it had been,

00:50:23.502 --> 00:50:27.182
he would have done, he would
have been more attentive to it.

00:50:27.182 --> 00:50:29.921
When his grandson takes over the farm,

00:50:29.921 --> 00:50:31.960
in the 18 teens,

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.960
production went up like three times.

00:50:36.146 --> 00:50:39.223
He just wasn't attentive to it at all.

00:50:39.223 --> 00:50:40.314
He talked of gain.

00:50:40.314 --> 00:50:43.097
He talked around it, but
you know when Jefferson is

00:50:43.097 --> 00:50:45.041
obsessed about something.

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.041
Because you know it,

00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:47.231
because you know what he's doing.

00:50:47.231 --> 00:50:49.285
You can see it and he's counting the peas.

00:50:49.285 --> 00:50:51.666
The number of peas in a peck.

00:50:51.666 --> 00:50:54.812
Individually counting them out.

00:50:54.812 --> 00:50:56.451
That kind of focus.

00:50:56.451 --> 00:50:57.954
He didn't have that for the economics

00:50:57.954 --> 00:51:01.658
or he would've been in a better situation.

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:02.657
- Hi there.

00:51:02.657 --> 00:51:04.839
You made the point earlier that Jefferson

00:51:04.839 --> 00:51:07.444
targeted a lot of his fire
power on the federalists.

00:51:07.444 --> 00:51:08.444
I'm curious,

00:51:08.444 --> 00:51:11.763
was there anyone that he
grappled with to his other flank,

00:51:11.763 --> 00:51:13.518
whichever side that would be,

00:51:13.518 --> 00:51:15.361
that was more of a cahoonian stripe?

00:51:15.361 --> 00:51:17.733
Or a positive good view of slavery

00:51:17.733 --> 00:51:21.287
if Jefferson was more
of a gradual extinction,

00:51:21.287 --> 00:51:22.371
necessary evil?

00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.593
And maybe if you could
provide any insight into that.

00:51:25.593 --> 00:51:29.214
Also, how would he have
responded to those arguments

00:51:29.214 --> 00:51:31.474
in the context of the brewing civil war?

00:51:31.474 --> 00:51:33.360
- You know, that's...

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.193
Well.

00:51:35.469 --> 00:51:38.883
The founding generation was of the view

00:51:38.883 --> 00:51:41.673
that slavery was a necessary evil.

00:51:41.673 --> 00:51:42.675
Right?

00:51:42.675 --> 00:51:43.675
I mean,

00:51:43.675 --> 00:51:46.529
the South Carolinians were into it.

00:51:46.529 --> 00:51:49.112
But people, people in Virginia,

00:51:50.505 --> 00:51:51.505
that was their story.

00:51:51.505 --> 00:51:52.991
That this was a necessary evil

00:51:52.991 --> 00:51:54.592
that was eventually gonna go away.

00:51:54.592 --> 00:51:55.598
It was a back,

00:51:55.598 --> 00:51:57.600
like think of something
backwards we do now.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.069
That we say oh,

00:51:59.069 --> 00:52:03.171
one of these days people
aren't gonna do that anymore.

00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:06.506
He dies before we really began to get

00:52:06.506 --> 00:52:09.028
the pro-slavery ideology.

00:52:09.028 --> 00:52:12.258
He just misses the real you know,

00:52:12.258 --> 00:52:16.018
Thomas Dew and his own grand children.

00:52:16.018 --> 00:52:18.803
Who began to shift over.

00:52:18.803 --> 00:52:22.970
Well, his eldest grandson
introduces an emancipation plan.

00:52:23.834 --> 00:52:26.660
His grandfather's emancipation plan.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.097
Tries to introduce that in the,

00:52:29.097 --> 00:52:30.782
in a sort of constitutional
convention they have

00:52:30.782 --> 00:52:33.098
after Jefferson dies.

00:52:33.098 --> 00:52:35.289
But no, he was, slavery
was a necessary evil.

00:52:35.289 --> 00:52:37.279
And he misses the beginning,

00:52:37.279 --> 00:52:39.955
the nascent pro-slavery ideology.

00:52:39.955 --> 00:52:41.837
How he would've responded to it,

00:52:41.837 --> 00:52:43.203
it's hard to say.

00:52:43.203 --> 00:52:44.204
It's hard to say.

00:52:44.204 --> 00:52:47.105
People ask, how would he
have responded to the war?

00:52:47.105 --> 00:52:49.368
What would he have done?

00:52:49.368 --> 00:52:50.800
It would've been excruciating for him.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.800
He hated, hated England.

00:52:54.812 --> 00:52:57.694
And the idea that the south at some point

00:52:57.694 --> 00:52:59.692
is making overtures to England,

00:52:59.692 --> 00:53:02.239
or the idea that any one of those sides

00:53:02.239 --> 00:53:05.422
would've been relying on
the Europeans to help them.

00:53:05.422 --> 00:53:07.966
That was the whole
point of the revolution.

00:53:07.966 --> 00:53:11.146
Is to separate, to get out of that.

00:53:11.146 --> 00:53:12.492
On the other hand,

00:53:12.492 --> 00:53:14.664
he loved Virginia.

00:53:14.664 --> 00:53:18.458
So it would've been the
patriotic love of his country

00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:21.124
with the place that he
knew as his country first,

00:53:21.124 --> 00:53:24.707
against his hatred of
the idea of Americans

00:53:26.763 --> 00:53:30.263
siding with Europeans against one another.

00:53:31.132 --> 00:53:32.928
I don't know what he would've done.

00:53:32.928 --> 00:53:37.011
His granddaughter, Ellen
Coolidge was a unionist.

00:53:37.984 --> 00:53:40.436
But then she moved to Massachusetts.

00:53:40.436 --> 00:53:42.928
His grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph

00:53:42.928 --> 00:53:44.212
was a confederate.

00:53:44.212 --> 00:53:49.043
And his youngest grandson,
George Wythe Randolph

00:53:49.043 --> 00:53:51.609
was the secretary of the confederacy.

00:53:51.609 --> 00:53:52.442
So...

00:53:53.585 --> 00:53:56.903
Even the grandchildren
were split on all of that.

00:53:56.903 --> 00:53:59.790
But I know it would've been
excruciating for him because...

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:02.722
And when he writes about
the Missouri compromise,

00:54:02.722 --> 00:54:06.917
the controversy in between 1819 and 1820,

00:54:06.917 --> 00:54:08.767
the fire bell in the night letter.

00:54:08.767 --> 00:54:10.653
He says this is like a
fire bell in the night.

00:54:10.653 --> 00:54:12.065
You can hear the anguish.

00:54:12.065 --> 00:54:15.795
Because he's realizing they're
gonna go to war about this.

00:54:15.795 --> 00:54:17.198
All this thing, where he's saying,

00:54:17.198 --> 00:54:19.600
oh, we're eventually gonna come to some

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.213
amicable agreement about it.

00:54:21.213 --> 00:54:23.628
He realizes, that's not gonna happen.

00:54:23.628 --> 00:54:24.461
This is,

00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:26.801
is the death now.

00:54:26.801 --> 00:54:29.792
It'll be the rock upon
which the union will split.

00:54:29.792 --> 00:54:33.125
And that was a horrifying notion to him.

00:54:34.539 --> 00:54:37.632
- On a more domestic area, level,

00:54:37.632 --> 00:54:39.882
you talk about his progeny.

00:54:41.435 --> 00:54:43.334
And I'm interested in knowing
a little bit more about

00:54:43.334 --> 00:54:46.874
how he may have felt about his children

00:54:46.874 --> 00:54:49.047
that he had with Sally.

00:54:49.047 --> 00:54:51.576
How many, I'm not clear
about how many he had.

00:54:51.576 --> 00:54:52.659
But was he...

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:58.891
I try to imagine how he would
feel about these children

00:54:59.948 --> 00:55:04.045
who are his and grandchildren
who are also his.

00:55:04.045 --> 00:55:05.655
Given the times.

00:55:05.655 --> 00:55:08.202
- It's hard to wrap your mind around it.

00:55:08.202 --> 00:55:09.702
The idea of having

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:14.779
children or family members
that are your legal,

00:55:14.779 --> 00:55:15.770
that you legally own.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:19.008
Now of course parents
don't own their kids.

00:55:19.008 --> 00:55:21.675
But that, the power over
kids is something that

00:55:21.675 --> 00:55:25.376
obviously that would've
existed as legal children.

00:55:25.376 --> 00:55:29.969
Madison Hemings said that
he was not in the habit

00:55:29.969 --> 00:55:32.395
of showing us partiality.

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:33.874
Or fatherly affection.

00:55:33.874 --> 00:55:35.568
And he compares,

00:55:35.568 --> 00:55:37.995
he said but he was affectionate
with his grandchildren.

00:55:37.995 --> 00:55:40.662
Now his grandchildren are, were,

00:55:42.222 --> 00:55:45.917
of the same generation pretty
much as the Hemings children.

00:55:45.917 --> 00:55:48.672
So what he seems to be talking about

00:55:48.672 --> 00:55:50.639
is the fact that Jefferson was you know,

00:55:50.639 --> 00:55:52.198
bounced him on the knee
and patted him on the head

00:55:52.198 --> 00:55:55.031
and did all these kinds of things.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:00.047
Contingency is so important
as historians always know.

00:56:01.062 --> 00:56:03.796
I think it's really significant that

00:56:03.796 --> 00:56:06.567
Jefferson's legal daughter, Martha,

00:56:06.567 --> 00:56:09.802
when her husband fails essentially,

00:56:09.802 --> 00:56:12.437
they have to move back to Monticello.

00:56:12.437 --> 00:56:15.187
So in 1809, she moves her family,

00:56:16.218 --> 00:56:19.847
the husband and all the
kids into Monticello.

00:56:19.847 --> 00:56:23.556
And that, and I wonder
what would've happened

00:56:23.556 --> 00:56:26.079
to the Hemings children.

00:56:26.079 --> 00:56:28.676
There were, Sally Hemings
had seven children.

00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:31.067
Four of them lived to adulthood.

00:56:31.067 --> 00:56:33.013
If their lives would've been different

00:56:33.013 --> 00:56:35.716
if the legal white
grandchildren had not been

00:56:35.716 --> 00:56:36.953
in the same place.

00:56:36.953 --> 00:56:40.788
Because there's no way
that a man of that class,

00:56:40.788 --> 00:56:43.788
that man of that, he could not treat

00:56:44.931 --> 00:56:48.829
those children the same way he treats

00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:51.329
his legal white grandchildren.

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:54.988
I mean, it might be bad enough

00:56:54.988 --> 00:56:57.585
that he has a mistress.

00:56:57.585 --> 00:56:59.252
His daughter's aunt.

00:57:00.936 --> 00:57:02.534
If you think about this.

00:57:02.534 --> 00:57:06.178
So you know, this is all
speculation on my part.

00:57:06.178 --> 00:57:09.793
But I just can't see how
he could've treated them

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.030
exactly the same.

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:12.335
Treated them like white kids.

00:57:12.335 --> 00:57:13.977
Because Martha wouldn't have liked that.

00:57:13.977 --> 00:57:16.177
What I do know from doing,

00:57:16.177 --> 00:57:17.578
I hadn't paid very much attention to this

00:57:17.578 --> 00:57:20.117
because I was doing something
different in the first book.

00:57:20.117 --> 00:57:22.399
There are a series of
letters that Jefferson writes

00:57:22.399 --> 00:57:25.259
to his overseer at Poplar Forest.

00:57:25.259 --> 00:57:27.435
And he's talking about his coming visits.

00:57:27.435 --> 00:57:31.628
And he will say, I'm
coming with Johnny Hemings

00:57:31.628 --> 00:57:33.256
and his assistants.

00:57:33.256 --> 00:57:35.956
Johnny Hemings' assistants were Madison,

00:57:35.956 --> 00:57:39.033
depending upon the years, were
Beverly Madison and Eston.

00:57:39.033 --> 00:57:40.100
The sons.

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.212
Jefferson had put them under
the tutelage of John Hemings.

00:57:43.212 --> 00:57:45.581
John Hemings was his favorite artisan.

00:57:45.581 --> 00:57:46.916
And he spent a lot of time.

00:57:46.916 --> 00:57:48.789
Jefferson was a wood worker himself.

00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:50.199
He spent a lot of time with him.

00:57:50.199 --> 00:57:52.515
So he takes these young men

00:57:52.515 --> 00:57:54.866
and puts them under the
tutelage of a person

00:57:54.866 --> 00:57:56.699
that he is with a lot.

00:57:58.033 --> 00:57:59.814
So he's with them a lot.

00:57:59.814 --> 00:58:02.132
So they go to Poplar Forest.

00:58:02.132 --> 00:58:03.532
They are isolated.

00:58:03.532 --> 00:58:05.672
It's 90 miles from Monticello.

00:58:05.672 --> 00:58:06.975
Monticello's in the woods.

00:58:06.975 --> 00:58:09.164
This is even more in the woods.

00:58:09.164 --> 00:58:11.292
So he's there with them.

00:58:11.292 --> 00:58:13.284
For weeks at a time.

00:58:13.284 --> 00:58:15.915
So we don't know what he's like.

00:58:15.915 --> 00:58:18.547
All three of them play the violin.

00:58:18.547 --> 00:58:19.874
As he played the violin.

00:58:19.874 --> 00:58:22.076
They're named for his favorite cousins.

00:58:22.076 --> 00:58:24.138
And best friends.

00:58:24.138 --> 00:58:26.947
Madison Hemings is James Madison Hemings.

00:58:26.947 --> 00:58:28.947
Beverly, the eldest son,

00:58:30.128 --> 00:58:34.295
is described at one point as
ascending a hot air balloon.

00:58:35.413 --> 00:58:37.764
After he escapes from Monticello.

00:58:37.764 --> 00:58:40.011
They basically leave to
live as white people.

00:58:40.011 --> 00:58:42.070
Beverly and Harriet were the two oldest

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:43.412
who went to live as white people.

00:58:43.412 --> 00:58:44.745
And we know nothing about them.

00:58:44.745 --> 00:58:46.545
Because they had no freedom papers.

00:58:46.545 --> 00:58:47.962
There's no paper record.

00:58:47.962 --> 00:58:49.989
They disappeared into
whiteness and we don't know

00:58:49.989 --> 00:58:50.989
anything about them.

00:58:50.989 --> 00:58:55.751
So hot air ballooning was
the Jefferson fascination.

00:58:55.751 --> 00:58:57.463
He was obsessed with that.

00:58:57.463 --> 00:58:58.798
So there are these little,

00:58:58.798 --> 00:59:02.965
Eston Hemings made his
living as a musician in Ohio.

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.728
And his signature tune was
a song called Money Musk.

00:59:07.728 --> 00:59:10.499
And that was one of the few
songs that Jefferson copied out

00:59:10.499 --> 00:59:12.041
by hand.

00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:14.655
In his, you know, he
didn't really care for

00:59:14.655 --> 00:59:16.252
popular music as much.

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.393
He liked classical music.

00:59:17.393 --> 00:59:20.048
That was one of the few
songs that he copied out

00:59:20.048 --> 00:59:22.028
in his own in his music book.

00:59:22.028 --> 00:59:24.280
So all these little tantalizing things

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.863
that suggest that he
is connecting to them.

00:59:28.768 --> 00:59:29.933
But we don't,

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:31.230
he can't write about them.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:33.497
He could not write about this.

00:59:33.497 --> 00:59:36.219
And Madison doesn't talk about this

00:59:36.219 --> 00:59:39.097
except to compare himself
to the grandchildren.

00:59:39.097 --> 00:59:42.171
And he's sort of like
the typical grandfather.

00:59:42.171 --> 00:59:45.745
But a father who you sort of see as,

00:59:45.745 --> 00:59:47.968
you get the sense that
he's sort of training them.

00:59:47.968 --> 00:59:50.912
Making sure they're trained to do things.

00:59:50.912 --> 00:59:52.543
They're never servants.

00:59:52.543 --> 00:59:54.315
But they're trained as carpenters.

00:59:54.315 --> 00:59:56.277
If they were to show up today,

00:59:56.277 --> 00:59:58.225
they'd have a job.

00:59:58.225 --> 01:00:01.569
Not as a, not working with a blacksmith.

01:00:01.569 --> 01:00:03.416
Not working with the horses or whatever.

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:08.017
But something that he knew
would always be needed.

01:00:08.017 --> 01:00:12.070
So we don't really know other
than those little bits of,

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:14.852
other than the facts that he makes them,

01:00:14.852 --> 01:00:17.685
he puts themselves in their lives.

01:00:19.036 --> 01:00:20.590
Thank you.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:21.964
- Yes.

01:00:21.964 --> 01:00:24.328
Welcome, Professor Reed to the Bay area.

01:00:24.328 --> 01:00:26.948
Just a quick question,
maybe a plea for help.

01:00:26.948 --> 01:00:28.865
Jefferson's always been

01:00:30.305 --> 01:00:31.526
someone that I always admired.

01:00:31.526 --> 01:00:32.693
His writing...

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.225
Founding father and you know...

01:00:36.225 --> 01:00:39.916
I had a couple kids and I
try to pass that on to them.

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:41.086
Now they're in the university.

01:00:41.086 --> 01:00:43.257
And you're right, it's
for them to get over

01:00:43.257 --> 01:00:45.507
the whole stain of slavery.

01:00:46.437 --> 01:00:48.342
And every time I bring Jefferson up,

01:00:48.342 --> 01:00:50.490
they throw it back in my face.

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:53.152
So I was gonna ask your assistance how...

01:00:53.152 --> 01:00:54.691
- I mean, he was a slave owner.

01:00:54.691 --> 01:00:59.280
- Is there anything that
you would still try to

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.025
maybe try to convey to younger people

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:03.905
about the importance and what he meant?

01:01:03.905 --> 01:01:08.468
My daughter's in the
audience, so you can just...

01:01:08.468 --> 01:01:09.801
- Don't give up.

01:01:11.345 --> 01:01:13.678
Well, because there isn't...

01:01:15.194 --> 01:01:18.571
He's at the center of so
much that's in America.

01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:20.654
History is not just about

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.918
your best BFF.

01:01:23.918 --> 01:01:25.847
The people that you like the best

01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:27.111
and you wanna have fun with.

01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:29.793
There's a lot to admire,

01:01:29.793 --> 01:01:31.656
but there's a lot to be concerned about.

01:01:31.656 --> 01:01:34.548
And I think he's an important
figure for grappling

01:01:34.548 --> 01:01:36.697
with serious, serious issues.

01:01:36.697 --> 01:01:39.178
He's also been made I think the fall guy

01:01:39.178 --> 01:01:41.555
for race and slavery.

01:01:41.555 --> 01:01:42.554
Because it's easy.

01:01:42.554 --> 01:01:45.125
One of the interesting things
about Hamilton the play,

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:46.178
has anybody seen that?

01:01:46.178 --> 01:01:47.177
Does anybody...

01:01:47.177 --> 01:01:48.179
Yeah.

01:01:48.179 --> 01:01:49.182
So a few people.

01:01:49.182 --> 01:01:51.520
Lucky people went out to see it.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.103
If you did not know

01:01:54.787 --> 01:01:57.207
American history, you would
think the only slave owner

01:01:57.207 --> 01:01:59.790
up on that stage was Jefferson.

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:04.173
Washington is not linked to slavery.

01:02:04.173 --> 01:02:06.923
Madison is not linked to slavery.

01:02:08.854 --> 01:02:12.451
Or the sort of racial
attitudes that Jefferson has

01:02:12.451 --> 01:02:14.197
as a racist, these were the,

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:16.786
this is the, his garden variety.

01:02:16.786 --> 01:02:18.384
I've called him one time in my,

01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:21.884
in an article, a garden variety white guy.

01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:25.900
And a church in Greenwich
village put that up on the...

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.006
On their little thing.

01:02:27.006 --> 01:02:28.183
Jefferson, garden variety white guy.

01:02:28.183 --> 01:02:30.999
No, and people want to suggest, you know,

01:02:30.999 --> 01:02:33.421
when he says white people may be smarter,

01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:35.749
I ventured as a suspicion only.

01:02:35.749 --> 01:02:37.822
That whites are smarter than blacks.

01:02:37.822 --> 01:02:39.940
Of course he believed that
whites are smarter than blacks.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.498
Better looking and all that.

01:02:41.498 --> 01:02:44.320
These are, what is this all been about?

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.719
If a critical mass of
white people haven't felt

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.426
those exact things.

01:02:48.426 --> 01:02:50.570
And it's sort of not,

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:53.599
it's sort of running away
from the pervasiveness

01:02:53.599 --> 01:02:55.588
of that idea to sort of say

01:02:55.588 --> 01:02:57.383
well, there was this garden of Eden.

01:02:57.383 --> 01:03:00.528
And then the serpent came
in and it was Jefferson

01:03:00.528 --> 01:03:03.494
and then all of a sudden
white people became racist.

01:03:03.494 --> 01:03:04.494
It's like...

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:06.639
No, no, that's not,

01:03:06.639 --> 01:03:07.730
that's not what happened.

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:10.294
The reason he was a popular
politician is because

01:03:10.294 --> 01:03:12.324
he knew his people.

01:03:12.324 --> 01:03:15.107
He understood what they wanted.

01:03:15.107 --> 01:03:17.986
And that's what, that's what he did.

01:03:17.986 --> 01:03:20.339
Once he realized, they're
not going for this.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:22.658
They're not gonna vote slavery out.

01:03:22.658 --> 01:03:23.907
He's like, I'm out of it.

01:03:23.907 --> 01:03:25.570
I'm over here with the federalists,

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:28.043
and the judiciary and all these other

01:03:28.043 --> 01:03:32.210
structural civics type
things that he's fixated on.

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:34.101
So I think

01:03:35.749 --> 01:03:40.470
you don't really, my home
state wanted to take him out of

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:41.671
the history books.

01:03:41.671 --> 01:03:43.794
I'm from Texas and they wanted to,

01:03:43.794 --> 01:03:46.165
and everybody laughs.

01:03:46.165 --> 01:03:47.573
They wanted to take him
out of the history books.

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:49.861
They replaced him with John Calvin.

01:03:49.861 --> 01:03:50.694
And...

01:03:52.183 --> 01:03:54.933
That noted American, John Calvin.

01:03:56.052 --> 01:03:58.807
Because of, mainly because
of his views about religion,

01:03:58.807 --> 01:04:01.045
but I also think Sally
is part of it as well.

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:03.361
But you can't do that.

01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:06.607
There is no American
history without Jefferson.

01:04:06.607 --> 01:04:07.674
You know?

01:04:07.674 --> 01:04:08.868
If he doesn't,

01:04:08.868 --> 01:04:10.616
if he's not in American history books,

01:04:10.616 --> 01:04:12.948
nobody belongs in an
American history book.

01:04:12.948 --> 01:04:14.482
You just can't do it.

01:04:14.482 --> 01:04:17.763
It's like we're gonna have
the Mao and the long march

01:04:17.763 --> 01:04:19.258
and anytime somebody's disfavored,

01:04:19.258 --> 01:04:21.858
they kind of get airbrushed
out of the picture.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:24.366
We can't do that with him.

01:04:24.366 --> 01:04:26.801
Because he's too central to it.

01:04:26.801 --> 01:04:29.515
And there are problems, it
doesn't mean that you have to

01:04:29.515 --> 01:04:31.488
admire or worship anybody.

01:04:31.488 --> 01:04:32.793
That's not the goal of it.

01:04:32.793 --> 01:04:36.519
The goal is to grapple
seriously with the people

01:04:36.519 --> 01:04:39.779
who helped make the country
and put us on the road

01:04:39.779 --> 01:04:40.851
that we've been on.

01:04:40.851 --> 01:04:43.353
So you don't have to like him.

01:04:43.353 --> 01:04:45.982
A lot of people like him.

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.276
A lot of people love him,
a lot of people loathe him.

01:04:47.276 --> 01:04:50.994
But you have to recognize the importance.

01:04:50.994 --> 01:04:52.637
And going through all of these,

01:04:52.637 --> 01:04:55.117
the words, the things that are hurtful,

01:04:55.117 --> 01:04:56.780
all those kinds of things.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.863
They're real.

01:04:58.758 --> 01:05:02.214
And I just don't think you
should run away with that.

01:05:02.214 --> 01:05:04.384
There are different, I'm
always asked now about

01:05:04.384 --> 01:05:07.315
who should be, whose name
should come down, who should...

01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:10.050
You know, I was up at Yale not long ago

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.004
and I've said this before.

01:05:12.004 --> 01:05:14.109
John Calhoon can go.

01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:16.330
(laughter)

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:17.945
I mean, there's all the
difference in the world

01:05:17.945 --> 01:05:20.665
between being one of the
founders of the United States

01:05:20.665 --> 01:05:23.049
and somebody who tried to
destroy the United States.

01:05:23.049 --> 01:05:27.259
We don't have to have
monuments to those people.

01:05:27.259 --> 01:05:30.672
It's just, you can remember
them in a different way.

01:05:30.672 --> 01:05:32.010
But I think we,

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:34.745
we will be hiding something from ourselves

01:05:34.745 --> 01:05:37.854
if we don't grapple with him.

01:05:37.854 --> 01:05:39.272
And it's not about love.

01:05:39.272 --> 01:05:43.779
It's about understanding the
importance of this figure.

01:05:43.779 --> 01:05:46.322
- I'm trying to get a better understanding

01:05:46.322 --> 01:05:50.185
of the relationship between
Sally Hemings and Jefferson.

01:05:50.185 --> 01:05:53.352
I know on her death bed, that his wife

01:05:55.928 --> 01:05:59.509
got a promise that he
would never marry again.

01:05:59.509 --> 01:06:00.342
So...

01:06:02.513 --> 01:06:06.546
Sally Hemings was the nurse
maid for his children.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.296
And she was a comfort in his bed.

01:06:10.354 --> 01:06:12.247
What else was she, did he,

01:06:12.247 --> 01:06:14.247
he was such an intellectual.

01:06:14.247 --> 01:06:17.414
Did he try and educate her in any way?

01:06:18.907 --> 01:06:22.573
What was that relationship
like other than being in bed?

01:06:22.573 --> 01:06:25.734
- We don't really know what
their relationship was like.

01:06:25.734 --> 01:06:27.313
Because he never wrote about it.

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:28.347
She never wrote about it.

01:06:28.347 --> 01:06:29.940
Madison describes,

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.971
Madison Hemings describes her as

01:06:32.971 --> 01:06:36.824
taking care of Jefferson's
rooms and sewing.

01:06:36.824 --> 01:06:37.975
She's...

01:06:37.975 --> 01:06:41.811
He's describing the life of a house wife.

01:06:41.811 --> 01:06:42.809
And I don't wanna say wife.

01:06:42.809 --> 01:06:46.976
But a person who is basically
taking care of this guy.

01:06:47.885 --> 01:06:50.157
And who is her master.

01:06:50.157 --> 01:06:53.157
And once she comes back from France,

01:06:54.569 --> 01:06:57.748
she's totally under his control.

01:06:57.748 --> 01:06:58.840
But I guess you could say,

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.284
and people have pointed
out to me when I say that,

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:03.549
is that when men married women,

01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:07.070
the women were totally,
you couldn't refuse sex.

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:08.922
The only thing that couldn't happen

01:07:08.922 --> 01:07:10.215
is that you couldn't be sold.

01:07:10.215 --> 01:07:11.811
You could apply moderate correction.

01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:14.650
There's a difference between
being a slave and a wife.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:16.317
But we're talking...

01:07:17.677 --> 01:07:21.149
People are starting to
twitter in here on that.

01:07:21.149 --> 01:07:24.566
But there are gradations of subordination

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:27.369
and unfreedom there.

01:07:27.369 --> 01:07:29.449
So we don't know anything about this

01:07:29.449 --> 01:07:31.860
other than the fact
that when he comes back,

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:35.360
there are no stories with him about women.

01:07:38.073 --> 01:07:40.511
There are no, there appear to be no

01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:44.166
other successive generations of Sallys.

01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:46.270
And you would think, maybe I'm,

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:49.451
this is my modern sensibility to do this,

01:07:49.451 --> 01:07:51.627
that it's just hard to
imagine that he had a purely

01:07:51.627 --> 01:07:54.935
sexual relationship or
sexual attraction to her

01:07:54.935 --> 01:07:56.018
for 38 years.

01:07:56.877 --> 01:08:00.148
That's typically not the way that works.

01:08:00.148 --> 01:08:02.528
I say in my first book
lust can last 20 minutes.

01:08:02.528 --> 01:08:03.979
20 days or 20 months.

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:07.870
But not 20 years, that's the
span of her child bearing.

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:10.142
And she was his wife's half sister.

01:08:10.142 --> 01:08:12.958
That's the other thing that's not

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.691
thought about enough in this.

01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:18.133
Is what is going on here
with this person who

01:08:18.133 --> 01:08:20.747
has taken up with his wife's,

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:24.285
his beloved deceased
wife's sister that he's...

01:08:24.285 --> 01:08:26.016
I think it would be impossible for him

01:08:26.016 --> 01:08:30.483
to look at her without making
the connection to his wife.

01:08:30.483 --> 01:08:31.316
So...

01:08:32.297 --> 01:08:33.664
We don't know that that's,

01:08:33.664 --> 01:08:35.459
what that role that played in it.

01:08:35.459 --> 01:08:36.480
We do,

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.770
the only gestured towards him is that

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.083
she comes back here.

01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:41.506
And that could've been because of him

01:08:41.506 --> 01:08:43.301
or it could've been, and
I talk in the book about

01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:45.743
whether or not this was
to be with her family.

01:08:45.743 --> 01:08:49.199
When she dies, she gives items
that belonged to Jefferson

01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:51.708
to her children that she has kept.

01:08:51.708 --> 01:08:53.415
That she gives to her children.

01:08:53.415 --> 01:08:55.498
Which is sort of a way of

01:08:56.607 --> 01:08:59.539
keeping, it's like a
memorial thing in a way.

01:08:59.539 --> 01:09:03.039
People say, talk about Stockholm syndrome.

01:09:03.931 --> 01:09:05.463
But...

01:09:05.463 --> 01:09:08.093
It could just be a person
making the best deal

01:09:08.093 --> 01:09:10.205
that she could make in her life.

01:09:10.205 --> 01:09:11.414
That women,

01:09:11.414 --> 01:09:14.210
women did that all the time.

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.017
Marrying people,

01:09:16.017 --> 01:09:18.108
this is the best thing
that I'm going to do.

01:09:18.108 --> 01:09:21.108
Sally Hemings was one quarter black.

01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:25.061
I mean, her father was a white man.

01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:26.828
Her fathers were white men.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.519
Who do we think,

01:09:28.519 --> 01:09:32.686
why do we assume that her
ideal, her understanding

01:09:33.652 --> 01:09:36.227
of who she would end up
with would be a black man?

01:09:36.227 --> 01:09:38.974
We've constructed race
in a particular way.

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:41.989
And if it was gonna be a white man,

01:09:41.989 --> 01:09:44.618
why wouldn't he be as
good as any other one?

01:09:44.618 --> 01:09:46.260
- [Woman] Could she read English?

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.840
- We don't know.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.974
Her brothers could.

01:09:48.974 --> 01:09:50.441
Her brothers were literate.

01:09:50.441 --> 01:09:51.442
But we don't have any way.

01:09:51.442 --> 01:09:52.442
- [Woman] She's learned French?

01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:53.448
- Yeah, she spoke French.

01:09:53.448 --> 01:09:54.446
But...

01:09:54.446 --> 01:09:57.311
We don't have any, we
have no letters from her.

01:09:57.311 --> 01:09:59.873
Robert and James were literate.

01:09:59.873 --> 01:10:03.040
Robert, James and Peter were literate.

01:10:04.121 --> 01:10:06.381
There are letters from
Robert to Jefferson.

01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:09.473
Jefferson also kept a list
of all the letters he got

01:10:09.473 --> 01:10:10.912
and all the letters he sent out.

01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:12.633
There are letters from Robert to him.

01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:14.370
The correspondence between them.

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:15.728
But it's gone.

01:10:15.728 --> 01:10:16.935
It's been lost.

01:10:16.935 --> 01:10:18.224
And so, we don't know.

01:10:18.224 --> 01:10:19.223
Whether she could.

01:10:19.223 --> 01:10:20.228
We don't know nothing about her.

01:10:20.228 --> 01:10:22.156
- [Woman] Thank you.

01:10:22.156 --> 01:10:23.412
- Hello.

01:10:23.412 --> 01:10:24.702
- Hello.

01:10:24.702 --> 01:10:27.024
- In Thomas Jefferson's
correspondence with John Adams,

01:10:27.024 --> 01:10:29.885
he refers to certain parts of the Bible,

01:10:29.885 --> 01:10:32.332
more specifically I think it
was the concept of a miracle

01:10:32.332 --> 01:10:34.408
as a pile of dung.

01:10:34.408 --> 01:10:36.954
I was wondering how these
more radical beliefs

01:10:36.954 --> 01:10:39.329
affected how he was respected

01:10:39.329 --> 01:10:41.371
in a more religious time.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.693
- Well, it caused him a lot of problems.

01:10:43.693 --> 01:10:45.638
When he was running for office,

01:10:45.638 --> 01:10:48.095
people in New England, we
think of New England as,

01:10:48.095 --> 01:10:49.910
New England was the religious place then.

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:53.126
They had established religion.

01:10:53.126 --> 01:10:55.748
And people were saying bury your Bibles.

01:10:55.748 --> 01:10:56.902
Because they thought he was gonna come

01:10:56.902 --> 01:10:58.154
and take away the Bible.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:00.449
They said if he's elected,
incest and adultery will

01:11:00.449 --> 01:11:01.282
be common.

01:11:02.405 --> 01:11:03.488
Non sequitur.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:07.412
But that's what they thought.

01:11:07.412 --> 01:11:08.245
He kept,

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.352
people had a sense that he was

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.350
skeptical of religion.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:17.463
But he was very very
private about his religion.

01:11:17.463 --> 01:11:19.220
He doesn't tell his family that.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.920
He begins his process of
creating what is called

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.634
the Jefferson Bible.

01:11:23.634 --> 01:11:26.566
Basically the life and
morals of Jesus of Nazareth.

01:11:26.566 --> 01:11:29.961
When he's president, he comes
back to it as an older man.

01:11:29.961 --> 01:11:32.731
He basically takes a razor
blade and scissors out

01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:34.568
all of the miracles.

01:11:34.568 --> 01:11:35.980
And creates a Jefferson Bible.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.320
And what Peter and I talk,

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.322
we have a chapter on this,

01:11:38.322 --> 01:11:40.056
and we talk about this as trying to create

01:11:40.056 --> 01:11:42.535
an American civic religion.

01:11:42.535 --> 01:11:44.246
He believed that it should,

01:11:44.246 --> 01:11:46.163
he believed that Jesus
was a wonderful teacher.

01:11:46.163 --> 01:11:48.152
But you should follow
the teachings of Jesus

01:11:48.152 --> 01:11:50.176
and not the things that the priests,

01:11:50.176 --> 01:11:54.377
he said the people had made
up and said that Jesus said.

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:55.970
So he was always,

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:57.535
he was considered an atheist.

01:11:57.535 --> 01:11:59.535
And that was a big deal.

01:12:00.513 --> 01:12:02.353
So he really kept his,

01:12:02.353 --> 01:12:06.333
he didn't talk openly about his religion.

01:12:06.333 --> 01:12:08.887
But people could sort of gauge

01:12:08.887 --> 01:12:10.539
that he was,

01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:12.129
and from things that said to other people,

01:12:12.129 --> 01:12:15.113
the rumor was that he was an atheist.

01:12:15.113 --> 01:12:16.568
And that he hated religion.

01:12:16.568 --> 01:12:18.872
But it really, as I said,
he wasn't an atheist.

01:12:18.872 --> 01:12:22.181
He thought that one day
everybody would be a unitarian.

01:12:22.181 --> 01:12:23.716
That was his prediction.

01:12:23.716 --> 01:12:25.005
That one day...

01:12:25.005 --> 01:12:27.175
And he considered himself a Christian.

01:12:27.175 --> 01:12:28.259
But he thought, he said,

01:12:28.259 --> 01:12:29.655
he's a primitive Christian.

01:12:29.655 --> 01:12:30.727
He believed in the

01:12:30.727 --> 01:12:32.711
what he thought were the
true teachings of Jesus

01:12:32.711 --> 01:12:34.435
and not the miracles.

01:12:34.435 --> 01:12:35.969
But he did have to keep that secret.

01:12:35.969 --> 01:12:38.070
If people had known that
he'd cut up the Bible,

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.213
it would have been over.

01:12:39.213 --> 01:12:41.509
(laughter)

01:12:41.509 --> 01:12:42.506
- Thank you.

01:12:42.506 --> 01:12:43.535
For coming to Berkeley.

01:12:43.535 --> 01:12:45.314
It's a pleasure listening to you.

01:12:45.314 --> 01:12:47.064
I'm a retired lawyer.

01:12:48.237 --> 01:12:50.872
I seem to recall 50 years ago
when I was an undergraduate,

01:12:50.872 --> 01:12:54.991
reading a book that characterized
the particularly cruel

01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:58.620
form of slavery that was
active in the United States

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.325
as contrasted with
Catholic countries like,

01:13:02.325 --> 01:13:03.992
more south American.

01:13:05.351 --> 01:13:06.870
And I'm...

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:08.823
- It's morning.

01:13:08.823 --> 01:13:09.990
- Well, I'm...

01:13:13.323 --> 01:13:16.089
It's a shock to me to hear that

01:13:16.089 --> 01:13:19.717
he couldn't imagine after
20 or 30 year affair

01:13:19.717 --> 01:13:21.300
with Sally Hemings.

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.361
And being the patriarch that he is

01:13:24.361 --> 01:13:27.076
and as well read as he
is and a long history of

01:13:27.076 --> 01:13:31.243
Roman patriarchs having their
slaves manage their estates.

01:13:33.245 --> 01:13:35.876
And the Islamic world,
slavery taking a form

01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:39.169
that didn't degrade people
in the way that it does here.

01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:42.252
Or at least didn't necessarily do it.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:45.947
What I'm wondering is is,

01:13:45.947 --> 01:13:48.718
how much of it had to do with

01:13:48.718 --> 01:13:51.301
Catholicism, realism, hierarchy

01:13:52.687 --> 01:13:55.261
and corporate state in Europe

01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:59.011
as contrasted with
nominalism, enlightenment,

01:14:00.918 --> 01:14:05.085
Lock, new science, new way
of looking at the world,

01:14:06.068 --> 01:14:07.740
and the new world.

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:10.990
And Protestant energy in the new world.

01:14:12.367 --> 01:14:14.191
- Well, you know.

01:14:14.191 --> 01:14:15.947
People write about this a lot.

01:14:15.947 --> 01:14:18.977
The supposedly better
slavery in Catholic countries

01:14:18.977 --> 01:14:21.310
versus Protestant countries.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.646
I think it's almost as similar,

01:14:25.646 --> 01:14:27.072
it's the same thing today.

01:14:27.072 --> 01:14:30.927
The Europeans are racist in their own way.

01:14:30.927 --> 01:14:32.622
And we're racist in our own way.

01:14:32.622 --> 01:14:34.214
Americans are racist in our own way.

01:14:34.214 --> 01:14:36.951
It's a matter of the
culture definitely matters.

01:14:36.951 --> 01:14:39.774
In Catholic countries you
do have the recording,

01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:42.467
they keep records of the births of people.

01:14:42.467 --> 01:14:44.358
Because they want them to be baptized.

01:14:44.358 --> 01:14:47.069
The Catholics are there to save souls.

01:14:47.069 --> 01:14:50.576
And the Protestants didn't seem
to care as much about that.

01:14:50.576 --> 01:14:53.996
And so there's a very
different understanding about

01:14:53.996 --> 01:14:56.245
family in Catholic countries.

01:14:56.245 --> 01:14:59.484
In the civil system where
you cannot, for example,

01:14:59.484 --> 01:15:01.842
cannot disinherit your children

01:15:01.842 --> 01:15:04.883
unless they do something really
really really really bad.

01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:07.147
And then the English system,
you don't have to leave

01:15:07.147 --> 01:15:08.378
your kids anything.

01:15:08.378 --> 01:15:11.552
There's no forced heirship
other than by contract.

01:15:11.552 --> 01:15:13.486
Namely the marriage contract.

01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:14.607
Dowered courtesy.

01:15:14.607 --> 01:15:15.918
So you come,

01:15:15.918 --> 01:15:19.414
there's a different
understanding about family

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.312
between the British.

01:15:21.312 --> 01:15:22.943
And the British,

01:15:22.943 --> 01:15:24.446
you're either black or you're white.

01:15:24.446 --> 01:15:25.795
You know?

01:15:25.795 --> 01:15:29.718
And the Europeans, I mean
the continental people have

01:15:29.718 --> 01:15:31.495
they have gradations.

01:15:31.495 --> 01:15:34.142
And it may actually matter

01:15:34.142 --> 01:15:37.272
that you are part white or whatever.

01:15:37.272 --> 01:15:39.772
The French saw the mixed class

01:15:41.243 --> 01:15:45.076
as sort of a buffer
between blacks and whites.

01:15:46.577 --> 01:15:48.827
And one letter, I remember one letter says

01:15:48.827 --> 01:15:51.478
that if we treat them better,
they will side with us.

01:15:51.478 --> 01:15:53.206
Instead of their darker cousin.

01:15:53.206 --> 01:15:54.574
The British don't do that.

01:15:54.574 --> 01:15:55.775
You're black or you're white.

01:15:55.775 --> 01:15:58.150
You're in or you're out.

01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.613
And that sounds harsh.

01:15:59.613 --> 01:16:00.696
But in a way,

01:16:02.011 --> 01:16:05.843
it's interesting that the
true civil rights movement

01:16:05.843 --> 01:16:08.010
among blacks happens here.

01:16:09.254 --> 01:16:10.938
Because, and I think it's because

01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:13.295
blacks never, I mean sure
there are always people

01:16:13.295 --> 01:16:15.728
who play color consciousness
and stuff like that.

01:16:15.728 --> 01:16:17.799
But seriously, after the end of slavery,

01:16:17.799 --> 01:16:21.095
blacks and whites of all colors
were thrown into one pot.

01:16:21.095 --> 01:16:22.841
You're all black.

01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:25.003
And we were forced to
cooperate with one another.

01:16:25.003 --> 01:16:28.452
We never really got this caste thing going

01:16:28.452 --> 01:16:31.221
as seriously as it exists in other places

01:16:31.221 --> 01:16:34.859
where everybody's pretending
that there is no race.

01:16:34.859 --> 01:16:36.269
In Brazil.

01:16:36.269 --> 01:16:39.316
I was in Cuba in 2010 and I
was at a university there.

01:16:39.316 --> 01:16:41.413
And I said what about
the racial situation?

01:16:41.413 --> 01:16:42.542
And this person told me

01:16:42.542 --> 01:16:44.959
the revolution ended race.

01:16:44.959 --> 01:16:46.223
And I'm like...

01:16:46.223 --> 01:16:47.598
And the black people sitting in the room,

01:16:47.598 --> 01:16:50.110
I could sort of see them like...

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:51.776
I don't know about that.

01:16:51.776 --> 01:16:53.621
I mean, he is British.

01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:55.227
He's a product of that system.

01:16:55.227 --> 01:17:00.008
And his racial attitudes
are very much of that binary

01:17:00.008 --> 01:17:01.423
of black and white.

01:17:01.423 --> 01:17:04.980
Now, in the end, when
he fixes out his will,

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.090
and he says, the Virginia
law of 1806 said that

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.299
in order to remain, if you were freed,

01:17:10.299 --> 01:17:12.014
in order to remain in Virginia,

01:17:12.014 --> 01:17:13.747
you had to have permission
of the legislature.

01:17:13.747 --> 01:17:17.078
He asked the legislature
to allow the people

01:17:17.078 --> 01:17:19.566
that he's freeing to remain in Virginia

01:17:19.566 --> 01:17:21.231
because this is where
their families and their

01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:22.756
connections are.

01:17:22.756 --> 01:17:24.253
Now when he was doing that,

01:17:24.253 --> 01:17:26.387
there were some people
who were freeing slaves

01:17:26.387 --> 01:17:28.733
on the condition that they go to Liberia.

01:17:28.733 --> 01:17:30.095
He could've done that.

01:17:30.095 --> 01:17:31.674
But he doesn't send them to Liberia.

01:17:31.674 --> 01:17:32.853
Because he wants them,

01:17:32.853 --> 01:17:34.005
because he knows these people.

01:17:34.005 --> 01:17:35.960
He wants them to say in Virginia.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.808
And that's the answer as
to why all black people

01:17:39.808 --> 01:17:40.908
should remain in America.

01:17:40.908 --> 01:17:43.242
Because that's where our
families and connections are.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:46.205
But Jefferson is speaking,
thinking abstractly.

01:17:46.205 --> 01:17:48.717
But in his day to day life,

01:17:48.717 --> 01:17:50.692
the stuff he says, everything that he says

01:17:50.692 --> 01:17:52.623
and noticed in the state of Virginia,

01:17:52.623 --> 01:17:54.142
you can find something that
he's doing on the plantation

01:17:54.142 --> 01:17:57.383
that in real life, in real time,

01:17:57.383 --> 01:17:59.740
that's completely in
contrevention of that.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.522
And I just think that's
the difference between

01:18:02.522 --> 01:18:06.689
thinking abstractly, the
catechism of white supremacy,

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:10.334
and the actual lived
experience of the person

01:18:10.334 --> 01:18:14.457
who is dealing face to face with people.

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:16.017
- One last very short question

01:18:16.017 --> 01:18:17.282
and it belongs to you.

01:18:17.282 --> 01:18:18.745
- Oh thank you so much.

01:18:18.745 --> 01:18:19.737
Hello.

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:21.291
- Hello.

01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:25.856
- You know, on the question
of whether slavery would have

01:18:25.856 --> 01:18:27.189
ceased to exist.

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:33.747
As some of the founding
fathers apparently believed,

01:18:33.747 --> 01:18:36.868
it's always seemed to me that

01:18:36.868 --> 01:18:40.440
the Louisiana purchase
basically guaranteed

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.794
that slavery would continue to exist for

01:18:43.794 --> 01:18:45.777
X number of years.

01:18:45.777 --> 01:18:47.360
And because of the,

01:18:49.655 --> 01:18:53.276
you know, the soil depletion
and all of that stuff

01:18:53.276 --> 01:18:56.276
that was true of the eastern states.

01:18:58.441 --> 01:19:02.608
And it also seems to me that
Jefferson must have known that.

01:19:03.754 --> 01:19:04.781
Didn't he?

01:19:04.781 --> 01:19:06.256
I mean...

01:19:06.256 --> 01:19:07.700
- Well, the problem.

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:08.703
- [Woman] Or he should've.

01:19:08.703 --> 01:19:12.703
- He should've known that
buying Louisiana would

01:19:13.975 --> 01:19:15.407
change the calculus.

01:19:15.407 --> 01:19:16.808
He had the idea that,

01:19:16.808 --> 01:19:18.588
he had a brief moment, the idea,

01:19:18.588 --> 01:19:23.078
was that he believed in
a notion of diffusion.

01:19:23.078 --> 01:19:26.161
That if slaves were spread out across

01:19:27.109 --> 01:19:28.823
this territory,

01:19:28.823 --> 01:19:31.260
that it would be easier to free them.

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.142
He looked at the example of New England.

01:19:33.142 --> 01:19:35.525
New England was able to
emancipate enslaved people

01:19:35.525 --> 01:19:39.204
'cause there are not that many
black people in New England.

01:19:39.204 --> 01:19:40.503
And numbers really matter.

01:19:40.503 --> 01:19:42.146
That something we don't
talk about very much today.

01:19:42.146 --> 01:19:44.022
But even then, numbers matter.

01:19:44.022 --> 01:19:46.201
So he thought that
that's what would happen.

01:19:46.201 --> 01:19:47.528
And we know that's ridiculous.

01:19:47.528 --> 01:19:49.124
We look at that and say that's ridiculous.

01:19:49.124 --> 01:19:51.497
But he's saying in another region,

01:19:51.497 --> 01:19:53.706
where they were spread out, not that many,

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:54.707
we could free them.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:58.253
The other thing is that slavery
was already in Virginia.

01:19:58.253 --> 01:19:59.837
The Spanish had slaves.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:02.292
They were wedded to that very much.

01:20:02.292 --> 01:20:04.479
In order for the federal government,

01:20:04.479 --> 01:20:07.622
we would've had a war in 1804.

01:20:07.622 --> 01:20:10.301
When he's president, if
they had tried to root,

01:20:10.301 --> 01:20:12.745
they had made the choice
for slavery already.

01:20:12.745 --> 01:20:13.745
So I mean...

01:20:14.642 --> 01:20:18.421
There's a book John Craig
Hammond has written a book about,

01:20:18.421 --> 01:20:20.921
about this contesting slavery.

01:20:23.016 --> 01:20:25.967
And talks about the
Louisiana territory that

01:20:25.967 --> 01:20:28.414
people write about it as
if it's this sort of land

01:20:28.414 --> 01:20:29.618
that's just sort of out there.

01:20:29.618 --> 01:20:33.630
But in fact, the plantations
out there already.

01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:36.342
And the federal government
would have to send an army.

01:20:36.342 --> 01:20:39.254
They would have to fight
to get, to make that,

01:20:39.254 --> 01:20:40.953
to sort of end it.

01:20:40.953 --> 01:20:43.011
So yeah, he had an idea,

01:20:43.011 --> 01:20:45.073
he knew that slavery wasn't gonna go away.

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:49.184
But this diffusion idea,
which we think is ridiculous,

01:20:49.184 --> 01:20:52.531
but it comes from his
idea that this extra land

01:20:52.531 --> 01:20:54.531
would spread slaves out.

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.611
There would be few

01:20:56.611 --> 01:20:58.988
and then they could in
fact be emancipated.

01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:00.628
Just as they had done in New England.

01:21:00.628 --> 01:21:02.101
But that's not what happened.

01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:03.925
The land was too good.

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:04.930
Settler,

01:21:04.930 --> 01:21:06.488
it wasn't just the Spanish
who were out there.

01:21:06.488 --> 01:21:08.491
The settlers from the east went out.

01:21:08.491 --> 01:21:10.494
And they, and everybody wanted to be,

01:21:10.494 --> 01:21:13.168
even if they didn't own
slaves, they aspired to.

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:15.707
And they brought their slaves west.

01:21:15.707 --> 01:21:18.495
And that's what caused
the expansion of slavery

01:21:18.495 --> 01:21:21.293
and eventually what caused a civil war.

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:25.022
As they wanted to try to
make a nation of slaves.

01:21:25.022 --> 01:21:28.129
A slave nation instead of a free nation.

01:21:28.129 --> 01:21:29.392
Thank you.

01:21:29.392 --> 01:21:31.642
(applause)

01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:40.251
(rhythmic music)
