00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.640
The golden boy tried,

many years ago,
didn't they?

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:06.120
With reflection was in Oscar part of that.
I remember Oscar.
Donald Trump.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.570
That's right.
Yeah.
Dot Com was a part of affliction.
That's right.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.530
Josh Barnett sunk that ship.
Josh [inaudible] tested positive and that ship sunk,

5
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:21.150

Yeah.
Yeah.
And then the UFC bought it like right afterwards.
Yeah.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.060
Yeah.
That they had some fun fights though.

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.640
That fucking Tim Silvia fate or fight was wild as shit.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.910
Andrea at Osceola Laski Fade,
hardly get Donald Sharp and fader.

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.740
He with Tom at tent.
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.190
Yeah.
Back in the day.
Sun.
Yeah.

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.550
Donald Trump and Tim Sylvia.
That's hilarious.

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.630
He was a totally different character back then.
Donald Trump was like a fun guy.

13
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.040
Like everybody liked him.
You won't use those at the boxing fights.
Yeah.

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.890
People liked him.
He'd get cheered on.
Now people are so fucking mad at him.

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.330
Same Guy.
They don't see him that way.
No,

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.610
they don't.
They don't,

That's why he has those security around them now.

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.170
Oh yeah.
You asked too.
Yeah.
You fucked up.
Became president.

18
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.950
She huge mistake for anybody.
You want to enjoy your life.

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.760
Don't be fucking president.
That has,
you know,
he could disappear,

20
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.250
get facial surgery or something.
So of course,

21
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.720
once you get that booklet with all the secrets of the history,

22
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.830
the CFR book,
just for that,
what do you think gives you that book?

23
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.270
Is it the CIA,
the NSA who comes to you with the book?
Some guy with no face.

24
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.400
No face?
Yeah,
like a,
the the guy with the [inaudible] and the mass.

25
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.770
What does the watchmen,
who was that guy?
Ink Blot.
What's his name?
Shack.

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.850
Raw Shack.
That's right.
That guy.
Yeah.
He comes to you.

27
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.400
You come see what the phone and be.
Everything's in that book.

28
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
We all know what's in them.
Tell me,
I don't know what's in that book.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.970
You don't know what's in that book?
What's in the book?
You think?

30
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.770
I'm going to say here and what the minions are people listening to get killed?

31
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:53.290
I can't see.
I seen the book,
but I can't tell.
What do you think's in the bone?

32
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.540
Jovi.
What do you think?
If you had to guess.

33
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.950
I wouldn't even want to say President Jorge,
your first day in office.

34
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.810
Mr Monster High Doll.
A word you like to,
uh,
would you like to go over first?

35
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.060
Is Elvis still alive?
What about Tupac?

36
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.700
Where the fuck we're super guy.
Who else?

37
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:16.060
What's going on with these Amiens bro?
They real which,
which was mind number one.

38
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.200
One.
Number one I want to know about aliens.
I was hoping,
this is my hope.

39
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.260
When all these people screaming his treats about Trump,

40
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.270
like I was hoping the moment he gets in,

41
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.060
he's going to ask about aliens because Trump's into conspiracies.

42
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.550
Like he used to go on the Alex Jones show all the time.

43
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.500
I know he's into conspiracies.
If you were going to be the president,

44
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:35.280
the first thing you'd ask is fucking aliens.
What do you got?

45
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.840
What's going on here with these green fellows now about what's going on with

46
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.890
them?
I don't know.
You live in Florida.
There's plenty of aliens down there now.

47
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:44.724
We don't go.
Oh yeah,

48
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.430
we got a lot of agencies,
different types of aliens.
