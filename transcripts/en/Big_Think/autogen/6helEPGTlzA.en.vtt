depressed I didn't get the date with the
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.980
depressed I didn't get the date with the
girl I wanted I'm so depressed or I when

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
girl I wanted I'm so depressed or I when
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.690
girl I wanted I'm so depressed or I when
I'm younger and I'm a teenager I didn't

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700
I'm younger and I'm a teenager I didn't
 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.790
I'm younger and I'm a teenager I didn't
make the team I'm depressed or I failed

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
make the team I'm depressed or I failed
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.010
make the team I'm depressed or I failed
the test I'm depressed all of those are

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020
the test I'm depressed all of those are
 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.720
the test I'm depressed all of those are
part of the human condition that when

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
part of the human condition that when
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.709
part of the human condition that when
bad things happen we feel bad we feel

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
bad things happen we feel bad we feel
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.490
bad things happen we feel bad we feel
crummy which is very different than

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500
crummy which is very different than
 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.920
crummy which is very different than
depression which is a true disorder that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
depression which is a true disorder that
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.650
depression which is a true disorder that
that has a set of symptoms that lasts at

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
that has a set of symptoms that lasts at
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.740
that has a set of symptoms that lasts at
least two weeks and exists every day

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
least two weeks and exists every day
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.110
least two weeks and exists every day
most of the day and the important part

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
most of the day and the important part
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600
most of the day and the important part
for us to remember is that classic

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
for us to remember is that classic
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639
for us to remember is that classic
depression is different than atypical

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
depression is different than atypical
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040
depression is different than atypical
depression so teenagers and that teenage

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
depression so teenagers and that teenage
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.950
depression so teenagers and that teenage
brain is more susceptible to depression

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
brain is more susceptible to depression
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.410
brain is more susceptible to depression
than children are and certainly more

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
than children are and certainly more
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.690
than children are and certainly more
than adults so we have about two million

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700
than adults so we have about two million
 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.209
than adults so we have about two million
teenagers in the United States who have

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219
teenagers in the United States who have
 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.429
teenagers in the United States who have
depression and we have about 35 million

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
depression and we have about 35 million
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.359
depression and we have about 35 million
adults so what it sounds like adults are

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
adults so what it sounds like adults are
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.639
adults so what it sounds like adults are
more likely well we have less teenagers

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649
more likely well we have less teenagers
 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.129
more likely well we have less teenagers
and therefore the statistical risk is

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139
and therefore the statistical risk is
 

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:18.919
and therefore the statistical risk is
much higher when you're an adolescent to

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929
much higher when you're an adolescent to
 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.739
much higher when you're an adolescent to
get depressed and therefore the big

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749
get depressed and therefore the big
 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.749
get depressed and therefore the big
chemical that seems to be affected by

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
chemical that seems to be affected by
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.830
chemical that seems to be affected by
this is serotonin and if you have don't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
this is serotonin and if you have don't
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080
this is serotonin and if you have don't
have enough serotonin available in your

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
have enough serotonin available in your
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.719
have enough serotonin available in your
brain hanging around your brain and if

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
brain hanging around your brain and if
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.830
brain hanging around your brain and if
you're eating it too fast or

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
you're eating it too fast or
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.779
you're eating it too fast or
metabolizing the too quickly you are

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789
metabolizing the too quickly you are
 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.789
metabolizing the too quickly you are
more likely to be anxious more likely to

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
more likely to be anxious more likely to
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.859
more likely to be anxious more likely to
be sad and irritable more likely to be

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
be sad and irritable more likely to be
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.859
be sad and irritable more likely to be
rageful and the other chemical that's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
rageful and the other chemical that's
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.109
rageful and the other chemical that's
involved is norepinephrine and those two

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
involved is norepinephrine and those two
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.580
involved is norepinephrine and those two
chemicals when they those

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
chemicals when they those
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.169
chemicals when they those
neurotransmitters when they're out of

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179
neurotransmitters when they're out of
 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.819
neurotransmitters when they're out of
balance you are more susceptible to

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829
balance you are more susceptible to
 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.469
balance you are more susceptible to
full-blown depression

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479
 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.810
so I think the baseline we have to know

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820
so I think the baseline we have to know
 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.310
so I think the baseline we have to know
about is what are the symptoms we're

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320
about is what are the symptoms we're
 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.219
about is what are the symptoms we're
going to be tackling and so basically

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229
going to be tackling and so basically
 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.139
going to be tackling and so basically
teenage depression is slightly different

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149
teenage depression is slightly different
 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.359
teenage depression is slightly different
than adult depression adult depression

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369
than adult depression adult depression
 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.009
than adult depression adult depression
