00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.892
[DRUMMING]

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.090
Good morning.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.260
And what a beautiful
morning it is.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.170
Welcome to the 363rd celebration
of Harvard commencement.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm Diana Eck, a professor
of comparative religion

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.650
and Indian studies
here at Harvard.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.840
I'm joined in our tree house
by Professor Dan Schrag, who

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.260
is a professor of geology
and the head of the Harvard

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.520
University Center
for the Environment.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.410
It is a really great day.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.330
The people are streaming into
the Tercentenary Theatre, where

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.660
we're seated.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.970
We have a great view and are
looking forward to spending

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.086
these next few hours
with you, as you

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:49.460
have the best
seats in the house.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.390
So get a cup of coffee
or tea, put up your feet,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.580
and enjoy the
commencement exercises.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.060
So Diana, it's really
spectacular today.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.650
Not only is the
weather magnificent

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.480
after a long, cold
winter in Cambridge,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.680
it's just clear
and beautiful here.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.830
But actually, it's
thankfully not too hot.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.870
Last year we were sweltering
in 90 degree heat.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.370
It was.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.680
It was incredibly hot.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.210
And this year, it's
just-- everybody looks

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.420
excited and happy.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300
This is such a special
day when you look out

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.830
and you see all of
the PhD students

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.590
and professional students filing
into the Tercentenary Theatre.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770
You see all this
potential for the future.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.360
What's wonderful about this
day and this celebration today

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.685
is that it's both looking
back and looking forward.

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:38.545
There's a lot of hard
earned history here.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:41.535
As you said, this is
the 363rd commencement.

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:46.930
And there'll be lots of
aspects of this day that'll

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.060
include talking to the
50th reunion class,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.160
or the 25th reunion class.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.450
But really, what today is
about is looking forward,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.320
looking at all of
these students who've

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.380
worked so hard for the last
several years, sometimes two,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.980
three, four.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.600
In the case of PhD
students, even more.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.820
And here they are
now working, going

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.570
forward out into the world
to really change the world.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.520
They are our future.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.680
It is commencement.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.540
In that sense, it
is a beginning.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.760
And with trepidation, and
with hope, and high optimism

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.340
for the future, everyone
is beginning a new phase

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.740
of their life, all of these
graduates who are here today.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.350
That's great.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.890
And we actually are joined right
now by one Harvard graduate.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.270
She is in the class of 2014.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.470
We have Valerie Shen here.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.210
Valerie Shen is in Cabot House.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.320
She is graduating in both
environmental science

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.960
and public policy, and in
earth and planetary science.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.750
I know Valerie
because she actually

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.520
took my course as a freshman.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.450
And was wonderful.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.283
And then ultimately
worked in my laboratory,

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:52.840
did here senior thesis with me.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.514
She won a Hoopes
Prize for her thesis.

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:55.180
Congratulations.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.219
And is graduating summa cum
laude and Phi Beta Kappa.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.260
Congratulations, Valerie.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.715
Welcome.

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:00.214
Thank you.

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.050
Thank you for all of your help.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.880
So Valerie, tell us a
little bit about today.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.780
You came in with all
of your classmates.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.330
When you look out there,
what do you think about?

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.760
Well, I think about all
the wonderful opportunities

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.530
that Harvard has given us,
all the great friendships

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.280
that we've made,
the amazing mentors

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.120
like yourself that we've had
the opportunity to work with.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.140
But also, all the
opportunities that we all

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.500
have for the future.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.580
And being part of the
Alumni Association,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.720
being able to meet
alumni around the world,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.899
and the great jobs and
internships that we've all

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.940
had and will continue to
have throughout the rest

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.780
of our lives.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.960
So Valerie, who's
here with you today?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.550
I mean, what family do you have?

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.530
Where do you come from?

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.680
So I'm from Madison, Wisconsin.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.680
And both of my parents, Ben,
and children are here with me

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.330
today.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.010
My younger sister,
Kelly, is here

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.160
and my boyfriend,
Jamie, is also here.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.770
It's a very exciting day.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.450
And you know, what's wonderful
about today is there are just

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.470
hundreds of thousands
of students, each

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.112
with their own story,
each with their own path.

00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:01.830
Now, Valerie, you're
heading off to first travel

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.370
a little bit in Southeast Asia.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.970
Yeah.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.800
I'm very excited.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.960
I haven't seen a lot of
the world, I feel like.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.860
So going around a couple of
countries in Southeast Asia.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.405
Also going to Japan and
China for a little bit.

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:13.780
And then I'm going
to be starting

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.120
work full time in September
out in San Francisco.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.160
Now, you're following
an interesting path.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.310
You were very interested
in energy issues,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.760
environmental issues.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.094
You've worked on climate
change for your senior thesis.

00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:27.260
And yet, you're heading off
into the business world.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.843
Tell me a little bit
about what you're

00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:30.444
thinking, about how
your path is going

00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:32.960
to be improved after
you leave Harvard.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.460
Sure.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.710
So I think the business world
will be really exciting,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.740
because I'll gain a lot of
very valuable skills there.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.490
I think a lot of the work to
be done in energy and climate

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.370
change can be done through the
private sector with clean tech

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.970
companies leading the way.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.450
And I think that after a few
years in the business world,

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.279
I'll be able to go get a MBA.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.695
And I'm also going to be getting
a Master's in Environment

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:54.820
and Resources at the same time.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.810
And with that and my
business experience,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.460
really be prepared to make
change on climate change

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.370
issues, especially if I want
to go into the public sector

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.284
or even continue in
the private sector.

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:05.700
Valerie, it's very,
very exciting.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.325
It's wonderful.

00:05:06.325 --> 00:05:09.220
And I can't think of a more
important area to go into.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.677
So congratulations.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.510
Thank you very much.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.630
Congratulations on today.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.340
And good luck with those dreams
in the future, because this

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.980
is really important work.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.480
Thank you.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.440
Thanks for all your support.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.490
Congratulations, Valerie.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.856
Have a great day and enjoy it.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:23.689
Thank you very much.

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:24.600
Bye bye.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.340
So this really is a ritual
transition for everyone.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.380
And the processions
that brought people

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.430
from their houses or
their graduate school

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.650
this morning in great
battalions are really

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.690
the processions toward this
great rite of transition

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.820
that takes place here in
the Tercentenary Theatre.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.290
This is a ritual passage.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.500
It is a rite of
initiation for everyone.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.150
That's right.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.090
And what's wonderful
is that both classes

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.620
of old and the
current classes all

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.000
take part in this celebration.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.640
So very soon, we'll see the
25th and the 50th reunion

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.274
classes coming in.

00:06:06.274 --> 00:06:10.000
And they're special people.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.670
Each one of these
classes is really

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.980
made up of remarkable
individuals.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.600
What we're beginning to
see are the processions.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.720
And we will see the procession
of the alumni as well.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.120
But you caught a glimpse a
moment ago of the president's

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.640
procession, which is moving
through the open ranks

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.830
of the seniors in
the freshman yard.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.250
The houses are lined up with the
processional path between them.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.660
And the president's
procession is the first.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.760
We'll see it several
times before they

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.090
enter into the
Tercentenary Theatre

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.029
and take their
places on the stage.

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.570
That's right.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.444
And of course, with the
president in addition

00:06:53.444 --> 00:06:57.244
to the various deans and
leaders of the university

00:06:57.244 --> 00:06:59.410
are also, of course, the
honorary degree recipients,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.910
who we will talk about later.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.714
And there are the
members immediately

00:07:05.714 --> 00:07:09.730
with the president, the
members of the corporation.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.370
Here you see some of the
honorary degree recipients,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.610
if one can recognize
them, just a glimpse

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.970
of them with their
faculty escorts.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.070
The members of the
corporation will

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:27.050
sit with the honorary degree
recipients, and the president's

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.600
party, and the
faculty on the stage.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.640
One member of the
corporation, Susan Graham,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.040
is a professor of computer
science at Berkeley.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.730
Very distinguished
computer scientist.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.490
And she is a member of
President Obama's science

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.070
advisory council with me.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.440
I know her very well for that.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.010
And she's celebrating a
very special day today.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.387
It's her 50th reunion
year at Harvard as well.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:51.970
So she not only is
on the corporation,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.053
but she's also with the
50th reuinion celebration.

00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:55.100
That's splendid.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.730
And several of our colleagues
are in that 50th reunion class

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.390
as well.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.700
Marshall Ganz from
the Kennedy School.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.420
Marshall, really
extraordinary individual.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.080
He was a class of
'64 slash 1992.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.580
Yes.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.610
Because he actually left
Harvard before he graduated.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.540
He didn't take part in
commencement that year

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.987
in 1964, because he
went down to the south

00:08:14.987 --> 00:08:17.070
and worked for the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.650
Committee.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.030
He did.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.160
And then he worked with Cesar
Chavez as well in California.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.701
That's right.

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:25.520
He was Cesar Chavez's right
hand man in the Farm Workers,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.330
and did that for many decades.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.120
And ultimately came
back to Harvard,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.860
finished his undergraduate
degree, got a PhD,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.840
and now teaches at
the Kennedy School.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.710
What a tremendous story.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.730
And Sheila Jasanoff,
of course our colleague

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.090
also at the Kennedy School, one
of the founders of the Science

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.850
Technology Studies discipline.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.070
Brilliant scholar, fabulous
teacher and mentor.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.814
She's also celebrating
her 50th reunion today.

00:08:51.814 --> 00:08:56.700
That's a wonderful note as well.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.399
Here we see the various
processions starting.

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.940
I see various faculty
coming through.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.605
Faculty members coming through.

00:09:03.605 --> 00:09:06.370
Of course, all of the different
colors and the pageantry.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.815
I see Peter Bol from East
Asian studies, Rick McCullough,

00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:12.400
our associate provost.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.440
The deans.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.860
There are several of the
deans of different schools

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:21.450
here as well, members of
the president's procession.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.385
Dean Pfister, who
just passed, who

00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.720
has been the interim
dean of Harvard College

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.600
during this year.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.516
There's Mike Smith, dean
of arts and sciences.

00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:35.420
You see all of the different
colors representing

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.209
the universities where
they got their PhDs.

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:39.500
All wonderful different colors.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.230
Described by one wonderful
person at the 300th anniversary

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.450
of Harvard as a flock
of iridescent birds

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.080
in so many different colors.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.150
We see quite a lot
of crimson here,

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.120
but the other
colors of the Ivies

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.930
and other great
universities as well.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.120
There's a picture of all of the
undergraduates getting ready.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.780
You can see them watching.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.750
And it's really a
wonderful tradition

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.070
where the faculty
file through the ranks

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.970
of the undergraduates.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.820
It's just a spectacular feeling.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.750
I'm up here with you
on the stage today

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.380
in front of the
television camera.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.150
But I sort of miss filing into
this theatre through the ranks

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.270
of the undergraduates, and
having them applaud you

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.142
and vice versa.

00:10:23.142 --> 00:10:24.350
It's just a wonderful moment.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.180
And just reaching
out to see that there

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.760
is the president coming past
Lowell House, the President

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.570
and Fellows Division.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.490
She's accompanied by the
members of the corporation, whom

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.580
you see behind her.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.720
And that corporation has
grown just a bit larger

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.440
in the last few years.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.136
And I love their
hats, I must say.

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:46.260
They have spectacular hats.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.860
The tall hats, top hats.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.590
Scarcely-- not
very many contexts

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:58.280
in which the top hats and the
broad brimmed hats of the women

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.845
are as visible as here.

00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:01.680
There's Eric Jacobsen
from chemistry.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.700
Dan Lieberman from human
evolutionary biology.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.154
All sorts of
wonderful colleagues.

00:11:07.154 --> 00:11:08.320
This is such a spectacular--

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.160
You might say they're straggling
rather than processing.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.940
But that's good.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.710
They're making their way.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.720
And there's President
Faust who will soon

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.940
be stepping onto the stage,
which is right beneath us here.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.950
The crimson gowns of
the PhD graduates,

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.880
they will be
acknowledged almost first

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.670
in the recitation of the
conferring of degrees.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.160
Yeah, it's a very special honor.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.950
The PhD is really, it's
the ultimate achievement

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.220
here as a student at Harvard.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.997
Really at the point
where now, you

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:49.980
are joined the ranks of
an independent scholar.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.290
They're qualified to teach
and be a professor anywhere

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.560
in the world.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.480
590 PhDs being awarded today.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.060
My colleague Peter Galison, our
friend from history of science,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.770
tells me that their
small department actually

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.420
had 16 PhD graduates from
history of science this year

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.160
in the class.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.284
Really quite extraordinary.

00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:15.170
That is extraordinary, and a
very, very important field,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.110
that's to be sure.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.030
Here in this-- well,
what some people call

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.080
Harvard Yard between the
Memorial Church and Widener

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.930
Library, this was renamed the
Tercentenary or Tercentenary

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:35.280
Theatre in the 300th
anniversary of Harvard in 1936.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.190
There we see Alan Garber
there on the left.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.202
Alan is the provost, of course.

00:12:39.202 --> 00:12:47.240
And he has his PhD In economics,
and an MD as well from Harvard.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.170
And those empty
chairs on the right

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:54.660
will contain the undergraduates
as they file in house by house.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.060
The graduate schools
are already seated here.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.880
They gathered in [INAUDIBLE]
Quad a little bit

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.310
earlier this morning and
began their procession

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:08.050
with the PhDs, and then all
of the other graduate schools.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.900
One of the amazing
things about this day

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.753
is that it's the only time that
you see Harvard as a whole.

00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:17.930
I mean, Harvard University
is a word, really,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.610
until you see this incredible
gathering on commencement day

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.500
with thousands, 10s of
thousands, 32,000 people

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.660
somehow in these quadrangles.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.410
Well, it's really an
extraordinary collection

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.782
of knowledge, an
extraordinary collection

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:40.537
of eager students with
incredible ambition,

00:13:40.537 --> 00:13:42.900
incredible potential
to change the world.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.900
And I see that in
thinking about issues

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.875
related to energy
and environment.

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:49.780
When I look across
these schools, all

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.470
of these students-- I've
come across so many of them

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.830
over the last several years.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.500
And they're going to
go off around the world

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.359
and literally change the world.

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:00.150
It's very exciting.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.640
And they really come from around
the world in so many ways.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.450
At least in their generation,
their parents' generation,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.130
their grandparents,
if the grandparents

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.220
of all of these graduates
could be here today,

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.000
it would be a global
village to be sure.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.265
That's right.

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:16.348
And of course, what you
see also in the background

00:14:16.348 --> 00:14:18.000
is a lot of parents as well.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.140
And of course, it's
important to remember

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:26.080
that behind every student is
several family members, perhaps

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.230
parents, perhaps
other relatives.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.642
But really, who help them
get here all the way.

00:14:30.642 --> 00:14:32.975
And this is an achievement
not just for that individual,

00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:34.750
but of course for
their entire family.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.800
It's very, very special.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.490
Some of our students
come from families

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:42.702
who've never been to
university before.

00:14:42.702 --> 00:14:45.910
Others have long histories
connected with Harvard.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.794
But whatever the background,
whatever the connection,

00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:54.751
our students really are a
testament to the parents,

00:14:54.751 --> 00:14:56.250
and families, and
all their support.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.040
And this day is as much
for them as for all of us.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.130
One of the things that's
quite remarkable every year,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.980
but especially in
the last 20 years

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.660
as Harvard has become
so much more global,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.200
is the baccalaureate that the
undergraduates have took place

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.880
yesterday in the
Memorial Church.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.914
Or Tuesday, rather.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.080
Oh, here the undergraduates
are starting to file in.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.420
Here they begin.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.495
And it began with a
reading from Confucius

00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:24.220
in Chinese and then English.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.360
And then readings
from the Bhagavad Gita

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.230
in Sanskrit, from
the Hebrew Bible,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:37.080
from 1 Corinthians in Greek,
and from the Quran in Arabic.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.460
I mean, this is
the linguistic base

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.110
of the sacred texts of the
members of this graduating

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.790
class.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.400
And it's an
extraordinary testament

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.570
to what has happened to
the stock of the Puritans,

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.910
as fair Harvard puts it.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.290
The stock of the
Puritans has expanded

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.820
to include people from
all over the world.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.620
And this is an extraordinary
testament to that.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.120
It's true.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.460
Globalization is
really not just a word.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.658
It's here at Harvard.

00:16:09.658 --> 00:16:11.140
And it's very exciting.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.800
And if you look at the deans of
the Harvard Graduate Schools,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.740
who we will hear from, they
come from all over the world.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.160
Xiao-Li Meng of GSAS
of Chinese background.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.010
And Nitin Nohria of the
Harvard Business School,

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.860
who is of Indian background.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.845
And Julio Frenk, the School
of Public Health, from Mexico.

00:16:34.845 --> 00:16:35.420
From Mexico.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.970
And of course, Mohsen Mostafavi.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.270
From Iran.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.680
From Iran, from the GSD.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.740
And the new dean of
Harvard Divinity School

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.670
is from Northern Ireland.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:49.540
So the flock of deans is really
an international and indeed

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.670
a group of people with
a global perspective.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.910
And I think that is one
of the hallmarks of what

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.360
is happening at Harvard today.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.340
Not only all the world
in this small place,

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.440
but a sense of
global consciousness

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.460
among the students
and faculty here.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.290
So here come the faculties.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.390
Now, we don't separate the
faculties in this sense.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.406
All our colleagues
are all mixed together

00:17:15.406 --> 00:17:16.780
across all the
different schools.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.520
It's so true.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.770
I mean, the faculty line up.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.970
They're supposed to,
I mean undergraduates

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.750
are told, they're supposed to
doff their hats as they pass

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.960
the statue of John
Harvard, which we just saw.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.110
I'm not sure how many
of them still do that.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.060
One of the things that is
great about this ritual

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.490
space, the Tercentenary
Theatre, is

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.410
that there's so much
of individual student's

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.200
history that takes place here.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.900
For the AB graduates,
the undergraduates,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.240
they come here-- and in
recent years have come here--

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.460
for their freshman convocation.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.250
And then there are all sorts
of great public events.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.250
There was the yard fest where
Janelle Monae, who sang almost

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.020
at the same time she
sang at the White House,

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.350
came here to be the
lead entertainer.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.990
An extraordinary event.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:17.610
And major speeches by people
like Al Gore took place here.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.870
That's right.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.848
Al Gore came here to
celebrate the Harvard's effort

00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:24.910
and commitment to
sustainability at Harvard.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.380
This is also a space that's
used by the students for things

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.680
like political rallies.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.260
It is indeed.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.140
So this is a place where
student activism and student

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.480
political speech
really is center stage.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.850
And that's part of the
vibrancy of this place.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.960
Here we see some of the
PhD students coming in.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.680
All of these students,
believe it or not,

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.720
and their families
will be fed somewhere

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.260
after these exercises are over.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.890
There'll be processions
and movements

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.000
back to the various
buildings on campus,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.560
and to all of the
huge tents that

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.600
have been set up everywhere.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.630
There is virtually an
alternate campus of tents.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.451
Well what's so lovely is that
Harvard is really in full bloom

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:12.950
right now.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.350
I mean, the trees, the
leaves have come out

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.942
in the last few weeks.

00:19:16.942 --> 00:19:19.260
And the grass is green.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.400
The grounds crew has been
working incredibly hard.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.540
It's been pretty cold.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.910
But it's amazingly special.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.243
I was just talking
to Ned Friedman, who

00:19:26.243 --> 00:19:28.080
was the director of
the Arnold Arboretum.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.000
The Arnold Arboretum
is in spectacular--

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.700
Glorious.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.890
--glorious time right now.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.240
The rhododendrons
are almost out.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.870
And it's really an amazing time
to go see the Arnold Arboretum.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.900
It's a very special place
attached to Harvard.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.940
But really, this entire
campus as a botanical

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.800
display right now.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.110
But I must say, if we had been
looking out over the crowd

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.970
yesterday afternoon during the
time that the undergraduates

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.080
were having their
class day, you would've

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.772
seen people who were-- there
is Sheila Jasanoff, by the way,

00:19:59.772 --> 00:20:00.480
and Jay Jasanoff.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:00.785
Oh yes.

00:20:00.785 --> 00:20:01.090
And Jay Jasanoff
for 50th reunion.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.595
Some of the faculty coming in.

00:20:02.595 --> 00:20:03.570
Yes.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.900
But the parents were all sitting
in their coats with their hoods

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.540
on.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.240
And the students as well,
except even those on the stage.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.115
It was extraordinary.

00:20:12.115 --> 00:20:14.520
It was chilly.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.970
When they all came
back to the houses,

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.900
we had a reception for all
the Lowell House parents

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.900
and graduates
yesterday afternoon.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.370
And they were cold.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.016
We served them a bit of wine.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.890
But they also wanted a
little tea and coffee,

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.600
because they had
been sitting here.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.480
It was a wonderful
afternoon, though.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.490
And I must say, the
words of Sheryl Sandberg,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:40.340
who is the CEO of Facebook,
were really extraordinary.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.290
She has written this
great book, Lean

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.720
In, but with it a lot of
advice for students about it's

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.810
not a ladder that you climb up.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.400
These days, it's more
like a jungle gym

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.480
where you have to be very
flexible and move from side

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.141
to side as you make
your moves in life.

00:20:57.141 --> 00:20:59.140
And that you never know
what you're going to be.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.940
She said, when she
graduated of course,

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.140
she had no idea about Facebook.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.070
There was no Facebook.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.270
In fact, there was no internet.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.010
So the world changes fast.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.950
And I think the flexibility
is really extraordinary.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.180
Yes, that's right.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.280
Now Diana, you're
a house master.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.870
And house master, for those in
our audience who don't know,

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.983
really plays a very
special role at Harvard

00:21:20.983 --> 00:21:22.250
for the undergraduates.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.390
The undergraduates live in the
houses, they eat in the houses.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.680
The houses also play a role in
their intellectual development.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.180
Absolutely.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.250
All sorts of activities and
events that you organize.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.920
So seeing them
off and graduating

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.820
a class of seniors
from Lowell House

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.911
for you must be both
wonderfully satisfying,

00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:44.160
and also a little bittersweet.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.050
It is bittersweet, as
this day in general

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.930
is bittersweet for all of us.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.920
I think for faculty,
for house masters,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.420
for graduates, for our
tutors in the houses.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.050
But it is true that the houses
are not, we have to say,

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.480
they're not simply dorms here.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.285
They are inter-generational
communities

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:04.940
of faculty and of tutors,
who are in graduate school,

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.170
and undergraduates.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.550
And we have lots of events.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.300
I think you came to one of the
master's dinners this year.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:10.841
That's right.

00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:14.460
I came to a dinner and had a
long discussion with students.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.390
I was so impressed with how
curious the students were

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.420
and how engaged they were.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.600
I mean, we've had-- this is
a tradition that's great.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.410
These are opportunities
in the houses

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.120
to have a small dinner or a
small discussion gathering

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.980
with, in this case, the
likes of Dan Schrag,

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.830
or this year with
Justice Souter, who

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.720
is a member of our
senior common room.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:45.088
And with David Gergen, and
with members of the faculty

00:22:45.088 --> 00:22:46.060
throughout.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.356
Just a wonderful chance.

00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:48.980
Those kind of
opportunities to interact

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.140
with faculty members
outside of the classroom,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.740
really in these more special,
more intimate encounters,

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.986
that's a very special part
of the Harvard experience.

00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.360
Well, and it's
one of the reasons

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.920
that I love being
a house master.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.670
I think it's the
best job in Harvard.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.340
You're not supposed to
be out raising money.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.920
I mean, although
we do need that, I

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.100
should remind our audience.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.230
But it's an opportunity
to be with students

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:16.530
outside the classroom.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.020
And some of those students
are in your classes as well.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.120
But it really is fabulous.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.200
You eat with them,
you live with them.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.800
You deal with them in hard
times and with glorious times.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.880
So you really get to know
them in a very special way.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.980
Yeah.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.850
One of our great
traditions at Lowell House

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:40.075
is Thursday afternoon tea
where Dorothy and I pour

00:23:40.075 --> 00:23:42.920
tea in a silver
teapot to all comers.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.640
It started out as a
Lowell House event,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.470
but actually we have
literally 200 students

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.060
from all over the college who
want to be served a cup of tea.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.056
It's a civilizing
influence as well, I think.

00:23:53.056 --> 00:23:54.180
What a wonderful tradition.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:54.721
That's great.

00:23:54.721 --> 00:23:57.409
It is great.

00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:58.700
So I think we're getting close.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:58.990
We're ready to begin.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.875
We are getting close.

00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:01.458
It looks like the
undergraduates are--

00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:02.750
Undergraduates are--

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.450
--mostly in.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.800
They're continuing to file
in and take their seats.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.480
Seeing this
gentleman in a turban

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.430
reminds me that in
yesterday's baccalaureate,

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.930
there was also a reading
from the Guru Granth

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.530
Sahib from the Sikh
scriptures, really

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.890
for the first time in my memory.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.140
Well some of those seats on
the right are still empty.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:30.100
So we have a little time to go
before they are all filled in.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.840
One of the things that
is totally in evidence

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.570
here are the literally
thousands of cell phones

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.370
on which people are
snapping their pictures.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:47.160
This is-- Drew Faust tried to
talk a bit about this yesterday

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.610
in her baccalaureate
speech, where she says,

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.750
you are the class who entered
in 2010-- what's sometimes

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.090
called the year
of the smartphone.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.630
You tweeted and
buzzfed it all as

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:04.440
you instagrammed your selfies,
viral tagged your Pinterest

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.920
accounts, and monitored
your Twitter feedback.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.100
And then she said, I
hope I got that right.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.592
Yeah, I think that Drew is
not of a generation that

00:25:15.592 --> 00:25:17.030
uses all those social--

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.790
That's instagramming selfies.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.920
We're not doing that
either at the moment.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.490
But I will say that this
is a generation where

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.990
the selfies of dozens
of students, they've

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.830
really developed long enough
arms to take group selfies

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:40.050
and send them instantly
to their friends.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.855
This class of graduating
seniors this year

00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:44.000
is filled with
special people, people

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.510
like Valerie Shen,
who we met earlier.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.780
Some of our colleagues
also have children

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.960
in the graduating class.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.930
This year, for
example, Kathy Buckley,

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:58.175
one of our associate
provosts, her son Tom Miller

00:25:58.175 --> 00:26:00.880
is graduating from Adams House.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.596
He concentrated in psychology
with a secondary in government.

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:07.290
And congratulations to
Tom and to Kathy Buckley.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.780
It's wonderful.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.400
And there's so many stories
like that, our colleagues

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.590
and our friends
who have students.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.110
There are also many
distinguished friends

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:24.090
of Harvard who are in their
25th reunion class as well.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.880
My friend Ariel Anbar from
Arizona State University,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.140
and Lisa Dilling from the
University of Colorado,

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.110
those are both
earth scientists who

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.930
are back here for
their 25th reunion.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:39.090
Scott Nathan, who's
a friend of Harvard,

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.700
led Baupost Investment
Firm in Boston

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.570
and is now working in
the State Department,

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:50.130
Scott has been incredibly
generous with his money,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.950
but also with his time,
working tirelessly

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.787
for a variety of
environmental issues.

00:26:55.787 --> 00:26:57.245
And now, he's
working in Washington

00:26:57.245 --> 00:26:58.670
in the State Department.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.804
And also, Jonathan Shaw,
who is the managing

00:27:01.804 --> 00:27:03.716
editor of Harvard Magazine.

00:27:03.716 --> 00:27:07.710
Jonathan has been
a wonderful force

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.140
at Harvard Magazine
for many, many years.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.710
His father was actually
my father's roommate

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.180
at Adams House in
the class of 1959.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.965
Jonathan Shaw is celebrating
his 25th reunion today as well.

00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:22.845
Congratulations to him.

00:27:22.845 --> 00:27:27.200
Here, we see pictures of the
band playing the last few notes

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.410
before we get ready to start.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.660
What will happen once the
sheriff of Middlesex County

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.410
calls this meeting to
order is that there's

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.380
almost nothing
that is unscripted.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:46.540
There's a small booklet
that is almost like a ritual

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.500
manual for the marshal
of the university.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.830
Marshal Jackie O'Neill is
the chief ritual officer,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.120
so to speak.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.010
And all the words that
the president speaks

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.780
and that the deans of
the various faculties

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.905
speak as they introduce
their students, all of those

00:28:05.905 --> 00:28:07.074
are part of that script.

00:28:07.074 --> 00:28:07.990
It's very traditional.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.180
It changes a bit
from time to time.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.510
But on the whole,
this is a festivity

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:22.450
that is both utterly
chaotic and rather ordered.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.550
There you see Dean Ellwood
of the Kennedy School,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.402
and Jackie O'Neill on the
bottom left, who is our--

00:28:29.402 --> 00:28:30.360
There's David Ellwood--

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:30.860
--marshal.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.224
--dean of the Kennedy
School talking with--

00:28:34.224 --> 00:28:35.140
With Drew Faust again.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:35.806
With Drew Faust.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.940
Now, of course, as
the ceremony proceeds,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.190
President Faust will
bestow the degrees

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.140
en masse for most
of the students.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.300
The deans will get
up individually

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.400
and ask the president
to bestow the degrees

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.124
that the students have earned.

00:28:59.124 --> 00:29:02.230
And she will do it en
masse with one exception,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.885
the undergraduates who graduate
summa cum laude, the highest

00:29:06.885 --> 00:29:10.550
Greek honors that
they can receive.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.940
Very small number of
them in each class.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.890
They will actually come up
and receive their degree.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:26.560
The summas are asked to draw
near as the undergraduates are

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.200
introduced.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.750
And they get,
basically, a handshake.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.820
The truth is, the
degree is bestowed today

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.970
by a speech act
of the president,

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:42.440
by authority of the
president and fellows

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.940
of Harvard College, and
the members of the board

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.370
of overseers, all whom voted
these degrees yesterday.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.680
That is how these
degrees are bestowed.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.750
And they are graduates,
as they are here

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.769
in this Tercentenary Theatre.

00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:59.560
Then, when they actually
get their diploma,

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.450
that's sort of extra.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.980
They didn't really have
diplomas for a long time.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.960
And there's a wonderful piece in
the Harvard Gazette about that

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.810
this time, that you
could buy a diploma.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.414
There you see Charles
Rosenberg, Drew Faust's husband

00:30:11.414 --> 00:30:14.718
there below the screen.

00:30:14.718 --> 00:30:16.970
There's Jeremy
Bloxham on the right,

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.860
Jeremy dean of natural sciences.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.644
Area dean for natural sciences
and arts and sciences.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.675
And Lee Rosovsky
on the bottom left.

00:30:29.675 --> 00:30:33.340
Lee of course son of the
former dean Rosovsky.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.702
I think I see our next
undergraduate guest, who

00:30:38.702 --> 00:30:39.430
is approaching.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.738
Everybody's getting very
excited for this to start.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.330
Welcome.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:05.540
We have here with us Alex
Diaz, who is at Lowell House.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.440
It's not a wonder that I know
this remarkable young man

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.390
as house master.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.160
Lowell House is
already seated, right?

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.660
Yes.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.160
We just sat down now.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.120
That's great.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.240
Alex, you know me.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.584
This is Dan Schrag, who is--

00:31:21.584 --> 00:31:22.500
Congratulations, Alex.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.003
Thank you so much.

00:31:23.003 --> 00:31:23.711
What a great day.

00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:27.220
Tell us a little bit about
what you've done here.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.160
Majored in and--

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.610
I majored in psychology,
focusing on applying psychology

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.460
to law and policy.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.300
And my greatest
passion now is to learn

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.580
how to implement policy that's
a little bit more updated

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.272
and informed by science,
specifically psychology.

00:31:45.272 --> 00:31:45.980
That's wonderful.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.660
So what are you
going to do next?

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.971
But your area in
psychology would interest--

00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:49.720
Social psychology.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:49.990
Yes.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.823
Would interest people,
because you're really

00:31:51.823 --> 00:31:55.140
examining the roots of--

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.040
Unconscious biases, yeah.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.680
--unconscious bias
and prejudice.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.840
That's great.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.590
So tell me, what are
you going to do next?

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.180
So I've been blessed enough to
receive a Rhodes Scholarship.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.910
So I'll be at Oxford next year.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.530
That's spectacular.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.400
Reading for public policy
for my first year there.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.265
That'll be a wonderful,
wonderful next step.

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:13.890
I'm so excited.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:14.370
I cannot wait.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:14.880
That's really fun.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.338
So when do you head
to the England?

00:32:16.338 --> 00:32:17.325
I head in October.

00:32:17.325 --> 00:32:18.489
Or last week of September.

00:32:18.489 --> 00:32:19.030
That's great.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.863
And what are you going
to do for the summer?

00:32:20.863 --> 00:32:23.880
I'll be back home in New Jersey
working with Senator Cory

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.765
Booker on his upcoming campaign.

00:32:26.765 --> 00:32:27.640
That's very exciting.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.473
Oh, that's terrific.

00:32:28.473 --> 00:32:32.670
So tell us a little bit about
your background in Union City

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.630
New Jersey.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.880
So, I mean, my parents
immigrated here

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:42.216
from Cuba in the '60s during
the communist revolution,

00:32:42.216 --> 00:32:43.840
pulled themselves up
by the bootstraps.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.500
And my dad worked his way
through college and law school,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.342
and worked his way to get
me to be where I am today.

00:32:51.342 --> 00:32:53.800
I'm so grateful for my parents
for all they've done for me.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.760
Are they here today with you?

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.840
They're here today, yes.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.965
They must be very exciting.

00:32:56.965 --> 00:32:58.415
Aw, man.

00:32:58.415 --> 00:32:59.290
This is all for them.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.400
It's not even for me.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.380
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.250
I have two older brothers.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.374
And they're also here, too.

00:33:03.374 --> 00:33:04.337
That's great.

00:33:04.337 --> 00:33:05.545
What a wonderful celebration.

00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:06.086
Good for you.

00:33:06.086 --> 00:33:08.270
And what you hope to
be doing in 10 years?

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.760
I have no idea.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.040
I want to practice
law for a bit.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.600
But I do want to go back
and help out my community.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.450
Wherever I end up, as long
as I stand for my values,

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.487
I feel like I've
accomplished something.

00:33:20.487 --> 00:33:22.570
And are you headed to law
school after the Rhodes?

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.570
So I'm headed to law
school and business school.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.180
I'll doing the joint
when I come back.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.430
Are you doing that at Harvard?

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.320
Yeah, both here.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:28.850
Oh, good.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:29.808
So we'll see you again.

00:33:29.808 --> 00:33:30.700
I'll be back, yeah.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.649
You'll have a couple
more commencements.

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:33.190
Good for you.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.620
Alex, thank you so much.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.970
Enjoy the rest of the day.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.210
Thank you so much, Diana.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.660
A great pleasure.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.500
Great pleasure to have you here.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.730
Yes, thank you.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.210
OK, we see the final handful
of undergraduates filing in.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.750
Here's one of our honorands.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.310
And I think many people
will recognize him.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.560
Yes, there we go.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.937
President George
H W Bush, 41st--

00:33:57.937 --> 00:33:59.020
And he's with Roger Porter

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.740
--president of
the United States.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.620
Every honorary
degree recipient is

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.010
accompanied by a
Harvard faculty member.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.210
Of course, the
commencement speaker,

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.170
the head of the honorary
degree class this year,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:14.620
is Michael Bloomberg, former
mayor of New York City.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.999
He's accompanied by Rebecca
Henderson, university professor

00:34:18.999 --> 00:34:22.911
at the Business School.

00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:27.040
Well, at the honorary
degree dinner

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.530
last evening, George Bush
was not able to attend.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:34.345
He's conserving his energy
these days, and rightly so.

00:34:34.345 --> 00:34:36.179
But it's a great honor
to have him here.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:40.469
Honestly, no matter where you
were on the political spectrum

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.639
during the Bush years, there
was a lot that happened,

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:48.370
including the fall of the Berlin
Wall, and the end of the Soviet

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.580
Union, and--

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.230
He also was a huge president.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.790
He achieved a lot.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.730
I think that people
are not aware of some

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.810
of his spectacular achievements
in the environment.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.810
For example, the clean
air amendments of 1990

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.370
were really under his--

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.150
There's another
of our honorands.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.450
People may not recognize him.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.470
That's Seymour Slive.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.890
That is Seymour Slive, they say.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:13.400
Slive.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.440
But he is a great art historian.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:23.910
I knew him for conversation at
several Cambridge Scientific

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.540
Club, or some of these things
that were really interesting.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.210
It's a wonderful tradition
that every year, at least one

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.940
of the honorary
degree recipients

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.010
is a former Harvard
faculty member.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.510
Yeah.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:38.610
And there are a lot of long time
Harvard faculty members who,

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.500
well, who already
have degrees, but who

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.170
deserve the honor of
an honorary degree.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.290
And we'll see all of
the honorary degree

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.745
recipients in just
a little while.

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:48.890
We'll see them one by one.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.490
And everybody who has a
Gazette in their hands

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.890
already knows who they are.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.400
A friend of mine,
one of our colleagues

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.120
who was on the honorary
degree committee that

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.095
selects the honorary
degrees recipients

00:36:03.095 --> 00:36:05.220
told me a story-- I don't
know if it's apocryphal--

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:11.500
but that President Bush, when
he was told that he was selected

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.400
to receive an honorary
degree from Harvard this year

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.690
said, oh, that's wonderful.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.100
Barbara can just drive
me down from Maine.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.730
I don't know if that's
actually how he got here.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.480
I imagine.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.631
That's a wonderful story.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.316
It's only about an
hour from [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.860
Well, the honorary
degrees will be

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:44.040
awarded at the very end of
the festival rites today.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.100
One of the things that I
tore out of the Gazette,

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.830
I think it is, is the
accounting of sustainability

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:56.560
that might interest you in
today's commencement program.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:03.140
That there will be 1,500
pounds of sustainable salmon.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.670
100% of Harvard Yard grounds
are managed organically

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:11.490
with zero toxic
pesticides or herbicides.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:15.920
There are 109 receptacles for
recycling roundabout here.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.100
A sense that
sustainability is something

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.260
that goes from what we eat
to how we manage the grounds.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.780
And certainly, how we
think about the science

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.380
of the future.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.410
I mean, this must be
extraordinary for you,

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.290
the director of the
Harvard University Center

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.950
for the Environment.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.510
Such an important--

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.160
I can't help but think
about these issues

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.696
when I look out at the class.

00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:47.320
Looking at all of these students
from the professional schools,

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.584
from the college, these are
the environmental challenges

00:37:51.584 --> 00:37:54.000
that they're going to struggle
with for their whole lives.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.510
Yeah.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.290
I mean, this is-- when they
talk about the rising sea level

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:04.230
and what it will be
like in 2050 or 2075,

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.970
this is part of the lives
of the people who are here.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:08.950
We are passing these
challenges onto them.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:12.844
And in some ways,
you can tell when

00:38:12.844 --> 00:38:15.370
you talk to these
students, they're

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.620
passionate about these issues.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.280
They're curious.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.120
They want to get out
there and solve them.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.245
They have all
sorts of new ideas.

00:38:22.245 --> 00:38:25.454
And I think it's hard not to
feel a little bit optimistic

00:38:25.454 --> 00:38:26.870
when you actually
look out and see

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.310
all of these smart students
heading off to the world

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.100
and try to make
it a better place.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.240
There's Richard Tarrant, has a
very important role in Harvard

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.140
commencement.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.290
He is the person who is in
charge of the committee that

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.340
selects the student
commencement speakers,

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.110
and that coaches
them as they practice

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.930
to deliver their address
before such a huge

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:55.960
and in many ways very,
very intimidating crowd.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.730
And if you ask who is speaking
at Harvard commencement,

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:05.710
well, the speakers here are
literally three students--

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.760
two undergraduates and
a graduate student.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.800
And then of course,
this afternoon, people

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.220
will acknowledge that
there is the speech

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:20.570
of former mayor of New
York Mayor Bloomberg.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:24.600
But the speakers are
basically students here.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.539
A Latin address and
two English addresses.

00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:29.080
That's right.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.030
So there's some relatively
short addresses by students.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.730
And the rest of it is
really just the ceremony.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:37.230
It happens very, very quickly.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.590
Really, once it starts, it'll
be over in about an hour

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.640
and a half.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.790
But there are a lot of students
to acknowledge in the meantime.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:49.490
Many of the people who are
interested in the speakers

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:52.730
at the Harvard
commencement in general

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.540
also are interested in who is
speaking at the class days.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.300
We mentioned Sheryl
Sandberg, the CEO of Facebook

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.570
who spoke yesterday
to the undergraduates.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.200
At the Kennedy
School, the class day

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.750
speaker with Samantha
Power, who is currently

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.999
our ambassador to
the United Nations.

00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:09.540
That's right.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.810
Samantha ran the Carr
Center for Human Rights

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.820
here at the Kennedy
School for many years.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.550
She's a spectacular
journalist and author,

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.270
wrote that beautiful
book on a history

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.440
of American foreign policy
dealing with genocide.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.746
Yes.

00:40:26.746 --> 00:40:27.495
Lessons from Hell.

00:40:27.495 --> 00:40:29.320
Problem from Hell, yes.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.560
And really has been
very influential

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.030
on the National Security Council
in the Obama administration

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:43.390
before she was appointed to the
ambassador position to the UN.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:49.320
At the School of Public Health--
or I think maybe at the Medical

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:54.000
School rather-- Vivek Murthy,
also a Harvard graduate

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.310
who was the nominee
for Surgeon General,

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.530
was the class day speaker.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.060
And each of the
schools-- Law School,

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.770
Public Health-- have
their own speakers

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.090
for the in gathering
of the class

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.760
on the day before commencement.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.800
But Samantha Power
is a classic example

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.670
of someone who really very
common at Harvard how many

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.665
of our colleagues, both on the
faculty and former students,

00:41:21.665 --> 00:41:22.710
who go onto service.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.800
Who really focus on
serving this nation

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.900
and serving the world in
a variety of capacities.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.970
Today, we say goodbye
to a colleague of ours

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.650
in the law school, David Barron.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.590
David and I taught
a course together.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:40.645
He focuses on a variety
of issues in cities.

00:41:40.645 --> 00:41:42.981
And we taught a
course together on how

00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:46.059
Boston will deal with sea
level rise, along with a couple

00:41:46.059 --> 00:41:48.100
of professors from the
Graduate School of Design.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.400
And what about the river houses?

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.570
Are they still
going to be there?

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.480
They will still be there.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.105
I'm a little more
worried about Austin.

00:41:53.105 --> 00:41:55.730
But David Barron.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.290
Served in the early days
of the Obama administration

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.900
in the Legal Counsel office.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.020
And then he's now
just been nominated

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.110
to become a judge on
the circuit court.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:07.560
He was just confirmed
a few days ago.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.510
And so he will be leaving
Harvard tomorrow, on Friday,

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.230
and take up his
judgeship in Boston.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.440
It's both bittersweet.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.020
It's wonderful that
he will be there.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.520
We need his kind of wise
counsel on the bench.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.640
But at same time, we'll miss him
from being part of our faculty.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.260
We remember today, of course,
that you were reminding me

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.530
as we gather that
this is actually

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.609
the birthday of John F Kennedy.

00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:32.150
That's right.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.500
He would be 97 if
he were alive today.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.800
When I think of the
50th reunion class,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.750
I mean, this has been
from start to finish

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.620
a year of 50th commemorations.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.890
And that 50th reunion class
lived through them all, really,

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.450
from the beginning of
their senior year on.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:55.280
There was the 50th anniversary
of the March on Washington.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.220
Then the 50th anniversary
and commemoration

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.610
of the assassination
of President Kennedy.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.110
Yeah.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.590
In fact, if you talk to
the 50th reunion class,

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.860
I've spoken to many of them.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.250
They all know exactly where
they were at that time

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.940
when they heard that news.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.860
And then the 50th
anniversary of that spring,

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.160
when students went down to
lobby for the civil rights bill.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.944
And the 50th anniversary
of the visit of the Beatles

00:43:22.944 --> 00:43:23.485
to Cambridge.

00:43:23.485 --> 00:43:27.835
I mean, all of this was
part of the lived life

00:43:27.835 --> 00:43:30.250
of that remarkable class.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:34.830
And it includes, by the way, you
mentioned Sheila Jasanoff and--

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:35.690
Marshal Ganz.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.020
--Marshal Gantz.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:41.410
Stephen Breyer, a
Supreme Court Justice.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:47.270
And Andy Weil, one of the
great health gurus of our time

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.365
all back for this 50th reunion.

00:43:49.365 --> 00:43:52.420
And we wish them well.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.840
I have one personal interest
in this Extension School class

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.170
that's graduating.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:01.600
And that is my to
be daughter-in-law

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:07.480
is getting a degree in
extension studies as a graduate

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.530
with a Master's in
Museum Studies today.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.810
Diana, congratulations.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:12.820
That's wonderful.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.542
Good for her.

00:44:13.542 --> 00:44:14.250
What is her name?

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.190
Her name is Crystal Stone.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.610
And her fiance,
Kreshnik Zejnullahu

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.010
is one of the four
kids from Kosovo

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.050
who came to live
with us in 1999.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.740
And he will graduate from
medical school in UMass

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.970
on Sunday.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.320
And then the two of them
will get married a week

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.370
from Saturday in
Lowell House, and then

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:40.510
head off for his residency
at University of California

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:41.990
at San Francisco.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:43.805
So it's really fun.

00:44:43.805 --> 00:44:45.059
It's wonderful.

00:44:45.059 --> 00:44:47.350
And of course, the Extension
School is often forgotten,

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.411
but it's a very important
part of Harvard.

00:44:49.411 --> 00:44:49.910
It is.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.310
The way that we
reach so many people

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.940
who have a variety of
alternative education

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.930
opportunities.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.160
It's open.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.740
It's our Open University.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.660
And it really is
very, very important.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.467
So many people are connected
to this proceeding today.

00:45:06.467 --> 00:45:09.281
I was at the doctor yesterday.

00:45:09.281 --> 00:45:12.095
I went to see an eye
doctor yesterday.

00:45:12.095 --> 00:45:13.585
I don't need glasses.

00:45:13.585 --> 00:45:14.515
I'm fine.

00:45:14.515 --> 00:45:17.420
But I was telling-- he
asked me what I did.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.302
And I told him I was
a professor and was

00:45:19.302 --> 00:45:21.010
going to be doing the
commencement today.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:24.000
He told me about
his niece, who's

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.670
graduating from the Medical
School, Catherine Eric

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.404
Kohn, who's part of the
Medical School class today.

00:45:30.404 --> 00:45:31.820
Oh, there you see
Mayor Bloomberg.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.440
Mayor Bloomberg with
one of our honorands.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.420
Very special woman.

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.400
Very special woman.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.840
Aretha Franklin.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.268
This is going to be really a
very exciting, very exciting

00:45:44.268 --> 00:45:46.220
commencement morning.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.870
Everyone does have
their memories.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:51.310
And you talk about
your eye doctor.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:57.390
I was running across the street
and hailed by a former class

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:02.350
day speaker, or commencement
speaker, the comedian Jimmy

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:05.380
Tingle, who was with us
a couple of years ago.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.600
I do think most
everyone is seated.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.570
I don't see those
rows of empty chairs.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:18.760
I think when we see the
marshals come down the aisle

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:24.490
and report to the
university marshal

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.490
that everyone is seated.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.736
I still see a handful
of students filing in.

00:46:28.736 --> 00:46:29.360
There they are.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.700
But they're almost done.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:35.150
You can see the end of
the procession there.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:38.130
The band playing
10,000 Men of Harvard.

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:43.510
And certainly today, there
are 20,000 men and women

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.380
of Harvard gathered here in
the Tercentenary Theatre.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.500
It is just extraordinary
to see this space so filled

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.900
with such a gala
array of people.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.400
There's Dean Pfister, who
has served so admirably

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.290
as the interim dean
of the college.

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.110
Talking to Jackie
O'Neill, the marshal.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.720
And she's about
ready to get going.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.670
Martha Minow just
walked by the camera,

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.795
the dean of the Law School.

00:47:08.795 --> 00:47:10.390
And Julio Frenk is
looking at us there

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:11.595
in his blue and gold robes.

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:12.470
And in the white is--

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.330
Former health minister
of Mexico, and now dean

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:15.621
of the School of Public Health.

00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:19.100
In the white is Grace Scheibner,
who deserves a lot of credit

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.390
for putting this
whole show together.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.400
She has an office over
in Wadsworth House

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.281
and works on this from one
commencement to another.

00:47:27.281 --> 00:47:27.780
Yes.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.300
Planning for this event does
not happen in just a few weeks.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.420
This is something that
really takes all year long.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:37.450
There's Jackie O'Neill.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:41.090
This is the oldest
non-religious ritual

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.670
in the United
States, the festival

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:46.930
rites of Harvard commencement.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.160
And this sense of the
gathering of a great university

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.370
is really powerful,
of the faculties,

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.970
of the students,
and of the alumnae,

00:47:55.970 --> 00:48:01.290
who constitute part of what
is now embraced in that term--

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:02.081
Harvard University.

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:11.004
Here come the marshals, the
last few people to file in.

00:48:11.004 --> 00:48:12.462
Let's see them with
their top hats.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:21.190
The array of marshals
responsible for keeping order

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:26.145
as the ushers and sort of ritual
magistrates of the university.

00:48:26.145 --> 00:48:28.520
It's kind of remarkable that
this isn't just total chaos.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.430
It is incredible that
this is not total chaos.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:35.930
And that is due to the good
offices of the marshals.

00:48:45.517 --> 00:48:46.600
Everybody's getting ready.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.120
I can sense the anticipation
of the students.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.207
The last few people
are filing in now.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.600
There they are.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:09.080
Ben Levy reporting, Harry Lewis
reporting to Jackie O'Neill

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.640
that all is in order.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.152
[BELL RINGS]

00:49:11.152 --> 00:49:11.860
The bell is rung.

00:49:16.279 --> 00:49:18.734
[CHEERING]

00:49:18.734 --> 00:49:21.189
A roar goes up from this crowd.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.740
Mr. Sheriff, pray,
give us order.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:16.050
As the high sheriff
of Middlesex County,

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:25.688
I declare that the
meeting will be in order.

00:50:25.688 --> 00:50:28.652
[CHEERING]

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:56.224
Please rise as our honorand
Miss Aretha Franklin performs--

00:50:56.224 --> 00:51:00.697
[CHEERING]

00:51:00.697 --> 00:51:03.679
--performs the national anthem--

00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:08.170
[CHEERING]

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.200
--after which the
chaplain of the day

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.850
will deliver the opening prayer.

00:51:22.266 --> 00:51:45.144
Oh say can you see by the dawn's
early light, what so proudly

00:51:45.144 --> 00:51:57.420
we hailed at the twilight's
last gleaming, whose

00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:13.799
broad stripes and bright stars
through the perilous night o'er

00:52:13.799 --> 00:52:25.740
the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:44.550
And the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air,

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:58.910
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.850
[CHEERING]

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:21.813
Oh say does that star
spangled banner yet

00:53:21.813 --> 00:53:53.250
wave, o'er the land of
the free and the home-- we

00:53:53.250 --> 00:54:02.731
are the home of the brave.

00:54:02.731 --> 00:54:06.723
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:06.723 --> 00:54:11.713
The home of the brave.

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:41.200
Look to the soaring heavens.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.800
Look to the depths
of our hearts.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:50.000
And let us pray that
from horizon to horizon,

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.570
from the first glimmering of
an idea to its full flowering,

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.170
from the dawning
of companionship

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.850
to firm friendship and
fellowship in learning,

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:05.800
all we celebrate
today be blessed.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.400
May the world find blessing in
the women and men of Harvard.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.970
May these bannered hosts
arrayed in crimson fledge

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:20.520
as forces for good in
the world of our times,

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.770
so that speedily and soon,
on the hill of Washington

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:27.100
and in the canyons
of Wall Street,

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.530
in the highest
reaches of academe,

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:32.920
and on the vanguard's of
our arts and industry,

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.140
in schools and in hospitals, in
laboratories and in law firms,

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:43.020
in theaters of conflict, and
in crucibles of statecraft,

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:47.150
there may be heard new
voices of wisdom and voices

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:52.640
of compassion, voices of
reason and voices of insight,

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.800
voices of exhilaration and
voices of understanding.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.000
Voices that say,
let us join hands

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.240
to forge a way of purpose and of
promise, for the need is great,

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.450
and the time has come.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:13.510
For just as the rain and the
snow fall from the heavens

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:16.530
and there do not return
without first having watered

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:20.860
the Earth so that she births,
and sprouts, and gives seed

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:25.010
to the one who sows and
bread to the one who eats,

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:29.060
so too shall be my word which
proceedeth from my mouth.

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:33.310
It shall not return to me
unfulfilled, nor without first

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:38.100
having accomplished that which
I desire, and having prospered,

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.820
that for which I send it.

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:47.550
You shall go forth in joy
and be guided by peace.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:52.190
The mountains and the hills will
give a joyous shout before you,

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:55.410
and all the trees of
the field will applaud.

00:56:55.410 --> 00:57:01.180
So may it be with us this
glorious day and every day.

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.559
And if such can be your prayer
today, then say with me amen.

00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:05.059
Amen.

00:57:20.528 --> 00:57:23.522
[SINGING IN LATIN]

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:40.080
Latin salutatory.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.300
[SPEAKING LATIN]

00:58:48.102 --> 00:58:51.470
Did I get that right?

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:53.770
Candidate for the
degree of bachelor

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:56.930

Barry-Heffernan.

[APPLAUSE]

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:37.110
Senior English address, a
Harvard spring candidate

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:41.518
for the degree of bachelor
of arts, Sarah Abushaar.

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:06.660
When I was around seven,
my toothless brother

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:11.900
and I on long, boring
taxi rides in Syria

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.920
would indulge in
imperialistic fantasies

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.740
of how we wanted to
take over the country

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.360
outside our windows.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.830
My parents would quickly
crush these imperial conquests

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:30.130
by warning, shh, you'll get
taking by Secret Service

01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:32.800
if they hear you.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.290
The walls everywhere,
we were told,

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:39.850
could hear our
revolutionary ideas

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:42.650
and would send us to prison.

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:47.870
Whereas children here had
ghosts and the bogey man,

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:53.270
our equivalents our governments.

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:57.550
Fast forward to 2010.

01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:00.540
When I first got
here, someone told me

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:05.037
if Harvard shut its gates, it
could be its own country, just

01:07:05.037 --> 01:07:05.745
like the Vatican.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:12.080
As I've walked through
this place every day

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.750
for the past four
years, I was struck

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:18.750
by how true this idea was.

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:22.910
I thought everywhere
the Harvard nation.

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:27.160
I saw it in the big
and obvious things.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.260
We had our own version of the
Statue of Liberty-- the John

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.700
Harvard statue.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:39.160
Our own embassies, the Harvard
clubs of Boston and London.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.360
A tax collection agency, the
Harvard Alumni Association.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:52.990
And an endowment larger than
more than half the world's

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:56.150
countries GDPs.

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:59.960
We also have our own
diplomatic passports.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.880
Nowhere did I see this
more clearly than at US

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.690
immigration at
Boston Logan Airport.

01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:10.100
Whenever they saw I was
coming from the Middle

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.690
East-- what were
you doing there.

01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.890
Why are you here?

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.935
Why did God make you
from the Middle East?

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:25.319
But I made sure I dressed like
our overly proud Harvard dads

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:28.130
with Harvard hat, Harvard shirt,
Harvard shorts, and Harvard

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:30.470
underwear.

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:35.130
And as soon as they saw I
was a citizen of Harvard,

01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:38.750
oh, you go to Harvard.

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:42.300
Surely you must not be a
national security threat.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.596
Welcome to America.

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:53.420
And suddenly, all the gates to
the American dream opened wide.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:59.450
I saw it everywhere,
this Harvard nation,

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:04.229
but I saw it not just
in the hard structures.

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:09.689
But more importantly, in
its invisible institutions.

01:09:09.689 --> 01:09:13.840
The invisible scaffolds
around and under-girding

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.660
the hard institutions.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.840
I saw it in the quarreling
columns of the Crimson

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.290
newspaper, it's kung fu fights
of ideas and lively student

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:31.569
debates with the potency
to propel policy changes

01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:35.069
by the next morning's print.

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:39.779
I saw it in our cluttered
bulletin boards, bustling

01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:44.180
with life, with announcements
of student led conferences,

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.670
Broadway worthy shows,
and dorm room projects

01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:49.220
turned world's next Facebook
smothering each other

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.800
for our cursory glimpse.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.020
A trivial detail,
these cluttered boards

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.900
that often slip notice.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:04.530
But where some saw papers, I saw
passions, purpose, creativity.

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:11.060
I saw a heartbeat of civic
community's vivacity.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.780
My parents'
countries were places

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.960
where institutional
dysfunction killed off

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.690
the social dynamism and
vibrant productivity.

01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:22.750
And so I felt acutely
here the value

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:29.340
of civil society and living,
breathing institutions.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.690
My time here would
give me a working model

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.630
of a better world.

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:44.660
Not only that, but that sense of
empowerment to initiate change.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.400
You see, with those
spying walls still lurking

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.140
in my memory that constrained
the little Napoleons

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.060
in my brother and me, you
might imagine my shock

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.680
when in one of my
first classes here,

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:04.143
I suddenly found myself
debating a president.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.150
So it's the 1990s.

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:14.140
Our negotiations class
professor set the stage.

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.440
A war is about to break out
between Ecuador and Peru.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.340
How will you stop it?

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.850
I raised my hand to respond.

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:22.590
Wait.

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:25.410
Professor Shapiro stopped me.

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:28.330
Tell the president what to do.

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:31.563
And in walked the
Ecuadorian president.

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:38.260
And bringing the
president to me and having

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.800
me speak to and question
a shaper of history

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.400
and experience the
value he saw in my view,

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.770
Harvard would make me
feel I too could be him.

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:50.480
I too had the power to
shape history and not

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.350
just be passively shaped by it.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:55.840
That sense of
infinite possibility

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:01.120
we have as children to think
big and conquer great things

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.180
was returned to me here.

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:07.810
A less despotic version of it.

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:12.630
But what seemed intractable
problems of the world

01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:19.980
became opportunities for
me, for us to change things.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:23.500
You know, when I first got
here, my name was Sarah.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.343
After Harvard, it
would become, hey

01:12:25.343 --> 01:12:30.590
Harvard, with people
stuffing 378 years,

01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:34.600
5,000 acres of real estate, the
entirety of Widener Library,

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:41.700
and 32 heads of state all into
my five foot six inch self.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:50.270
Ridiculous as it is, there's
a strange reality to it.

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.930
Arab American
author Randa Jarrar

01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:56.330
pictures inhabiting a new
place as running barefoot,

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.610
the skin of our
feet collecting sand

01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:01.250
and seeds and rocks and
grass until we had shoes,

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:06.350
shoes made of everything
we picked up as we ran.

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:10.040
And running through Harvard
Yard over the past four years,

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.950
the skin of our feet collecting
a world of experiences,

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:21.110
we each become this
place in a strange way.

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:24.190
Each of us picking up bits of
people, and history, and ideas

01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:27.560
that changed the way
we saw the world.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:33.230
Accumulations I hope we will
continue to wear on our souls

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:37.360
and leave a footprint of all the
best we took from Harvard Yard

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.300
on our new destinations.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:45.090
And that's why I am
hopeful for the future.

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:47.750
I'm hopeful because of
my dining hall dinners

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:50.560
spent marveling at friends who,
while their countries waged

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.910
bloody war against each
other, are able to carry out

01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:58.830
civil conversation and build
generative projects together.

01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:01.770
I am hopeful because
of the founding mothers

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:05.530
and founding fathers of
revolutionary ideas like these

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:07.735
being launched
into the world, who

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:10.050
will make of its institutions,
its constitutions,

01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:16.010
its hospitals, its art
houses something better.

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:21.590
We hear a lot in the news
about an Arab Spring.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:26.690
This graduation is
sending 6,000 revolutions

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:30.450
into the world in the 6,000
revolutions graduating

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:34.460
as part of the class of 2014.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:38.090
If we take those revolutions,
those great ideas

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:41.910
sparked behind Chipotle
burritos and Starbucks coffee

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:46.660
cups in our version of Tahrir
Square, Harvard Square,

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.480
out with us into the real world,
into the real Tahrir Squares,

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.610
and make something of them.

01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:55.100
Revolution's not in
arms, but in minds

01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:01.500
more powerful, and
permanent, and pervasive.

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:09.220
For this isn't a Ukrainian
revolution or an Arab Spring,

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.340
but a global revolution.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.840
This is the Harvard
spring of 2014.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.340
This is the Harvard Spring.

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.590
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:06.150
Graduate English address,
A Kind of Destiny.

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:08.980
Candidate for the
degree of Master

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.040
in Public Policy,
Philip A Harding.

01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:32.410
Over two centuries
ago, a man came

01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:38.590
to Harvard uncertain of
his future and his fate.

01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.900
He had received an offer
he could not refuse,

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:46.940
and though he felt unworthy,
he wrote to his family

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:50.580
that he believed
a kind of destiny

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.820
was driving him to Cambridge.

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:58.680
He spent his first night right
here sleeping in Harvard Yard,

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:05.240
and awoke the next
morning-- July 3, 1775--

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.640
to take command of the troops
of the United Provinces of North

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:16.040
America, the fledgling
Continental Army.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:20.380
George Washington had a unique
Harvard application process.

01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:28.520
His admissions committee was
the Second Continental Congress.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.000
And his experience
here at Harvard

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
would not only define the
final 24 years of his life,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.370
but the startup he
launched here would go on

01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:47.780
to change the course
of human history.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:52.490
Just across the street, under a
tree, is a group of monuments,

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:56.230
one displaying rows of
strapping uniformed soldiers

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:58.640
welcoming Washington
to Cambridge.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.010
And another says,
under this tree,

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.910
Washington first took command
of the American army--

01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:07.730
July 3, 1775.

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:09.635
And I've always
felt a sense of awe

01:18:09.635 --> 01:18:13.010
for this world changing spot.

01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:15.910
But then I did some
research, and I

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:18.033
found something less romantic.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:25.940
Washington's Harvard welcome
weekend was less than grand,

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.750
and his first year Harvard
was downright awful.

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:33.650
On Sunday, July 2, he
rode in to a deserted

01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:39.910
looking town soaking
wet and half sick.

01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:43.420
In fact, the welcome reception
was canceled due to rain.

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.620
And several soldiers
wrote in their journals

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:53.010
that nothing new or remarkable
happened on July 3rd.

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:56.390
Imagine if we could go back in
time to this very spot that day

01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:58.780
in 1775.

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.740
We would be sitting in
a very different Harvard

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:08.420
Yard, a field full of makeshift
tents, un-uniformed soldiers,

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.610
and a rough defense position
in place of Lamont Library.

01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.540
One historian
described this scene

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:20.260
like Woodstock, New York 1969.

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.930
A volunteer undisciplined,
under-equipped militia

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:26.880
of farmers and merchants.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.290
This was the group,
about half the size

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:32.900
of the crowd we've
assembled this morning,

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.730
this was the group
that Washington

01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:39.480
came to lead against the
most powerful military force

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.570
on Earth.

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:45.990
But Washington took what was
offered to him here at Harvard

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:48.244
and he made the most of it.

01:19:48.244 --> 01:19:49.910
And I'm not just
talking about the brass

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.430
doorknobs, or the metal roof
he took off Harvard hall

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:57.250
to melt into musket balls--
which they did take.

01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:04.680
But he took ideas that existed
only as words and writings

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:11.190
and he turned them into reality
for millions and generations

01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:11.690
to come.

01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:18.690
And less than a year later,
after pushing the British out

01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:22.700
of Boston, Washington
received an honorary degree

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:29.580
from this fine institution,
his first academic degree.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.380
And like many
Harvard graduates, he

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:36.010
went on to take a prominent
position in New York City.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:46.920
And it almost killed him.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.800
Well, the British
nearly killed him.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.450
And we almost lost
the entire war.

01:20:52.450 --> 01:20:56.180
In fact, the next seven
years of the war effort

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.612
would become the most
challenging years of his life.

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:08.420
Today, you will receive a
piece of paper representing

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:11.890
your short time here at Harvard.

01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:16.860
Your successes, your failures,
your all night study sessions,

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:21.135
your lessons, your
first A minus.

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:33.000
And the friendships that
will last a lifetime.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.760
Through these
experiences, you've

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:39.240
developed, practiced, and
honed the skills you need.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:45.030
But sitting here today, facing
an uncertain future-- let alone

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:48.040
the examples of mayors and
entrepreneurs, Nobel Prize

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.430
winners, presidents,
and a queen,

01:21:51.430 --> 01:22:00.320
the queen of soul--
sitting here today

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.380
facing a lot of uncertainty
and a lot of high bars,

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.610
it might seem
difficult to connect

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:09.340
the dots to your destiny.

01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.070
But have faith.

01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:15.290
Because there is a kind of
destiny waiting to be fulfilled

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:19.079
that is uniquely yours.

01:22:19.079 --> 01:22:21.120
You see, Washington had
to go through a difficult

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.670
transformation process, even
after receiving his Harvard

01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:28.330
degree, to turn
his kind of destiny

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:33.540
into a real force that
could change history.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:38.480
And he came to discover
he could not do it alone.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.710
The individuals
and incidents that

01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:43.330
faced him over the
next seven years

01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:46.380
whittled, carved,
and sculpted him

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:51.460
into the monumental
man we remember today.

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.660
And in the end,
the army he thought

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:57.550
he was coming to
transform ended up

01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:00.620
being the force that
transformed him.

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:05.684
And while you may
not realize it yet,

01:23:05.684 --> 01:23:07.100
some of the biggest
lessons you'll

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.570
take with you from
this experience

01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:15.610
have come from the people who've
been learning right beside you.

01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:16.800
They've challenged you.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.820
They've pushed you.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.600
They've inspired you.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.880
They've supported
you, and ultimately

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.045
helped reveal a better
version of yourself.

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.320
You see, the
question is not only

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:36.784
what you will take with you,
but who you will take with you.

01:23:39.450 --> 01:23:45.600
On July 4, 1775, still a full
year before the Declaration

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.570
of Independence, Washington
issued his first general orders

01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:52.120
to the troops from right
here in Harvard Yard,

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.260
declaring that all
distinctions of colonies

01:23:55.260 --> 01:24:01.470
should be laid aside so that one
spirit may animate the whole,

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:06.100
and the only contest
be who shall render,

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:09.850
on this great and trying
occasion, the most

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:13.990
essential service to this
great and common cause

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:18.030
in which we are all engaged.

01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:20.430
And just as Washington
came here to Harvard

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:24.760
to unite the 13 colonies, we've
come together this morning

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.700
to celebrate the unity and
diversity of our 13 schools.

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.310
Whether you are driven to
solve the world's largest

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:39.140
public or private problems,
cure that dreaded disease,

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:44.120
alleviate human suffering, work
across religious and cultural

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:50.305
divides, generate knowledge
and push education forward.

01:24:50.305 --> 01:24:55.540
[CHEERING]

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:58.708
Create effective
legal frameworks.

01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:01.690
[CHEERING]

01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:05.050
Design and construct the
future world we live in.

01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:08.340
[CHEERING]

01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:11.940
Or use technology to enable new
discoveries and innovations.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.766
[CHEERING]

01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:24.760
Whatever kind of destiny
is compelling you today,

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.835
imagine the countless lives that
are waiting for you to step up.

01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:37.440
In two centuries, who might be
talking about the grand mission

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:41.370
you begin today in this yard?

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:45.490
Who will be saying
they sat right there

01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:48.090
under that tree in that spot?

01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:54.740
Let today be your moment to
accept the challenge that

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.850
has been offered to you.

01:25:56.850 --> 01:26:00.250
Bring that most
essential service only

01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:05.360
you can provide to this
great and common cause.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.245
And together, let us not
just go change the world,

01:26:10.245 --> 01:26:15.688
but let us go serve
the world with passion.

01:26:15.688 --> 01:26:19.160
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.376
[SINGING LATIN]

01:29:37.093 --> 01:29:39.979
[APPLAUSE]

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:39.150
Each candidate stands
before you prepared

02:00:39.150 --> 02:00:43.440
to advance knowledge,
promote understanding,

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:47.274
and to serve society.

02:00:47.274 --> 02:00:50.190
[CHEERING]

02:00:54.564 --> 02:00:58.590
By virtue of authority
delegated to me,

02:00:58.590 --> 02:01:04.070
I confer on you the first
degree in Arts or in Sciences

02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:08.430
and admit you to the fellowship
of educated men and women.

02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:09.280
Congratulations.

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:12.773
[APPLAUSE]

02:02:22.633 --> 02:02:25.627
[CHANTING]

02:03:37.590 --> 02:03:41.200
OK, my turn now.

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:45.490
No one, it has been
said of our first guest,

02:03:45.490 --> 02:03:48.880
has done more to kindle
a passion for the arts

02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:51.030
at Harvard.

02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:55.830
He joined the Harvard
faculty 60 years ago,

02:03:55.830 --> 02:04:00.350
a World War II Navy
veteran with two degrees

02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:03.670
from the University of Chicago.

02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:08.460
He went on to become a
preeminent art historian,

02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:16.150
a museum leader, and a teacher
of uncommon prowess and flair.

02:04:16.150 --> 02:04:19.570
He has shaped the
study of Dutch art,

02:04:19.570 --> 02:04:23.010
especially the golden
age works of Rembrandt

02:04:23.010 --> 02:04:25.770
and other Dutch masters.

02:04:25.770 --> 02:04:31.500
His famed lectures captivated
thousands of Harvard students,

02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:35.250
spellbinding talks,
one student recalls,

02:04:35.250 --> 02:04:40.390
that open both your
eyes and your heart.

02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:44.310
For nearly a decade,
he served with aplomb

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:47.630
as director of the
Fogg Art Museum,

02:04:47.630 --> 02:04:51.950
strengthening one of Harvard's
most treasured institutions

02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:57.480
and propelling plans
for the Sackler Museum.

02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:01.950
In one admirer's
words, he is a credit

02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:08.020
to humanity in every way as
a scholar, family man, friend

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:13.410
to many, generous in spirit,
and scrupulous in his dealings

02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:15.530
with everyone.

02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:18.110
When friends set out
to produce a volume

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:22.980
to commemorate his
75th birthday in 1995,

02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:26.900
they attracted nearly as many
eager contributors as the years

02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:28.990
it marked.

02:05:28.990 --> 02:05:32.760
He has personified the
university's commitment

02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:37.510
to understanding and
preserving culture at a time

02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:40.790
when the arts and humanities
more than ever demand

02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:44.020
and deserve our support.

02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:48.220
As a colleague writes, for
generations of students,

02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:52.440
he was art history at Harvard.

02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:58.480
Another said simply this-- he is
the only man at Harvard I ever

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:01.270
loved.

02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:05.060
We proudly honor Harvard's
own Gleason Professor

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:08.770
of Fine Arts Emeritus,
Seymour Slive.

02:06:08.770 --> 02:06:11.722
[APPLAUSE]

02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:31.540
A living portrait in
ebullient erudition and humane

02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:35.840
inspiration, he has
masterfully illumined the works

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:41.590
of Dutch masters, his own
career a rare work of art.

02:06:41.590 --> 02:06:45.752
Seymour Slive, Doctor of Arts.

02:06:45.752 --> 02:06:49.238
[APPLAUSE]

02:07:04.690 --> 02:07:07.590
Our next guest
has been a pioneer

02:07:07.590 --> 02:07:12.590
at the crossroads of law,
medicine, ethics, and policy,

02:07:12.590 --> 02:07:16.400
and she has been an
exemplar of academic values

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:21.870
and common sense in the
governance of the university.

02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:24.780
After a childhood in
the segregated south,

02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:29.600
she came to Massachusetts
to attend Wheaton College.

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:33.590
She went on to Harvard
Law School in an era

02:07:33.590 --> 02:07:37.270
when the doors of legal
education and practice

02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:41.970
had barely begun to open
for African American women.

02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:44.780
She pursued her
devotion to civil rights

02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:48.800
in positions at the Equal
Employment Opportunity

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:52.060
Commission and the
Department of Justice

02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:56.330
before launching a four decade
career at the Georgetown

02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:59.440
University Law Center.

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:03.370
Having served on a
landmark commission

02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:07.240
on protecting human subjects
of biomedical research,

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:13.350
she played a formative role in
shaping the field of bioethics.

02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:18.740
Over the years, she has applied
her expertise and judgment

02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:21.820
to complex ethical questions
posed by everything

02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:25.940
from human radiation
experiments to genomics,

02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:30.560
from stem cell research to
the interplay of bioethics

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:32.540
and race.

02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:36.570
At Harvard, she brought
her strong moral compass,

02:08:36.570 --> 02:08:40.970
her multi-disciplinary
outlook, and her deep concern

02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:45.030
for educational opportunity to
bear on the work of the Harvard

02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:51.040
Corporation from
2006 until 2012.

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:53.290
She has also played
leadership roles

02:08:53.290 --> 02:08:56.590
on the boards of Wheaton
College, the Russell Sage

02:08:56.590 --> 02:09:00.520
Foundation, and the
Kaiser Family Foundation,

02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.010
besides serving on
major advisory counsels

02:09:03.010 --> 02:09:04.880
for the National
Institutes of Health,

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:07.360
the Institute of
Medicine, and others.

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:13.370
She wears her prodigious
accomplishments

02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:16.930
with humility and grace.

02:09:16.930 --> 02:09:22.670
We have all been the fortunate
beneficiaries of her wisdom.

02:09:22.670 --> 02:09:28.370
We proudly honor our colleague
and friend Patricia King.

02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:31.779
[APPLAUSE]

02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:49.570
Bridging disciplines
and overcoming barriers,

02:09:49.570 --> 02:09:54.610
elucidating ethics, and
embracing beneficence,

02:09:54.610 --> 02:10:00.730
a trusted trustee whose
sagacity and tenacity

02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:04.780
always bend the arc
towards justice,

02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:08.915
Patricia N King, Doctor of Laws.

02:10:08.915 --> 02:10:11.849
[APPLAUSE]

02:10:25.550 --> 02:10:30.220
As a student, he was struck by
the incongruities he perceived

02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:34.400
between the standard models
taught in economics class

02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.360
and the realities he
witnessed in daily life.

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:41.380
He began to question
the invisible hand

02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:45.250
and to wonder about
the limits of markets.

02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:48.680
In time, he rose to
prominence in an array

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.230
of domains of economics--
macroeconomics

02:10:52.230 --> 02:10:57.550
and monetary theory,
development economics and trade,

02:10:57.550 --> 02:11:02.540
and the distribution of income
and wealth, to name a few.

02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:05.110
Among his academic
colleagues, he

02:11:05.110 --> 02:11:08.190
is perhaps best
recognized for shaping

02:11:08.190 --> 02:11:13.090
the economics of
information, in particular

02:11:13.090 --> 02:11:16.560
for explaining how uneven
access to information

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:20.010
affects the
operation of markets.

02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:25.600
His work earned him a
Nobel Prize in 2001.

02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:28.100
His noted books
for wider audiences

02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:31.860
include Globalization
and its Discontents

02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:35.090
and The Price of Inequality.

02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:39.790
They reflect his concern for
how and when governments should

02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:42.530
intervene in markets,
and how efforts

02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:44.950
to spur the global
economy might be

02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:49.110
devised to lessen rather
than widen the growing

02:11:49.110 --> 02:11:53.890
gap between rich and poor.

02:11:53.890 --> 02:12:01.160
He served at MIT, Yale,
Stanford, Oxford, and Princeton

02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:03.910
before becoming a
university professor

02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:07.850
at Columbia, where he founded
the initiative for policy

02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:13.790
dialogue and co-chairs the
Committee on Global Thought.

02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:18.910
Deeply engaged with national and
international economic policy,

02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:22.830
he has also serve as chairman
of the President's Council

02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:28.220
of Economic Advisers, chief
economist of the World Bank,

02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:32.810
and chair of the UN commission
on reforming the International

02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:37.190
Monetary and Financial System.

02:12:37.190 --> 02:12:42.330
We recognize the eminent
economist Joseph Stiglitz.

02:12:42.330 --> 02:12:45.300
[APPLAUSE]

02:12:59.170 --> 02:13:05.850
Demarking the limits of markets,
discerning global discontents,

02:13:05.850 --> 02:13:10.560
a paramount progenitor
of information economics

02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:15.470
who bestrides the spheres
of theory and policy,

02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:19.120
Joseph E Stiglitz,
Doctor of Laws.

02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:22.550
[APPLAUSE]

02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:35.910
He is one of the world's
great plant biologists

02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:40.120
and a champion of
global biodiversity.

02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:45.330
As one colleague put it, he
is a dynamo intellectually

02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:51.040
with a passion for science, for
nature, and for conservation

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:54.670
with a good dose
of fun mixed in.

02:13:54.670 --> 02:13:59.680
Time Magazine hailed him
as a hero for the planet.

02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:04.600
His many honors include the
National Medal of Science.

02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:09.130
He long led the renowned
Missouri Botanical Garden while

02:14:09.130 --> 02:14:12.080
serving as Angelman
Professor of Biology

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:16.230
at Washington
University in St. Louis.

02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:22.230
A prolific researcher, he
helped introduce co-evolution,

02:14:22.230 --> 02:14:26.130
a seminal concept in
evolutionary biology.

02:14:26.130 --> 02:14:29.230
He has also made
fundamental contributions

02:14:29.230 --> 02:14:33.690
in biogeography, folk taxonomy,
and pollution studies.

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:40.100
A distinguished teacher, he
has written leading textbooks

02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:43.370
on both botany and
the environment

02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:47.520
and mentored scores
of grateful students.

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:50.170
An energetic citizen
of science, he

02:14:50.170 --> 02:14:53.400
has been a central figure in
the work of both the National

02:14:53.400 --> 02:15:00.290
Academy of Sciences and the
National Geographic Society.

02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:04.630
Recognized worldwide for his
leadership in conservation

02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:10.580
and sustainability, he has been
elected to scientific academies

02:15:10.580 --> 02:15:15.710
in nearly 20 nations, from
Denmark to New Zealand,

02:15:15.710 --> 02:15:19.280
from Brazil to India.

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:24.750
He helped lead a massive
project to classify the 31,500

02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:28.060
species of plants
in China and has

02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:31.450
been a catalyst for
international scientific

02:15:31.450 --> 02:15:34.360
collaboration.

02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:38.750
We salute a man who in
the words of one admirer

02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:42.960
has touched the whole world
with the power of science

02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:49.001
and the moral imperative of the
conservation of life-- Peter

02:15:49.001 --> 02:15:49.995
Raven.

02:15:49.995 --> 02:15:53.474
[APPLAUSE]

02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:09.280
A grand sycamore in
the garden of science,

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:14.510
he has nourished our knowledge
of the phyla of flora

02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:19.240
and cultivated care for the
precious diversity of life--

02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:23.320
Peter Hamilton Raven,
Doctor of Science.

02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:26.792
[APPLAUSE]

02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:41.400
Maybe the most important
reason for writing

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:44.059
is to prevent the
erosion of time

02:16:44.059 --> 02:16:48.129
so that memories will not
be blown away by the wind,

02:16:48.129 --> 02:16:50.510
our next guest has said.

02:16:50.510 --> 02:16:55.490
We should write what
should not be forgotten.

02:16:55.490 --> 02:16:59.480
Her own vivid works of
imagination and remembrance

02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:02.540
will not be forgotten
by countless readers

02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:04.809
around the world.

02:17:04.809 --> 02:17:08.809
Born in Peru, raised
largely in Chile,

02:17:08.809 --> 02:17:11.870
she had a turbulent childhood.

02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:16.346
In time, she made her way as a
journalist and talk show host

02:17:16.346 --> 02:17:16.846
in Santiago.

02:17:19.959 --> 02:17:24.780
On September 11,
1973, a violent coup

02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:29.620
felled President Salvador
Allende, her cousin.

02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.430
Suddenly everything changed.

02:17:32.430 --> 02:17:41.490
By 1975, she was in exile in
Venezuela building a new life.

02:17:41.490 --> 02:17:46.590
In 1981, she learned that
her beloved grandfather,

02:17:46.590 --> 02:17:51.480
still living in
Chile, was dying.

02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:54.260
The letter she set
out to write him

02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:58.430
grew into her first novel,
The House of the Spirits,

02:17:58.430 --> 02:18:03.049
a landmark in Latin American
fiction and a testament

02:18:03.049 --> 02:18:07.120
to Chile's tumultuous times.

02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:11.440
She has gone on to
write 20 books in all,

02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.660
emerging as one of the Western
hemisphere's most illustrious

02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:18.379
authors.

02:18:18.379 --> 02:18:22.940
Her stories mix
history with fantasy,

02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:28.139
the intensely political
with the fiercely personal,

02:18:28.139 --> 02:18:33.530
the strikingly real with
the hauntingly surreal.

02:18:33.530 --> 02:18:37.330
Her several memoirs reflect
with candor and wonder

02:18:37.330 --> 02:18:42.610
on her own life experience,
including the devastating death

02:18:42.610 --> 02:18:45.230
of her daughter
Paula, in whose memory

02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:48.350
she maintains a
charitable foundation

02:18:48.350 --> 02:18:51.760
to promote the welfare of
women and children worldwide.

02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:58.629
Her lyrical style has
been described as packed

02:18:58.629 --> 02:19:02.070
with action, prodigal
in invention,

02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:05.370
vivid in description
and metaphor.

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:08.389
Her stories, as
one critic writes,

02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:11.820
have moved the readers of
Latin American literature

02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:16.280
in ways that few authors have.

02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:19.190
We honor Isabel Allende.

02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:22.130
[APPLAUSE]

02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:45.740
Conjuring memories
blown by winds of exile,

02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:49.630
leavening realism
with dashes of magic,

02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:53.500
she fills her splendorous
house of stories

02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:58.040
with spirits and shadows,
anguish and love.

02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:01.390
Isabel Allende,
Doctor of Letters.

02:20:01.390 --> 02:20:04.330
[APPLAUSE]

02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:22.260
This stage has been graced by
presidents and prime ministers,

02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:27.410
laureates and literary lights,
even the occasional prince

02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:30.060
or king.

02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:34.700
In fact, with us here today, we
have a president, a laureate,

02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:39.600
a literary luminary,
and even a King.

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:42.230
We now proudly welcome
to this esteemed company

02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:45.130
her regal highness,
the queen of soul.

02:20:45.130 --> 02:20:48.567
[APPLAUSE]

02:21:01.824 --> 02:21:05.670
Born in Memphis,
raised in Detroit,

02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:09.050
she was a child prodigy
with a voice that

02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:13.120
shook the rafters of her church.

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:18.970
As a teenager, she set out
on gospel caravan tours

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:20.950
with her father.

02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:23.990
She soon had a
recording contract.

02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:28.380
And within a few years, she was
not just climbing the charts,

02:21:28.380 --> 02:21:32.640
but topping them with
five straight singles that

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:36.740
sold more than a
million copies each.

02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:40.710
Over the years, her records
helped compose the soundtrack

02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:47.930
of a generation--
"Respect," "Chain of Fools,"

02:21:47.930 --> 02:21:56.570
"I Never Loved a Man," "Baby,
I Love You," "Think Until you

02:21:56.570 --> 02:22:03.380
Come Back to Me," "Spanish
Harlem," and on and on.

02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:08.300
She has won an eye
popping 18 Grammy awards.

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.102
[APPLAUSE]

02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:16.940
Including the award
for best female

02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:24.060
R&amp;B vocal performance for an
amazing eight straight years.

02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:28.900
Her voice has galvanized three
presidential inaugurations,

02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:33.660
and it graced the funeral of
Doctor Martin Luther King.

02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:38.320
The first woman inducted into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,

02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:43.940
and a recipient of the
National Medal of Arts,

02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:48.070
she was presented in 2005
with the nation's highest

02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:52.490
civilian honor-- the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.

02:22:52.490 --> 02:22:55.920
[APPLAUSE]

02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:04.150
Her vocal virtuosity
is so admired

02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:07.610
that her home state of
Michigan declared her voice

02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:10.130
one of the state's
natural resources.

02:23:10.130 --> 02:23:13.870
[LAUGHTER]

02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:16.760
There are singers,
Ray Charles once said,

02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:20.550
and then there is Aretha.

02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:25.710
With the utmost respect--
I won't spell it out--

02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:28.330
we honor Aretha Franklin.

02:23:28.330 --> 02:23:31.318
[APPLAUSE]

02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:01.340
Hey band, do that again.

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:03.380
We couldn't hear you
with the cheering.

02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:09.356
[LAUGHTER]

02:24:09.356 --> 02:24:12.344
[BAND PLAYING - ARETHA FRANKLIN,

02:24:31.766 --> 02:24:35.252
[CHEERING]

02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:44.790
Almighty fire and amazing
grace, she reigned sublime

02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:48.890
as the electrifying
empress of soul.

02:24:48.890 --> 02:24:53.510
For this, our highest honor,
she is a natural woman.

02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:56.328
Aretha Franklin, Doctor of Arts.

02:24:56.328 --> 02:24:59.262
[APPLAUSE]

02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:18.970
Our next guest's
singular career has

02:25:18.970 --> 02:25:22.850
combined extraordinary
entrepreneurial success,

02:25:22.850 --> 02:25:27.250
distinguished public service,
and visionary philanthropy

02:25:27.250 --> 02:25:29.840
for the common good.

02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:33.720
Born across the river at
Saint Elizabeth's Hospital

02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:38.500
in Allston/Brighton,
raised in nearby Medford,

02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:42.820
he worked his way through
college at Johns Hopkins

02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:46.170
before earning his MBA at
Harvard Business School.

02:25:46.170 --> 02:25:51.420
[CHEERING]

02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:53.900
Wall Street beckoned.

02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:58.550
He soon became a rising star in
equity trading and information

02:25:58.550 --> 02:26:04.050
systems, and then launched
the firm that bears his name.

02:26:04.050 --> 02:26:09.080
The rise of Bloomberg
LP, transformed the world

02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:11.740
of financial information.

02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:14.910
And it established
its founder as one

02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:17.860
of the nation's most
savvy executives

02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:21.460
and imaginative entrepreneurs.

02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:24.240
Having built his company
into a global force,

02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:29.210
he set his sights on a
new leadership challenge.

02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:35.560
Three times, he won election as
mayor of the City of New York,

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:44.020
serving from 2002 until December
of 2013 Over that 12 year

02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:49.660
tenure, he dedicated himself to
enhancing the city's schools,

02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:57.940
spurring the creation of new
jobs, improving public health,

02:26:57.940 --> 02:27:03.150
nourishing the arts and culture,
and confronting the challenge

02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:07.560
of climate change, all while
helping the city navigate

02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:12.180
the wrenching aftermath of 9/11.

02:27:12.180 --> 02:27:17.120
As a philanthropist, he has
devoted more than 3.3 billion

02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:20.010
and counting of
his own resources

02:27:20.010 --> 02:27:25.780
to an array of worthy causes,
education foremost among them.

02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:29.510
[APPLAUSE]

02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:33.770
Few figures in our time
have made so strong a mark

02:27:33.770 --> 02:27:37.780
on both business and government.

02:27:37.780 --> 02:27:41.120
On both the vitality
of private enterprise

02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:45.900
and the creative pursuit
of the public good,

02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:50.160
let us honor his honor
Michael Bloomberg.

02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:53.590

From Hopkins to
Harvard, Wall Street

02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:23.780
to City Hall, a resolute leader
and fervent philanthropist,

02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:29.220
whose entrepreneurial spirit
and zeal for innovation

02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:34.339
have helped our
nation's burg to bloom,

02:28:34.339 --> 02:28:38.251

02:28:38.251 --> 02:28:41.674
[APPLAUSE]

02:28:55.855 --> 02:28:59.900
It is seldom on
this stage that we

02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.290
take the occasion to
honor a former member

02:29:02.290 --> 02:29:05.125
of the cheerleading
squad at Yale.

02:29:05.125 --> 02:29:09.860
[LAUGHTER]

02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:12.970
But there is more to this story.

02:29:12.970 --> 02:29:21.440
Born in Milton, Massachusetts
90 years ago next month,

02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:23.890
he served with valor
and distinction

02:29:23.890 --> 02:29:28.729
as a Navy pilot in the
Pacific during World War II.

02:29:28.729 --> 02:29:31.687

02:29:44.110 --> 02:29:46.768
[APPLAUSE]

02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:59.100
Soon after, he enrolled
in a quaint college

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:03.350
in the hinterlands of
South Central Connecticut

02:30:03.350 --> 02:30:07.290
in a city that stakes
its claim to fame

02:30:07.290 --> 02:30:09.613
on being the birthplace
of the lollipop.

02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:21.080
He kept in Yale's baseball team
as a left handed first baseman,

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:24.520
and he led them to the finals
of the College World Series

02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:25.900
two years in a row.

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:35.240
When Babe Ruth presented
an original manuscript

02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:38.280
of his autobiography
to the Yale archives,

02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:41.940
our guest was chosen
to receive it.

02:30:41.940 --> 02:30:47.090
By the 1960s, in Texas, he
launched his remarkable career

02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:49.914
in public service.

02:30:49.914 --> 02:30:56.120
[APPLAUSE]

02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:58.650
Across the decades,

from the House of
Representatives

02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:05.720
to service as US Ambassador

02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:09.350
from chairing the Republican
National Committee to directing

02:31:09.350 --> 02:31:15.110
Central Intelligence, from
eight years as vice president

02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:21.340
to his election in 1988 as the
41st president of the United

02:31:22.149 --> 02:31:25.143
[APPLAUSE]

02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:37.170
With a clear eye

he led the United States
through a transformative time

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:42.810
in world affairs.

02:31:42.810 --> 02:31:46.720
His presidency saw the
liberation of Kuwait,

02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:55.290
the fall of the Berlin Wall, the
crumbling of the Soviet Union,

02:31:55.290 --> 02:31:58.810
the signing of the first
two Strategic Arms Reduction

02:31:58.810 --> 02:32:02.523

end of the Cold War.

02:32:02.523 --> 02:32:05.421
[APPLAUSE]

02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:15.010
He was a force behind the
historic North American Free

02:32:15.010 --> 02:32:16.880
Trade Agreement.

02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:20.400
Working with Congress, he
championed the Americans

02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:24.870

Clean Air Act amendments,

02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:27.490

National Service Act,

02:32:27.490 --> 02:32:30.150

02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:33.030
[APPLAUSE]

02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:40.100
And throughout his long
career in public service,

02:32:40.100 --> 02:32:42.860
extending well beyond
his presidency,

02:32:42.860 --> 02:32:47.160
he has been a champion of
volunteer service for the well

02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:48.820
being of others.

02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:52.530
What he has famously
called Points of Light--

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:55.385
or as they like to say in
New Haven, Points of Looks.

02:32:58.390 --> 02:33:01.310
With a burst of Eli
cheer, we proudly

02:33:01.310 --> 02:33:06.138

With faith, courage, and service
true, his eyes ever fixed

02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:55.800
on points of light,
he piloted our nation

02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:58.270
through changeful skies.

02:33:58.270 --> 02:34:01.940
His cap was blue,
his house was white,

02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:05.128
and now his robe is crimson.

02:34:05.128 --> 02:34:09.610

02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:54.715

declare the meeting adjourned.

02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:57.610
The audience is requested
to remain seated

02:35:57.610 --> 02:36:01.160
until the president and
fellows and their guests

02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:02.810
have withdrawn
from the platform.

02:36:06.802 --> 02:36:10.295
[BAND PLAYING]

02:36:20.275 --> 02:36:23.768
[MUSIC - SAMUEL GILMAN, "FAIR
 HARVARD"]

02:38:10.554 --> 02:38:15.560
[CHEERING]

02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:20.220
As we close this
morning's ceremony,

02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:23.690
I would like to offer
a benediction inspired

02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:27.310
by one of the greatest
intellectuals, poets,

02:38:27.310 --> 02:38:32.350
and preachers of the 20th
century, the Reverend Clarence

02:38:32.350 --> 02:38:36.530
Lavaughn Franklin, whose
daughter we honored here today.

02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:45.160
As an eagle stirreth
her nest, Oh God,

02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:51.230
we ask that you would stir
us to be kind and give thanks

02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:53.850
every day.

02:38:53.850 --> 02:39:00.910
Stir us, oh God, to
treat our bodies well.

02:39:00.910 --> 02:39:04.470
For we are made in the
imago dei, the image of God.

02:39:07.410 --> 02:39:11.570
Be kind, be of service.

02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:18.800
Stir us, oh God, to treat
our neighbors right.

02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:21.650
Stir us.

02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:23.970
Stir us so that we
might discipline

02:39:23.970 --> 02:39:28.710
ourselves to know
ourselves better.

02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:30.910
And in knowing
ourselves better, we

02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:36.470
begin to love
ourselves as we are.

02:39:36.470 --> 02:39:41.320
And when we break through the
cloud of insecurity that often

02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:45.050
confines our
bodies, then we will

02:39:45.050 --> 02:39:51.270
be able to love our
neighbors as ourselves.

02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:53.860
Stir us.

02:39:53.860 --> 02:40:02.550
Stir us, so that we
might, in humble ways,

02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:09.090
bring your kingdom here on
Earth as it is in heaven.

02:40:09.090 --> 02:40:11.456
May we all say together, amen.

02:40:26.396 --> 02:40:29.882
[CHEERING]

02:40:41.834 --> 02:40:50.642
As the high sheriff
of Middlesex County,

02:40:50.642 --> 02:40:57.474
I declare that the
meeting will be adjourned.

02:40:57.474 --> 02:41:02.354
[APPLAUSE]

02:41:02.354 --> 02:41:06.290
[BELL RINGS]

02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:08.910
Now the bell in the
church begins to ring.

02:41:08.910 --> 02:41:17.100
And there is a tintinnabulation
of bells all over Cambridge,

02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:19.550
including the great Lowell
House bells from Russia.

02:41:19.550 --> 02:41:22.269
And there's the Sheriff of
Middlesex County and Drew

02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:25.990
Faust, president of Harvard
leading the procession.

02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.990
Procession of overseers.

02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:30.094
This is a grand
board of overseers,

02:41:30.094 --> 02:41:31.940
and Alan Garber, the provost.

02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:34.180
Everybody's heading
off the stage.

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:36.600
And there will be a
president's spread.

02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:38.950
All of these luncheons
are called spreads.

02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:41.700
And they take place everywhere.

02:41:41.700 --> 02:41:47.540
The president's over near
Lowell House on Quincy Street.

02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:50.450
This has been an amazing
day in Harvard Yard,

02:41:50.450 --> 02:41:56.760
beginning with the influx of
so many students, and faculty,

02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:58.562
and parents, and families.

02:41:58.562 --> 02:41:59.520
And just extraordinary.

02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:01.520
If you just look at
all the happy faces,

02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:04.260
all the amazing achievement
of all of our students,

02:42:04.260 --> 02:42:07.606
and the celebration
of their current

02:42:07.606 --> 02:42:09.518
and also future accomplishments.

02:42:09.518 --> 02:42:11.407
It's just such an exciting time.

02:42:11.407 --> 02:42:11.990
And thank you.

02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:15.385
Here we see Aretha Franklin
being congratulated.

02:42:15.385 --> 02:42:16.660
And the Harvard Band.

02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:20.184
Actually, I think we should
note that the Latin orator is

02:42:20.184 --> 02:42:25.496
a member of the Harvard Band
when he put on that Roman hat

02:42:25.496 --> 02:42:28.484
for his oration.

02:42:28.484 --> 02:42:31.120
The faculty are filing
up to congratulate

02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:33.670
the honorary degree recipients.

02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:36.367
This afternoon,
this will fill again

02:42:36.367 --> 02:42:39.890
with the Harvard Alumnae
Association Annual

02:42:39.890 --> 02:42:42.610
Meeting, which will
be called to order.

02:42:42.610 --> 02:42:44.830
The new Alumnae
Association president

02:42:44.830 --> 02:42:49.500
is Cynthia Torres, who was
elected rather recently.

02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:59.320
And 1980 graduate of the college
who welcomed the newest class

02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:00.430
yesterday afternoon.

02:43:00.430 --> 02:43:03.322
So Diana, it's been a really
wonderful commencement,

02:43:03.322 --> 02:43:06.600
and I'm glad I got to
spend it with you here.

02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:08.770
We're just the talking
heads here of course.

02:43:08.770 --> 02:43:11.058
There's an entire crew of
people-- Kathy O'Connell

02:43:11.058 --> 02:43:13.540
and lots of other
people who are helping

02:43:13.540 --> 02:43:17.240
make this commencement happen
and make this broadcast happen.

02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:19.342
It's always a
pleasure to witness

02:43:19.342 --> 02:43:21.030
this spectacle with you.

02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:23.836
And it's such a great
pleasure to see the joy

02:43:23.836 --> 02:43:27.263
on the faces of the
graduates, and at the delight

02:43:27.263 --> 02:43:29.570
of the faculty of
being here as well

02:43:29.570 --> 02:43:34.180
to be reminded by our
student speakers of both

02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:38.980
the historic presence of
George Washington in this yard,

02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:44.670
and the inspiration that
the call to a global world

02:43:44.670 --> 02:43:46.600
really has for our students.

02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:49.204
We heard that again
and again this year.

02:43:49.204 --> 02:43:52.750
And I suspect it's
really part of why

02:43:52.750 --> 02:43:54.110
we're all here at Harvard.

02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:55.370
And the call to service.

02:43:55.370 --> 02:43:56.450
So thank you everyone.

02:43:56.450 --> 02:43:59.990
And we look forward to
seeing you again next year.

02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:02.730
Happy day of commencement.
