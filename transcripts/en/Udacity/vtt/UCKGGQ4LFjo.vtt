00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.650
In the context of data science,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.830
when creating visualizations, you should almost always focus on

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.000
communicating in the most effective manner to solve the problems at hand.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.800
Although data artists, or even a data journalist,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.650
may be interested in creating a complex graphic to creatively convey

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.310
information, data scientists' first priority is solving problems.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.170
Whether that be through models, algorithms, analyses, or visualizations.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.730
When faced with a dataset that you want to visualize, you should inspect your

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.320
data, the columns, the variables, inspect what types they are, and always

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.960
choose the right tool, in this case chart, that best represents your data.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.495
We will see in just a second all the options and how to determine which chart

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:48.990
might be best for representing our given data and conveying a certain message.
