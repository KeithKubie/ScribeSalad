00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I thought that was pretty effective
um<00:17:17.680><c> but</c><00:17:18.220><c> yeah</c><00:17:18.820><c> just</c><00:17:19.180><c> so</c><00:17:19.600><c> much</c><00:17:19.780><c> stuff</c><00:17:20.620><c> and</c><00:17:20.830><c> then</c>

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:20.950 align:start position:0%
um but yeah just so much stuff and then
 

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.570 align:start position:0%
um but yeah just so much stuff and then
just<00:17:21.160><c> more</c><00:17:21.370><c> setup</c><00:17:21.820><c> for</c><00:17:22.090><c> another</c><00:17:22.360><c> film</c><00:17:22.870><c> and</c><00:17:23.200><c> I</c>

just more setup for another film and I
 

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.770 align:start position:0%
just more setup for another film and I
