JAKE VANDERPLAS: Hi, and
welcome to this video series

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.239
on Google Colab.

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:12.280
I'm Jake VanderPlas, and
I'll be your guide today

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.980
as we look at what
Colab is all about.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.050
Google Colab is an
executable document

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.010
that lets you write, run, and
share code within Google Drive.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.380
If you're familiar with the
popular Jupyter project,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.520
you can think of Colab
as a Jupyter notebook

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.830
stored in Google Drive.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.790
A notebook document is composed
of cells, each of which

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.520
can contain code,
text, images, and more.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.480
Colab connects your notebook
to a cloud-based runtime,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.750
meaning you can execute Python
code without any required

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.850
setup on your own machine.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.500
Additional code
cells are executed

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.570
using that same
runtime, resulting

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.480
in a rich, interactive coding
experience in which you

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.910
can use any of the functionality
that Python offers.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.240
For example, here we define
a variable containing

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.580
a range of 10 numbers.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.620
In the next cell, we
loop through this range,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.900
printing the square
of each number.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.239
For convenience, we use
the Shift-Enter shortcut

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.180
rather than the Play
button to execute the cell.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.060
Cell outputs are not limited
to simple text, however.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.760
They can contain any number
of dynamic, rich outputs.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.480
For example, we can search
Colab's built-in library

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.840
of code snippets and insert code
to create an interactive data

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.340
visualization.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.230
This particular
visualization is created

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.170
with Altair, one of several
third-party visualization

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.570
libraries that Colab supports.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.940
Colab notebooks can be
shared like a Google Doc,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.680
and for this purpose
it's useful to use

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.470
text cells to provide a
narrative around the code

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.910
you've executed.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.540
Text cells are formatted using
Markdown, a plain text document

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.000
format that's
rendered on the page.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.050
Markdown format is
simple and powerful,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.390
allowing you to add
headings, paragraphs, lists,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.550
and even mathematical formulae.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.800
If you would like to share
your notebooks with others,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.710
you can do so via
Google Drive sharing

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.220
or even by exporting
your notebook to GitHub.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.590
The notebook is stored in
the standard Jupyter Notebook

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.600
format, and so the
notebooks you create

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.960
can be viewed and executed in
Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.030
and other compatible frameworks.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.560
The convenience of
sharing notebooks

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.120
means that you can
find and explore

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.730
many interesting
notebooks around the web.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.340
One useful collection
is the Seedbank project

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.010
at research.google.com/seedbank.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.670
For example, the Neural
Style Transfer seed

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.370
shows how to use deep
learning to transfer styles

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.590
between images and
includes a link

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.030
to a Colab notebook where you
can run and modify the code.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.020
To learn more about Colab,
visit colab.research.google.com

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.090
and find the Welcome
notebook, where

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.940
you will find links to
tutorials and other info

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.580
about Jupyter and
Colab notebooks.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.380
You can also find
the remaining videos

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.850
in this series, which will
explore Colab in more depth.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.810
In the next video,
my colleague Lawrence

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.050
will explore how to install
TensorFlow using Colab

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.490
and how to use
different runtimes

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.710
to access things like the GPU.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.420
See you there.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.110
Hi, I'm Jake.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.700
I'm a software engineer on
the Google Colab project,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.330
and we've got lots of great
videos for you about Colab.
