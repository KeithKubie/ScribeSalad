00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.730
Are obese brains “addicted” to sugar?

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.710
Hello everyone!

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.790
I’m Crystal here with DNews.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.600
Now I don’t know about you, but I had really
strict parents and they rarely let me eat

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.780
sugar as a kid.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.920
And now that I’m an adult, candy basically
makes up one of my major food groups.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.890
According to a new study out of the University
of California San Diego, the brains of some

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.790
children respond differently to sugar than
others and are more likely to appear “addicted”

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.790
to sugar.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.320
The discovery that addicted brains are structurally
and functionally different from non-addicted

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.660
brains is not new, but this study reveals
that those neurological changes can happen

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.550
very young, while the brain is still developing.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.610
Those of you who watch a lot of these videos
probably already know that the brain matures

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.059
back to front, with the frontal cortex (which
is responsible for our rational decision making

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.010
abilities) maturing last, in our early twenties.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.059
At adolescence the regions of our brains that
are responsible for emotion and “reward”

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.309
(that happy feeling we get when we encounter
something we like) are fully on-line before

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.899
we have the ability to regulate and control
our reactions to them and this fact has been

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.390
used to explain why adolescents, who physically
appear very adult, make decisions that are

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.390
so.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.390
very.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.390
dumb.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.390
(sorry mom)

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.810
Approaching obesity as a symptom of food addiction,
Scientists at UCSD examined the brains of

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.840
obese and non-obese pre adolescent children
using fMRI to identify any functional differences

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.260
in their response to sugar.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.880
The children’s ages ranged from 8 to 12
and they were asked to close their eyes and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.820
focus on the taste of a sugar-water solution
while they swirled it around in their mouth.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.000
The resulting images showed that obese children
had more activity in the insular cortex and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.220
amygdala, brain regions associated with emotion,
perception, contextual awareness and taste.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.710
But what was most surprising, is that the
obese children did not show any increased

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.810
response to sugar in the striatum.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.860
The striatum is involved in our perception
of salience, which is how much an item or

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.930
experience stands out when compared to others
and it is also known to play an important

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.409
role in our experience of reward so scientists
were surprised to see no increase in activity

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.600
in children they tested.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.439
This result was also surprising because increased
activity in the striatum has been associated

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.159
with obesity in adults.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:17.219
The DA reward pathway involving the striatum,
substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens and the

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:22.739
ventral tegmental area is the accepted neuroscientific
roadmap for how we experience pleasure and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.109
develop addictions (ask me about my thesis
sometime) but we are starting to learn more

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.790
about the role of the amygdala in emotional
regulation in the development of addiction

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.790
states.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.279
A recent rodent study showed that clinical
activation of the amygdala in a lever press

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.879
experiment made a sugar solution MORE “ADDICTIVE”
(or at least more rewarding).

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.019
So it may be that rats and children whose
amygdala activation in response to sugar are

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.430
more likely to seek out sweets due to the
emotional memory of the experience.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.680
Obviously there are many causes for obesity
and food addiction is just one of them.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.700
Are scientists going down the right path?
