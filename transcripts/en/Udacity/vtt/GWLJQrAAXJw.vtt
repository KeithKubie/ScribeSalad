00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'd like to challenge you to find an algebraic relationship between b and r.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Can you tell me what is b / r?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Is it 1 / Σ(y - y-bar)²?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Is it Σ(x - x-bar)² / Σ(y - y-bar)²?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Is it the square root of Σ(x - x-bar)² / Σ(y - y-bar)²

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or perhaps is it--choose the right answer.
