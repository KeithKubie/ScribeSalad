[Music]

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070
 
 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.340
 
that's interesting interesting that you

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350
that's interesting interesting that you
 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.870
that's interesting interesting that you
asked that question because we're really

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880
asked that question because we're really
 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.870
asked that question because we're really
dealing with that right now because we

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880
dealing with that right now because we
 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.620
dealing with that right now because we
have a we want to see since we know that

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630
have a we want to see since we know that
 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.620
have a we want to see since we know that
if you think about you Jen think about

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630
if you think about you Jen think about
 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.510
if you think about you Jen think about
the clitoris so think about the the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520
the clitoris so think about the the
 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.359
the clitoris so think about the the
g-spot or think about the cervix that

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
g-spot or think about the cervix that
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.600
g-spot or think about the cervix that
those that the the corresponding part of

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610
those that the the corresponding part of
 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.760
those that the the corresponding part of
the body of the brain map for that those

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770
the body of the brain map for that those
 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.100
the body of the brain map for that those
parts of the body those become activated

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110
parts of the body those become activated
 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.740
parts of the body those become activated
so one question is whether women who can

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750
so one question is whether women who can
 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.200
so one question is whether women who can
think themselves to orgasm do they think

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210
think themselves to orgasm do they think
 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.270
think themselves to orgasm do they think
their genital activation the the brain

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
their genital activation the the brain
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.770
their genital activation the the brain
representation of the genitalia into act

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780
representation of the genitalia into act
 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.530
representation of the genitalia into act
into activity and does that spread to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540
into activity and does that spread to
 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.689
into activity and does that spread to
the other systems that are involved in

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699
the other systems that are involved in
 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.119
the other systems that are involved in
orgasm how do they do it we want to

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129
orgasm how do they do it we want to
 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.219
orgasm how do they do it we want to
understand how they do it normally and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229
understand how they do it normally and
 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.180
understand how they do it normally and
then the question is what if we ask

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190
then the question is what if we ask
 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.440
then the question is what if we ask
women to think about the genital the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450
women to think about the genital the
 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.070
women to think about the genital the
genitals more intensively or will we

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080
genitals more intensively or will we
 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.380
genitals more intensively or will we
will we will they be able to intensify

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390
will we will they be able to intensify
 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.380
will we will they be able to intensify
the response in their genital sensory

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390
the response in their genital sensory
 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.180
the response in their genital sensory
cortex and will that spread to other

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190
cortex and will that spread to other
 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.550
cortex and will that spread to other
parts of the brain will that facilitate

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560
parts of the brain will that facilitate
 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.800
parts of the brain will that facilitate
their orgasm I mean I think it could be

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810
their orgasm I mean I think it could be
 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.800
their orgasm I mean I think it could be
very useful in in women who say that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810
very useful in in women who say that
 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.290
very useful in in women who say that
they don't experience orgasms it could

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300
they don't experience orgasms it could
 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.320
they don't experience orgasms it could
be useful in women with spinal cord

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330
be useful in women with spinal cord
 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.530
be useful in women with spinal cord
injury who can't feel their their

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540
injury who can't feel their their
 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.150
injury who can't feel their their
external genitals can they can they

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160
external genitals can they can they
 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.460
external genitals can they can they
think their brain into greater

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470
think their brain into greater
 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.520
think their brain into greater
activation and will that facilitate

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530
activation and will that facilitate
 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.730
activation and will that facilitate
their orgasm that's a it's a it's a

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740
their orgasm that's a it's a it's a
 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.460
their orgasm that's a it's a it's a
question that we are currently dealing

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470
question that we are currently dealing
 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.850
question that we are currently dealing
with with our brain research and it's a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860
with with our brain research and it's a
 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.590
with with our brain research and it's a
it's a very important and interesting

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600
it's a very important and interesting
 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.630
it's a very important and interesting
question and it could be therapy

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640
question and it could be therapy
 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.970
question and it could be therapy
therapeutically useful one of the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980
therapeutically useful one of the
 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.890
therapeutically useful one of the
techniques that we that we've developed

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900
techniques that we that we've developed
 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.870
techniques that we that we've developed
is to have the women in the scanner

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
is to have the women in the scanner
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.460
is to have the women in the scanner
looking at their own brain activity in

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470
looking at their own brain activity in
 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.420
looking at their own brain activity in
near-real-time and the question is if we

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430
near-real-time and the question is if we
 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.190
near-real-time and the question is if we
can see our own brain activity in

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200
can see our own brain activity in
 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.740
can see our own brain activity in
near-real-time in specific regions can

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750
near-real-time in specific regions can
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.699
near-real-time in specific regions can
we voluntarily increase the activity of

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709
we voluntarily increase the activity of
 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.530
we voluntarily increase the activity of
that part of the brain just by thinking

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
that part of the brain just by thinking
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.980
that part of the brain just by thinking
about

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990
about
 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.880
about
it just as as we can think about moving

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890
it just as as we can think about moving
 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.980
it just as as we can think about moving
our finger and we can we can move our

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990
our finger and we can we can move our
 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.230
our finger and we can we can move our
finger we can wiggle our finger we don't

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240
finger we can wiggle our finger we don't
 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.590
finger we can wiggle our finger we don't
know what we do we we learn to do it as

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600
know what we do we we learn to do it as
 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.180
know what we do we we learn to do it as
an infant because we got the feedback

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190
an infant because we got the feedback
 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.340
an infant because we got the feedback
between what we see and what we what we

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350
between what we see and what we what we
 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.710
between what we see and what we what we
do maybe we can do the same thing with

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720
do maybe we can do the same thing with
 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.390
do maybe we can do the same thing with
the brain if we see our own brain

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400
the brain if we see our own brain
 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.290
the brain if we see our own brain
activity maybe we can make a change and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300
activity maybe we can make a change and
 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.870
activity maybe we can make a change and
maybe that's going to change the way we

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880
maybe that's going to change the way we
 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.000
maybe that's going to change the way we
feel or the way we move so this is a new

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
feel or the way we move so this is a new
 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.970
feel or the way we move so this is a new
technology of near real-time brain

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
technology of near real-time brain
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.740
technology of near real-time brain
imaging and with unlimited frontiers we

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
imaging and with unlimited frontiers we
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.890
imaging and with unlimited frontiers we
don't really know how how far we can go

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900
don't really know how how far we can go
 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.930
don't really know how how far we can go
with it but it's a it's a new it's a new

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940
with it but it's a it's a new it's a new
 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.030
with it but it's a it's a new it's a new
approach
