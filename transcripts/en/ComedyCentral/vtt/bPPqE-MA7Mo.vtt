00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.405
Unh!

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.574
(man)
Bridget Everett is just three
points away from winning

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:09.643
her fourth Grand Slam.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.478
(man)
Remarkably, she has not allowed
Schumerenka a single game in

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.580
this match and yet,
I can't take my eyes off

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.482
of Schumerenka's unique
style on the court.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.150
Ah!
(man)
I agree, Patrick.

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.086
Schumerenka has
a charisma on the court

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.556
that just pulls
you in.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.959
Unh!
<i>(man)
Out.</i>

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.928
I think one reason why
Schumerenka's having such

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.496
a difficult time in this
match is the distraction

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.532
factor of
Everett's grunting.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.467
(Patrick)
Oh, God, it's disgusting,
they should really ban it.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.802
Whoo!

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.471
Ah!

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:38.839
Unh.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.574
<i>(man)
Out.</i>

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.142
(man)
Heaving and sweating
like a Clydesdale,

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.677
Everett makes the shot.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.512
Let's take a look at
the instant replay.

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:48.015
Unh.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.987
(Patrick)
So amazing.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.857
I think the most incredible part
of Schumerenka's game is how she

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.060
manages to be so thin and yet,
still have such large breasts.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.662
(man)
Absolutely, it's just
such a turn-on

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.764
to see tennis played with
this level of integrity.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.968
Amy's friends and family
obviously agree.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.104
Schumerenka's sponsor
is Herpsky premium vodka.

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:20.380
(Patrick)
As usual, Everett's friend
and old math teacher

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.449
is there to
cheer her on.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.853
Got her a nice seat in her VIP
box, sponsored by ground beef.

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:27.855
(man)
Is what she's doing
technically cheering her on?

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.990
It looks like she's just
eating snacks from home.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.393
Schumerenka seems to be trying
to take a moment to refocus.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.662
(Patrick)
This is one of those key moments
where she definitely needs to

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.931
take her time
and not rush.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.567
Yeah, don't rush that.
(man)
Whoo.

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.903
(Patrick)
Bridget doesn't seem to like the
delay in the game and as usual,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.906
she has to try to control her
infamous attitude problem.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.775
It's unattractive and also
she's (bleep) blocking.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.411
Unh!

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.646
Unh!

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.381
Uh!

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.416
(man)
No good, it's over.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.118
Yes! Yes!

00:01:58.185 --> 00:01:59.953
Well, Everett wins the
East Coast International

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.588
for the fourth time
in straight sets.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:02.923
Hope she's happy.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.391
Let's go courtside for
the awards ceremony.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.126
Bridget, you won.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.897
Here's your cup and
a million dollars.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.633
Thanks, Katrina.

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.502
Really fought hard
out there--
Amy, you lost.

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.772
But you were so gorgeous
throughout the entire match

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.174
that it's almost
like you won.

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:22.442
Does that make sense?
What's your secret?

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:24.611
Um.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.079
I love this country.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.081
Freedom.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.450
Amy, I'm being told
the crowd has chipped in.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:35.756
You will now be walking
away with $2 million!

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.092
(Amy)
America!

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.528
I love you...
thank you!

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.631
Oh, thank you,
my country!

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:49.903
Oh thank you America!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.405
Ah!

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.106
I won, I won.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.577
Amy! Amy! Amy!

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:58.879
America! America!

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.614
These are for you,
take them.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.482
I don't need
them anymore.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:03.917
I love you, America.

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.485
Take them.

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.588
(Patrick)
Amy Schumerenka,
a true champion.

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:08.922
(man)
Great for tennis.
