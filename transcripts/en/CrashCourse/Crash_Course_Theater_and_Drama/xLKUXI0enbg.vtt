00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.770
Hi there I’m Mike Rugnetta.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.590
Welcome to Crash Course Theater.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.799
Today we’ll be covering Greek satyr plays
and classical Greek comedy.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.170
We’ll also take a look at Aristophanes’
“Lysistrata,” a play in which the women

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.940
of Athens and Sparta decide to ban sexual
intercourse until their husbands stop fighting

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.940
a war.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.420
It might get a little lewd, but this play
is actually a lot less lewd than most Greek

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.539
comedies that came before it.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.410
The next time you’re at a museum, staring
up at some noble piece of ancient marble statuary,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.310
just remember: those folks LOVED a good fart
joke.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.989
INTRO
Satyr plays are the raunchy plays that appear

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.040
at the conclusion of each tragic trilogy.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.530
They’re meant to cheer an audience up after
all of that pity, fear and purgation.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.750
And what did audiences find most cheerful?

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.530
You guessed it: phalli.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.750
Like tragedies, satyr plays were usually derived
from mythological stories.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.570
Unlike tragedies, satyr plays featured a chorus
dressed as satyrs—ears, tails, shaggy legs

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.479
and … tie-on phalluses.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.870
Satyr plays presented goofy versions of important
legends: here’s your typical myth, going

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.460
along as planned, and then who shows up: Satyrs!

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.770
These plays normally focus on how fun-loving,
drunk, and cowardly the satyrs are... but

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.439
there are often a few human characters who
engage in serious moral debate at some point.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.470
Only one complete satyr play survives and
that’s Euripides “Cyclops,” based on

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.370
an episode in the “Odyssey.”

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.570
It’s almost a retelling of Odyssey’s version,
except there are a lot of satyrs on the Cyclops’s

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.540
island and they’re the ones who get Odysseus
into trouble with Mean Ole Mr Unipupil.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.680
While trying to avoid being eaten, Odysseus
takes a moment to engage the Cyclops in an

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.180
earnest debate on whether duty or pleasure-seeking
is the key to a happy life.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.750
After that the Cyclops and the head satyr
Silenus get very drunk and Silenus gets dragged

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.500
off to maybe do Cyclops sex stuff, but then
Odysseus blinds the Cyclops and it ends happily

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.500
for all.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.629
Except the Cyclops who is blinded and was
probably like UGH THAT WAS MY ONE.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.629
GOOD.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.629
EYE.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.030
You may remember from a couple episodes ago,
the Drama Contests of Dionsyia.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.319
In 486 BCE, a separate contest for comedy
was established, with five competitors each

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.319
year.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.930
In classical Greece, comedy was pretty raucous
and pretty ribald.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.730
The word “comedy” came to us from the
Greek word komoidia, which literally means

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.730
party song.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.730
After forty years or so, comedy got popular
enough that it had its own festival, the Lenaea,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.470
held in winter for Athenians only.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.430
No foreign dignitaries, which makes sense
because these comedies were probably not how

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.630
Athens wanted to represent itself to the world.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.300
Like tragedies, comedies were inspired by
the philosophies and problems of present-day

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.300
Athens.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.910
But while tragedies tended to cloak their
relevance in the mythic past or foreign lands,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.390
comedies were typically set in contemporary
Athens, poking merciless fun at contemporaneous

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.390
life.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.280
They kept themselves safe by being so wild
and crazy you couldn’t take their political

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.960
attacks seriously, though there are records
of a couple lawsuits.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.310
SPOILSPORTS.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.080
Comedies differed from tragedies in that they
often depended on spectacular effects and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.200
featured funny costumes like padded stomachs
and butts, and yes, of course, say it with

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.780
me now–though I would totally understand
if it makes you uncomfortable and you super

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.870
don’t want to– phalluses.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.569
Most of the formal elements—dialogic scenes
interspersed with choral odes—were similar

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.360
to tragedy, but comedy included something
new.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.430
It was the parabasis, a speech in which the
chorus addresses the audience directly.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.670
And while tragedies focus on some noble figure
falling, comedies are often about the little

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.810
guy struggling to rise.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.290
Though as we’ll see with “The Lysistrata,”
comedies can deal with great figures and serious

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.640
subjects, as well.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.560
Unfortunately, few examples survive from the
golden age of classical comedy and all the

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.010
ones that do are by Aristophanes.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.691
But we have fragments by many others, including
sections from the plays of Eupolis, a comedy

00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:16.940
writer so beloved that legend has it that
when he died fighting a war, the government

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.390
passed a law exempting all poets from military
service.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.840
Let’s take a moment to look at what separates
comedies from satyr plays.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.540
Satyr plays are situated in a mythic past,
comedies in the present.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.410
Satyr plays are typically rural.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.750
Comedies are usually urban.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.430
Satyr plays are about messing things up.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.139
Comedies are about putting things back together.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.460
They tend to return social order and conclude
with a compromise of some kind: a peace treaty,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.030
a constitution, a marriage.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.340
There’s not necessarily any reconciliation
at the end of a satyr play, while comedies

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.160
are about offering absurd suggestions to real
problems.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.800
Aristophanes is the most famous figure of
classical comedy for the very good reason

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.210
that his plays are the ones that … uhhh…
still exist.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.660
Invading hordes: You.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.660
Are.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.660
The Worst.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.220
He wrote at least forty plays.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.550
We have eleven.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.340
Aristophanes was born into a wealthy Athenian
family sometime in the 450s.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.940
He started writing early and he was almost
immediately known for his splendid poetry,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.490
and for relentlessly mocking specific political figures.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.479
In fact he was sued at least once for “unpatriotic
behavior”.

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.460
But, undeterred, Aristophanes kept the poetry
and dirty jokes and mockery coming for quite

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.830
some time.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.229
Late in the fifth century BCE, though, Athens
started losing the Peloponnesian War to Sparta

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.190
and a lot of things changed, including comedy.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.949
Suddenly it wasn’t a great idea to satirize
political figures.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.699
And Athens didn’t have as much money to
spend on spectacular effects and fancy choruses.

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.750
So Aristophanes made a mid-career switch.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.500
He started writing plays for smaller choruses
and with composite comic figures rather than

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.750
specific, real-life politicians.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.610
Aristophanes has a lot of famous plays—The
Birds, The Clouds, The Frogs.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.100
But, today we’re going to look at “The
Lysistrata,” which we chose for a couple

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.100
of reasons.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.949
For one, it’s still relevant today.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.660
In the early days of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, thousands of theater companies

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.819
staged readings and productions of the play.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:28.580
The Lysistrata’s frustration at the senselessness
of wars and the tolls they exact won’t seem

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.990
very ancient to us.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.819
Also it’s one of the rare ancient comedies
in which the women get to be really funny.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.020
So that’s nice.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.419
(But remember, all the actors in ancient Greek
theater were men!

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.050
And all the playwrights, too.)

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.289
Let’s go to the Thoughtbubble.

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.949
The Lysistrata won first prize in 411 BCE,
at which point the Peloponnesian War had waged

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.480
for about twenty years.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.979
Athens and Sparta together defeated an enemy
once thought unstoppable: the Persians.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.610
But after their victory, they squabbled over
colonies.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.380
Sparta had the superior land army, Athens
had the superior navy.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.040
Athens was a democracy, Sparta was an oligarchy.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.710
Athens had a lot of money, Sparta had a lot
of staying power.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.520
Things got ugly and stayed ugly.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.170
Also Athens had a plague that killed a lot
of its citizens and its great leader Pericles.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.170
That didn’t help.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.539
This … is the background story for The Lysistrata,
at the start of which, the women of Athens

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:29.810
are fed up.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.789
They’re tired of war, they’re tired of
being poor and they’re really, really tired

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:37.440
of their husbands leaving to fight.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.690
Because when their husbands are away, they
can’t have sex.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.690
And in The Lysistrata, these women really
want to have sex.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.480
So led by a woman named Lysistrata, they devise
a so-far-fetched-it-just-might-work plan.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.569
They seize control of the Acropolis, which
is where Athens keeps all its money, and they

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:56.660
say they’re not going to give up the siege
and they will not have any sex until the men

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.669
stop fighting.

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:02.351
To show that they’re really serious, they
get a bunch of women from warring areas, like

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:05.370
Sparta and Corinth, to join them.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.569
The women swear an oath and achieve a truce,
showing the men that it can be done.

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:12.569
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:15.639
I’d love to quote the chaste ladies oath
for you.

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:20.699
But it’s a family show and this oath is
filthy, which is sort of the point.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:25.510
To begin, the women prepare a sacrificial
victim, but instead of killing an animal,

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:30.330
the sacrifice they make is to open a jug of
wine, which they’re obviously going to chug.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.229
And then they swear to not let any man near
them, but the joke is that the oath they take

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:37.450
is really, really specific.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:43.300
It’s not just that they’re swearing off
sex, they’re swearing in great detail about

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.800
exactly the kind of sex they’re not going
to have—like…EXACTLY.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.350
EXACTINGLY EXACT
This is one of the things Greek comedy does.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.690
It makes fun of beliefs and rituals that are
often held sacred, but doesn’t satirize.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.740
The point isn’t to show that oaths are ridiculous
or that the goals of the women are absurd.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.720
The point is to make fun of social conventions
with the end goal of creating a better and

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.339
happier society.

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:11.400
So cheers to that.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.399
In a patriarchal society like ancient Greece,
by the way, the idea of women seizing power

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:22.280
was also pretty funny in itself--for the men--because
it was so impossible.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.880
The women might have had different ideas.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.180
Most of the jokes are about how difficult
it is to go without sex.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.980
Women keep pretending to be hurt or pregnant
in order to sneak out of the Acropolis.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.570
Men come to try to entice their wives back
into bed.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.380
And in one of the funniest scenes, a wife
agrees, but then she keeps making more demands

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.700
of her husband—she needs a mattress, she
needs a pillow—and then runs back into the

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.269
Acropolis at the last minute, leaving her
husband with an epic case of… frustration.

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:50.269
Good times.

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:55.300
At the end, Lysistrata comes out of the Acropolis
and meets with Athenian and Spartan delegates.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.640
She reminds them of what they owe to each
other and how ridiculous this conflict is.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.580
Yet they agree to peace not because Lysistrata
is so wise, but because the goddess of Reconciliation

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.950
is there, personified as a naked woman, and
they all want to have sex with her.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.370
Which is creepy.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.550
And misogynist.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.550
And violent.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.950
Then, there’s a banquet and all the newly
reconciled men and women sing and dance together.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:22.170
From this you can get a sense of how delightful
and radical Greek comedy is, while also being

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.380
kinda troubling.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.600
Suggesting the absurdity of a vicious and
expensive war is a pretty racy thing for an

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.010
Athenian play to do when Athens is still in
the middle of that war.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.070
But this isn’t a bleak satire.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:39.810
It has a happy ending, with its enthusiastic
embrace of food, wine, singing and dancing,

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:46.089
and it tries to show that peace is possible
and preferable… if maybe kind of ruined

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:47.089
by creepin’ dudes.

00:10:47.089 --> 00:10:48.089
Typical.

00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:49.089
Thanks for watching.

00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:52.510
Next time we’ll look at the transition from
Greek theater to Roman theater and the rise

00:10:52.510 --> 00:11:27.190
of popular entertainments that’ll make The
Lysistrata seem tame.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:32.649
Until then… curtain!
