CRAIG FENTON: OK,
so our guest today

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.340
is the lead singer and
songwriter of an absolutely

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.270
iconic British rock band.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.450
He's a brilliant lyricist.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.050
And I encourage you to
listen to the songs.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.690
Like, really listen
to the songs.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.850
I think he's a
great storyteller,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.100
and each song has
a message in it.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.220
He's also a Welshman,
another one.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.375
GETHIN JONES: Yes, he is.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:36.750
CRAIG FENTON:
--and a family man.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.020
In fact, his family
is here today with us.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.680
And Stereophonics started
about 20 years ago in a garage.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.240
Sound familiar?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.460
Like Google?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.640
And I think what
makes them stand out

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.270
is they're really
true to their roots.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
They're real musicians that
have stood the test of time.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.930
So just a few facts here.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.230
Leapfrogged onto the
stage with the Brit Awards

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.460
for the Best New Group in 1998.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.652
1998 ring a bell?

00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:12.420
Huh?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.700
Nine further awards since, six
platinum and multi-platinum

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.200
records.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.940
Platinum record is
a record that sells

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.065
more than a million copies.

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:22.600
I think that's right, isn't it?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.570
Quadruple platinum-selling
best of collection

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.420
called "Decade in the
Sun" sold 4 million plus.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.230
11 top 10 singles, including
anthems like "Dakota,"

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.450
"Maybe Tomorrow."

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.930
One of four iconic British bands
to open the London Olympics

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.832
in Hyde Park in 2012.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:40.540
Was anyone there?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.310
I was.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.920
It was an amazing concert.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.520
A touring group, globally
selling out stadiums

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.542
still around the world.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.750
I should probably say stadia.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.000
And actually, Kelly's just
about to do a solo tour starting

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.080
in June.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.160
I've just got my tickets.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.622
They're playing at
the Hammersmith--

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.330
used to be called the
Hammersmith Apollo.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.460
I think it's the
Eventim Apollo now.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.710
So go online and
get your tickets.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.449
Just do it after the talk.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.930
Sold over 10 million albums
worldwide, 8 million in the UK

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.810
alone, making them one of
the most successful Welsh

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.590
and British rock
bands of all time.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.450
And big on YouTube.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.790
220,000 YouTube subscribers
and over 150 million

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.320
views on YouTube.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.420
So Google and YouTube are very
proud to welcome Mr. Kelly

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.310
Jones.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:42.550
KELLY JONES: Hello.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.930
Hello.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.078
GETHIN JONES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:47.870
KELLY JONES: Hello.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.220
GETHIN JONES: Thank
you very much, Craig,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.637
for those wonderful
introductions.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.070
Kelly's was far
better than mine.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.470
We'll talk about that later.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.990
To be honest, the only
reason we said we'd do this

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.088
is because we've got a Google
tour just before coming here.

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:01.130
It's brilliant, isn't it?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.790
KELLY JONES: Goodie bag.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.332
GETHIN JONES: It's much better
than Hits Radio in Manchester.

00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:05.250
I said that out loud.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.450
Yeah, we've got a
goodie bag as well.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.180
We don't know what's in it.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.290
I think mine's a notebook.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.290
I think you might have--

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.804
KELLY JONES: Well, he's trying
to convert me from Apple.

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:13.880
GETHIN JONES: [LAUGHS]
It's basically a bribe.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.005
KELLY JONES: It is a bribe.

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:18.097
Yeah, I think [INAUDIBLE] the
other side, which we might do.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.180
GETHIN JONES: I think the
first thing we should do

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.220
is just point out
that despite the fact

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.123
that we do have the same
surname, we're not brothers--

00:03:25.123 --> 00:03:25.790
KELLY JONES: No.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.040
GETHIN JONES: --I don't think.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.900
KELLY JONES: Well, there's a
lot of us look the same where

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.250
we come from.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.540
So you never know.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.643
GETHIN JONES: Could be a cousin.

00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:35.810
KELLY JONES: You never know.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.280
GETHIN JONES:
Second cousin maybe?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.880
KELLY JONES: I'll
be your cousin.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.380
I'll be your brother.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.017
You look more like me than
my brothers look like me.

00:03:42.017 --> 00:03:43.350
I think I was the mistake there.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.823
So there's a 10-year gap between
my brothers, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:49.240
GETHIN JONES: We talked about
that as well, your parents--

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.332
KELLY JONES: They actually
say we were all mistakes.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.540
GETHIN JONES: Actually weird.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.130
Jones is a weird thing in Wales.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.193
This is a true story.

00:03:56.193 --> 00:03:57.860
I actually hold a
world record for being

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.830
part of the largest gathering
of people with the same surname

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.000
under the same roof.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.660
1,583 Joneses all got together
in the Millennium Center

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.650
in Wales in 2001.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.560
And we beat the
Norbergs from Sweden,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.660
who could only manage 596.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.823
The show [INAUDIBLE] was
called "Jones, Jones, Jones."

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.240
They put a lot of
thought into it.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.010
KELLY JONES: I didn't
get the invite.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.360
GETHIN JONES: Yeah, why
did you not get invited?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.930
KELLY JONES: I don't know.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.920
Was Tom Jones there?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.310
GETHIN JONES: No,
because he's not a Jones.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.393
KELLY JONES: No, but I am.

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:25.643
GETHIN JONES: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:26.310
This is awkward.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.430
Let's move on quickly, shall we?

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.990
Craig mentioned
there, actually, the--

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.530
actually, weirdly, with the
Stereophonics and the Google,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.390
it's, like, 25-ish years
when it all started.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.310
And it's quite a few
similarities between the two.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.200
And as Craig
mentioned just before,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.420
I suppose the biggest one
is that you both started

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.500
in a garage about 1992.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.950
KELLY JONES: Yeah, to the
dismay of my neighbors.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.450
Yeah.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.920
Well, Stuart, the drummer,
lived in number 62.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.010
And I lived in 54.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.100
I was practicing "Highway
to Hell" by AC/DC in 54,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.002
and he was practicing
in number 62.

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.210
So everybody in between was
getting a bit pissed off,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.020
really.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.680
So we just decided to maybe
come together in the same thing,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.750
and we went up in
my old man's garage.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.708
And then my brother Lee
came over from the pub,

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.492
and he was pretty annoyed as
well after about two hours.

00:05:16.492 --> 00:05:18.200
And then we went to
the local youth club,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.668
so when youth clubs existed.

00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:20.460
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.690
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.385
So were you, like, 17?

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:26.510
KELLY JONES: When I first
started running-- by then

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.790
I was 12, actually.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.100
It was 1987.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.032
GETHIN JONES: Oh, wow.

00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:32.990
KELLY JONES: And then it
went on and on and on.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.600
But when we became
the lineup that we

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.850
were on the first record,
that was about 1994.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.160
So it was an overnight
success, Gethin.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.110
It was a very long night.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.070
GETHIN JONES: Yeah, it
did take a little while.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.420
But when it did, it
really kicked off,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.503
as we'll mention in a bit.

00:05:45.503 --> 00:05:48.170
But I suppose that
17, 18-year-old Kelly,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.180
jamming in different garages
in number 62, number--

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.300
in your house-- 54.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.200
What was he like?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.832
What was a 17-year-old
Kelly Jones like?

00:05:57.832 --> 00:05:59.040
KELLY JONES: I was all right.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.040
I was pretty quiet, really.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.470
I liked playing football.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.935
I liked doing boxing.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:07.310
I had two older brothers who
I was following them around,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.130
you know.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.560
But I was into the music
from a very young age

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.770
because my father was working--

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.340
going around to
working men's clubs.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.250
So I would go round
carrying his speakers.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.337
He was a singer, my dad.

00:06:20.337 --> 00:06:21.920
He was professional
before I was born.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.930
He was-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.700
And he did some shows of Roy
Orbison and people like that.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.290
And when I was
growing up, his record

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.480
was on the jukebox in the
local pub, which was weird.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.940
GETHIN JONES: Yeah, bet it was.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.000
KELLY JONES: So when I used to
go and watch him in the clubs,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.190
he would give me a fiver
for carrying his speakers

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.017
and a Chinese takeaway
on the way home.

00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:44.850
GETHIN JONES: Did you
have Chinese takeaway?

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.310
KELLY JONES: No.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.760
GETHIN JONES: Oh, right.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.070
You bought--

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.862
KELLY JONES: It was a
really good incentive

00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:49.230
to go every weekend.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.355
But I learned a lot from
watching him in the clubs.

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:53.690
Because if you could
play a working men's club

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.827
and succeed, then you're
doing something right,

00:06:55.827 --> 00:06:58.410
you know, the way you pace the
set and all that kind of stuff.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.470
So as much as I didn't
realize, I probably

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.970
learned a hell of
a lot doing that.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.220
And then I end up doing
working men's clubs, and pubs,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.570
and stuff like that
in the back of the van

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.490
and all that for many,
many years as well.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.865
GETHIN JONES: By the way, he
changed his name, didn't he,

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:10.430
from Jones?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.970
KELLY JONES: He was Jones.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.820
And because at the time there
was Tom Jones and Jack Jones,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.913
they changed his name
to Arwyn Davidson.

00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:17.330
So in the phone
book, nobody could

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
find us, because obviously,
it was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.690
But yeah, I don't know where
the Davidson came from.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.690
GETHIN JONES: It's not
exactly Tom Jones, is it?

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.260
KELLY JONES: No.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.340
GETHIN JONES: Arwyn Davidson.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.440
KELLY JONES: No, and he was
Tom Woodward, wasn't he?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.910
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.440
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.020
GETHIN JONES: That's
why he changed.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.437
You mentioned
boxing and football.

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:34.030
But you also had quite a keen
interest in writing as well,

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.130
didn't you?

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.580
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.120
GETHIN JONES: That's the thing
about all your tracks for me.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.790
I don't know.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.292
It's a bit of a wordsmith
in there-- script--

00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:41.953
you love films?

00:07:41.953 --> 00:07:44.120
KELLY JONES: Well, I was
pushed in the band, really.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.640
I mean, I like
playing the guitar.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.035
But because my old man was a
singer, every band I joined,

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:49.660
they would kind of
push me to the front

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.540
because they just assumed
because my father could sing,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.110
I would be the
singer sort of thing.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.870
Not until about 18 or 19, I
felt that comfortable with that.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.820
The first six or seven years,
I wasn't that keen on it,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.350
but I would do it.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.310
And then when I
got to about 18, I

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.680
was working in a fruit
and veg stall about 16,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.978
and I was in art school.

00:08:09.978 --> 00:08:11.770
So I left school at
16, went to art school.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.650
Did that for five years,
filmmaking and animation.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.560
And during that time
of being in art school

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.230
and working in a
market, I would see

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.000
lots of people in
the market and get

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.440
to know all different
walks of life.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.100
And I would be writing a
lot of the the words down

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.870
on the back of brown bags.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.460
While I was serving
carrots, I would

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.909
be writing stuff like "A
Thousand Trees" and "Local Boy

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.701
in the Photograph."

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:38.091
All that was literally written
in a market stall, really.

00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:39.549
But then I would
go to film school.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.230
And because I was
doing sequential art

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.880
and storyboarding, I would be
doing filmmaking sequences,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.570
and I'd be writing dialogue.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.897
So the dialogue
then became lyrics.

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:53.230
Because I'd go to rehearsals
on a Thursday and a Sunday,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.810
and some of the dialogue I wrote
for films I was trying to make

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.130
would end up coming
in songs, like "She

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.630
Takes Her Clothes
Off," and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.755
and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:59.755 --> 00:09:02.740
So a lot of it was
very filmic, you know,

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.170
because they were kind of
crossing over in my life

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.110
at that point in time.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.610
So it was all very
visual and very--

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.410
very filmmaking themes, really.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.120
But the music was
very authentic.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.088
GETHIN JONES: Yeah it's like
a autobiographical, wasn't it,

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.630
in all the things--
your experiences,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.940
which made up the first album.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.110
And literally, word did get out
then about the Stereophonics.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.870
KELLY JONES: It did, yeah.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.600
GETHIN JONES: And it's a
bit of a weird question,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.995
but did you want to be famous?

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:27.280
Were you thinking about it?

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.170
KELLY JONES: No, Stuart the
drummer wanted to be famous.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.160
And he became famous
for many, many reasons.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.720
And he was lovely,
and he was crazy,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.137
and he's all of
the above, really.

00:09:36.137 --> 00:09:38.260
But he always joked that
he wanted to be famous.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.380
He wanted a BMW.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.470
He wanted a swimming pool.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.830
And he got it all.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.630
And I never really
wanted to be famous.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.290
I just knew that I had
something I was trying to say.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.050
And I still haven't really
worked out what that is.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.930
But it's a drive that is still
within me which I can't really

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:56.440
turn off.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.410
I know the energy that
gives me that drive

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.540
is the same energy
that can drive

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.860
me a bit crazy on down time.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.000
So I kind of always have to have
some sort of project going on

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.530
to kind of focus that
in the right way,

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.300
if you know what I mean.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.540
But the fame thing and
the celebrity thing,

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.530
it was never really
on my agenda, really,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.790
and still isn't, really.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.860
GETHIN JONES: The thing
is with the success,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.550
it comes, doesn't it,
whether you like it or not.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.890
When was it that you
suddenly thought,

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.333
actually, hang on a minute here.

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:29.500
We're going to be quite big.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.250
This is happening.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.610
KELLY JONES: Yeah, well,
people started putting us

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.940
on the front of the magazines,
and we were selling out

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.050
arenas and stadiums by
our second album, which

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.460
was like 10 albums ago.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.673
So it wasn't fast, but
it appeared to be fast.

00:10:45.673 --> 00:10:47.840
Because obviously, we'd
been working since I was 12.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.890
So for a long time, I would say
for the first 12, 13, maybe 14

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.290
years, I never really
felt comfortable

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.617
on stage doing our gigs
because I wasn't convinced

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:00.200
that the people there
really liked us.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.480
And I wasn't--

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.430
GETHIN JONES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.700
KELLY JONES: I think a lot of
musicians feel it, possibly.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.770
And it took me a while to
work out the common sense,

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.800
well they must be there.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.860
They must like us because
they bought a ticket, right?

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.690
GETHIN JONES: I'm
thinking that now.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.480
But [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.365
So that's the worry.

00:11:11.365 --> 00:11:12.990
They could leave at
any time, you know?

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.750
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.420
So it takes you a while
to get comfortable

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.180
in your own skin doing
something that's quite

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.085
a vulnerable thing, I guess.

00:11:22.085 --> 00:11:24.210
But once I kind of got used
to that, I was into it.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.590
But I didn't really
love the fact--

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.580
not in a grumpy way-- just I
never felt comfortable walking

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.190
on red carpets and stuff, like
that wasn't really my scene.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.107
My wife loves it, but
I'm not very good at it.

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:38.050
GETHIN JONES:
[INAUDIBLE] in '98,

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.440
we mentioned, you were then sort
of selling out gigs everywhere.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.290
And probably for any kind
of Welsh musician, then

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.570
you hit the big time.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.210
You duet with Tom
Jones, in Cardiff,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.467
you know you've made it.

00:11:50.467 --> 00:11:51.300
KELLY JONES: We did.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.373
Yeah, I bent his ear
one night in a bar.

00:11:53.373 --> 00:11:54.290
GETHIN JONES: Did you?

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.480
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.920
GETHIN JONES: Was that
your idea, was it?

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.500
KELLY JONES: Well, he
was making a duets album,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.375
and I'd seen all these
other people doing it.

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:01.930
And that was a bit
like, oh, hello.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.208
So I told him I love Sam
Cook, and Otis Redding,

00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:05.000
and all this stuff.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.840
And I think I convinced
him over a few pints

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.228
in some pub in Cardiff.

00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:11.020
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.020
KELLY JONES: And then
we did the track.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.940
And I think that was Tom's,
one of Tom's most successful

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.838
albums.

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:16.630
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.263
Good guy?

00:12:17.263 --> 00:12:18.430
KELLY JONES: He was amazing.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.850
I mean, I stood opposite him
and there's a glass screen.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.060
We sang it twice
looking at each other.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.280
And then he said let's go for
a Chinese, and that was it.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.225
And I said, all right.

00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:29.350
So we went to Baker Street.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.392
And we had a lovely meal.

00:12:30.392 --> 00:12:32.412
And that was that.

00:12:32.412 --> 00:12:33.370
And so we stayed mates.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.470
And then he took
me under his wing,

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.490
and took me around
for weeks and weeks

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.130
to lots of really
nice restaurants

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.060
that opened the door for him.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.852
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:12:40.852 --> 00:12:43.035
KELLY JONES: So,
yeah, he's amazing.

00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:43.660
He's a machine.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.320
GETHIN JONES: Still a mate?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.430
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.700
GETHIN JONES: Still a friend?

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.250
KELLY JONES: Yeah, he is, yeah.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.150
GETHIN JONES: I feel
like Chinese food

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.320
is going to be a theme here.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.810
KELLY JONES: I didn't
mean it to be a theme.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.700
Yeah, it was a big
part of my youth.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.250
GETHIN JONES: It's
amazing how things

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.110
changed as well,
because obviously, I

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.100
was a fan growing up.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.810
But it was like a
lot of the songs

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.320
were anthems to me and my
friends growing up as well.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.270
And I remember sort of
you doing gig support

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:10.070
in bands, like Feed, and
like Ocean Color Scene.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.460
And then all of a sudden,
they're supporting you in gigs.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.010
That must have been a
very strange transition

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.417
for a very humble lad from
Cwmamman, in the valley.

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:21.500
KELLY JONES: Yeah, it was.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.640
It was weired, because we
were doing cover versions

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.600
by Aerosmith, and the Black
Crows, and Lenny Kravitz,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.550
and all that one month.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.290
And the next six
months later, we're

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.290
playing Wembley Stadium
with them all and above them

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.300
on the bill.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.210
It's a very bizarre
thing because you're not

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.380
ready for that, obviously.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.992
Your brain can't
quite compute that.

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:45.950
But we were very lucky.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.075
We had a lot of major band
[INAUDIBLE] on the road.

00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:50.580
We did David Bowie's last tour
across America, The Reality

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.080
Tour.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.658
We did the U2 Elevation
Tour, just after 9/11,

00:13:54.658 --> 00:13:55.700
in Madison Square Garden.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.200
And all the firemen
came on the stage.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.180
We've been really-- The
Who took us on tour.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.637
That was the first major
[INAUDIBLE] we did with them.

00:14:02.637 --> 00:14:04.220
GETHIN JONES: And
you're a fan anyway?

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.630
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.612
Yeah, it was amazing.

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:08.820
We had a [INAUDIBLE] football
match with David Bowie.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.737
It was pretty bizarre.

00:14:09.737 --> 00:14:10.790
GETHIN JONES: Oh, really?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.540
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.310
The thin White Duke was on the
side of the pitch heckling me.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.670
There's some things you
just don't forget, you know.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.880
GETHIN JONES: Was
he like at midfield.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.500
KELLY JONES: He was amazing.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.910
Because it was the Reality Tour.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.278
He was actually playing himself.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.070
He didn't have an alter
ego or anything us.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.320
We bummed around, and he'd
come in the dressing rooms.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.970
And he'd watch us soundcheck.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.220
Because we were trying to
be very quick soundchecking.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.988
You try of this
guitar for 40 seconds,

00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:33.530
try a bit of that
one for 40 seconds.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.238
Do a bit of that.

00:14:34.238 --> 00:14:36.350
He'd be watching, and
then he'd come over to me,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.140
and put his arm around me.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.780
He goes, you know, if you
extended a few of those songs,

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.590
you might be onto something.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.873
So he was-- he was really
lovely to us, yeah.

00:14:43.873 --> 00:14:46.040
GETHIN JONES: Yeah, he knew
a thing or two, as well,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.250
didn't he?

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.540
KELLY JONES: He did
know a thing or two.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.215
He was a Jones.

00:14:48.215 --> 00:14:48.880
GETHIN JONES: Was he?

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.200
KELLY JONES: Yeah, his
real name's Jones too.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.790
GETHIN JONES: I
didn't know that.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.738
I think we all are,
originally, aren't we?

00:14:52.738 --> 00:14:53.780
Change it as we go along.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.007
KELLY JONES: Sorry to
bring that back around.

00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:57.590
GETHIN JONES: It is
fascinating to me,

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.080
because I know you say you're
uncomfortable about the fame,

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.390
but it actually sounds
like you're very

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.870
relaxed in that environment.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.630
Because it-- because
you know what it is.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.400
KELLY JONES: I'm
relaxed with musicians.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.450
I'm relaxed with people
who do the same thing as me

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.520
once I get to know them.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.400
But I'm not very comfortable
sitting on a table

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.850
in like an award ceremony
and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.020
Probably because we
never really win.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.960
No--

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.460
GETHIN JONES:
Nominated a few times.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.390
KELLY JONES: Nominated--
yeah, I'm joking.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.500
GETHIN JONES: Have
you been starstruck?

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.300
Has there been an
awkward moment where

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.458
you felt like a very normal
person with this big--

00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:33.500
KELLY JONES: I've been
starstruck by all of them.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.433
At first, I'm very silent.

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:37.100
And I don't really
like meeting somebody

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.380
lest they meet us back.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.770
But we've got some-- we
did the Stones tours.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.900
And everybody took us,
around about that time, 2000,

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.240
and you walk into Keith
Richards' dressing room.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.780
And he's got a 12 foot snooker
table and a Shepherd's Pie.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.960
And you're not allowed
to bust the crust.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.780
He has to be the one that
takes the first portion.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.680
GETHIN JONES: Really?

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.150
KELLY JONES: And, of course,
I bring Stuart in there.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.860
Then I go there's a
12th foot snooker table.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.402
He goes, oh, I love
a bit of snooker.

00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:04.640
And then he went straight
into the Shepherd's pie.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.540
GETHIN JONES: No.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.915
KELLY JONES: So
they send it back

00:16:06.915 --> 00:16:09.200
and had to get another
one before Keith saw it.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.040
GETHIN JONES: I didn't
realize that was

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.200
a ritual, that was a thing.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.170
KELLY JONES: It's
the truth, yeah.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.960
And then he sat me down, and
he had a chat with us, and he--

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.673
and he was with his two
daughters, who are now models,

00:16:17.673 --> 00:16:19.340
I think, but they
were quite young then.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.640
And he drew a map of Wales--

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.050
Britain, and he put a
red line around Wales.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.270
And he said that's
where the dragons live.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.925
Because I think his
mother was Welsh.

00:16:28.925 --> 00:16:30.800
GETHIN JONES: Probably
a Jones at some point.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.258
KELLY JONES: She
was Jones as well.

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:33.340
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.380
And by the way, if you see a
dragon in the Blueberry room,

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.060
later on, if you're
having a meeting,

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.683
that will be Kelly's
daughters, who've done that.

00:16:40.683 --> 00:16:41.600
KELLY JONES: Oh, yeah.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.020
GETHIN JONES: Just been--

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.210
KELLY JONES: They draw
dragons wherever they go.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.900
It's a Welsh thing.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.830
GETHIN JONES: It's graffiti.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.920
It's actually very good.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.600
KELLY JONES: It
wasn't bad, was it.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.767
GETHIN JONES: A real talent.

00:16:47.767 --> 00:16:49.460
So now you're at super stardom.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.610
You are running the show.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.180
Just quick, did
you have a rider?

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.070
KELLY JONES: A rider?

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.000
GETHIN JONES: Yeah,
do you have a rider?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.860
KELLY JONES: No, we don't
have a Shepherd's Pie, no.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.510
GETHIN JONES: No, but
what was your rider?

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.040
KELLY JONES: Same as
we go, now, just--

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.957
GETHIN JONES: Chinese.

00:16:58.957 --> 00:17:01.700
KELLY JONES: No Chinese, no.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.766
The usual, really-- white wine,
red wine, beer, spirits, water.

00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:07.099
GETHIN JONES: That's old school.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.380
KELLY JONES: It's
never really changed.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:08.849
GETHIN JONES: Bit of whisky?

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.119
Because they say you
have the whiskey voice.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:11.000
KELLY JONES: I've
never liked whisky.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.970
See, I've read that.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.440
GETHIN JONES: Oh, really?

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.329
KELLY JONES: No,
whisky gravel voice.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:20.339
I gargle sandpaper and stuff,
but no, I never drank whisky.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.079
No.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.990
GETHIN JONES: Good
question, yeah?

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.312
KELLY JONES: I like
vodka, but this is water.

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:28.109
GETHIN JONES: That's
what you think.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:29.350
Kelly, how would you--

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.860
I was chatting
with Craig before,

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.152
and, I mean, what's happened
with Google is incredible.

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:34.610
They stay at the
top of their game.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.018
They're market leaders.

00:17:36.018 --> 00:17:36.810
How do you do that?

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.510
How do you stay at the top?

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.330
And you've been
doing it for so long.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.400
KELLY JONES: I
think for me I like

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.150
to learn stuff all the time.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.293
So I think when we
got signed, I always

00:17:50.293 --> 00:17:52.210
thought that was the
first step on the ladder.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.000
And then I thought-- it
was just after the Brit pop

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.710
kind of explosion, really.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.373
So it was Oasis and [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:58.373 --> 00:18:00.040
But a lot of the bands
that were around,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.453
they all kind of fell apart.

00:18:02.453 --> 00:18:04.870
And by watching that, you could
see, if you haven't really

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.760
got the craft, or the
songwriting together,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.460
then when the scene goes away,
you kind of go away with it.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.377
And I didn't want to
be part of a scene.

00:18:11.377 --> 00:18:13.210
I didn't want to be
part of the Welsh scene,

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.585
when they started
making nothing.

00:18:14.585 --> 00:18:18.130
Because I didn't want to
be attached to anything.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.095
To me, it was about
always wanting

00:18:21.095 --> 00:18:22.720
to leave behind a
catalog of music that

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.640
stood the test of time.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.550
That's all I ever
want to achieve.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.570
And so that's all I've
ever wanted to do.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.302
That's all I've ever focused
on, is this the catalog.

00:18:32.302 --> 00:18:33.760
And every time I
make a new record,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.460
I try to play guitar
in a different way,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.942
sing in a different way,
learn to play the piano,

00:18:38.942 --> 00:18:40.150
bring different musicians in.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.890
Whatever it might
be, each time you

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.612
do it, if you're not
challenging the sound of what

00:18:44.612 --> 00:18:45.570
you're trying to make--

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.850
and I guess looking
up to people,

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.600
whether it's Prince,
or Bowie, or Madonna,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.680
or whoever it was at that time.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.430
You're always trying
to make something

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.910
that you can't quite do yet.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.770
And then you got to learn
how to do it, you know.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.740
And I think by doing
that, you kind of stumble

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.500
across accidents.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.940
Sometimes it works, sometimes
it really doesn't work.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.330
But then sometimes
when you hit, you know,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.310
like we brought our "C'est
La Vie" a few years ago,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.877
people thought,
who were 14 and 15,

00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:13.210
thought that was our first song.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.410
And there was lots
of 15-year-old kids

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.118
in the front row.

00:19:15.118 --> 00:19:18.190
And because the energy of
that song talked to them.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.120
And then they look
at, and then they go,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.830
there's actually another nine
albums I better go and look at.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.660
So it's constantly
trying to do our thing.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.140
There's people who've
followed us since '96,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.675
and there's some people who
only discovered us last year.

00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:31.650
And that's kind of--

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.810
that revolving door is the
most important part for us.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.640
Because if you're only going
to cater to the people who just

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.640
want you to keep making
"Word Gets Around," then

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.590
you're not going to
really get very far.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.965
You're going to have a bunch
of people in the show as old

00:19:43.965 --> 00:19:46.840
as me, and I don't really want
to play to them all the time.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.900
I want to play to everybody.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.620
It's about trying to keep
it growing and developing.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.170
And the internet has
really helped in some ways,

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.600
because we wouldn't
have played in places

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.670
like Mexico City, and
Kuala Lumpur, and all

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.050
these different places,
all over the world,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.510
because these kids
are just finding

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.510
our music through streaming
and stuff like that.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.370
So Mexico City, people
crying in the front row.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.330
Like 15-year-old
kids who never--

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.450
it's quite bizarre.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:12.905
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:13.870
KELLY JONES: It's really weird.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:14.620
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.578
Actually, I did this
earlier, because I thought

00:20:16.578 --> 00:20:18.340
I'd make the use
of being in Google,

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.650
and I had a look to
see where you were

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.300
most searched around the world.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.790
Do you have any
ideas where that is?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.780
I mean, that's a tough
question, isn't it?

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.970
KELLY JONES: Cardiff.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:28.630
GETHIN JONES: Well,
let's have a look--

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.320
KELLY JONES:
Probably not Cardiff.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.987
GETHIN JONES: Let's
go around the world.

00:20:30.987 --> 00:20:33.010
Let me get it up
on the screen now.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.500
This is where it's at-- as you
expect, the United Kingdom.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.780
I mean, when was your
last gig in St. Helena?

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.960
KELLY JONES: I'm not quite
sure even where that is.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.680
Where is that?

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.900
GETHIN JONES: You got the
UAE there and then Australia

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.980
as well, that comes up.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.300
KELLY JONES: We've just
come back from there.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.680
Yeah, we did the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.230
GETHIN JONES: They
like you there.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.080
And then cities wise,
as you can imagine,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.122
we'll never let you down.

00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:56.050
We'll always be for
you there, Kelly.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.620
There we are, unbelievable,
pair up in threes, in Cardiff.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.250
KELLY JONES: That's pathetic.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.052
32 in Liverpool.

00:21:04.052 --> 00:21:05.260
Wonder what that's all about.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.160
GETHIN JONES: I'm hoping
that's million, though, Kel.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.440
They just didn't
have the room for it.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.100
So that's good.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.300
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.250
Melbourne.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.750
GETHIN JONES: And
on a serious note,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.200
though, and I might be a
little bit biased saying this,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.720
but you talk about constantly
trying to renew things,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.280
like "1,000 Trees,"
'97, "Dakota,"

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.550
2005, one of my favorite tracks
of all time, "Indian Summer,

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.090
2013.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.460
That's 15 odd years.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.100
It still sounds brilliant to me.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.310
Has there been a record where
you thought this is brilliant,

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.900
this is definitely
going to do well,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.630
that hasn't, or vise versa?

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.350
Does that happen?

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.040
Or do you even think--

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.440
KELLY JONES: The only song
I've ever written which lasted,

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.470
which was written
in about 10 minutes,

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.200
and took about three hours
to record, was "Dakota."

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.952
And the minute that I wrote
that in a hotel room, that's

00:21:53.952 --> 00:21:56.410
the only time I've ever text
a record company guy and gone,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.500
I think I've got--

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:57.880
GETHIN JONES: Really?

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.505
KELLY JONES: Yeah,
that's the only one.

00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:02.260
Apart from that, I don't
really pick the singles.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.060
I mean, I write
them, record them.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.590
And then everybody
gets together.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.423
And they say they like
this, they like that.

00:22:07.423 --> 00:22:10.990
And I've never tried to write
a single, like a factory

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.208
kind of writer, you know.

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:13.000
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.940
KELLY JONES: So,
no, it's quite funny

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.582
how they come about really.

00:22:17.582 --> 00:22:19.540
GETHIN JONES: And there
are challenges as well,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.340
in any business, as
there is in a band.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.640
Like you're four now, but
you've been a different four

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.890
a couple of times over the
years, if that makes sense.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:27.520
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.687
GETHIN JONES: That must be
really, really difficult.

00:22:29.687 --> 00:22:31.840
But is there a drive
in you that thought

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.650
I've got to make
these changes if we're

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.007
going to sustain our success?

00:22:36.007 --> 00:22:37.840
KELLY JONES: Well, I
think, like going back,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.720
the drive is the force of
what keeps every band going.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.617
If it's really what you are.

00:22:43.617 --> 00:22:45.200
I don't think I kind
of choose really.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.110
I don't sit down and
try to write songs.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.027
I think the songs kind
of channel through you.

00:22:49.027 --> 00:22:51.570
They kind of come out that way.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.430
But I've got that drive
where I go to the studio,

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.897
and I'll stay there till
2:00 in the morning.

00:22:56.897 --> 00:22:59.230
I'll get up and I'll do the
family stuff in the morning.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.762
And then I'll go back
there by 10 o'clock,

00:23:02.762 --> 00:23:03.970
before the engineers turn up.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.170
It's just, when I'm in
that mode, I love it.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.950
That's when I feel the
most free and I feel most

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.600
in the flow of what I'm doing.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.610
And it's solving problems,
and it's challenging,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.420
and all that sort of stuff.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.295
And it's frustrating.

00:23:14.295 --> 00:23:16.110
And it's everything
above all that.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:20.780
But the rewards, when you
actually make those songs,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.780
they're only yours for a
certain amount of time.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.680
And for that little
block of time,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.190
you can kind of see them and
manipulate them a little bit.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.290
And then once you kind
of hand them over,

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.423
then fortunately
and unfortunately,

00:23:31.423 --> 00:23:33.340
they kind of become
marketing tools for people

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.060
to sell records.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.040
And then they become the songs
again when you play live,

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.610
you know.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.423
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:23:37.423 --> 00:23:39.340
KELLY JONES: So it kind
of goes a bit strange.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.060
And then you look
back at over 20 years,

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.310
and there's a lot of them.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.260
And thankfully, we've
been a band that

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.560
has got a lot of big
songs on every album,

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.480
so it's not just dependent
on a one hit here

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.998
or a one hit there.

00:23:50.998 --> 00:23:53.290
GETHIN JONES: You touched on
a few things in the answer

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:53.860
before actually.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.270
And one of them
was the internet,

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.720
and now you're huge in
Mexico, and St. Helena, which

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.670
you learned today.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.490
KELLY JONES: And a couple
of people in Melbourne, too.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.430
GETHIN JONES: Social media is
such a big part of everything

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.030
now, isn't it?

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.710
Especially in terms of promoting
your brand and the music.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.253
Stereophonics have
accounts, but not Kelly.

00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:14.920
KELLY JONES: No.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.993
GETHIN JONES: Why not?

00:24:16.993 --> 00:24:18.910
KELLY JONES: I've never
felt the need, really.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.770
I guess some people
need validation

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.958
and they like
telling people what

00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:24.250
they do in their everyday life.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.800
I suppose my outlet
is in my music.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.168
I've never really wanted to have
a Twitter account or Instagram

00:24:32.168 --> 00:24:33.460
account, or anything like that.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.650
I prefer-- maybe it's
an old fashioned thing,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.770
but I prefer, if I am
an artist, if that's

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.050
what people want to
call what I do is,

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:45.160
then I prefer the art to kind of
speak for what it is that I do.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.260
If people know too much about my
personal life or my real life,

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.090
then the words that
I'm writing, they're

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.715
going to be very hard for people
to interpret in their own way.

00:24:54.715 --> 00:24:55.792
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:24:55.792 --> 00:24:57.250
KELLY JONES: So
it's always wanting

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.390
to be open for interpretation.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.870
GETHIN JONES: Does it
dilute it, as well?

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.230
KELLY JONES: I think
it dilutes it a bit.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.960
And I think--

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.440
I think there's an element of
mystery when I was growing up

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.840
that I didn't know about any
of the artists that I love.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.360
And I couldn't find out
anything about those artists.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.570
I was an AC/DC fan.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.630
I was an Otis Redding fan.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.890
I couldn't find anything.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.330
Now you can find
an AC/DC t-shirt

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.705
in [INAUDIBLE]
which is annoying.

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:23.290
Because I couldn't
find one anywhere.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.450
I wrote a letter
to the fan club.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.530
It took three years for a reply.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.530
GETHIN JONES: You should
have sent the pitch in.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.030
You should have
just sent an email.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.488
KELLY JONES: So I come from a
different time in that sense.

00:25:33.488 --> 00:25:34.630
And I quite like--

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.652
I suppose it's an
old school thing.

00:25:36.652 --> 00:25:39.110
An artist is meant to be seen
and not touched and all that,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.710
but I don't really take
it to that serious extent.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.330
But I've never
really felt the need,

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.550
and I haven't
seriously got the time

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:49.332
to be telling people
my every move, really.

00:25:49.332 --> 00:25:51.790
Everybody in the office will
say, can you send us a picture

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.957
when you're making a record.

00:25:52.957 --> 00:25:53.860
And I'll send one.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.693
Where it goes, I
don't really know.

00:25:56.693 --> 00:25:58.610
And I don't really want
to be reading comments

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.660
about what I do
either, because I think

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.790
that can distract as well.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.940
Because not everybody's
going to like what I do.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.880
And not everybody is
going to care what I do.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.995
But if I start reading
what everybody's doing,

00:26:06.995 --> 00:26:09.370
then it's only going to get
in the way of what I do next.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.180
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.950
KELLY JONES: I mean, I
do it for me, really.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:12.400
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.730
KELLY JONES: Ultimately,
every song I've ever written,

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.230
I've had to write because I was
going through whatever I was

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.827
going through to get it out.

00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:19.910
And then, you can have it.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.840
But the main reason I've done
it is because I need to do it.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.578
And so it's not really for
anybody else at that point.

00:26:26.578 --> 00:26:27.370
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:27.940
KELLY JONES: You know?

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.780
GETHIN JONES: It's
interesting, and actually

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.210
trying to just googling
Kelly, you can't really

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.930
find out that much about you.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.560
And I think there's a small
paragraph about family

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.820
and personal life.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.270
It's quite funny, I pride
myself on diligence and research

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.250
doing my work, but
coming to Google,

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.020
to do a gig for
Google is a bit weird.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:44.980
Because you're going
to Google, and then you

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.960
go what do I do now?

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.722
Like, you know, googling Google.

00:26:47.722 --> 00:26:49.680
But, yeah, there's not
much about you in there,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.890
about your family life.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.920
And just watching you
now, with the girls,

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.872
it's obvious that you're a dad,
first, and they're great girls.

00:26:55.872 --> 00:26:57.330
And you're mates
with them as well.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.083
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:26:58.083 --> 00:26:59.250
GETHIN JONES: How have you--

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.720
how have you balanced that?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.690
I mean, you're touring, you've
writing albums, you're gigging.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.470
How do you balance that life?

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.720
KELLY JONES: Well, we've got--

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.567
I've never really been a dad
they wanted nannies, and help,

00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:11.400
and stuff like that.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.380
Everything we have
around us is all family.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.560
And it's important.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.240
Now the girls are
older, I'll only

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.060
go away for two, three weeks
at a max, and then come back,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.810
and then I'll go away
again and come back.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.227
So it's not-- before
we would go away, do

00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:28.560
an American tour for six
weeks, go straight to Australia

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.560
for another eight weeks.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.700
And you'd be gone
forever, really.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.730
But it's an important
balance to keep.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.045
The hours I put in of
being a father, and doing--

00:27:38.045 --> 00:27:39.870
getting up and doing
the school runs,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.152
and doing all the stuff,
the relationships you build

00:27:43.152 --> 00:27:45.410
are hopefully, and
it seems to be,

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.160
paying dividends for
the relationships you

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.535
have in the years where they
can want to communicate more

00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:50.768
with you.

00:27:50.768 --> 00:27:52.560
And I've always thought
that was important.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.360
I had a good relationship
with my parents, my brothers,

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.318
and all the rest of us.

00:27:55.318 --> 00:27:58.440
So I don't really want to
put anything before that.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.190
So that is always,
if I get a schedule,

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.630
it's come to the point,
the half terms are in pink.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.480
And I have to kind of work
tours around some of that stuff.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.040
Because you want to be around.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.990
And then luckily,
they came today.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.100
They got a free goody bag.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.858
They'll probably be
all right now today.

00:28:15.858 --> 00:28:17.650
GETHIN JONES: I was
going to say, actually,

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.120
do they think you're cool?

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.180
KELLY JONES: No.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.640
GETHIN JONES: Or is today
probably the best thing

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.290
you've ever done with them.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:21.870
KELLY JONES: They
thought I was cool

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.120
up until about four years ago.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.133
And since they started
secondary school,

00:28:25.133 --> 00:28:26.550
it's kind of like
on the low down.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.210
GETHIN JONES: Is it?

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:27.450
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.770
They don't-- we don't--

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.730
even the school,
the school asked

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.397
me to go in to do a
battle of the bands,

00:28:31.397 --> 00:28:33.210
and all the stuff like
that, judging and--

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.530
I said no, because
I want the kids

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.822
to walk in their own footsteps.

00:28:35.822 --> 00:28:39.323
I don't want them to
walk in what I've done.

00:28:39.323 --> 00:28:40.740
I want them to be
their own people

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.865
and all that sort of stuff.

00:28:41.865 --> 00:28:44.880
So they don't talk
about me in school.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.700
If somebody googles me and finds
out about it-- googles me--

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.220
GETHIN JONES: Well done, Kelly.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.178
KELLY JONES: I wasn't--

00:28:51.178 --> 00:28:52.803
GETHIN JONES: You
didn't mean to do it.

00:28:52.803 --> 00:28:53.500
KELLY JONES: No.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.842
No, they try to keep it
private and so do we.

00:28:55.842 --> 00:28:57.300
GETHIN JONES: It
was weird, they're

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.370
probably finding out
what you're doing

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.592
on a day to day basis
from social media

00:29:02.592 --> 00:29:04.550
more than they are you
telling them, basically.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.350
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.320
Yeah, I don't really
know what I'm doing.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.620
GETHIN JONES: I didn't know
you're doing a gig in Mexico

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.340
next week, dad.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.300
KELLY JONES: Well,
the thing that

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.690
winds me the most about all
this stuff, and me and my wife

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:12.990
have many
conversations about it.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.657
I have people coming
up to me telling me

00:29:14.657 --> 00:29:17.120
what my family are
doing and I don't know.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.620
GETHIN JONES: It's
creepy, isn't it?

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.537
KELLY JONES: Like, yeah,
like the hair dresser

00:29:20.537 --> 00:29:22.590
will say to me, I saw
Jakki doing so on--

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.240
I'm like, oh, when?

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.050
I hadn't even found
out about it yet.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.270
But they know about it.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.853
GETHIN JONES: Who
is your hairdresser?

00:29:28.853 --> 00:29:31.192
Because you have got great hair.

00:29:31.192 --> 00:29:33.150
[INAUDIBLE] I've always
thought that about you.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.567
KELLY JONES: It's
not down to him.

00:29:34.567 --> 00:29:35.736
GETHIN JONES: Oh.

00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:36.225
KELLY JONES: He just cuts hair.

00:29:36.225 --> 00:29:36.980
GETHIN JONES: Welsh,
it's Welsh hair.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.550
KELLY JONES: No, Johnny.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.475
I'm not giving him
a plug, no chance.

00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:43.350
GETHIN JONES: Listen,
I've babbled on enough.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.380
If you've got a question for
Kelly, please, please, please

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.330
feel free to ask away.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.560
That's why we're here.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.160
And weirdly, they have
put like this sort

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.310
of a comedy mic in the middle.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.275
That's the most sort
of unattractive way

00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:58.650
of like-- who's going to go
up there to start a question.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:59.400
KELLY JONES: I wouldn't.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.030
GETHIN JONES: That's
a lot of pressure.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.730
I wouldn't do that.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.340
Anyway, so we have got
a roving mic as well.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.720
So you can put your hand
up and they'll come to you.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.853
So have a think if you
got anything to ask Kelly.

00:30:06.853 --> 00:30:09.270
But before we do that, one
last thing I'd like to touch on

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:13.420
is the fact you're also
going to be doing solo tour.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.430
KELLY JONES: I am, yeah.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.590
GETHIN JONES: Which might
surprise a lot of people.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.257
And I know you like
to do them every now

00:30:18.257 --> 00:30:20.190
and then, like every decade.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.030
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.590
GETHIN JONES: Was it 2007
you did your last one?

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:25.590
KELLY JONES: Yeah, the
band is a bit like having

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.590
a good marriage, really.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.740
They try to give me some space.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.780
And I'll say, look,
it's not you, it's me.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.738
I need to go off and do
my own thing for a bit.

00:30:35.738 --> 00:30:39.600
And it's just-- you come to the
end of the world tour and part.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.850
You think that you
want to quit for a bit,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.100
because you're a
bit bored, or you're

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.460
a bit fed up with hotel rooms,
and buses, and stuff like that.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.110
But in reality, I think, is
you want to try something new.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.680
So doing a solo tour,
you get a chance

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.620
to talk about how the
songs are written,

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.530
why you've written those
songs, do versions of the songs

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.030
that people have
never heard before.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.572
Do new songs that you've never
played, and may make a record,

00:31:02.572 --> 00:31:04.000
may not make a record.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.780
And it's a chance to
be a bit more, I guess,

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.820
personal with the people
that come to watch you.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.710
Because when you play in a
big show, in the stadium,

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:15.210
with the big lights, and the
screens, and all the rest

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.793
of it, then it becomes
very much based

00:31:16.793 --> 00:31:18.540
on anthems, and big
songs, because that's

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.470
what people are there for.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.678
They're for a good night out.

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:23.040
But when you do the
solo show, we've

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.540
got a guy playing
the trumpet, we've

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.520
got a girl playing the
violin, and there'll

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.437
be some very raucous
moments, but then very

00:31:28.437 --> 00:31:29.520
kind of beautiful moments.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.326
It's a very different
kind of dynamic to it

00:31:31.326 --> 00:31:33.570
than a Stereophonics show.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.720
As a musician, it's nice to
try to do that sort of stuff,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.580
because then you
learn things from that

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.550
and then you can take
on to do other things.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.760
GETHIN JONES: And the
boys are fine with that?

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.780
They fully support that?

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.610
KELLY JONES: They
don't know yet.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:45.610
No, they do know, yeah.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.610
Well, Richard-- I've been
in school with Richard

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.750
since he was three.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.770
GETHIN JONES: Richard
Jones, that is.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:50.690
KELLY JONES: He's Jones.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.107
And they thought
we were brothers.

00:31:52.107 --> 00:31:53.850
And he had his name
tattooed on his neck.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.225
Actually, speaking
of Jones, when

00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:57.510
Richard turned up
to school one day,

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.190
after going for a
tattoo, when he was 15--

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.750
he shouldn't have
been obviously--

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.140
and he had Jonsey
written on his arm.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.220
But it was spelt wrong.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.183
GETHIN JONES: Oh, no.

00:32:06.183 --> 00:32:08.100
KELLY JONES: So I was
the person that told him

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.260
that it actually says Jonsey.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.620
They put the E in the
wrong way, wrong place.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.160
And then I think he had to go
back and have it tattooed over

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.250
with a larger skull.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.180
GETHIN JONES: Right.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.480
So what is it now, like
John E Skull White?

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.800
KELLY JONES: It was Johns--

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.250
e-y, instead of writing
it Jones with a Y. Yeah,

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.332
he was wrong anyway.

00:32:29.332 --> 00:32:31.290
GETHIN JONES: [INAUDIBLE]
maybe, just a space--

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.320
KELLY JONES: He's got a big arm.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:32.620
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.350
KELLY JONES: Yeah,
he has got a big arm.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.142
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:32:34.142 --> 00:32:36.692
KELLY JONES: But this was art
by Roy in the Rhonda Valley.

00:32:36.692 --> 00:32:37.400
GETHIN JONES: Oh.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.260
KELLY JONES: I hope
he's not still there.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:40.760
If he is--

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.760
GETHIN JONES: You're
giving him a plug, but not

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.020
your hairdresser.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.478
KELLY JONES: If he is, there's
always spellcheck on Google.

00:32:44.478 --> 00:32:48.397
And so, yeah, so
what was we saying?

00:32:48.397 --> 00:32:50.730
Oh, yeah, he did give me
permission, yeah, he did, yeah.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.620
GETHIN JONES: Solo tour, which
starts in Scotland, actually,

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.310
doesn't it?

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.540
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.707
GETHIN JONES: Start of June.

00:32:54.707 --> 00:32:56.760
And I like the fact
Kelly's giving himself

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.190
a day of for his birthday.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.190
KELLY JONES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.403
GETHIN JONES: And do you
mind if I say, you're 45.

00:33:01.403 --> 00:33:02.320
KELLY JONES: 45, yeah.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.153
GETHIN JONES: Yeah, I
mean, like, you just--

00:33:04.153 --> 00:33:06.153
I suppose you've answered
this question already,

00:33:06.153 --> 00:33:07.090
but you're not given--

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.923
you're not-- you don't
want to stop, do you?

00:33:08.923 --> 00:33:10.885
This is a constant
journey for you.

00:33:10.885 --> 00:33:11.760
KELLY JONES: I don't.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.640
When I stop, I go
a bit mad, really.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.210
So--

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.543
GETHIN JONES: You play football.

00:33:16.543 --> 00:33:18.020
Could've been a boxer.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.080
Quite handy.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.350
KELLY JONES: I
stop after a pint.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.480
No, I like doing what I do.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.030
I like doing--
there was a part I

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.860
started doing some directing
in the videos and screenplay

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.360
writing.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.872
I did that for a bit with BAFTA.

00:33:31.872 --> 00:33:32.830
And I loved doing that.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.550
But end of the day, it all comes
back to storytelling, really.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:35.810
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.710
KELLY JONES: And I do it
best, I think, through music.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.340
GETHIN JONES: Yeah,
it's definitely

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.725
been your thing, for sure.

00:33:39.725 --> 00:33:41.010
Do you mind if we take a few
questions from the floor?

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.830
KELLY JONES: No, I don't mind.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:43.980
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.230
AUDIENCE: Hey, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.880
And firstly, thank
you for the music.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.990
KELLY JONES: Thank you.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.300
AUDIENCE: Been a big fan.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.570
I've got one question
around the storytelling

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.970
that you've mentioned already.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:00.150
Two songs are a particular
favorite of mine, bit

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.815
abstract ones perhaps.

00:34:01.815 --> 00:34:03.690
"Rainbows and Pots
of Gold," which

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.780
is a song about,
presumably about a breakup.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.980
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.870
AUDIENCE: And "Vegas
Two Times," which

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:15.300
is quite a rocky song, which is
two very, very different songs.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.389
It's a bit of a kind of
strange question to ask,

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.460
because I just want to
know a bit more about what

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.880
those songs were about.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.305
And a bit selfish
question, I suppose.

00:34:24.305 --> 00:34:27.469
KELLY JONES: Well, "Rainbows
and Pots of Gold" was about--

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:28.380
quite dark, actually.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.880
GETHIN JONES: Just
lowered the tone.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.620
He's definitely
lowered the tone.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.230
KELLY JONES: It's
not lowered the tone.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.949
GETHIN JONES: Could we not find
a more positive first question?

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:35.300
KELLY JONES: It was--

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.570
let's say I was with
a childhood sweetheart

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:40.560
for many, many years.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.764
You're not going
to like the answer.

00:34:42.764 --> 00:34:44.389
GETHIN JONES: It was
an expensive fine,

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.389
that's for sure.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:46.800
KELLY JONES: We broke up.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.550
And then I discovered that she
was then with my best friend.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.449
So the song was about me
then offering an olive branch

00:34:54.449 --> 00:35:00.270
to him, so we could kind of
still be friends sort of thing,

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.200
because we had a
major, major fight.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.600
And the police came
and took us away.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.040
That's the very, very
diluted version of it.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.198
But that's kind of--

00:35:12.198 --> 00:35:13.740
I'm sure my kids
are going to quiz me

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.940
on that one in the
car on the way home.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.917
"Vegas Two Times"
was I went to Vegas--

00:35:20.917 --> 00:35:21.750
GETHIN JONES: Twice.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.930
KELLY JONES: Well,
that's the thing.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:31.110
I went to make a video
with Tom Jones in LA,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.700
but we went via
Vegas, because he

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.730
was playing his last night
of a 15-night stand in Vegas.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.360
So when we went to see Tom--

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.900
this was in 1998 maybe--

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:45.790
so we stayed up all night
with Tom Jones having a drink.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.297
And then we watched his
show the next night.

00:35:48.297 --> 00:35:50.880
And because we'd kept me him all
night, when he came on stage,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.530
he had about 15
glasses of water.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.347
And he put a spotlight
on us in the booth.

00:35:54.347 --> 00:35:56.930
And he said if you're wondering
why all these waters are here,

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.820
he said because those
bastards kept me up all night.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.460
And then we had to leave Vegas
the next day to go back to LA

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.720
to make the video.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.080
But we got lost.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.340
And as we were leaving, we went
round in some weird circle.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.243
And we ended up back in Vegas.

00:36:10.243 --> 00:36:11.910
And we literally had
to leave two times.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.700
And that's what it was.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.520
So, yeah.

00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:19.960
AUDIENCE: So thank
you for coming.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.450
It's really cool to meet you.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.763
I was wondering, given
kind of your job,

00:36:24.763 --> 00:36:26.430
it's obviously a very
high-pressure job,

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.740
and there's a lot of--

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.180
the energy must be
really crazy, probably

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.608
really takes a lot out of you.

00:36:31.608 --> 00:36:33.900
So I'm wondering how do you
actually balance your life?

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.970
You talked a little bit about
it between your family life

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.800
and personal, but what
do you do personally

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.260
to kind of take the edge off
when things get-- when they

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.093
escalate, when you're
on tour, for whatever,

00:36:42.093 --> 00:36:44.898
eight weeks,
non-stop, et cetera.

00:36:44.898 --> 00:36:46.190
KELLY JONES: Not enough really.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.890
I'm pretty crap at giving
myself any time, I have to say.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:54.760
I kind of get into a bit of
a treadmill, of when I start,

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.330
I'll do the work, and
I'll do the shows,

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.195
and I kind of get
engrossed in it.

00:36:59.195 --> 00:37:00.570
And when I'm with
the family, I'm

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.050
very much engrossed in that.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:06.540
And the only thing I kind of do
outside of that really is I'll

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:12.238
go for a run or something
like that, or watch films,

00:37:12.238 --> 00:37:13.030
or stuff like that.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.210
But a lot of the time,
I've never really

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.120
been very good at giving
myself back as much as I need.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.490
So I guess I find
most of the release--

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.060
I feel more calm
when I'm writing,

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.230
or I'm recording or playing.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.513
But the time-- unfortunately,
when you're on the road,

00:37:27.513 --> 00:37:30.180
you have two and a half hours on
stage, and the rest of the time

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.180
is in hotel rooms, which
I can't stand really.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.400
That's the bit that, you know--

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.047
jet lagged in the
middle of a hotel

00:37:37.047 --> 00:37:39.130
in Australia, on the other
side of the world, when

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:40.560
you family's on the other
side, and you're all

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.690
on the wrong clock.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:42.690
I don't enjoy that part.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.660
So, I don't know, I'm still
learning on that side of it.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.250
Not quite been worked out.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.170
GETHIN JONES: So random fact
is that you actually support

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.450
Leeds United, don't you?

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.200
KELLY JONES: I do.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.480
I think they're going
to mess it up as well.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:55.720
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.540
The won last night, [INAUDIBLE]
But when's the last time

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.802
you saw Leeds
United play, Kelly?

00:38:00.802 --> 00:38:02.260
KELLY JONES: When
they were playing

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.980
Real Madrid in the quarterfinal,
the European Cup, which

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.830
was about--

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.560
GETHIN JONES: Two years back.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.230
KELLY JONES: 15 years ago.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.765
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:38:07.765 --> 00:38:09.240
See, you need to
watch Leeds more.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.080
That will help.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.670
That's my [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.378
KELLY JONES: Yeah,
you're right actually.

00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:12.940
I'm crap.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.560
People ask me to go to
football, or golf, or do--

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.270
I'll say, yeah, and
then I never do.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.133
I like a pint of Guinness,
I do like to have

00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:20.925
a pint of Guinness.

00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:21.580
GETHIN JONES: There you go.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.430
KELLY JONES: Sorry,
I forgot about that.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.295
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:38:23.295 --> 00:38:24.670
KELLY JONES: I
really like having

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.720
a pint of Guinness, yeah.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.110
That calms me down.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:28.630
Yeah.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.950
GETHIN JONES: Guinness
helps everything.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.430
KELLY JONES: Guinness
is good [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:32.897
GETHIN JONES: It's
true, it's true.

00:38:32.897 --> 00:38:34.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you both
for the fascinating talk.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.570
I'm sorry this is also a
little self-indulgent question,

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.232
so shut me up if you--

00:38:39.232 --> 00:38:39.940
GETHIN JONES: No.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.690
AUDIENCE: Around--

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.830
GETHIN JONES: All right,
enough, pass the mic off.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.300
AUDIENCE: Around 20 years
ago, 21 years ago, me my mates

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.080
were also in a band.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.030
We came to watch you.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.743
And I think it was
[INAUDIBLE] Lido,

00:38:50.743 --> 00:38:51.910
or [INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.590
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.260
AUDIENCE: Afterwards, we were
having a few, let's say drinks,

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.020
with Stuart.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.840
KELLY JONES: I
don't believe you.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.712
AUDIENCE: I'm saying drinks,
because my boss is probably--

00:39:04.712 --> 00:39:06.670
yeah, so we were in a
chat with him afterwards.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.820
And we asked him about how
you guys got your big break

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.820
and what we could do.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.990
And he said you used to jump
on stage while bands went off.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.240
Like Skunk Anansie would play.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.157
They'd go for a break.

00:39:17.157 --> 00:39:18.970
You'd jump on to play
their instruments

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.680
and try and get your
name out that way.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.740
Was that true, or was he
having us on the whole time?

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.230
KELLY JONES: No, when we were
playing in clubs and stuff,

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:31.323
we'd always go and play on other
people's equipment and stuff

00:39:31.323 --> 00:39:31.990
like that, yeah.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.530
And Skunk Anansie took us
on tour for a little bit.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.312
There was a month
in 1996 where we

00:39:37.312 --> 00:39:38.770
were opening up
for Kenickie, which

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.368
was Lauren Laverne's band.

00:39:41.368 --> 00:39:42.660
She was really funny, actually.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.118
Soon as we saw her on stage,
she was brilliant, [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:45.118 --> 00:39:46.398
GETHIN JONES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:46.398 --> 00:39:48.190
KELLY JONES: So we had
the Monarch's shows,

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.510
we had the Skunk Anansie shows.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.580
We The Who, Three
Colors Red and all that.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.080
And that was all
within three weeks.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.668
And then you go
around the country,

00:39:55.668 --> 00:39:56.710
and you steal their fans.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.830
And then you go and
do your own shows.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.455
And then there's
loads of people there.

00:39:59.455 --> 00:40:01.150
So, no, he wasn't
completely lying.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.505
But you never let the truth
get away with an anecdote.

00:40:04.505 --> 00:40:06.880
GETHIN JONES: What happened
to the band, out of interest?

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.338
AUDIENCE: We were
quite successful.

00:40:08.338 --> 00:40:10.840
GETHIN JONES: Quite successful.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.330
Still in the garage back in--

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.620
no, I'm joking.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.370
Anymore for Kelly?

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:19.338
Oh, yeah-- hello.

00:40:19.338 --> 00:40:21.130
AUDIENCE: Hello, thanks
both for coming in.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.110
It's such a treat to have
you come in during the week.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:25.900
I had a question.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.210
Obviously, the
music industry has

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.370
evolved since you've been
doing what you're doing.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.370
What kind of questions
or advice do you

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:37.198
give to artists who are kind
of starting their careers now?

00:40:37.198 --> 00:40:38.740
And what are the
different challenges

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:43.538
that you think they face to
when you were breaking through?

00:40:43.538 --> 00:40:45.580
KELLY JONES: I don't think
I'd want to start now.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:51.940
I think it's much harder for
young musicians to develop,

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.950
because I think there's
so many stats involved.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:59.557
I think record companies and
management companies, and all--

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.390
not to put them in a
bad light-- but there's

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.640
a lot of statistics
people follow now more

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.860
than when we were starting out.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.720
For example, what
they did with us was,

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.370
they wouldn't let
us play in London.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.080
They made us avoid London.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.090
So we'd have to play in
Newcastle, and Scotland,

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.540
and Wales, and build
a proper fan base.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.750
And do 15 interviews a
day in every university.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.460
So by the time the media caught
up with us, we were actually--

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.720
we had a real fan base.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.490
So if the media kind
of turned on us,

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.490
or the record wasn't
successful, then we already

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.585
had a grounding.

00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:33.460
So the only thing, my
advice would be really,

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.950
I think it still
stems back to the fact

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.860
the songs have to work, because
now it's a bit like the '50s.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.847
The song is more
important than the album

00:41:40.847 --> 00:41:43.180
really, because people are
just downloading or streaming

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.380
one song.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.810
And if that song
is not very good,

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.185
then people are not really
going to listen to you at all.

00:41:48.185 --> 00:41:50.602
So I think it'll always come
back to the songwriting craft

00:41:50.602 --> 00:41:52.140
really.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.770
GETHIN JONES: You've
been quite open,

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:56.570
as well, about the TV
shows now, in terms

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.890
of the manufactured bands,
with "X Factor," "The Voice,"

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:01.720
et cetera.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.420
That's not really something
you ever advocated, is it?

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.878
It's not something
you're a fan of.

00:42:05.878 --> 00:42:08.560
KELLY JONES: I don't think it's
something you can judge really.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.100
I have been asked to
judge on all those shows.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.410
And I'm not against the shows.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.160
I think they're great
Saturday night tele.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.310
Sat down with the kids when
there would be younger,

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.630
and watching, have a
laugh and all that.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.990
But I think it's
very hard once you--

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.492
even if you win, to
go on from that point,

00:42:24.492 --> 00:42:26.950
you're always going to be a
contestant winner or something.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.060
I know some people have
been massively successful.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.480
But I the majority
of those people,

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.030
it's a different way to come
into the game, then, really.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.163
I think you have
to play in a club

00:42:39.163 --> 00:42:41.080
where there's only three
people that know you.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.363
You have to know what it
feels like to die on stage.

00:42:43.363 --> 00:42:45.280
You have to feel like I
don't want to walk out

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.300
the dressing room
because I'm embarrassed

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.455
how crap I was tonight.

00:42:47.455 --> 00:42:49.890
And unless you have
those feelings,

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.050
then you're not going to--

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.310
you can't learn by walking
into a football stadium.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:55.450
You have to learn that
from the ground up.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:58.540
And that's no different,
I think, from any trade.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.390
You have to make your
mistakes yourself,

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:01.932
you have to walk
into your own walls.

00:43:01.932 --> 00:43:04.758
Otherwise, you're
not really going to--

00:43:04.758 --> 00:43:07.050
one, you're not going to
appreciate it when you get it.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.730
And it's a bit like
a lottery winner.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.600
You give a lottery
winner 10 million quid,

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.610
you guaranteed 99%
of them mess it up.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.560
If you earn the
money, then somehow

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.727
you know what to do with it.

00:43:17.727 --> 00:43:19.685
GETHIN JONES: It is
massive exposure, isn't it?

00:43:19.685 --> 00:43:21.320
We were chatting
about the 18-year-old

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.903
on "Britain's Got
Talent" on Saturday.

00:43:22.903 --> 00:43:25.507
And all of a sudden, bang,
she wasn't even expecting it.

00:43:25.507 --> 00:43:27.590
Do you think you would
have coped with that at 18?

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:28.492
KELLY JONES: No.

00:43:28.492 --> 00:43:29.200
I couldn't do it.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.825
I couldn't do live
tele every Saturday.

00:43:30.825 --> 00:43:31.750
I'd fall apart.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:32.297
No chance.

00:43:32.297 --> 00:43:33.630
GETHIN JONES: I can't do it now.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:34.320
KELLY JONES: No.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.028
I couldn't, honestly,
genuinely couldn't.

00:43:36.028 --> 00:43:39.100
I've never enjoyed one live
TV show my entire life.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.510
No.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.285
I mean, when it's
finished, I like it,

00:43:42.285 --> 00:43:44.640
but watching it back,
with the boys and a pint.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.190
But leading up to
it, no, I'm not--

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.260
it's like [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.580
GETHIN JONES: So you're not
going to do "Strictly Come

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.260
Dancing" anytime soon?

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:51.960
KELLY JONES: I've been asked.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.310
GETHIN JONES: Have you.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.790
Did you watch the Welsh
guy in 2007, came third?

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:58.200
KELLY JONES: Was that you?

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:58.820
GETHIN JONES: Enjoy that?

00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.550
KELLY JONES: I played
on that, though.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.420
I have sang on that.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.440
GETHIN JONES: I
think you have, yeah.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.010
KELLY JONES: I've sang on that.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.450
GETHIN JONES: Did
you vote for me?

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.590
KELLY JONES: I didn't vote, no.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:06.257
Because like I just
said, I don't really

00:44:06.257 --> 00:44:07.340
do the voting thing.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.850
I don't like to judge, Geth.

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.440
GETHIN JONES: Got to look
after the Welsh though.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.060
KELLY JONES: No, I
didn't, I didn't--

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.255
I didn't watch that one.

00:44:14.255 --> 00:44:15.630
GETHIN JONES: Any
more questions?

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.840
Or we can-- oh,
yeah, OK, yeah, sure.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.370
I should have said,
introduce yourself as well.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:21.840
That would have been nice.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.270
But it's probably a
bit too late for that.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.770
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you guys
for coming, first of all, very

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:27.840
inspirational meeting.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.890
KELLY JONES: Thank you.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:32.700
AUDIENCE: Kelly, you mentioned
that with all the new music,

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.942
you try to experiment, bring new
things, bring new instruments.

00:44:35.942 --> 00:44:37.650
And so one, I think
that's a common trait

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.350
that we googlers have with you.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.400
We like experimenting.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.160
Sometimes you quickly fail, but
sometimes you really do well.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.880
So my question is, what
inspires you, in particular,

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.150
outside of music, that
you do, that helps

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.192
boost your creativity.

00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:56.400
KELLY JONES: I guess I've
always took my inspiration,

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.720
from for good or for bad, from
whatever I'm going through

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.780
in my own life, on my,
if you want to call it

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.860
a journey through life.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.800
When I started doing it,
I was like 12 years old.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.870
When I started writing
songs I was 18.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.670
And the 18-year-old
version of me,

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:16.960
compared to 44 version of me
is very different, I hope.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.792
And there's lots of
mistakes I've made,

00:45:18.792 --> 00:45:21.000
and lots of things I've
done, which are good and bad,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.970
and all the rest of it.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.680
And you have to deal with
it in different ways.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.900
So I think it's, for
me, personally, it's

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.150
like a manifestation
of stuff that's

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:33.392
inside me that has to come out.

00:45:33.392 --> 00:45:35.100
But when it comes to
song mix, and music,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.750
and all that sort of
stuff, I take inspiration

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:37.417
from everything.

00:45:37.417 --> 00:45:43.350
I listen to lots of stuff from
films, actually, sometimes.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.340
I mean, when I was
younger, a lot of it

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.323
was conversations, a
lot of people talking,

00:45:47.323 --> 00:45:49.740
and I would take things from
conversations, like literally

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.940
live actual conversations.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.650
And kind of turn them into
songs and stuff like that.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.200
And then people would come up
to me in the workman's club

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.150
when I'd go home, and start
telling me their life story

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:58.500
hoping I would put into a song.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.720
But start the conversation
with, don't put this

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.225
into a song, but--

00:46:02.225 --> 00:46:03.600
and then they
would tell me that.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.710
So that happens a
lot, happened a lot.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.460
GETHIN JONES: It's
true, though, isn't it?

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.550
You're not allowed to
fail anymore, especially--

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:11.300
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:11.950
GETHIN JONES: --media.

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.810
And I suppose Google's
really good for it,

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.430
because you were
able to establish,

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.820
and so are you--
you're allowed to fail.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.730
And if you don't fail,
how do you learn?

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.940
KELLY JONES: Yeah.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.000
GETHIN JONES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.167
KELLY JONES: Well, I think--

00:46:22.167 --> 00:46:25.110
no, I think you have to--

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.360
going back to when, like we
did that David Bowie tour,

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.100
we watched him do a
different show every night.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.558
When he's in middle
America, he was

00:46:30.558 --> 00:46:32.280
doing a very different
show, to where

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.988
he's doing when he
was on the east coast,

00:46:33.988 --> 00:46:35.510
and like New York, and stuff.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:36.960
And I learned a lot
from that, because he's

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.293
catering to different people
in different walks of life.

00:46:39.293 --> 00:46:42.780
And you can be indulgent and
selfish, but at the same time,

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.800
you can be very smart
how you do that.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.175
And you do have
to make mistakes.

00:46:47.175 --> 00:46:49.740
Not every record you make
is going to be successful.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.322
And if you don't do the
mistake, then you've

00:46:52.322 --> 00:46:54.280
got nothing to come back
from each time either.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.070
So it's trial and error, really.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.140
I mean, you don't know.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.130
And it's in so many
different people's hands

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.420
when you hand it over.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.980
Some songs you
feel very personal.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.210
You think people
will connect to.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:03.710
They don't.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:06.760
And other times, you just throw
it away, and people love it.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.551
It's a very odd thing, really.

00:47:08.551 --> 00:47:09.343
GETHIN JONES: Yeah.

00:47:09.343 --> 00:47:12.180
I think that's probably--
oh, we should do one more.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.013
Yeah, I don't know--

00:47:13.013 --> 00:47:15.555
Craig will probably really kick
me off when we have to leave.

00:47:15.555 --> 00:47:16.200
Hello.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you so much.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.670
I've really enjoyed
this conversation.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.370
And I love how we've spoken a
lot about you being a family

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:26.280
man and about having drive.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.070
And I just wanted to
know, being so successful,

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:31.680
how are you able to impart
this on your children?

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:36.190
Because obviously they've grown
up with seeing you succeed,

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.870
but they may not necessarily
have seen the back story.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:43.470
How do you still
impart the drive?

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:47.520
KELLY JONES: Well,
I think anybody

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.500
that knows me, and knows
me, and knows my kids,

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:54.120
knows this not really based
around any kind of celebrity

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.530
status or anything like that.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:57.270
We don't kind of live like that.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.050
It's very kind of
grounded upbringing.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.360
GETHIN JONES: They were
like totally fine with me,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:00.902
weren't they?

00:48:00.902 --> 00:48:02.341
It was really surprising.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:09.810
KELLY JONES: And then,
grounding wise, I guess--

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.532
I think all of
this conversation,

00:48:11.532 --> 00:48:12.990
like anything else,
really, I think

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.450
the most thing I've
learned in all of life

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:17.470
really is you have to
be honest with yourself.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.730
And if you put the most honest
version of yourself out there,

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.197
then it becomes its own success.

00:48:23.197 --> 00:48:24.780
Because you're being
real about stuff.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.005
And I think with the kids, I've
always been straight with them.

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:29.880
I've always told them
what they want to know.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:33.300
And I've always told them
what's going on, really.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:38.560
And I think even today,
I told them to walk,

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.460
to come to see me, to get
the taxi, to come to here.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.800
And then, they split up.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.620
One called the bus.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.860
And the whole point of the walk
was to get a bit of fresh air,

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.985
because it was a sunny day.

00:48:47.985 --> 00:48:52.450
So we had a bit of
a moment about that.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:54.820
But it was that, but then it
turns into a funny moment.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:55.778
Because we have a line.

00:48:55.778 --> 00:48:57.690
We know when they'll
apologize, and I'll

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:58.800
apologize if I'm wrong.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.610
And then we'll have
a crack about it.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.320
But I think the difference
between my generation growing

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.930
up and theirs, is that when
your parents would give you

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.810
a bollocking when you were a
kid, and then they'd walk off,

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:11.500
you didn't quite know why.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.273
But now, I'll give
them a bollocking,

00:49:14.273 --> 00:49:15.690
but then I'll
explain to them why.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.646
And then we'll have
a chat about that.

00:49:17.646 --> 00:49:22.230
And look, it's not perfect
by any way or means.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.447
I've never brought up a
14-year-old girl before,

00:49:24.447 --> 00:49:26.280
or a 12-year-old girl,
or a 3-year-old girl.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.880
I'm learning how to do it.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.457
So each time it happens,
I'll kick myself to death

00:49:31.457 --> 00:49:33.290
when I go to bed, because
I've messed it up,

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:34.915
or I haven't done it
right or whatever.

00:49:34.915 --> 00:49:37.293
And then my wife
will say, you're

00:49:37.293 --> 00:49:38.960
being ridiculous and
all the rest of it.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.700
But that's the way I am.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.568
I over-think pretty
much everything.

00:49:43.568 --> 00:49:46.110
GETHIN JONES: And then write it
down and make loads of money.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:48.390
KELLY JONES: And then
make a song, yeah.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.830
Write it down, make some money,
and then they take it all.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.037
It's a funny circle, really.

00:49:53.037 --> 00:49:54.120
GETHIN JONES: Full circle.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.074
Which is probably the perfect
way to finish things off,

00:49:57.074 --> 00:49:58.690
I think.

00:49:58.690 --> 00:49:59.190
I think so.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.990
Listen, Kelly,
thank you so much.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.470
KELLY JONES: Cheers, mate.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.887
GETHIN JONES: Thank
you very much.

00:50:02.887 --> 00:50:04.650
Ladies and gents, Kelly Jones.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.800
[APPLAUSE]
