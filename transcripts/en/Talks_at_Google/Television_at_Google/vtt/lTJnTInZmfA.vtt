DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi
everyone Hi everyone.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.620
Welcome to Talk at Google.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.261
My name's Dana
Han-Klein, and today it

00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.010
is my pleasure to
welcome some of the cast

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.841
and the executive
producer of "Code Black."

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:18.966
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: Hi.

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:19.402
MELANIE CHANDRA: Hi.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:20.370
HARRY FORD: Hi.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.540
RYAN MCGARRY: Hi guys.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.860
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So "Code
Black"-- gritty, gross,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.210
awesome.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.950
Ryan, did you want
to tell us about what

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.000
inspired this in your journey,
and how this became, now,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.839
a television show?

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:35.630
RYAN MCGARRY: Yeah.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.770
I was on day one of a medical
school rotation at the LA

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.780
County Hospital.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.020
And I was in this very
special trauma bay.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.171
And I thought, within
about 30 seconds, I'm like,

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.670
I don't think America's ever
seen anything like this before.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.000
Every five seconds, there's
every aspect of human drama

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.230
that's coming in here--
life, death, first chances,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.940
second chances, last chances.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.780
I mean, it's totally phenomenal.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.230
And there was no shortage
of characters in the doctors

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.319
and nurses who gave that care.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:04.569
And I thought, this is a film.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.360
This is going to be a film.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.880
And I'd always wanted to combine
storytelling and medicine.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.634
And so I found myself
with a documentary

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:13.300
that long story short, went into
the festivals and the theaters.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.250
And now is the premise
for this incredible show

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.044
with these incredible cast.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:18.960
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Right.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.290
Can you also explain what
a code black is for those

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.969
who are not in the know yet?

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:23.760
RYAN MCGARRY: Yeah.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.730
So a code block is, technically,
an internal disaster.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.100
And some hospitals call
it something different .

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.440
On our show, a code block
means that there is basically

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.650
an influx of patients that's
so great that there aren't

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.870
enough resources to treat them.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.040
But I think what the
show really is about,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.590
is it's really sort of
putting you as the viewer

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.070
into the co-pilot
seat as a new doctor,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.470
basically going along with
these guys on their shift.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.400
It's breathless.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.500
It's breathtaking.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.750
I think you kind of sweat
through the episode at times

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.940
because it's so intense.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.750
And I think you're going to end
the show feeling like OK, that

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.015
was an experience.

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:01.890
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.660
I think it was great that
you guys didn't shy away

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.199
from-- hospitals get
glamorized a lot I feel like.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.490
And this was very
gory and visceral.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.960
And so for you guys,
how has this experience

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.210
been as actors, kind of
being put in the set.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.720
My understanding is that
some of the background

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.554
cast members are
actual doctors as well.

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:24.470
MELANIE CHANDRA: Sure.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.470
So we wanted to get the
hospital environment

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.800
as real as possible.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.390
It was actually mirrored
after LA County Hospital.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.900
So even if you opened drawers,
you opened the refrigerator,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.440
you have all these gross
things and posters peeling off.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.050
So it's really
gritty and rustic.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.070
And yeah, we have hundreds
of extra on set every day.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.211
So even if you're
just doing a scene,

00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:47.710
and there's just one gurney and
a couple nurses and doctors,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.750
you still have hundreds
of patients and doctors

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.370
roaming back and forth.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.580
And they've hired real
medical personnel and staff

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.500
to be those background actors
to create that real environment.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.000
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Yeah, I mean

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.010
it's kind of crazy
at the end of a day

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.940
because we are surrounded with
so many extras and the set.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.190
We shot the first episode--
which you saw-- on location.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.880
So that was actually
in an actual hospital

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.230
that Ryan was referring to.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.170
So that was crazy because
you feel like you spend

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.880
16 hours in an emergency room.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.840
And you really did feel,
like a lot of times,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.070
I think we had to go
home and remind ourselves

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.210
that we didn't just save lives.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.830
Because it really feels
like that when you're in it,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.329
you know?

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.500
HARRY FORD: Louis calls
it medical NASCAR.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.440
And his running joke is, at
any given moment he'll say,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.660
I just show up for a shift.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.630
And I think it does feel like--
as much as laypeople can--

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.200
that we're showing
up for a shift,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.270
hopefully to tell the
real heroes' stories,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.447
which is Ryan and these other
nurses and doctors that we met.

00:03:48.447 --> 00:03:50.530
RYAN MCGARRY: And I think
we, on the creative side

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.160
of the process, I think we felt
that a lot of medical dramas,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.917
the hospital sort of looks
like this incredible office.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.500
Which is not true
to real life, right?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.340
I mean, I feel like if your
hospital looks like a Google

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.380
office, we've either come
a long way in this country

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.070
or the miracle health care.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.020
HARRY FORD: And I
want to be a doctor.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.440
RYAN MCGARRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.810
Or we're not being authentic.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.530
And so I think we
went to great strides

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.700
to make the focus of
the show, interestingly,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.242
not about medical
technology, not

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:17.700
about touch screens and all
these futuristic things that we

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.200
see in medical shows
that in some ways

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.116
sort of take the doctor
away from the patient.

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:22.890
We were all about the
touch of it, really

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.610
that moment of
having to connect.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN: My understanding
is that you guys went

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.870
through a medical boot Camp

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.703
HARRY FORD: Oh yeah.

00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:29.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
What was that like?

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.790
HARRY FORD: I'm certified now.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.920
I have offices hours
on the weekends.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.440
MELANIE CHANDRA:
Ryan, didn't you

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.898
say we have enough hours of
training that we could actually

00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:37.740
be EMTs?

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.219
RYAN MCGARRY: Yeah,
at this point--

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:40.760
MELANIE CHANDRA:
Which is just scary.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.218
RYAN MCGARRY: --and I'm not
talking about just on set time,

00:04:43.218 --> 00:04:45.500
but the amount of time
that these guys have

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.560
spent as far as their actual
medical hands on training.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560
At this point, they'd be
equivalent in the state

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.189
of California to
EMTs, and soon would

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.980
be on their way to
paramedic level training

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.900
as far as hours spent.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.730
HARRY FORD: Holy cow.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.380
RYAN MCGARRY: And
it's really true.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.320
I mean, we go to great
lengths on the show

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.227
to portray to the public
the real way to do CPR.

00:05:02.227 --> 00:05:03.810
So on medical dramas,
you'll see a lot

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.770
of this, which is all in
the elbows and doesn't work.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.950
The right way is in the
shoulders and using your back.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.500
And if it's working,
well you guys

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.940
know, it cracks people's chests.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.150
So we have to put protective
plates over our actors

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.900
who are the patients,
which is incredible.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.360
HARRY FORD: We had a rehearsal
today right before we came.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.010
I was with Raza, and he
and I found ourselves

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.800
going, oh right.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.995
If this is the case, if
the blood pressure's this,

00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:27.380
that means there must
be bleeding down low.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.140
And if that means, that's
why the heart is slowed down.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.400
And somebody just looked
at us and was like what?

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.230
You guys are not doctors.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.730
But you do.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.170
You find yourself wanting
to understand the medicine

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.730
because it informs the thinking.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.438
You know, it informs
the thinking and how

00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:43.390
you are, and authenticity.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.010
I think that's a
big focus for us.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.510
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
It's very method.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.630
It is, which is
wonderful to see.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.055
It's not just this kind
of, oh, I'm showing up

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.720
and I'm saving the day, and
I've solved it with a diagnosis

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.227
that Sherlock Holmes did.

00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:02.060
MELANIE CHANDRA: And
we also did ride alongs

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.530
with ER doctors at night just
to talk to the residents,

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.480
talk to the nurses,
talk to the staff,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.081
and just understand the
dynamics and some of the issues

00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:10.580
they face.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.054
And I don't know, it was really,
really informative for me.

00:06:13.054 --> 00:06:14.470
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
I think we

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.760
got the sense of their
attitudes, especially.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.960
Because you know, I
think hopefully what

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.435
we brought is a different
flavor of characters

00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:24.130
that you normally wouldn't
think would be doctors.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.389
And they are.

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.930
And that's what you
see in real life.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.070
You go in an emergency
room, and your doctor

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.530
doesn't look like a doctor.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.240
He looks like a person,
because he is a person, or she.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.850
And I think that was
really important to us.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.110
And I think one thing
with the authenticity

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.200
thing, the closer we could
come to portraying something

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.210
that you would find in
any urban hospital ER,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.900
the more we're hoping
the general public

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.590
would resonate with them and
their experiences in there.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.420
Because I think everyone's
had a traumatic experience

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.810
in their life where they've
gone to the hospital.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.310
And they've been
in the waiting room

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.450
when someone who is just
a wreck rolls through

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.180
on a gurney from a
massive car accident.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.610
And that feeling of when your
hair goes stands on its end,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.800
and you're like oh wow,
stuff's getting real.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.009
That's what we try to create.

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.383
DANA HAN-KLEIN: What's one of
the most interesting things

00:07:12.383 --> 00:07:15.060
you've learned from kind of
interacting with these other?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.601
I mean obviously,
you work with Ryan,

00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:19.450
but there's probably
a difference.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.510
MELANIE CHANDRA: Well,
throughout the series,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.120
sometimes you can't
save a patient's life.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.600
So one of the first questions
I asked a fourth year

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.580
resident was, can you tell
me about the first time

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.500
a patient has died on you?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.300
And sometimes you
see doctors as very,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.130
they've put up these
barriers because they

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.160
have to do their job.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.960
But I could just
see in her eyes when

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.220
she was telling this story that
it still deeply affected her.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.692
And so as actors, it's
all about the empathy,

00:07:44.692 --> 00:07:45.900
but still being professional.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.650
And so it's great to see that
human connection very much

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.360
exists and is alive
in these people.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.330
HARRY FORD: Yeah, I struggle
with the, I would say,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.810
requirement to
compartmentalise how you feel

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.560
vs what you observe.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.740
And Ryan has a great story
that I'll let him tell.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.340
But there are moments where
your humanity wants to lead you.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.100
And the minute that
happens, you're compromised.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.920
And as Harry, I find myself
going, this is impossible.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.460
I cannot ignore such and
such and such and such.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.799
And so I think leading
with the observation,

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:28.340
and the information,
and the science,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.950
and the technology is
an extraordinary thing.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.765
Because it's backwards to me.

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:36.390
Especially at Google,
I go I don't even

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.929
know how to use a phone.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.120
That kind of thing,
it's all foreign to me.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.620
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: We do
have real ultrasound machines

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.119
on set.

00:08:44.119 --> 00:08:49.100
So when we put an ultrasound
wand to someone chest,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.530
we see what's inside, like
actually, a lot of time.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.220
If you were here,
I'd be like whomp.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.720
And you can see it
up on the screen.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.361
So it's cool.

00:08:55.361 --> 00:08:56.610
I mean, I think we found out--

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.810
HARRY FORD: And you
learned not to comment

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.257
because you have no idea what--

00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:00.090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.990
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Congratulations on your--

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.510
RYAN MCGARRY: You never know.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.794
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
What's that big white blob?

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:05.210
MELANIE CHANDRA:
I think even when

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.800
we're taking people's
blood pressure,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.184
the cuffs, those are real too.

00:09:08.184 --> 00:09:09.850
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Of course, yeah.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.558
MELANIE CHANDRA: We
had this like patient

00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:12.850
who was an extra on set.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.100
And when they knew the camera
was going to be on them,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.170
their blood pressure
would keep spiking.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.662
So we actually had to
fake the monitor because--

00:09:19.662 --> 00:09:21.370
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
We couldn't play.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.830
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hey, I get
nervous around doctors.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.770
That happens to me.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.270
So clearly this
person was very much

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.314
actually in the
moment with you guys.

00:09:27.314 --> 00:09:29.230
It sounds like that leads
to a lot of mischief

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.442
though, having actual
equipment on set.

00:09:31.442 --> 00:09:33.650
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Mischief on "Code Black" set?

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.150
No-- no.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.354
DANA HAN-KLEIN: None
whatsoever, ever.

00:09:37.354 --> 00:09:39.520
Well, let's talk about your
characters for a moment.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.177
Because it's one, great to see a
nice and diverse cast up there.

00:09:44.177 --> 00:09:46.010
It's nice to see a lot
of women leads, which

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.010
is nice and
representative I think

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.420
of more of our actual
medical profession.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.510
I'm going to start
with you Harry.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.487
Your character goes
through something,

00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:57.570
I feel like at least having
watched pilot, that we

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.770
experience a lot of Google.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.150
It's imposter syndrome.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.728
HARRY FORD: Oh, that's
what we call it, yeah.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:06.590
He, yes-- yes.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.204
And I the actor am
waiting for someone

00:10:08.204 --> 00:10:09.620
to come and tap
me on the shoulder

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.029
and say OK, get out of here.

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:12.320
You slipped through the cracks.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.510
And I think, luckily, I
have that track in the show.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.670
I often joke I'm playing
Ryan, and he hates that.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.260
But it's just--

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.890
RYAN MCGARRY: It's
completely baseless.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.070
HARRY FORD: It's because
I'm not as pretty as he is.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.861
And I'm like look, give
me a little credit.

00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:28.510
But I feel like Angus's struggle
is a lot of people's, which

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.320
is he has the information.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.570
He has the passion.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.760
He knows what to do.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.270
But he doesn't have the
courage and the bravery

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.880
to find his voice
to speak his truth.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.450
And in that sense, I think
it's a universal problem.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.140
But it's definitely
imposter syndrome.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.820
And I come from a long line of
successful people in medicine.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.736
So it's also this--

00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:52.610
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You've
been researching this.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.860
HARRY FORD: External pressure.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.990
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Melanie,
so your character

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.430
is one who doesn't necessarily
have imposter syndrome.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.887
She knows what she's doing
but isn't really, at least

00:11:03.887 --> 00:11:05.970
in the first episode,
hasn't been given the chance

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.600
to kind of show her stuff.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.209
But one thing I love is,
instead of withholding

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:11.750
this information,
lives are at stake.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.740
So she's going to feed
it to a character who

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.610
is going to use it.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.160
But where is something you'd
like to see your character grow

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.744
to with that?

00:11:19.744 --> 00:11:20.660
MELANIE CHANDRA: Sure.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.135
So yeah, in the pilot, you
see that she's very smart.

00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:25.260
She knows what she's doing.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.220
She's very experienced.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.940
And she just wants to
prove yourself, right?

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.960
And she's just got
a great degree.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.530
You find out she
went to Stanford.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.110
And she's very well educated.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.920
But I think she's learning
to not always follow

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.950
the rules when a patient's
life is at stake.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.440
I think she is kind
of the know it all,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.420
and she's always
played by the books.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.740
And so I think it's a matter
of her coming out of her shell.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.200
What you also learn about
her-- and this is not a spoiler

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.440
by any means-- but
she's also a lesbian.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.140
So what it means to be-- first
and foremost, she's a doctor.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.720
But then she's also
this-- she's very

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.250
confident about her sexuality.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.090
And I think she helps bring up
the morale with the group too.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.930
So she's not just, I'm going
to stay in my own world.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.610
She wants the team to win.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:16.300
And I think that's a really
inspiring aspect about her.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.210
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And then
your character, Ben, is a--

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.510
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: Dick?

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.330
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That was
actually in my notes.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.550
I didn't want to say it that
way, but I was like, he is--

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.640
but I was watching the episode--

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.440
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
He's so likable.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.148
DANA HAN-KLEIN: --rough
around the edges.

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:29.570
Let's go rough around the edges.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.278
HARRY FORD: Ryan just
said Ben plays him.

00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:34.370
RYAN MCGARRY: Yeah, can
we go to a close up here.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.310
Right here, close up right here.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.470
Angus Leighton is not
Ryan McGarry in real life.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.810
It is a baseless claim.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.380
I just want to put it out there
to the interwebs in case that

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.220
happens again.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.299
Now however, Mario
Savetti may be.

00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:49.840
I don't know.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.880
There might be some
similarities here.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.910
He's jacked, good
looking dude over there.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.590
I don't know.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.614
I'm just saying.

00:12:55.614 --> 00:12:56.280
He's aggressive.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.359
He gets after the cases.

00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:57.900
I don't know.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.750
There might be some--

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.083
HARRY FORD: I'm going to be
America's sweetheart though,

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:02.887
so you better back
that talk back.

00:13:02.887 --> 00:13:04.720
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You
just said, he can split.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.080
That's kind of the joy of being
an EP is that you get to be

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.780
like, you're both my character.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.000
HARRY FORD: No, he's like 0%.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.910
RYAN MCGARRY: 0%
American and world.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:11.210
HARRY FORD: Great.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.960
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
You heard it here.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.334
HARRY FORD: Yeah,
what a charmer.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:14.449
What a charmer.

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:16.990
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So what's that
additional responsibility like

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.782
then, playing the--

00:13:17.782 --> 00:13:19.614
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Playing the bad boy?

00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:20.540
I guess it's fun.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.264
It's nice to not have
to apologize for things

00:13:25.264 --> 00:13:26.930
that your character
doesn't feel like he

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.190
should have to apologize for.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.500
And I think it
gives me somewhere

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.690
to go as far as an actor
and playing an overall arc.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.290
I think obviously
there's going to be

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.610
some reasons why Mario is a
little confident and a little

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.840
cocky.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.500
And I think hopefully
you'll see that

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.210
throughout the first
season, kind of learn

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.730
some lessons along
the way, and hopefully

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.280
be a better doctor for it.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.180
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And become
this super likable teddy bear.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.977
But it's great.

00:13:58.977 --> 00:14:00.810
Sometimes we all just
want to say the things

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.077
that-- we don't want a filter.

00:14:02.077 --> 00:14:04.160
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: I
mean, that's very human.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.701
I mean, I think
Mario says the things

00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:08.522
that a lot people say behind the
doors or behind people's backs.

00:14:08.522 --> 00:14:09.980
And I think there's
something to be

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.688
said about a character
that is just going

00:14:11.688 --> 00:14:14.112
to say it to someone's face.

00:14:14.112 --> 00:14:15.695
Listen, you're 10
years older than me.

00:14:15.695 --> 00:14:16.720
That's what it is.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.840
I mean, you're not, but
I think in the pilot

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.052
when he gives Krista's
character shit, that's

00:14:24.052 --> 00:14:25.010
what he's referring to.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:25.980
I can say shit, right?

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.320
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah, totally.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.720
HARRY FORD: Well
said Ryan, well said.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.570
RYAN MCGARRY: What's
weird is some people

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.130
stop me in the street.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.120
They're like, you look
like Ben Hollingsworth.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.660
I'm like, I know.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.160
It's weird.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.140
I don't know, I get that a lot.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.960
MELANIE CHANDRA: They have
a very similar jaw lines.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.840
RYAN MCGARRY: It's really
yeah, that jaw line.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:34.980
HARRY FORD: That happens a lot.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.560
RYAN MCGARRY: It's really weird.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.290
HARRY FORD: That
happens all the time.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.356
RYAN MCGARRY: They're like
yeah, look at those arms dude.

00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:39.522
HARRY FORD: Yeah, you can
hardly go down the street.

00:14:39.522 --> 00:14:40.740
That's what I heard.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.810
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Ryan, was
there a lot of oversight

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.500
into the casting
of Ben on this one?

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.304
Were you like--

00:14:44.304 --> 00:14:45.345
HARRY FORD: Well clearly.

00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:47.630
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
--I need it to be.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.830
HARRY FORD: Golly.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.540
This has been very
informative, Dana.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.245
I'm really glad we're on.

00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:54.620
This has been
really informative.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.165
DANA HAN KLEIN: This is
more of a psychological talk

00:14:55.165 --> 00:14:56.900
at this point.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.400
We're diving deep.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.290
So I think to me, one of
the things about ER doctors

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.386
is there's this sort of quality
and maybe craziness that

00:15:06.386 --> 00:15:08.010
sets them apart, and
like a willingness

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:13.870
to jump into a situation that
maybe-- all doctors provide

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.140
wonderful valuable services.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.060
But there is a certain
kind of heroic nature

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:22.780
to being an ER doctor where you
are in the grind and the gunk.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.810
What's something that you are
all inspired by in that role?

00:15:29.022 --> 00:15:30.980
HARRY FORD: Within the
first two or three days,

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.470
we were on set for the pilot.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.140
We ran into a number of doctors
that had worked with Ryan,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.269
or that had supervised
Ryan, and nurses

00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:41.310
that had worked with him.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.170
And every one of
them was completely

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.972
moved to tears at saying, thank
you for telling our story.

00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:48.680
And we can't tell you
how grateful we are

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.930
that you're giving us a voice.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:54.410
And that, for me, I just keep
coming back to that and going,

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.125
that's my goal.

00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:56.750
So I think in terms
of the authenticity

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.840
and the medical NASCAR and all
that, at the end of the day,

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.390
it's to give voice to
people who are the heroes.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.240
They're doing the real stuff.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.442
And for me, there is an
adrenaline thing, because I go,

00:16:07.442 --> 00:16:09.650
you're not a podiatrist--
no offense to podiatrists--

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.650
but you know, it's
not about hurt feet.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.890
It's about, oftentimes,
what, two minutes?

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.240
RYAN MCGARRY: This guy
in row three is pissed.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.821
Sorry man.

00:16:18.821 --> 00:16:19.570
HARRY FORD: Sorry.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:20.366
Sorry about that.

00:16:20.366 --> 00:16:21.740
I bet you're a
great foot doctor.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.448
You know, her shoe
broke on the way over.

00:16:23.448 --> 00:16:24.580
Maybe you can help her.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.850
But I think there is
something to them.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.770
Because I'd look at it
and go, this is insane.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.070
You people are crazy.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.249
And they love 24 hour shifts.

00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:38.290
RYAN MCGARRY: Well I don't
know about love, but--

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.480
HARRY FORD: Well no, but
they're like, yeah man,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.590
you're on that's 16th hour.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.390
You don't know
what you're doing.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.440
But it's great to get in there.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.481
And you're just like, what
are you talking about?

00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:45.290
This is amazing.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.748
RYAN MCGARRY: I'd
love it if we had

00:16:46.748 --> 00:16:48.590
one of those Google kitchens.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.050
We wouldn't be seeing patients.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.150
We'd just be in that
kitchen the whole time.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.376
HARRY FORD: And that hammock.

00:16:52.376 --> 00:16:54.000
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Are we 150 feet

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.675
away from food right now?

00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:57.800
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We're about
50 feet away from food.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.341
HARRY FORD: Of course
they know that.

00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:00.430
That's amazing.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.560
Are we 100 feet?

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.420
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
I think we're close.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.210
I can see food.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.740
HARRY FORD: Yeah, there's
a coffee bar right there.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.790
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
It's pretty good.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.250
MELANIE CHANDRA: One of
things I'm inspired by--

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.333
HARRY FORD: Sorry Melanie.

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:09.780
MELANIE CHANDRA: Oh sorry.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.845
HARRY FORD: She's
bringing us back here.

00:17:10.845 --> 00:17:11.980
MELANIE CHANDRA: I
actually really like

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.339
those cookies that were out
there in the coffee area.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.130
HARRY FORD: Oatmeal raisin.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.755
MELANIE CHANDRA: Did
you know-- I mean,

00:17:16.755 --> 00:17:19.620
you guys know-- but you can
just lift up the whole shield

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.690
and you can just
take the cookies.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.119
HARRY FORD: You don't even
have to swipe your phone.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.952
MELANIE CHANDRA: You
don't have to ask them.

00:17:24.952 --> 00:17:27.400
And that's just so
bizarre and amazing to me.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.400
HARRY FORD: I feel like
I was stealing actually.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.040
MELANIE CHANDRA: Yeah, me too.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.619
HARRY FORD: Do they
notice I've taken three?

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.660
MELANIE CHANDRA: But going
back to your question,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.630
one of the things I'm inspired--

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.016
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
I was wondering what

00:17:37.016 --> 00:17:39.140
that bulge was in your pocket.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.770
Right there.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.380
MELANIE CHANDRA: Good
thing I don't have pockets,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.170
because that would be dangerous.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.640
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: So
we're allowed to be like that?

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.530
HARRY FORD: So
Google, thank you.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.410
We had such a nice time here.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.760
So we're going--

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.885
RYAN MCGARRY: Check please.

00:17:49.885 --> 00:17:51.843
MELANIE CHANDRA: Today,
everyone is like, where

00:17:51.843 --> 00:17:53.380
did all the cookies go?

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.700
He's low in cookies.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.730
But no, Ryan has this
really inspiring story

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.080
about that person
at the airport who

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.630
was basically on death's bed.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.650
And you realize some
of these ER doctors,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.710
when they don't have
family or friends around,

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.030
are their last point of contact.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.130
And that last point of contact
that can either save their life

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.140
or be there when
their life ends.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.270
And I don't know if you
want to tell this story,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.580
but I just love this story.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.288
RYAN MCGARRY: Yeah,
we always say there's

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:22.640
a weird intimacy to this world.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.580
And for what it is, it's
kind of like a blue collar

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:32.940
medicine in that we're often on
shifts no one wants to be on.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.840
We're often the only
doctor in the hospital

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.809
if it's a smaller
community hospital

00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:38.100
on a holiday and a night shift.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.910
And so there are certain
elements of course

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.076
that are not very glamorous.

00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:45.420
But there is a weird intimacy
in that when someone comes in,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.359
you may be the very last
person they ever make contact

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:50.150
with in this world.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.070
And it may be one of their
worst days of their life,

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.360
or potentially their best.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.442
But you don't know them.

00:18:55.442 --> 00:18:56.900
And it may even be
something minor.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.680
I mean, it's not uncommon to
literally go hey, how are you.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.580
I'm Dr. McGarry.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.080
And 30 seconds later, and how
many sexual partners have you

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.580
had?

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.832
It's insane questions that
you would never ask someone

00:19:07.832 --> 00:19:09.290
in the general
public, but you need

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.140
to know these things
to grasp their problem

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.080
in an efficient way.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.980
But I think the story these
guys are talking about,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.340
which coincidentally happened
on one of my first flight

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.450
out to LA from New York
where I was practicing

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.700
for a development meeting,
but I'm at LAX baggage claim

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.510
at the Starbucks.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.397
And I get this tap
on my shoulder.

00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:30.480
And someone's like hey,
does anyone know CPR here?

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.340
And I'm like, what?

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.730
And sure enough,
in the corner is

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.120
this TSA agent who
looks totally ashen gray

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.000
and has clearly had
a cardiac arrest.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.280
And I go, I know CPR.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.910
And I go over there and I
start to do compressions.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.280
And you know, now
I'm really into it.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.590
And I'm feeling those
ribs crack and watching

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.020
froth gurgle out of his mouth.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.440
And I see his pupils
aren't moving.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.360
And I'm like, this probably
isn't going very well.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.520
And in the interim
while the police

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.830
are going to get the shock
device-- which by the way,

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.470
definitely can save lives.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.540
So always think of that if
you're in the situation.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.630
I see his cell phone
pop out of his pocket,

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.830
and it's those three little dots
that indicate someone's typing.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.680
And it's like, hey, hello,
question mark, question mark.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.530
Are you there?

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.270
Hey man, you there?

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.470
And it was just the
ultimate moment for me

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.720
or reminding myself
of like, my goodness.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.050
No one else in this world
knows this guy has now

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.420
lost the pulse.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.430
This I think was his
girlfriend who was just

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.840
in mid-conversation with him.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.957
And I'm a complete stranger.

00:20:40.957 --> 00:20:42.540
And I know something
she doesn't know.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.990
And this is just unbelievable.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.264
Now, we shocked him and
we got a pulse back.

00:20:47.264 --> 00:20:49.180
And I think he at least
lived to the hospital.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.055
I don't know what happened
to him after that.

00:20:51.055 --> 00:20:53.420
But it's just a
striking example of how

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.950
you don't have to do a lot
of hyperbole or dramatization

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.560
of this world to make
something incredibly intense

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.280
and engaging.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.350
And I think my vouch to anybody
who watches "Code Black"--

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.590
and I think the cast would
agree-- I mean, it's authentic.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.200
What you're seeing is real.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.634
And I don't think anyone's
ever seen him like it before.

00:21:12.634 --> 00:21:14.800
Because we don't have to
Hollywoodize these stories.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.150
I mean, it's just
really intense as is.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.099
And it's totally real.

00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:20.640
HARRY FORD: Something
that I remember

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.560
is when we were
first there, I said,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.940
do you ever feel like
you've lost patients,

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.220
or you can't save them?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.430
And it was Billy.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.310
Billy goes, well, when
they come in, they're dead.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.150
They're already dead.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.260
So you can do no harm, right?

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.130
That's the first
rule is do no harm.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.190
But he's like at the end
of the day, they come in

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.260
and they're dead.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.950
So anything you do is
actually going to help them.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.480
And you know, there
are exceptions.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.850
But I think that's
an extraordinary role

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:53.670
to play in someone's life, that
you're their last best hope,

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:59.320
really, I think, hopefully.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.904
Unless Mario's your doctor, then
it's all downhill from there.

00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.486
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
think it's something

00:22:03.486 --> 00:22:06.150
we all hope for when we
get a doctor that they

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.914
care enough to.

00:22:07.914 --> 00:22:09.080
Your life is in their hands.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.913
MELANIE CHANDRA: Or
that they look like him.

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:13.720
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Or both, you know.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.450
On a slightly lighter
note, if you all

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.390
had to specialize in medicine,
what would you choose?

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.970
You yourself, not
your character's.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.660
Podiatry is an OK answer.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.170
HARRY FORD: Yeah, thank you.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.870
As a young kid, I
always wanted to be

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.520
a cardiovascular
pediatric surgeon.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.354
I know that's so specific,
but I remember it

00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:36.269
because the first time
I went to the hospital,

00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:37.787
I saw these little
bitty preemies

00:22:37.787 --> 00:22:39.370
that were hooked up
to these machines.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.417
And I said I want to be
the guy who does that.

00:22:41.417 --> 00:22:42.750
And I didn't know what it meant.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.750
And then they told me I
was too stupid to do it.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.160
But I always wanted to do that.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.110
And I joke with Ryan that
I think Angus is secretly

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.740
a pediatrician.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.300
But that was not a popular
answer with any of them,

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.160
pediatrics.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.010
Children I think.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.080
MELANIE CHANDRA: I want
to say pediatrics too,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.570
but I'll also say neurology.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.606
I come from a techie background.

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:08.230
And if I could have
gone back in time--

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.899
I actually got my
degree in engineering.

00:23:09.899 --> 00:23:11.690
But if I could have
gone and done it again,

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.750
it would have been in
neuroscience and symbolic

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.830
systems.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.820
Because I'm just--

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.890
HARRY FORD: And what?

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:17.900
MELANIE CHANDRA:
Symbolic systems,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.640
just because I'm just--

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:18.830
HARRY FORD: What does that mean?

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.900
MELANIE CHANDRA: --fascinated by
the way things work, and logic,

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.845
and problem solving, and
just that whole arena.

00:23:25.845 --> 00:23:29.154
HARRY FORD: Wait, no
really, what does-- You all

00:23:29.154 --> 00:23:30.320
know what that means but me?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.045
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You should
Google it, is my answer

00:23:31.045 --> 00:23:31.280
to that.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.270
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Yeah, Google it Harry.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.353
HARRY FORD: Well, I can't.

00:23:33.353 --> 00:23:35.967
I don't have my phone.

00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:37.300
Do you all know what that means?

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:37.940
Everyone?

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.670
You know?

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.450
Is that a Google thing?

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.557
AUDIENCE: Well, I
have an AI background.

00:23:43.557 --> 00:23:44.890
HARRY FORD: What does that mean?

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.913
AUDIENCE: Artificial
intelligence.

00:23:46.913 --> 00:23:48.430
HARRY FORD: I'm an idiot.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.230
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Welcome to Google.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.270
HARRY FORD: I'm a
technological idiot.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.890
RYAN MCGARRY: I'm not joking.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.480
There is a dog back there,
and he knows what it is.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.500
Am I crazy?

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.380
Did a dog just walk back there?

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.880
Are we taking
questions in a second,

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.600
because that dog had a question.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.360
HARRY FORD: The good new is, I'm
not afraid to say I don't know.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.200
I don't know.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.670
RYAN MCGARRY: Oh yeah, look at.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.515
There it is.

00:24:02.515 --> 00:24:03.140
There is a dog.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.557
He knows what that is.

00:24:04.557 --> 00:24:06.640
HARRY FORD: Do you know
the symbolic system thing?

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.400
MELANIE CHANDRA: Yeah,
anyway, so that would

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.339
be my brainiac sort of answer.

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:12.380
I think it's interesting.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.980
HARRY FORD: That was well done.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.230
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: I
think I'm an adrenaline guy.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.150
I would love to work in trauma.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.620
You know, I think the--

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.200
HARRY FORD: Did
you say podiatry?

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.866
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Trauma-- trauma.

00:24:22.866 --> 00:24:24.660
MELANIE CHANDRA:
General and podiatry.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.900
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: I
think the amount of people

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.370
that you get to work
on the front lines

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:33.230
with-- it's a team
environment, which I love.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.900
And the fact that
you have to make

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.750
instinctual-- you have to
make life or death decisions.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.136
And you have to do it
based on your instincts

00:24:42.136 --> 00:24:43.010
and what you believe.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.720
I think that's exciting.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.480
And I would be able to do that
for a very long time, until I

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.279
was worn out.

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.570
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's awesome.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.260
HARRY FORD: No symbolic
systems for you.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.080
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: No.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.330
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Maybe.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.330
Maybe you can retire
to symbolic systems.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.840
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: That and
I can get my like workout just

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.480
doing chest compressions.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:56.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN: There you go.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.350
Correctly.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.270
Doing them correctly.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.450
And then my other question--

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.530
RYAN MCGARRY: Yeah.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.960
I know it's hard to get there.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.576
But keep working.

00:25:04.576 --> 00:25:05.200
Some day buddy.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.230
HARRY FORD: Do you want
to sit closer to him?

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.000
You want to move?

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.690
Golly.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.356
RYAN MCGARRY: Can
that dog come up here?

00:25:12.694 --> 00:25:15.110
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And if you had
to have one of your peers--

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.590
Ryan does not count-- be
your doctor in an emergency

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.077
situation, who would--

00:25:21.077 --> 00:25:23.160
MELANIE CHANDRA: Only like
these three colleagues?

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.270
DANA HAN-KLEIN: No,
anyone on the cast.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.010
Anyone on the cast.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.051
And not an actual doctor.

00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:27.970
HARRY FORD: Well what
about these three?

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.390
MELANIE CHANDRA: Well
there's my answer.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.120
HARRY FORD: None of us?

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.200
MELANIE CHANDRA: No, I
mean, you guys are great.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.870
HARRY FORD: Think about
all of our time together.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.802
I have not been wrong.

00:25:39.802 --> 00:25:41.260
MELANIE CHANDRA:
You have not been.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.430
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
He did win that contest.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.100
HARRY FORD: I have
not been wrong.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.060
I have been bullied,
but I've not been wrong.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.310
MELANIE CHANDRA: His character,
even though he's still

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.100
like learning how
to have conviction,

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.450
he's usually pretty right.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.390
His instincts are right.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.750
But I think Marcia, I
think Marcia Gay Harden

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.350
would actually make a really
great, great, great doctor

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.310
because she's so smart.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.930
She's always on top of it.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.140
But she's so compassionate
at the same time.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.250
I would trust her.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.507
HARRY FORD: I think
I'd want Raza.

00:26:08.507 --> 00:26:09.840
RYAN MCGARRY: I would want Raza.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.540
Yeah.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.690
Marcia-- yeah.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:13.190
It's funny.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:18.110
I think I'd want Marcia to
explain a diagnosis to me.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.220
And then I feel like Raza
can execute and do surgery.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.960
HARRY FORD: I would
want her to explain it.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.501
That's right.

00:26:22.501 --> 00:26:24.180
Not Kevin.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.596
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Not Kevin.

00:26:25.596 --> 00:26:29.030
HARRY FORD: No, not Dr. Taylor.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.532
No.

00:26:29.532 --> 00:26:31.740
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
You're going to die tomorrow.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.270
Deal with it.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.210
Who would I pick
out of the cast?

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.990
I mean, Raza is
the obvious choice

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.300
because he's so-- I think
the accent makes everything.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.130
MELANIE CHANDRA:
Because he's British.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.800
HARRY FORD: I trust him more.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.383
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
You know what?

00:26:47.383 --> 00:26:51.200
I think I would go
with-- I think I would go

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.310
with Luis, just as a curveball.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.850
HARRY FORD: She said doctor.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.220
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Well, you know, she

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.303
said who out of the peers.

00:26:59.674 --> 00:27:02.090
DANA HAN-KLEIN: He thought
outside the box on that answer.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:03.590
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Yeah-- yeah.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.250
Just because I think
that if Luis studied

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.990
his entire life
of being a doctor,

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.064
he would know it inside and out.

00:27:10.064 --> 00:27:11.530
HARRY FORD: But he didn't.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.840
But he didn't.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.710
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Are we assuming

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.730
that we're all doctors in this?

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.370
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yes,
in this scenario.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.100
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: We're
assuming that we all have

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.180
our MDs like actual doctors.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.750
HARRY FORD: Would
you pick me second?

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:23.150
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH: I
wouldn't pick you second.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.810
You would be in the
top five though.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.793
Top four, maybe.

00:27:26.793 --> 00:27:28.043
MELANIE CHANDRA: Out of eight.

00:27:28.043 --> 00:27:29.080
BENJAMIN HOLLINGSWORTH:
Out of eight.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.280
Top 50%, that's not bad.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.619
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Top 50%.

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:33.660
Well, thank you all so
much for joining us today.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.740
"Code Black" is on

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.685
CBS.
