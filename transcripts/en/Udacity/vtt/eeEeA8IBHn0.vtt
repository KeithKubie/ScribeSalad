00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.280
Here's the picture so far.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.430
We have a primal program over
here trying to be maximized, and

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.840
we have a dual program over here
trying to be minimized, and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.920
the obvious question
is do they ever meet?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.450
Well, the answer here is yes,
they always do.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.680
More precisely, we state this as
follows in the duality theorem.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.720
If either the primal problem or
the dual has a finite optimum solution.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.400
Then so does the other.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.870
And, the optimum objective
values are equal.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.009
And if either problem has
an unbounded objective value,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.330
then the other is infeasible.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.600
Note that it is possible for both the
primal and the dual to be infeasible.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.070
We'll start the proof by
showing the second part.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.130
If either problem has
an unbounded objective value,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.870
then the other has no feasible solution.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.790
So we'll suppose that
the primal is unbounded and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.700
that y is feasible for the dual.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.060
Well, by weak duality,
b transpose y must be

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.280
at least c T times x for all feasible x.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.250
But since the primal is bounded,
there has to be an x that's larger.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.310
And that creates a contradiction.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.970
The case where the dual instead of
primal is unbounded is analogous.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.050
Now we turn to the first
part of the proof.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.420
And we want to show that
if either the primal or

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.390
the dual has a finite optimal solution,
then so does the other, and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.519
even more that the optimum
values are equal.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.790
Let's start with the primal
having a finite optimal solution.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.610
Well, that then implies that it has
a finite optimal basic solution

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.680
by the Fundamental Theorem
of Linear Programming.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.820
Let's let the basis be the first
m columns of the matrix a, and

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.720
we'll divide up x and
c in the usual way.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.395
Remember that B stands for basic here.

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:52.220
Recall then from the simplex
algorithm that this vector r D,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.070
which represented the effects of moving
along one of the directions in x D

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.050
had to be non-positive Otherwise
this basic solution wasn't optimal.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.340
Now we're actually going to
construct a solution for the dual.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.260
We'll let y transpose be CB
transpose times B inverse.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.560
And then from the non-positivity of r,
it follows that y transpose D

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.459
has to be at least as
great as CD transpose.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.250
And then we can show feasibility
by arguing that y transpose A, and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.160
we can just rewrite that in
terms of sub matrices B and D.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.250
Just by definition,
the first part is just CB transpose, and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.410
the second part is this expression here,
which again, from our The fact that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.850
our D is non positive
is at most Cb times T.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.240
Well that's just our vector C and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.300
we can see that y does in fact
meet the feasibility constraint.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.460
Moreover, Y transposed B, that is the
objective function for the duel program.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.680
Is equal to CV transpose
times B inverse, times B.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.040
But B inverse B, that's equal to XB, and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.500
C transpose B times XB was the value of
the objective function for the primal.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.060
So these are equal, and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.660
then by weak duality it follows
that our choice of Y is optimal.
