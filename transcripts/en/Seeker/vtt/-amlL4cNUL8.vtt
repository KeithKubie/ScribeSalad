00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.449
Forget the Big Bang… we might have had the
Big Bounce instead!

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.910
The Big Bounce hypothesis says that before
the universe as we know it today had formed,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.820
there was a universe here before us.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.970
It disappeared before we arrived in something
called the Big Crunch.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.350
And from there it created such an immense
amount of density and extreme temperatures

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.470
that it caused an inversion effect meaning
it went from the big crunch right into expansion,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.710
and formed the universe as we know it today--no
point of singularity, no Big Bang required.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.730
This is referred to as the bounce.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.250
If our universe formed through a bounce instead
of a Big Bang then maybe some of what exists

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.290
in the current universe today has already
existed in a previous one!

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.260
The bounce hypothesis arose from our understanding
of black holes.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.200
It all started when physicist James Berdeen,
in 1968, modified the equations about black

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.810
holes in Einstein’s theory of General Relativity.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.079
He stated that the mass of a black hole is
not constant but instead a function based

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.149
off the distance to the center of the black
hole.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.920
This gave birth to the possibility of a new
kind of black hole: named the “regular”

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.749
black hole which does not violate general
relativity…

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.700
The idea has been around for decades.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020
So if there are black holes with no singularity
then maybe there’s no singularity for the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.020
universe either!

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.359
This maybe can be the basis of the Universe
Bounce hypothesis.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.670
Many scientists, like physicist Juliano Cesar
Silva Neves, believe that a black hole isn’t

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.459
identified by its singularity but instead
by its event horizon…. which is the area

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.840
around the black hole, where, once an object
passes by it, it’s doomed for a one way

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.899
ticket into the black hole.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.479
He believes that spacetime acts totally differently
at the event horizon than elsewhere in the

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.479
universe.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.669
And there may be something there that can
explain some of the questions that arise in

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.679
the bounce hypothesis.

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.549
He also believes in the possibility that some
of the black holes in our universe existed

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.909
before the big crunch and transferred over
to our current universe during the inversion

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.119
process.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.930
Does that mean maybe we too existed in another
universe before this one?!?!

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.779
Well, until more research is done this is
just a mere mathematical possibility.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.959
But it’s still pretty amazing to think about…
right?

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.629
Starting in the 1940s scientists have constructed
3 potential outcomes of our universe: The

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:24.870
big crunch, the infinite expansion and the
stagnation expansion.
