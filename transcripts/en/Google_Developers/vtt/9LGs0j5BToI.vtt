Matt Trifino: Assistly turns customer
service into customer wow.

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:09.417
It allows you to manage all your
communications with your customers.

00:00:09.417 --> 00:00:14.000
All-in-one customer service solution
for companies that wanna deliver service

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.625
across email, self-service,
frequently asked questions,

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.625
web, Twitter, Facebook, Live Chat.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.875
All the channels that you might
wanna connect with your customers.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.167
So, we target small- to medium-sized
enterprises who are customer-driven,

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.667
wanna get close to the customers,
wanna deliver customer service at scale.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:30.750
They have a lot of customers.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.000
Their inboxes are overflowing.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.167
And they need a way to deliver
great customer service,

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.500
'cause that's differentiated
for them in their business.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.292
So we provide a tool set
that optimizes those workflows,

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:44.375
allows your entire company to collaborate
on delivering support to those customers

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:48.667
and tracks every customer interaction
in an air-tight case management system.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:49.875
So when every case comes in,

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.417
it's got assigned a ticket.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.042
It's got a status.

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:53.667
It's got an owner. 

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.500
So nothing ever falls through the cracks.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.750
So, we're a business-to-business application.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.792
We sell to businesses.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.500
And so what Google has done is
they've done all the heavy lifting.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.833
They've convinced these organizations
to adopt a cloud as a hundred percent web.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.750
Put your entire business on the web.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.208
And so, it's a great synergy.

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.458
The companies that have already
adopted Google Apps,

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.792
they've made that decision to use it
in their business

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.667
and now they're looking for ways
to leverage that investment.
