00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, let's just take a look at each of the steps one-by-one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This first step "E" can be rewritten by (E) corresponds to rule two.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Must have used rule two to do that. Then here, I just changed the "E" to a "T" that's rule one.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But then down here, I somehow changed this "T" to an "E + E".

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We only have two rules to play with, and only one of them starts with a "T".

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, I must have used rule four to do this, and this tells me exactly what it has to be.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"T" goes "E + E", so it must've been "E + E", and down here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the only thing I've changed is "E" goes to "int".

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's not currently one of my grammar rules. It must have been rule three, "E" goes to "int".

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Remember, every step in the parse tree

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
corresponds to taking some part of the current input and using one of the rewrite rules.
