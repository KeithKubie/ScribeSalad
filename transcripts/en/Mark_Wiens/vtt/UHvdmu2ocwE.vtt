00:00:00.558 --> 00:00:02.752
- My plate of hoy tod is coming along,

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:04.708
and she just added the egg, and I love,

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:08.675
she cracked on the egg, and
then she chucks the eggshell

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.911
into the bucket of eggshells, expertly.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.468
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:17.301
(cheerful instrumental music)

00:00:23.437 --> 00:00:24.871
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.888
with Migrationology.com
in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:29.891
There are many different floating markets

00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:31.535
that you can visit when
you come to Bangkok,

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:33.444
and there are a couple
right within Bangkok,

00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:36.407
I really recommend Khlong
Lat Mayom, by the way,

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:38.572
and then there are also some
really famous floating markets

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:41.514
about an hour and a
1/2 outside of Bangkok,

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:44.238
in a province called Samut Songkhram,

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:46.018
and some of the really
famous floating markets

00:00:46.018 --> 00:00:49.507
like Damnoen Saduak, and
Amphawa floating markets

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.397
are all located there.

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:55.064
But today, my wife and
my sister and my mom,

00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:59.107
and our kids, a couple of our kids,

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:02.532
we are gonna go on a day
trip to Samut Songkhram,

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:06.456
and hopefully go to a couple
of kinda more lesser known

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:09.036
floating markets, so stay
tuned for this video,

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:11.950
some lesser known floating
markets and some delicious food

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.030
coming up.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.712
Are you ready for another road trip, Mika?

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:18.652
(woman singing lullaby)

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:21.697
According to Google
Maps, it's 86 kilometers

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:25.506
from where we're leaving,
and we're in the Bangna area

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:28.416
of Bangkok, and it's gonna
take an hour and 36 minutes

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:29.319
to drive there.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.152
(cheerful instrumental music)

00:01:57.374 --> 00:01:58.603
You know when you're in the countryside

00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:01.232
when the dog just lounges
in the middle of the road

00:02:01.232 --> 00:02:03.986
and you have to go around him.

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:06.869
We are following Google
Maps, and we're now

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.766
on this small little jungle
road, and I'm loving it.

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.327
Oh, this is such a beautiful province,

00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:14.994
I love being around these areas.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.207
Achoo!

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:31.323
We made it, this market is
called Talat Nam Tha Kha,

00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:34.207
and the literal
translation, talat is market

00:02:34.207 --> 00:02:36.953
and then nam is water,
so it's a water market,

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:40.184
and I'm already loving the simple,

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:42.767
kinda slow feel of this market.

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:49.731
When you arrive to this
market, you walk through

00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:52.003
this little entrance
section which is covered,

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.936
and there's some souvenir
shops, and then immediately,

00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:57.178
you get to the floating market section,

00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:00.005
it has such a quiet,
peaceful, nice feel to it,

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.528
there are plenty of boat vendors,

00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:05.232
some of which are selling
ready-to-eat things,

00:03:05.232 --> 00:03:08.232
and then some people who are selling

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:13.530
a variety of different
ingredients, lots of bananas,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.932
some onions and some garlic and shallots,

00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:18.726
and then produce from their gardens,

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:21.543
probably right from their
gardens right at home,

00:03:21.543 --> 00:03:24.387
and they just load
everything up onto their boat

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:27.435
and then come to the market to sell.

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:29.374
But what I really like is how small,

00:03:29.374 --> 00:03:32.231
and how friendly it is so far, and I just,

00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:34.464
actually, I haven't really
walked around much yet,

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.253
but I just came into the market,

00:03:36.253 --> 00:03:38.112
walked up this little bridge so I can just

00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:42.279
kinda get a birds' eye view
of Tha Kha floating market.

00:03:49.142 --> 00:03:53.309
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.181
So far, the ladies selling
things at this market

00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:00.532
are all very friendly, and
they all wanna see Mika.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.977
Looks like they're buying something here.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.477
- Popiah!
- Popiah.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.407
My sister Anyin just got
some fresh spring rolls,

00:04:14.407 --> 00:04:18.324
and they are really hot
and fresh, fried fresh.

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:20.910
Mm!

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.285
Oh yeah!

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:26.016
Filled with mung mee
noodles, and maybe carrots.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.149
Mm, they're good.

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:29.925
Nice and hot still.

00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:32.508
(baby wailing)

00:04:36.952 --> 00:04:40.404
As you're walking along the
edge of the water on the market,

00:04:40.404 --> 00:04:42.034
they have these coconuts set up

00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:44.701
where you can massage your feet.

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:48.862
Kinda go like this, it kinda hurts!

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:56.411
Am I doing it, (speaks
in foreign language).

00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:57.830
(speaks in foreign language)

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.530
It's coconut sugar.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.029
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.274
You can smell it, you can smell it.

00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:06.882
- [Anyin] It's supposed to
be better, so I use that

00:05:06.882 --> 00:05:08.745
instead of regular sugar.

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:10.807
- There's a lot of good
produce at this market,

00:05:10.807 --> 00:05:12.953
and also, you can buy fresh coconut sugar,

00:05:12.953 --> 00:05:16.423
and coconut syrup, and
lots and lots of bananas

00:05:16.423 --> 00:05:17.898
and coconuts.

00:05:17.898 --> 00:05:18.731
Hoy tod.

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:20.842
Yeah.

00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:34.582
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:05:35.764 --> 00:05:38.943
I am squatting down
here on a floating raft,

00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:41.174
and I just ordered
something called hoy tod,

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.271
which is fried oysters with egg,

00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.620
and this is a beautiful stall,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.310
it is an amazing grandmother
who is cooking up,

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.441
and she is using charcoal on a hot plate,

00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:56.608
and adding in the batter,
the oysters, and then egg.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:02.290
Oh, and it's just going up in
a cloud of beautiful smoke.

00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:13.035
My plate of hoy tod is coming along,

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:14.959
and she just added the egg, and I love,

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:19.249
she cracked on the egg, and
then she chucks the eggshell

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:22.431
into the bucket of eggshells, expertly.

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:24.848
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:30.132
Oh, I think that's some lard going in.

00:06:35.783 --> 00:06:39.950
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.489
There are bean sprouts in it, there's egg,

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:54.111
there's the rice flour
batter, as well as oysters,

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:55.663
I asked her, they are oysters,

00:06:55.663 --> 00:06:58.063
and then also bean sprouts and cilantro,

00:06:58.063 --> 00:06:59.021
and then after it was finished,

00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:02.015
she dished it onto a
plate, added some cilantro

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:03.839
and then some pepper.

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:07.589
And I'm sitting down
here with my mom to eat.

00:07:13.974 --> 00:07:14.807
Oh yeah.

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:16.477
It's good.

00:07:17.384 --> 00:07:22.014
Oh, the fresh, crisp bean
sprouts, the oyster in there,

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:25.567
and then like the gooey batter flour.

00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:27.624
As we were sitting eating
that oyster omelet,

00:07:27.624 --> 00:07:30.070
I could smell the smoke
coming down the canal

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.928
from the grilling skewers of
gai ping and maybe moo ping,

00:07:34.928 --> 00:07:36.873
I'm not sure, I think
she mostly has chicken,

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.699
but that sounds delicious right now,

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.607
grilled meat on skewer.

00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:43.721
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:47.221
Okay, how many skewers would you like, ma?

00:07:51.207 --> 00:07:52.790
- [Mom] One or two.

00:08:01.364 --> 00:08:05.531
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:08:09.142 --> 00:08:10.777
- [Mom] Sticky rice.

00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:14.944
(Mark speaking in foreign language)

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:23.235
- We got a full baggy of
grilled chicken, and also tab,

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:27.235
which is liver, and liver's
one of my favorites.

00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:29.778
Oh yeah.

00:08:32.004 --> 00:08:34.986
So creamy, and then it
has a marinade on it,

00:08:34.986 --> 00:08:37.712
so it's a little bit sweet
and a little bit salty

00:08:37.712 --> 00:08:40.143
at the same time, but with a really good,

00:08:40.143 --> 00:08:41.486
smoky flavor to it.

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:45.319
(cheerful instrumental music)

00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:05.979
Oh, thank you!

00:09:13.568 --> 00:09:15.432
I stopped to buy some starfruit,

00:09:15.432 --> 00:09:17.443
starfruit is an excellent fruit,

00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:20.767
not only does it look cool,
but it tastes incredibly good,

00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:24.934
so every opportunity I have
for starfruit, I go for it.

00:09:27.873 --> 00:09:28.706
Mm!

00:09:30.783 --> 00:09:32.033
It is so juicy!

00:09:32.942 --> 00:09:36.766
Oh, that's just an entire
mouthful of starfruit juice.

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:39.224
Oh, that's delicious,
and it's sweet and sour.

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:41.782
The next snack that we
got is called toong tong,

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:45.962
and the literal translation
is a golden little bag,

00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:48.908
or little pocket pouch,
and it's a little wrapper,

00:09:48.908 --> 00:09:51.167
which is wrapped really nicely,

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:53.253
and I think they had a
minced pork version as well,

00:09:53.253 --> 00:09:55.898
but we got the one filled
with corn and then deep-fried,

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:59.398
and this is a little one-bite little gift,

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.808
and you can see on the top,
on the top it's very crispy,

00:10:02.808 --> 00:10:04.029
and then on the bottom is the pouch

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:07.279
where it's wrapped up with the filling.

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:12.244
Mm!

00:10:13.207 --> 00:10:14.259
Oh yeah.

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:18.309
That's like a spring
roll in different shape.

00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:19.463
That's fantastic.

00:10:19.463 --> 00:10:20.963
Oh, that is tasty.

00:10:22.273 --> 00:10:23.211
- Surprisingly good!

00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:24.927
- [Mark] It's more tasty than
I thought it was gonna be.

00:10:24.927 --> 00:10:28.534
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying,
like it was really good!

00:10:28.534 --> 00:10:31.098
- Ying is having a bowl
of kway chap nankon,

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:33.025
which are the rice noodle rolls,

00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:37.559
in like a braised soup,
and I'm having just ba mee,

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:40.703
which are the egg noodles, with pork,

00:10:40.703 --> 00:10:42.724
and there's some pork
meatballs, I think in there,

00:10:42.724 --> 00:10:47.359
and also some daikon, I
think it's daikon radish,

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:49.237
which is also within the soup broth.

00:10:49.237 --> 00:10:51.705
Let me get a bite with some
pork and with some noodles,

00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:55.872
there are also a lot of bean
sprouts in here as well.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.120
Mm!

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.694
Some good black pepper in
there, or maybe white pepper,

00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:09.861
but that's just a simple,
classic bowl of Thai noodles.

00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:11.759
Pork noodles.

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:15.592
(cheerful instrumental music)

00:11:18.164 --> 00:11:22.331
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:28.190
I'm watching them make something

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.079
which is called khao
tom mad, which is rice,

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:32.969
sticky rice mixed in a mixture,

00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:34.629
I think with coconut milk, and then

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:36.894
they add in a banana and
wrap it in a banana leaf,

00:11:36.894 --> 00:11:40.547
and then it's steamed, and
it's a very popular Thai snack,

00:11:40.547 --> 00:11:43.021
but she was telling me
that it's a bolan version,

00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:45.710
it's a traditional version.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.377
Very cool to watch them make it.

00:11:50.414 --> 00:11:51.619
Oh, okay.

00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:53.041
So this is the sticky rice mixture

00:11:53.041 --> 00:11:56.124
that includes sugar and coconut milk.

00:11:57.186 --> 00:12:01.103
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:05.732 --> 00:12:07.510
They are making the khao tom mad

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.269
over a little bit down
there, overlooking the canal,

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:12.028
and then they're selling them right here,

00:12:12.028 --> 00:12:13.464
so I just got some of the khao tom mad

00:12:13.464 --> 00:12:15.543
that they're making freshly right now.

00:12:15.543 --> 00:12:20.360
They're wrapped in doubles,
and you unravel that,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.443
and then you got two banana
leaf-wrapped packets.

00:12:28.472 --> 00:12:31.000
Oh, and you can feel
that stickiness already

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.917
from that coconut milk
and that sugar in there.

00:12:39.357 --> 00:12:40.967
Oh, and what I love about things

00:12:40.967 --> 00:12:42.030
that are cooked in banana leaf

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.972
is you can immediately smell the aroma,

00:12:44.972 --> 00:12:47.469
that banana leaf, it has
such a wonderful aroma.

00:12:47.469 --> 00:12:48.887
The sticky rice just sorta melts

00:12:48.887 --> 00:12:52.054
into that coconut milk and the banana.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.702
Really gooey, sticky rice, and then just

00:12:57.702 --> 00:13:01.285
with a sweet and tart
banana on the inside.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:06.401
This is one of my favorite
Thai traditional desserts.

00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:07.767
You can really taste that banana leaf,

00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:09.800
which the steam embedded into it.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.164
We spent about two hours
walking around this market

00:13:12.164 --> 00:13:15.010
and eating and relaxing,
this is a fantastic

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.924
little floating market, and
I love how it's so quiet

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:21.556
and peaceful and very, very friendly.

00:13:21.556 --> 00:13:24.213
They also offer boat rides,
which would look really,

00:13:24.213 --> 00:13:26.302
really nice, but with the babies,

00:13:26.302 --> 00:13:27.753
I think we're gonna skip the boat ride,

00:13:27.753 --> 00:13:31.242
although if you come here, I
think I would highly recommend

00:13:31.242 --> 00:13:33.510
the opportunity to take a
boat through these canals

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.255
and just relax, that looks really fun.

00:13:36.255 --> 00:13:38.757
And from here, we're gonna go
see another floating market,

00:13:38.757 --> 00:13:40.110
which is not too far away.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.805
Yeah, there's another
floating market about,

00:13:42.805 --> 00:13:45.416
it said about 15 minutes
away that I wanna check out,

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:47.210
so we'll just stop by
there for a little bit

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.360
and see how it is.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.193
(cheerful instrumental music)

00:14:05.654 --> 00:14:07.944
That was an absolutely beautiful drive

00:14:07.944 --> 00:14:09.908
through the coconut trees to get here,

00:14:09.908 --> 00:14:11.859
and that was about a 15 minute drive,

00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:14.681
and this is called Talat Nam Bang Noi,

00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:18.024
and it is right on the
edge of the Mekong River,

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.559
I can see it right up here.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:21.847
(jazzy folk music)
Oh man, at first I thought

00:14:21.847 --> 00:14:25.473
that was a CD playing, that's a live band!

00:14:25.473 --> 00:14:26.306
Fantastic!

00:14:49.603 --> 00:14:51.894
I gotta give it up to the live music,

00:14:51.894 --> 00:14:55.561
that is a highlight of
visiting this market.

00:15:01.474 --> 00:15:03.623
This is a really relaxed
floating market as well,

00:15:03.623 --> 00:15:06.604
but it's right along the Mekong River,

00:15:06.604 --> 00:15:09.669
which is a huge river, and then kind of

00:15:09.669 --> 00:15:13.317
right in the parking lot
on the side of the temple,

00:15:13.317 --> 00:15:14.777
so it's almost like a community,

00:15:14.777 --> 00:15:17.471
it almost has a community
center feel to it.

00:15:17.471 --> 00:15:19.310
The girls and the babies
are walking around

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.657
the market shopping.

00:15:20.657 --> 00:15:22.376
This is a good shopping market,

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:25.972
especially for little
Thai things and souvenirs,

00:15:25.972 --> 00:15:28.465
and so I have taken this
opportunity to sit on the bench

00:15:28.465 --> 00:15:31.658
near the water and eat some mulberries,

00:15:31.658 --> 00:15:34.362
and mulberries are, I
think they're popular

00:15:34.362 --> 00:15:35.921
to eat at this market,
they're kinda famous

00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:37.963
to eat at this market, and I like how

00:15:37.963 --> 00:15:40.779
she has made a mulberry, a little basket

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:42.170
to hold the mulberries in, and then

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.178
put the mulberries inside,
and then she put it

00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:46.011
in a plastic bag, too.

00:15:48.853 --> 00:15:49.730
Oh yeah!

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.349
Mm!

00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:54.447
Oh, that gives you an
immediately burst of sourness,

00:15:54.447 --> 00:15:56.197
before any sweetness.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.193
Mm!

00:16:00.908 --> 00:16:02.257
Those are really good.

00:16:02.257 --> 00:16:06.424
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:16:07.805 --> 00:16:09.124
Mika!

00:16:09.124 --> 00:16:10.082
We're walking around the market,

00:16:10.082 --> 00:16:14.025
and we came back to the car to feed Mika,

00:16:14.025 --> 00:16:17.760
and also, we're eating some
snacks, so I'm gonna try.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.843
This one is khanom gluay, it's a banana

00:16:20.843 --> 00:16:24.492
grilled in a banana leaf, long and skinny.

00:16:24.492 --> 00:16:28.188
Let me break it in half, oh, very sticky.

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:32.105
Loo at that, oh, it's
hot, right off the grill.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.493
Mm!

00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:42.386
Yeah, it's really good.

00:16:42.386 --> 00:16:45.462
It's nice, you can taste the banana like,

00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:48.863
tastes like a dried banana with coconut,

00:16:48.863 --> 00:16:52.188
and then it has like a,
it's almost like caramelized

00:16:52.188 --> 00:16:53.835
on the outside.

00:16:53.835 --> 00:16:54.668
Oh, Mika!

00:16:58.405 --> 00:17:00.349
What I really enjoyed today was visiting

00:17:00.349 --> 00:17:03.637
Talat Nam Tha Kha, that
was the highlight of today.

00:17:03.637 --> 00:17:07.249
It's about an hour and a 1/2
outside of central Bangkok,

00:17:07.249 --> 00:17:08.698
and it's definitely worth the trip,

00:17:08.698 --> 00:17:10.516
that's one of the best
floating markets in Thailand

00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:12.951
that I've been to, I just
enjoyed the whole atmosphere

00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:16.194
of the market, and then
we just kinda stopped here

00:17:16.194 --> 00:17:17.465
just because we were in the area,

00:17:17.465 --> 00:17:19.610
and those mulberries were delicious.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.428
I'm gonna end this video now, it's been a,

00:17:22.428 --> 00:17:24.193
yeah, just a great Bangkok day trip,

00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:26.091
and good to get out of
Bangkok for a little bit,

00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:29.078
and I really love this
Samut Songkhram Province

00:17:29.078 --> 00:17:30.720
in Thailand, and the relaxing markets,

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.313
and the whole feel of the entire province,

00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:34.901
this entire area.

00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:36.952
