00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now you're maybe asking yourself, so what? Who cares about this phase diagram?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You're in for a treat. Notice that when I pick out a point on this circle.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And remember this circle tells us all the locations in what we can call phase space

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is a combination of position in velocity.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
All the locations in phase space where we might find this object. Let's look at this point for example.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, this point corresponds to a position down here and to a velocity over here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, I'm seeing something very fascinating right now.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's just draw a line from the center over to here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's draw a line from the center out to the point we're talking about.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Oh, I think you're seeing it too now. Well, check it out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This point has an angle associated with it. I'm going to call that angle θ.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It has an opposite side and the length of this opposite side

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
well that corresponds to this length over here same as the velocity, V/Vmax.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And this triangle has an adjacent side and this adjacent side corresponds to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the position of the particle or the block at this instant in time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Another great thing is that since we've chosen to write the speeds and positions

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
this ratios of X/Xmax and V/Vmax  this circle has radius 1.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The hypotenuse is just 1. That's such an easy number to deal with.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now, can you figure out a very important equation namely what trigonometric function

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
goes here and which goes here?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'll give you a hint. It's either sine, cosine, or tangent. And it's either sine, cosine, or tangent.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So is X/Xmax the sin θ? The tan θ? Cos? Fill in your answers here and here.
