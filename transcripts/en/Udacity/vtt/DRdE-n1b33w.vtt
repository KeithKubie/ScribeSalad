00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.980
Growth hacking is a major buzz word
in the marketing industry right now.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.220
It's all about growing
your business quickly.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.370
Last lesson,
we spoke about a few examples.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.150
Do things that don't scale.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.740
In the beginning,
you may want to test out postcards or

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.810
door hangers, but that's not something
you're going to want to do when you

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.560
have a million users.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.100
Referral bonuses have helped
many companies achieve success.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.090
People, give ten bucks
to new customers and

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.620
ten bucks to the people
who referred them.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.180
Suggesting followers or

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.759
people who share the app with
is another way to gain users.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.040
With Twitter, they suggested people to
follow their members because they knew

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.460
if people were following and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.510
being followed,
they were more likely to be active.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.300
But let's take a moment
to explore a few more.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.220
&gt;&gt; Take YouTube for example.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.410
When they were first starting out,
they utilized giveaways and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.420
contests to attract new users to
create accounts and upload videos.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.560
They were giving away
an iPod Nano a day.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.670
Remember those?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.280
As we talked about
previously in the course,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.960
they also use partnerships to
help accelerate their business.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.920
Like the one that they did with Myspace.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.060
Now Uber, on the other hand,
did some in person growth hacking.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.590
They teamed up with Google Ventures and
drove around entrepreneurs and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.450
investors for

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.840
free, giving entrepreneurs 15 minutes to
pitch investors an idea during the ride.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.180
This was a great way to get future
influencers talking about their service

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.670
and caring about it.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.200
Now imagine if Mark Zuckerberg, in every
interview he did, told people that he

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.450
got his start in the back seat of his
Uber, rather than in a dorm room.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.640
Uber also teamed up with a northern
California blow dry bar.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.690
Where you get your hair shampooed and
a blow dry.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.880
They offer free rides to all of their
clients that booked a blow out.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.040
This allows them to one, get press,
and two, access another niche market.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.920
And finally, FourSquare let's
you leverage other platforms.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.370
For example, you can post check-ins
to your Facebook timeline for

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.630
other potential users to see.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.190
&gt;&gt; Because growth hacking is so

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.440
popular these days, we can't
cover everything in this course.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.720
However, we've posted links to articles,
if you're interested in learning more

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.580
and reading more examples
of growth hacking.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.220
&gt;&gt; Thinking about a small brand or
a small start up,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.850
it's really important to
embrace grassroots tactics.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.580
Think constant engagement,
think things like giveaways and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.630
contests, anything that can move
the needle in the right direction and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.240
help build your social
media follower base.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.050
It's also important to consider
things like user generated content,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.380
getting great content from your users,
quotes, anything tactical like that can

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.090
really pay of and
help engage with your customer base.
