Welcome to lesson five. In lesson five we're going to

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.330
talk about how to make your website communicate with, not just

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.290
with humans but also with other computers by building what

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.230
we call an API or Application Programming Interface, which is really

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.700
just a fancy way of saying instead of generating HTML

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.820
that we send to browsers that ultimately just get read by

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.990
humans, we're going to send data in formats XML or JSON

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.410
which are similar to html, but are designed to be read

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.390
by computers instead. In this lesson we're going to add a

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.160
feature to ASCIIChan, that will actually allow you to see where

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.690
users are submitting images from, using the Google maps API.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.130
And in the homework for this lesson, we're going to be adding

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.550
the JSON output to your own blog. So if somebody

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.530
wanted to build a service that used some data from your

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.040
blog that you thought was important, they can actually write a

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.330
program to fetch your blog, manipulate the data however they like,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.070
and then build their own web service on top of that, which is actually

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.120
how a lot of the internet works. So, let's go ahead and jump right in.
