00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.067
And, we're going to make a
major shift.

00:00:03.067 --> 00:00:07.588
You're going to feel like this
is a whole different class

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:11.463
compared to what we were talking
about last time,

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:15.580
because were jumping from the
biogeochemical cycles,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.505
or looking at the biosphere as
essentially a large biochemical

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:25.026
machine, to studying individual
populations of organisms,

00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:31.000
and the communities that they
make up when they come together.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.274
So, before we were really
talking about organisms as they

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:38.722
function in the biosphere.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:44.468
Mentally, we're grinding them
all up and thinking of them as a

00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:47.576
collective biochemistry
basically.

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:51.814
And now we are going to stop
grinding them up,

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:56.617
mentally, and think of them as
individual organisms.

00:00:56.617 --> 00:01:01.421
So, the next series of
lectures, we're going to talk

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:05.000
about population ecology.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.925
If you remember the first
lecture I gave we talked about

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:16.851
the hierarchy of organization
within ecological systems,

00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:22.670
and then we are going to talk
about competition between

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.272
organisms with a population,
and between organisms of

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:33.228
different species,
and were going to talk about

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:37.000
predation, and mutualism.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.892
These are all interactions
between organisms that affect

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:45.571
the fitness of organisms.

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.535
And then we'll,
at the end, talk about

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:51.678
community structure.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:57.892
So this is sort of the outline
for the rest of my lectures,

00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:01.000
not for this lecture.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.987
So, today we are going to talk
about properties of populations.

00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:20.670
We're going to analyze how we
measure growth rate,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.645
growth and death in
populations, and this will

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:36.797
include populations that have an
age structure,

00:02:36.797 --> 00:02:43.000
and populations that don't.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.377
And this is all in preparation
for the next lecture where we

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:50.270
will talk about human population
growth.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.870
So, in this field of population
ecology, which is as I told you

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.729
in the first lecture,
and some universities you could

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:03.180
take three courses in population
ecology, and you could get a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.000
Ph.D.
in population ecology.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.054
I mean, this is a whole field
that we're going to cover in two

00:03:11.054 --> 00:03:11.800
lectures.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.439
But what population ecologists
worry about fundamentally,

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.008
well, they don't worry about
it.

00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:23.400
This is what they study,
is what regulates the density

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.642
of populations?

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:29.117
Obviously, it's a function of
how fast they're growing,

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:32.597
the birth rate,
and how fast they're dying,

00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:35.000
the death rate.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.390
But what are the factors that
actually influence those rates?

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.170
Is it competition with other
organisms?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.317
Is it the entire structure of
the community?

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:47.585
Is it the availability of food?

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:51.609
Is it the various abiotic
properties of the environment:

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:52.853
temperature,
etc.?

00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:56.658
So, they analyze these and
basically try to model the

00:03:56.658 --> 00:04:02.000
population growth as a function
of these various parameters.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.033
The other questions they ask,
is how are populations

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:08.485
distributed in the environment?

00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:09.988
Are they clustered?

00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:12.203
Are they evenly distributed?

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:15.841
This has specific meanings
about their ecology.

00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:20.350
And, the other thing that
people are really fascinated by,

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.146
which is a really tough
question, is why are some

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:30.000
species' populations extremely
abundant, while others are rare?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.760
And one of the discussions we
always have in my lab,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.299
we work on an organism that's
extremely abundant,

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:41.133
this prochlorococcus,
which I told you briefly about,

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:44.525
is the most abundant
photosynthetic cell on the

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:45.041
planet.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.391
So, my students tend to keep
saying why is it so successful?

00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.857
And I keep saying,
it's successful but there are

00:04:52.857 --> 00:04:56.543
thousands of other species who
are also successful.

00:04:56.543 --> 00:04:58.903
Abundance does not equal
success.

00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:02.000
Endurance equals success.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.687
If you're here in the next
generation, you're successful.

00:05:07.687 --> 00:05:10.937
If you're not,
if your species is

00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:15.000
disappearing,
then you're not successful.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.789
So, speaking of abundance,
let's talk about how we measure

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.039
abundance, population
ecologists.

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.000
And this is just one example.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.500
Obviously, for microorganisms,
or some microorganisms it's

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.157
really easy because they're tiny
relative to their habitats.

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:42.131
So for the prochlorococcus that
we work on, there are 10^5 cells

00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:43.315
per milliliter.

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:48.052
So, we can go take a milliliter
of water and measure how many

00:05:48.052 --> 00:05:49.000
cells there.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.763
But for some organisms,
larger ones,

00:05:51.763 --> 00:05:55.473
that are widely distributed,
it's not that easy.

00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:58.315
So, one method is mark and
recapture.

00:05:58.315 --> 00:06:04.000
That's used a lot for things
like birds and butterflies.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.992
For a bird, the mark would be
putting a band on the bird.

00:06:08.992 --> 00:06:13.093
For a butterfly,
they often take a magic marker

00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:15.500
and put a mark on the wing.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.441
Well, that's largely what they
do.

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:23.166
You try to mark individuals in
some way that would not

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:27.000
influence their survivorship
rate.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.555
So, if N equals the population
size, that is,

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:34.111
that's our unknown,
what we're going to do is

00:06:34.111 --> 00:06:37.181
capture, say,
for butterflies or moths,

00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:41.626
you use a butterfly net,
or moths you can use a light to

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:45.909
track them; for birds,
you put up these big mist nets.

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.707
They fly into them;
they get tangled up a little

00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:51.969
bit but they don't get hurt.

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.444
Then you band them,
and that we let them go.

00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:59.000
That's the way you mark them.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.471
So, we're going to say n1
equals the total number of

00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:09.024
marked individuals released.

00:07:09.024 --> 00:07:13.338
So you capture them,
you mark them,

00:07:13.338 --> 00:07:17.398
you release them.
n2 is equal to,

00:07:17.398 --> 00:07:24.885
and then you go out sometime
later and you recapture as many

00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:31.864
individuals as you can find,
and this would be the total

00:07:31.864 --> 00:07:37.447
number [SIREN]
that doesn't sound like a fire

00:07:37.447 --> 00:07:41.000
drill, does it?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.927
I assume we're good to go here.

00:07:45.927 --> 00:07:52.284
So, n2 is the total number of
recaptured.

00:07:52.284 --> 00:08:01.662
And we're going to say m2 is
equal to the numbers recaptured

00:08:01.662 --> 00:08:05.000
that are marked.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.147
OK, and then we assume that the
fraction of the recaptured that

00:08:14.147 --> 00:08:22.409
are marked represent the
fraction in the total population

00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:24.770
that was marked.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:32.000
So, we say m2 over n2 is equal
to n1 over N.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.094
And the number that we're
looking for, population size,

00:08:37.094 --> 00:08:40.113
is equal to n1,
n2 divided by m2.

00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:44.075
So, of course,
this assumes that there's no

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:47.849
effect of the marking of the
individuals.

00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:53.603
It assumes that there's no bias
in the trapping for the marked

00:08:53.603 --> 00:08:56.056
or not marked individuals.

00:08:56.056 --> 00:09:02.000
There's all kinds of
assumptions that underlie this.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.624
It's a start for assessing the
population size.

00:09:06.624 --> 00:09:10.846
OK, so how do we measure
population growth?

00:09:10.846 --> 00:09:17.179
We're going to first start with
looking at populations that have

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:18.587
age structure.

00:09:18.587 --> 00:09:24.518
Now, I hope you printed out the
slides that were on the Web,

00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:30.751
because I'm depending on these
overheads a lot for this lecture

00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:36.783
because we wouldn't get through
any of it if I wrote all this

00:09:36.783 --> 00:09:40.000
stuff on the board.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:49.711
So, we're going to talk about
populations that have an age

00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:51.414
structure.

00:09:51.414 --> 00:10:00.103
And the data I'm going to show
you here is for human

00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:03.000
populations.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.733
But this applies to any
population that has differential

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:19.991
birth and death rates as a
function of the age of the

00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:22.055
organism, OK?

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:30.948
So, in these populations if
birth rate and death rate are

00:10:30.948 --> 00:10:40.000
high, the population is
dominated by young people.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:51.475
And, we'll look at this in a
minute.

00:10:51.475 --> 00:11:02.559
And, if B and D are low,
dominated by old people,

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:07.893
or older I should say,
since I now fit into the old

00:11:07.893 --> 00:11:08.853
category.

00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:14.613
OK, so here's a typical
population age distribution for

00:11:14.613 --> 00:11:19.093
developed countries,
where each slice here,

00:11:19.093 --> 00:11:24.320
these are females on the right,
males on the left,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.759
and each slice is an age
category: zero to 10 years,

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:32.000
10 to 20.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.886
And you can see that in these
kinds of populations,

00:11:35.886 --> 00:11:38.918
you have a fairly even age
distribution.

00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:43.427
Long periods of no net growth
in a population lead to this.

00:11:43.427 --> 00:11:48.014
In these developed countries,
and we're going to examine why

00:11:48.014 --> 00:11:52.134
this is, there's basically an
even replacement rate of

00:11:52.134 --> 00:11:53.689
children for adults.

00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:58.431
And one of the things we worry
about when you see this kind of

00:11:58.431 --> 00:12:02.084
age distribution,
although it's good in terms of

00:12:02.084 --> 00:12:05.505
population growth,
is when you have few young

00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:09.936
people and a lot of older
people, who's going to take care

00:12:09.936 --> 00:12:16.000
of them, which is what's behind
the Social Security crisis.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.200
But we won't get into that.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.437
Since you're the young people
and I'm the old people,

00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:24.881
I don't want to dwell on that.

00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:29.688
OK, so what demographers do for
human populations is project

00:12:29.688 --> 00:12:34.577
what the population will look
like in the future based on the

00:12:34.577 --> 00:12:38.000
reproductive rates of the
present.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.824
And you can see for the US
here, it's reasonably stable if

00:12:42.824 --> 00:12:45.617
you look at these three
snapshots.

00:12:45.617 --> 00:12:49.510
We're going to go backwards
starting with 1950,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.912
and show you what the
population has been doing since

00:12:53.912 --> 00:12:54.335
1950.

00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:57.636
And I'm just going to walk
through this.

00:12:57.636 --> 00:13:02.376
You only have one in your
handouts, but I'll show you how

00:13:02.376 --> 00:13:05.000
it's moving along.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.490
Moving along,
you can think of this as

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.358
generations moving through the
population.

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:15.094
And this is the date up here.

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:19.150
So, this is 1950,
1955, you can see this red

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.811
cohort.

00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:24.622
A cohort is a group of
individuals that were born at

00:13:24.622 --> 00:13:26.698
roughly the same time.

00:13:26.698 --> 00:13:30.188
So, you can see that red cohort
there.

00:13:30.188 --> 00:13:32.830
And we are going along,
1965.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.037
This lip here,
that we can now see,

00:13:36.037 --> 00:13:40.000
is the postwar baby boom.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.553
That's what I'm a member of.

00:13:42.553 --> 00:13:47.113
If you can see it in this bulge
in this population.

00:13:47.113 --> 00:13:49.666
And now were marching along.

00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:53.861
Here's my cohort,
and I just put these lines on

00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:55.776
to keep you oriented.

00:13:55.776 --> 00:13:57.965
And here comes you guys.

00:13:57.965 --> 00:14:00.883
I think those are you guys,
1985.

00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:05.534
That's roughly right,
because I never know when I've

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:09.000
last updated these slides.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.749
So, and here you go.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:15.821
See, here's the big bulge of
all of these baby boomers that

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:19.494
you guys are going to have to
take care of.

00:14:19.494 --> 00:14:22.642
And now, we can actually see an
echo.

00:14:22.642 --> 00:14:26.140
This is what's called the baby
boom echo.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:32.000
These are the kids of the baby
boomers, which is you guys.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.894
But you can only see that as we
march through it.

00:14:36.894 --> 00:14:39.341
So, here we are at 2020.

00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:44.643
But you get the impression that
it's a fairly stable,

00:14:44.643 --> 00:14:50.250
now, even age distribution in
the US and these developed

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.270
countries.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.737
Oops, here we go a little but
more.

00:14:54.737 --> 00:14:58.000
Sorry.
2035, 2045, OK.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.264
Now, in less developed
countries, the birth rate's high

00:15:03.264 --> 00:15:05.702
and the death rate's low.

00:15:05.702 --> 00:15:09.602
We see a much different age
distribution.

00:15:09.602 --> 00:15:14.184
And here's Uganda,
with a very high reproductive

00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:17.695
rate showing the projections to
2050.

00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:21.595
And here, we can march through
from 1970.

00:15:21.595 --> 00:15:27.250
You can see that this huge
expansion, do you know what that

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.127
noise is?

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:28.419
OK.

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:34.269
Does anybody have a hypothesis
for what that noise is that we

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:37.000
could test?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.210
Oh, OK, I guess we can't do
anything about that.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.644
OK, so here's Uganda.

00:15:41.644 --> 00:15:45.743
And you can see the dramatic
difference in a population where

00:15:45.743 --> 00:15:49.226
there is large birthrates,
and reducing death rates.

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:52.846
And we're going to get into
analyzing that in the next

00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:53.393
lecture.

00:15:53.393 --> 00:15:57.355
I just want to show you this
here so you have a feeling for

00:15:57.355 --> 00:16:02.000
what we are talking about in age
structured populations.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.421
So, let's now look at how are
going to analyze these

00:16:06.421 --> 00:16:11.362
populations to try to quantify
growth rates or replacement

00:16:11.362 --> 00:16:11.882
rates.

00:16:11.882 --> 00:16:15.089
And to do this,
we set up life tables.

00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:20.030
And this is basically what
insurance agencies do for human

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.071
populations.

00:16:21.071 --> 00:16:25.665
But we do the same thing for
populations of ecological

00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:26.532
interests.

00:16:26.532 --> 00:16:30.000
We use the same techniques.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.721
In this lecture,
going to use a unicorn is my

00:16:33.721 --> 00:16:38.796
example, because I can make up
the numbers because they don't

00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:39.303
exist.

00:16:39.303 --> 00:16:44.293
But in a textbook there are
examples for real organisms like

00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:46.746
lizards and things like that.

00:16:46.746 --> 00:16:51.820
OK, so we need to define an age
interval, X, and then this is

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.711
the number of intervals in the
original cohort.

00:16:55.711 --> 00:17:00.870
Again, a cohort is a group of
individuals that are born within

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.000
a defined age interval.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.486
I mean, I think of you guys as
a cohort.

00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:11.331
DX is the number dying during
that interval.

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.655
All of this is on the Web.

00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:16.158
These slides are on the Web.

00:17:16.158 --> 00:17:20.450
So, you don't need to write it
down, but you can.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:25.456
And, NX is that number of
individuals surviving to age X.

00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:31.000
LX is the portion of
individuals surviving to age X.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.942
So, that's just equal to NX
divided by N0.

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:40.230
And, we're going to look at a
table that shows this in a

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.903
minute.

00:17:40.903 --> 00:17:44.269
And MX is something that's
measured.

00:17:44.269 --> 00:17:49.750
It's the per capita births
during age interval X to X plus

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.134
one.

00:17:50.134 --> 00:17:54.557
And this is also called
age-specific fecundity.

00:17:54.557 --> 00:17:59.942
And you can think of it as the
number of female offspring

00:17:59.942 --> 00:18:06.000
produced per female in a
particular age category.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.643
OK, is everybody comfortable
with that?

00:18:11.643 --> 00:18:19.663
So, with these definitions,
we're going to build a life

00:18:19.663 --> 00:18:28.128
table that will allow us to
actually calculate some things

00:18:28.128 --> 00:18:29.910
of interest.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:36.000
And, what do we want to
calculate?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:50.000
We want to calculate the
survivorship probability,
00:18:39&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.720
LX.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:19:02.000
We want to calculate the net
replacement rate.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.695
No it's not really a rate,
net replacement of population

00:19:09.695 --> 00:19:15.152
per generation,
which we are calling R0.

00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:23.407
It's basically the number of
children people have to replace

00:19:23.407 --> 00:19:27.185
who's there per generation.

00:19:27.185 --> 00:19:33.621
And then, for now,
this is what we are going to

00:19:33.621 --> 00:19:36.000
look at.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:45.767
And to do that,
we are going to generate what's

00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:51.500
called a cohort life table.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:59.143
And to do this,
we follow a cohort of

00:19:59.143 --> 00:20:07.000
individuals throughout lifetime.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.073
Or, we can also generate a
static life table because it's

00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:21.652
not that easy sometimes to have
a group of organisms that are

00:20:21.652 --> 00:20:29.105
born at the same time to follow
them throughout their entire

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:31.000
lifetime.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.571
So there is a static life table
of taking a snapshot at one time

00:20:37.571 --> 00:20:41.848
of the population,
and calculating the age

00:20:41.848 --> 00:20:42.892
structure.

00:20:42.892 --> 00:20:47.690
So, you take a snapshot,
and we look at the age

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.733
structure.

00:20:48.733 --> 00:20:54.992
And, we are going to do this in
a second so it will make more

00:20:54.992 --> 00:20:55.618
sense.

00:20:55.618 --> 00:21:00.000
OK, so we've defined our terms.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.070
And now, we are going to start
by calculating LX.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:09.718
So, this is a cohort life table
for unicorns.

00:21:09.718 --> 00:21:16.056
We're going to start out with a
hundred baby unicorns that we

00:21:16.056 --> 00:21:19.542
have in our imaginary unicorn
pen.

00:21:19.542 --> 00:21:22.922
So, this is a cohort size of
100.

00:21:22.922 --> 00:21:30.000
And, we find that after a year
there are 50 of them left.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.089
50 of them die in the first
year.

00:21:34.089 --> 00:21:40.734
So, the probability here,
the proportion surviving is

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:45.591
0.5, NX over N0,
and then a year later,

00:21:45.591 --> 00:21:52.492
.4, .3, and then by four years
older, no unicorns left.

00:21:52.492 --> 00:21:55.814
They don't live very long.

00:21:55.814 --> 00:22:02.332
All right, so this is what's
called the survivorship

00:22:02.332 --> 00:22:10.000
probability, and what we can do
is look at there.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.318
Different types of organisms
have different,

00:22:13.318 --> 00:22:15.864
what we call,
survivorship curves.

00:22:15.864 --> 00:22:18.797
And this is discussed in your
textbook.

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:21.266
We'll just describe the
extremes.

00:22:21.266 --> 00:22:24.816
These are just theoretical
survivorship curves.

00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:29.524
But some organisms have a very
high probability of survival as

00:22:29.524 --> 00:22:34.000
a function of age until they
reach an old age.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.400
And then, they have a very low
probability of survival.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:45.500
There are other organisms whose
survivorship probability drops

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.000
very fast, right after they're
born.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.099
But if they make it through
that interval,

00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:55.700
they're pretty good to go.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:01.299
And then there are some that
have a steady probability of

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:03.000
dying.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.643
So, where are humans,
do you think,

00:23:10.643 --> 00:23:12.441
on this?

00:23:12.441 --> 00:23:13.341
Two?

00:23:13.341 --> 00:23:17.387
No, but that's OK.

00:23:17.387 --> 00:23:27.503
Let me ask you the other way;
where our frogs,

00:23:27.503 --> 00:23:32.000
do you think?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.744
Yeah, OK, so you got that
image.

00:23:34.744 --> 00:23:38.284
Tons of frogs' eggs:
everybody eats them.

00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:42.622
Or for that matter,
the video I showed towards the

00:23:42.622 --> 00:23:47.578
end of the last class where
there were all those eggs of,

00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:48.818
what was that?

00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:53.155
Remember all those eggs that
everybody was eating?

00:23:53.155 --> 00:23:54.837
Herring, thank you.

00:23:54.837 --> 00:24:00.059
So, any organism that puts out
just tons of fertilized eggs,

00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:03.866
and knowing that most of them
will be eaten,

00:24:03.866 --> 00:24:09.000
but some of them will survive,
falls here.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.646
And, humans actually fall here.

00:24:11.646 --> 00:24:16.170
Any organism that has a high
investment in the care of

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:20.865
offspring, they have few
offspring but they invest a lot

00:24:20.865 --> 00:24:25.048
into the care of those
offspring, would fall here.

00:24:25.048 --> 00:24:28.804
And then this,
actually birds and things fall

00:24:28.804 --> 00:24:30.000
here.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.171
So, here's some real but
idealized survivorship curves.

00:24:34.171 --> 00:24:35.484
These are humans.

00:24:35.484 --> 00:24:38.188
And males and females are
different.

00:24:38.188 --> 00:24:42.360
I'm not sure whether we
understand that completely yet.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.454
Does anybody know whether
that's socially constructed?

00:24:46.454 --> 00:24:51.012
Now that there's more women
experiencing equal stress in the

00:24:51.012 --> 00:24:55.184
workplace as there are men that
will probably even out.

00:24:55.184 --> 00:24:59.356
But, I think there are more
women born, or girl babies.

00:24:59.356 --> 00:25:03.373
Anyway, there's some
interesting biology behind this,

00:25:03.373 --> 00:25:06.000
but I don't know.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.127
I don't remember.

00:25:07.127 --> 00:25:10.177
And, here's grass,
of course grass spew out all

00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:13.625
these seeds everywhere,
and very few of them survive,

00:25:13.625 --> 00:25:15.018
also these frogs,
etc.

00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:18.931
and birds are commonly like
this, where they're somewhere in

00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:19.461
between.

00:25:19.461 --> 00:25:22.644
Why do we care so much about
survivorship curves?

00:25:22.644 --> 00:25:23.307
Who cares?

00:25:23.307 --> 00:25:27.021
Well, I mean they're inherently
interesting to population

00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:31.000
ecologists, but there are also
uses for them.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.092
For example,
if you want to conserve a

00:25:34.092 --> 00:25:38.772
species, if you're worried about
a species going extinct,

00:25:38.772 --> 00:25:43.536
you want to figure out whether
it's better to conserve the

00:25:43.536 --> 00:25:45.792
young ones or the old ones.

00:25:45.792 --> 00:25:48.048
For example,
turtle species,

00:25:48.048 --> 00:25:52.896
you would pick a certain age
group where the probability of

00:25:52.896 --> 00:25:56.322
survival is high,
and decide to target the

00:25:56.322 --> 00:26:00.000
conservation of that age group.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.294
So, let's continue with,
we are building our life table

00:26:05.294 --> 00:26:05.784
here.

00:26:05.784 --> 00:26:11.568
So, we have the survivorship
probability, but what we really

00:26:11.568 --> 00:26:17.450
want to get at is understanding
whether or not the population

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:22.450
that we are describing is
replacing itself with each

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.529
generation.

00:26:23.529 --> 00:26:28.529
So, maybe we should define,
when R0 is equal to one,

00:26:28.529 --> 00:26:35.000
that meets the population is
exactly replacing itself.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.503
So, this is replacing,
so the actual growth rate of

00:26:43.503 --> 00:26:48.775
the population would be steady.

00:26:48.775 --> 00:26:57.448
If R0 is less than one,
the number of individuals is

00:26:57.448 --> 00:27:00.000
declining.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.195
And R0 of greater than one,
it's increasing.

00:27:04.195 --> 00:27:08.975
So, we want to know for our
unicorns what that is.

00:27:08.975 --> 00:27:13.853
And to get to that,
we have to know something about

00:27:13.853 --> 00:27:15.414
the birth rates.

00:27:15.414 --> 00:27:20.390
So, MX is the average offspring
per female of age X.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.780
So, this is called the
age-specific fecundity.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.658
And that's something that's a
known property of the

00:27:29.658 --> 00:27:32.000
population.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.829
Whoops, oh, my,
my, my, my, I'm missing a

00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:39.853
slide.

00:27:39.853 --> 00:27:42.585
Oh, there we go.

00:27:42.585 --> 00:27:46.170
They're out of order.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.243
OK, so we have MX.

00:27:49.243 --> 00:27:53.853
So, how do we calculate R0?

00:27:53.853 --> 00:28:13.000
Well, R0 is the sum of LX MX.
00:28:00&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.910
With the sum of the
survivorship times the

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.700
age-specific fecundity,
and in this case,

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.095
it sums up to three.

00:28:25.095 --> 00:28:30.604
So, what's happening to our
unicorn population?

00:28:30.604 --> 00:28:33.000
It's growing.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.333
Yeah, we are getting three
unicorns in each generation for

00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:42.666
every one that existed before.

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:47.444
So, in our imaginary unit of
our population,

00:28:47.444 --> 00:28:53.111
we're going to be knee deep in
unicorns pretty fast.

00:28:53.111 --> 00:28:58.444
OK, so I forgot my watch,
so I have to look at my

00:28:58.444 --> 00:28:59.444
computer.

00:28:59.444 --> 00:29:04.000
What if we can't follow cohort?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.314
Oh, thank you.

00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:10.758
How do we create the same kind
of analysis for a population

00:29:10.758 --> 00:29:16.296
that we can't follow through
time, but can only look at as a

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:17.140
snapshot?

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.519
OK, this is where we go to the
slide.

00:29:20.519 --> 00:29:25.682
If you don't have it in your
handout, it doesn't matter.

00:29:25.682 --> 00:29:30.000
I just got off the web this
morning.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.094
I couldn't find a skeleton of
the unicorn because,

00:29:34.094 --> 00:29:38.189
of course, that's totally
imaginary, but I found a

00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:38.941
mastodon.

00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:44.038
So, just imagine that this is a
unicorn, and I couldn't find a

00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:46.880
unicorn horn,
so this is a sheep's.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.470
But, all these principles
apply.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:53.649
I just discovered Images in
Google, which is really

00:29:53.649 --> 00:29:54.401
exciting.

00:29:54.401 --> 00:30:00.000
So, you're going to get
subjected to this for awhile.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.586
So, OK, so what you can do,
and this has actually been done

00:30:04.586 --> 00:30:08.303
with mountain sheep,
is you go out you find dead

00:30:08.303 --> 00:30:12.415
sheep, you find skeletons of
sheep that have died for

00:30:12.415 --> 00:30:13.681
whatever causes.

00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:17.239
And you go out,
and you sample until you have,

00:30:17.239 --> 00:30:18.742
say, 100 skeletons.

00:30:18.742 --> 00:30:22.301
And that's your cohort that
you're looking at,

00:30:22.301 --> 00:30:23.961
at one point in time.

00:30:23.961 --> 00:30:27.836
And from their horn,
you can actually tell how old

00:30:27.836 --> 00:30:31.000
they were when they died.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.486
You can count the number of
rings, so that's what's here,

00:30:35.486 --> 00:30:36.928
annual horn rings.

00:30:36.928 --> 00:30:39.571
This is for a dall mountain
sheep.

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:43.417
So, you can say well now it
died when it was two.

00:30:43.417 --> 00:30:45.740
That one died when it was 10.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.784
That one died when it was
whatever age.

00:30:48.784 --> 00:30:52.870
And then you can create the
same kind of life table,

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.395
a static life table,
where you have a hundred

00:30:56.395 --> 00:30:57.196
skeletons.

00:30:57.196 --> 00:31:00.000
That is your cohort.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.730
You look at the number dying of
age zero to one,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.333
the number of one year olds,
the number that died when they

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:12.142
were one year old,
the number that died when they

00:31:12.142 --> 00:31:14.047
were a two-year-old etc.

00:31:14.047 --> 00:31:18.095
And so, from these data,
these are the data that you

00:31:18.095 --> 00:31:21.587
collected, you can calculate
this column, NX,

00:31:21.587 --> 00:31:24.841
so NX is DX,
or NX minus DX equals NX plus

00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:25.158
one.

00:31:25.158 --> 00:31:26.825
Does that make sense?

00:31:26.825 --> 00:31:30.000
I can never tell whether.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.701
I know if I write this on the
board it might be easier,

00:31:34.701 --> 00:31:37.226
but it's so obvious isn't it?

00:31:37.226 --> 00:31:42.712
We are just saying that this is
the number that died at the age.

00:31:42.712 --> 00:31:47.762
This is the number you started
with, so that's how many are

00:31:47.762 --> 00:31:51.767
going to have that age,
that age, and that age.

00:31:51.767 --> 00:31:56.208
And then, once you have this
column, your proportion

00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:59.168
surviving LX,
you can calculate LX.

00:31:59.168 --> 00:32:03.000
LX equals NX divided by N0,
OK?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.540
So, we are doing exactly the
same thing as we did before.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.405
It's just that we're getting
the NX column instead of getting

00:32:12.405 --> 00:32:14.594
it by following the cohort.

00:32:14.594 --> 00:32:19.054
We're getting it by calculating
it based on how old dead

00:32:19.054 --> 00:32:21.486
organisms were when they died.

00:32:21.486 --> 00:32:26.513
And in my ecology class that I
teach, some years we actually go

00:32:26.513 --> 00:32:30.000
out to the Mount Auburn
Cemetery.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.231
And you can do this from human
gravestones.

00:32:35.231 --> 00:32:41.584
You can go to the cemetery,
and pick out a number of

00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:47.688
gravestones, and see the age at
which humans died.

00:32:47.688 --> 00:32:54.415
You create yourself a cohort,
and you can create a life

00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:55.162
table.

00:32:55.162 --> 00:32:59.896
And you can do that for
different eras,

00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:06.000
and see how replacements have
changed.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.427
OK, now so that's the analysis
for populations that have an age

00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:14.625
structure.

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:21.692
Now we are going to go more
into simpler type of population,

00:33:21.692 --> 00:33:44.000
and that is a population with a
stable age distribution.
00:33:29&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.368
And to do this,
you're going to help me,

00:33:47.368 --> 00:33:52.204
and we're going to use your
calculus that you've all been

00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:52.981
studying.

00:33:52.981 --> 00:33:58.250
So, instead of the unicorn now,
have your imaginary population

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:03.000
be a population of microbes that
divide in half.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.902
They multiplied by dividing in
half.

00:34:06.902 --> 00:34:13.369
So, each one of these is a
microbe that's dividing in half.

00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:16.268
This is your mental image.

00:34:16.268 --> 00:34:20.728
This is what's called
exponential growth.

00:34:20.728 --> 00:34:24.073
It's obvious how that happens.

00:34:24.073 --> 00:34:30.874
And we're going to model this
population, we're going to first

00:34:30.874 --> 00:34:35.000
assume unlimited resources.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:49.352
OK, so we're going to say that
the rate of population increase

00:34:49.352 --> 00:35:02.764
is equal to the average birth
rate minus the average death

00:35:02.764 --> 00:35:11.000
rate times the number of cells.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.079
OK, so we are going to now turn
this into math,

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:24.348
and that is to say the dN/dt,
the increase in population

00:35:24.348 --> 00:35:32.806
where N is the population number
is equal to the birth rate minus

00:35:32.806 --> 00:35:39.546
the death rate times N which is
the number of cells,

00:35:39.546 --> 00:35:41.000
OK?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:51.557
And then, we're going to let B
minus D, the birth rate minus

00:35:51.557 --> 00:35:58.000
the death rate,
be what we call r.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:11.013
And, this is what's called the
intrinsic rate of increase of a

00:36:11.013 --> 00:36:13.360
population.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.333
OK, what are the units of r?

00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:30.000
One over time,
exactly, time to the minus one.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.294
So, let's look at that more
carefully.

00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:40.562
And also, it's a little
misleading to say it's the rate

00:36:40.562 --> 00:36:46.250
of increase because r can be
positive or negative,

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.687
however it turns out.

00:36:48.687 --> 00:36:55.535
It can be positive or negative,
but that's what it's called.

00:36:55.535 --> 00:36:59.133
So, we have the dN/dt equals
rN.

00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:05.750
We're substituting r in this
equation for one over N times

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.000
dN/dt equals r.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.273
OK, so ours has the unit time
to the minus one.

00:37:14.273 --> 00:37:17.598
And so, let's ask a question.

00:37:17.598 --> 00:37:23.789
Given N0 I give you the
population density at some time

00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:28.261
which we're going to call T
equals zero.

00:37:28.261 --> 00:37:33.305
Given a population growing
according to this,

00:37:33.305 --> 00:37:39.611
which is exponential growth,
what if we want to know the

00:37:39.611 --> 00:37:45.000
population, what N is at any
time T?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
We want an equation that will
give us, given N0 what would the

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.639
population density be at some
time, T?

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:58.770
What do you have to do to this
to get that?

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:03.000
Yeah, so who wants to do that
for me?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.925
Come on.

00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:07.512
You guys did this freshman
year.

00:38:07.512 --> 00:38:11.909
It's the easiest thing there
is, right?

00:38:11.909 --> 00:38:18.851
Every class I've had has had
somebody who was willing to come

00:38:18.851 --> 00:38:20.586
up and do this.

00:38:20.586 --> 00:38:24.173
OK, so we'll just add a T
there.

00:38:24.173 --> 00:38:31.000
So, N at sometime T is equally
to N0 e to the rT.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.995
And so, We could say,
then, r equals natural log of

00:38:37.995 --> 00:38:43.452
NT minus natural log of N0
divided by T.

00:38:43.452 --> 00:38:49.609
And I like to write it that way
because then,

00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:54.506
we know what this looks like,
right?

00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:56.744
Let's plot that.

00:38:56.744 --> 00:39:00.102
This is N and this is T.

00:39:00.102 --> 00:39:05.000
What does that look like?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.666
I know this is really
rudimentary but remember we're

00:39:10.666 --> 00:39:13.666
modeling population growth.

00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:20.333
So here, if we plot the log of
N, and this is what we do with

00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:23.333
cultures of microorganisms.

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:25.000
That's a flask.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Those are a lot of microbes in
there.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.614
And what we do is we sample it
at various points in time,

00:39:36.614 --> 00:39:43.937
and if you take the log we get
a nice straight line that we can

00:39:43.937 --> 00:39:47.007
draw a regression through.

00:39:47.007 --> 00:39:51.968
And what's the slope of that
line equal to?

00:39:51.968 --> 00:39:52.204
r.

00:39:52.204 --> 00:39:53.149
Exactly.

00:39:53.149 --> 00:40:00.000
The growth rate in the units:
N to the minus one.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.447
OK, what's the Y intercept?

00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:07.164
N0.

00:40:07.164 --> 00:40:20.537
OK, now suppose we want to
calculate the doubling time of

00:40:20.537 --> 00:40:32.000
the population,
the time it takes to double.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.619
How would we do that?

00:40:36.619 --> 00:40:41.460
Let's first define it.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:50.260
It's the time,
T, that it takes for NT to

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.440
equal to N0, right?

00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:05.000
If we start with N0 the
population doubles.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.750
Then, that's the time at NT.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:23.071
So, we want to solve for that T
for the time it takes for the

00:41:23.071 --> 00:41:28.000
population to double.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:40.616
Since natural log of NT over N0
equals rT, then the natural log

00:41:40.616 --> 00:41:53.029
of, sorry, 2N0 over N0 equals
rT, and T equals the natural log

00:41:53.029 --> 00:42:03.000
of two divided by r equals our
doubling time.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.317
Does that make sense?

00:42:07.317 --> 00:42:17.185
I'll put this out there so you
can see it better.

00:42:17.185 --> 00:42:26.643
What's the natural log of two?
0.69, thank you,

00:42:26.643 --> 00:42:36.100
always a handy thing to have in
our repertoire.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:47.202
So, that's just the way,
it's easier to think about the

00:42:47.202 --> 00:42:56.660
time it takes for a population
to double often,

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.926
then the instantaneous growth
rate.
