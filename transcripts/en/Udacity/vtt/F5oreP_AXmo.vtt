00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.920
So let's compare what we can get from
a multicore versus single core processor

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.280
in a new technology.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.580
Suppose that in the previous
technology generation,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.160
we got a processor that has an area
of two centimeters squared.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.670
It was achieving 2.5
instructions per cycle.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.570
And it consumed 100 W,
at 2 GHz frequency.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.750
And this is the highest power that
we can allow this processor to have.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.400
And this 100 W is what
we can reasonably call.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.490
Now let's say we get the new technology
where this same exact processor

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.500
would be half the area because
our transistors have shrunk.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.864
Because it's the same design,
it's going to have the same IPC.

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:50.941
And because transistors have shrunk,
we also reduce the power

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:57.240
of this processor when operating at
the same 2 GHz frequency as before.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.650
Now of course because this processor is
smaller in the new technology than in

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.690
the old one.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.600
If we want to do the best we can with 2
centimeter square, we have two options.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.055
Our first option is a better
single core processor.

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:14.785
This processor will be designed to
occupy the entire area that we have,

00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:16.595
which is 2 cm square.

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:22.325
It's a more complicated processor that
allows us to achieve an IPC of 3.5.

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:29.000
So it executes 3.5 instructions per
cycle, not 2.5 as the old processor.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.430
But because it's a fancier processor and
has more transistors,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.410
it spends 75 W when operating at 2 GHz.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.915
So, the question for you is first, if we
allow this processor to spend all 100

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:50.200
W that we can call,
what is the frequency it can get in GHz?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.870
And if we do that, what is
the speedup this better single core

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.400
achieves versus what we can
get in the old technology?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.430
The second option we had
in this new technology

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.930
Is to simply put two cores on this chip.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.410
So it's going to be two cores like this.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.960
This is going to get us 2 cm squared.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.090
IPC is going to be 2.5 on each core.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.060
And each core is going to
consume 50 W at 2 GHz.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.250
So we get our entire budget spent by
having these cores operate at 2 GHz.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.330
So the question for you here,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.620
is what's the speedup of this two-core
approach versus the old technology,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.230
assuming, of course, that the old work
can simply be divided among the cores.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.160
So pretty much having two cores
allows us just to split the same work

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.940
that we had before onto two cores
without adding any new instructions.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.670
And without sacrificing the IPC.
