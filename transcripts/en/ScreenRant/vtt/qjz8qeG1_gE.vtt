00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.160
One of the upsides to having a TV show is
that if you�re lucky enough, you�ll have

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.780
multiple seasons to iron out any kinks and
develop your project into something special.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.160
Without that time, who knows what would have
become of some of the medium�s most famous

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.160
programs.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.860
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 Great TV Shows
That Struggled in Their First Season.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.030
Star Trek: The Next Generation

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.850
Two decades after The Original Series went
off the air, this classic sci-fi franchise

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.960
returned to the small screen with a new cast
of characters including now fan-favorites

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.840
like Captain Picard and Worf.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.220
Though the first season scored high ratings,
time has illustrated it�s somewhat problematic

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.170
with clich�d storylines, bizarre tonal shifts,
and questionable casting choices.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.340
Starting as lackluster when compared to its
predecessor, The Next Generation began to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.890
gel once a clear direction was established
and its ensemble developed better chemistry.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.140
Later seasons showcase an immediate improvement
and the TNG crew is now as beloved as Kirk

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.080
and Spock.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.180
Parks and Recreation

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.680
Originally pitched as a spin-off of NBC�s
hit show The Office � though that angle

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.040
was trashed in development - the first season
of Parks and Rec tried to replicate the harsh

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.670
and dry tone of that show and was a far cry
from the charming series audiences came to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.670
love.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.920
One particular problem was the characterization,
as even Amy Poehler�s Leslie Knope was written

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.100
very one-note and came across as unlikable.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.750
Fortunately, the show runners spent the next
years treating the characters in a much more

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.460
sympathetic manner, which made the show a
good-natured piece of satire that viewers

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.010
enjoyed seeing over and over again.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.730
Buffy the Vampire Slayer

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.560
One of Joss Whedon�s most famous creations,
Buffy had rough sledding during her initial

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.140
year on TV.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.240
A follow-up to a mostly forgotten movie of
the same name, Whedon struggled to even get

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.590
it on the air, and when he finally did, many
wondered why he wanted to.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.350
The first 
season is seen by some as being cheesy, and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.230
the poor fight choreography combined with
questionable camerawork didn�t do it any

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.230
favors either.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.209
There�s nothing wrong with a little narrative
cheddar, but the tone and pacing of that first

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.120
season was so displaced compared to what came
after it, the episodes are jarring to watch

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.430
today.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.200
Babylon 5

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.340
Coming out around the same time as Star Trek:
Deep Space Nine, Babylon 5 was tasked with

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390
distinguishing itself from the more established
brand � something it struggled with amidst

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.700
accusations of being a knockoff.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.200
The Star Trek comparisons were hard for it
to overcome, and it didn�t help that the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.549
cast was a long ways away from settling into
their roles during that first year.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.940
In order to amend that issue, the cast was
retooled for the second season, with Bruce

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.209
Boxleitner replacing Michael O�Hare.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.420
Fortunately, things picked up after that,
and Babylon 5 became one of the sci-fi greats

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.010
that stood on its own.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.010
Doctor Who

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:19.190
The 2005 revival of the classic property brought
back the Doctor after a 16 year absence from

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.290
the airwaves, but couldn�t really live up
to the hype.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.579
Show runner Russell T. Davies used his inaugural
year as more of an experimental run, dipping

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.050
his toes in the water to see what worked.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.010
The episodes he crafted proved to be divisive
amongst longtime fans, and the balancing of

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.000
multiple tones didn�t do the show any favors.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.620
Star Christopher Eccleston was always up for
the challenge, but the constant changing between

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.430
wacky and maudlin didn�t exactly fit his
typically stoic persona and acting abilities.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.730
The X-Files

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.889
One of the defining series of the 1990s, The
X-Files wasn�t always appointment television.

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.709
In the early going, Mulder and Scully had
numerous problems they needed to sort out.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.389
Though not as scattershot as the final seasons,
the first year was plagued by a rough dynamic

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.959
between its leads, as the writers were loose
with the characterization.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.319
Some traits introduced in season one ended
up being abandoned down the road.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.750
Also, the episodes featured very little of
the program�s trademark wit and sense of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.690
dread, which makes it difficult for fans to
include any of them in a �best of� list.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.890
The Walking Dead

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.700
AMC�s zombie hit has always been a ratings
juggernaut, but the six-episode first season

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.890
will make newcomers question what the big
deal is.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.370
The season plays out more like an experiment
than a fully realized show, with incredibly

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.150
slow pacing, meandering digressions, shallow
characterizations, and heavy-handed foreshadowing

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.420
of things to come.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.660
Not to mention, the finale was more head scratching
than anything, failing to live up to the open-ended

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.060
premise of the show.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.950
The run may not be horrible per say but it
certainly lacks the focus that ended up making

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.100
The Walking Dead one of TV�s elite dramas
of the modern age.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100
American Dad

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.420
A creation of Seth MacFarlane, American Dad
had troubles escaping the shadow of MacFarlane�s

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.420
Family Guy.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.370
Its early episodes borrow so heavily from
that more successful companion series, that

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.100
it didn�t offer viewers much of anything
unique and made those tired of MacFarlane�s

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.920
brand of humor even more jaded.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.200
In later years, American Dad fully embraced
more outlandish elements like alien empires

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.980
and CIA shenanigans � which had only been
hinted at in season one � to create something

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.320
a little more fantastical with its own storytelling
conventions that stood on its own merits and

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.410
elevated the show into one of Fox�s premiere
animated programs.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.150
Supernatural

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.180
Known for sprawling narrative arcs and terrifying
recurring villains, Supernatural had some

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.390
growing pains before it could click with viewers.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.280
The first season is mostly a collection of
disconnected �monster of the week� cases

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.270
that lacked the heft of later years.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.550
The winning chemistry between stars Jensen
Ackles and Jared Padalecki was also in its

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.050
earliest stages during this rough stretch,
meaning the initial year didn�t offer much

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.680
of its trademark humor that audiences enjoyed.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.270
Over time, the writers and actors hit their
stride to make a fan-favorite show, but the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.360
groundwork was there for Supernatural to be
a short-lived disaster.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360
Seinfeld

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.510
�The show about nothing� is hailed today
as one of TV�s most influential works, but

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.700
even Larry David couldn�t spin the first
season into comedic gold.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.680
With only five episodes to work with, the
writers didn�t have much time to dive into

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.240
the existentialist humor and absurd sight
gags that would become series trademarks.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.930
Not only were the actors still feeling out
their now-iconic characters, Seinfeld was

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.500
slow to fully embrace its premise of the misadventures
of four New Yorkers who are truly miserable

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.420
people to the world around them.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.590
Without that, the show didn�t have the same
bite that later seasons would showcase to

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.020
Emmy-winning results.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.160
