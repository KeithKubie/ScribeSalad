good try just a simple
yeah possibility for you know cuz we

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180
yeah possibility for you know cuz we
 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.360
yeah possibility for you know cuz we
can't use our key store in the API

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370
can't use our key store in the API
 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.390
can't use our key store in the API
console so we can't issue a API key

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400
console so we can't issue a API key
 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.480
console so we can't issue a API key
that's the problem if we were able to

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490
that's the problem if we were able to
 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.469
that's the problem if we were able to
issue an API key then I wouldn't show

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479
issue an API key then I wouldn't show
 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.850
issue an API key then I wouldn't show
the the web I would use the Account

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860
the the web I would use the Account
 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.090
the the web I would use the Account
Manager on ICS devices and forward

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.000

because they issued the account manager

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010
because they issued the account manager
 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.080
because they issued the account manager
issues and then we can show the allow

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090

I'm having an XML file sent to me and
 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.760
I'm having an XML file sent to me and
I'm trying to do a stream reader an

I'm trying to do a stream reader an
 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.659
I'm trying to do a stream reader an
input stream and bufferedreader and for

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669
input stream and bufferedreader and for
 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.619
input stream and bufferedreader and for
some reason I always get the 24 last

some reason I always get the 24 last
 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:39.439
some reason I always get the 24 last

I know that it's something very very

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:42.990
I know that it's something very very
 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.559
I know that it's something very very
weird and I'm trying to figure out why

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:45.569
weird and I'm trying to figure out why
 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:53.629
weird and I'm trying to figure out why
and is there a specific API or a good

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639
and is there a specific API or a good
 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.959
and is there a specific API or a good
example or a bufferedreader to see where

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:56.969
example or a bufferedreader to see where
 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:58.550
example or a bufferedreader to see where
we're doing it wrong or something

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560
we're doing it wrong or something
 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.279
we're doing it wrong or something
because I'm quite sure we have an issue

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:01.289
because I'm quite sure we have an issue
 

00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:04.850
because I'm quite sure we have an issue
on our reader because other platforms

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860
on our reader because other platforms
 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.860
on our reader because other platforms
read it okay just wanted to make sure

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:08.870
read it okay just wanted to make sure

something we're a very very weird is

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.250
something we're a very very weird is
 

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.920
something we're a very very weird is
that on a specific device or everything

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:15.930
that on a specific device or everything
 

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.219
that on a specific device or everything
on multiple devices I've checked on only

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:19.229

two devices on the Nexus 7 on the Galaxy
 

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:25.670
two devices on the Nexus 7 on the Galaxy
Nexus and on other devices we I think

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680
Nexus and on other devices we I think
 

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.260
Nexus and on other devices we I think
will enter at the same issue because the

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:30.270
will enter at the same issue because the
 

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.949

it's something very very weird
maybe you've encountered something like

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:01.870
maybe you've encountered something like
 

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:16.320
maybe you've encountered something like
that or yeah I was wondering is whether

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.330
that or yeah I was wondering is whether
 

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.420
that or yeah I was wondering is whether
it's worth trying to use the XML pull

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.430
it's worth trying to use the XML pull
 

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.160
it's worth trying to use the XML pull

it's driving me crazy we can try to find
 

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.890
it's driving me crazy we can try to find
the bug in the code I don't know if we

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:46.900
the bug in the code I don't know if we
 

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.120
the bug in the code I don't know if we
don't want to do that right now

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.130
don't want to do that right now
 

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.690
don't want to do that right now
yeah I'm just asking if you have any

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700
yeah I'm just asking if you have any
 

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.260
yeah I'm just asking if you have any
examples for a good example or guideline

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.270
examples for a good example or guideline
 

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.620
examples for a good example or guideline
to follow to see where this is going

to follow to see where this is going
wrong because I want to change this code

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000
wrong because I want to change this code

wrong because I want to change this code
because if it's not working I want to

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160
because if it's not working I want to
 

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.000
because if it's not working I want to
rebuild it or something I don't want him

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.010
rebuild it or something I don't want him
 

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.049

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:12.769
to use it and make a faulty
and response or something like that just

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779
and response or something like that just
 

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:15.919
and response or something like that just
off the top of my head looking at it

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:15.929
off the top of my head looking at it
 

00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:18.889

yeah you're using ready from

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899
yeah you're using ready from
 

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:21.559
yeah you're using ready from
bufferedreader but that basically

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:21.569
bufferedreader but that basically
 

00:11:21.569 --> 00:11:23.629
bufferedreader but that basically
indicates whether the reader is ready to

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639
indicates whether the reader is ready to
 

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:26.209
indicates whether the reader is ready to
be read from without blocking so yes so

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:26.219
be read from without blocking so yes so
 

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:27.979
be read from without blocking so yes so
it's potentially possible that you're

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:27.989
it's potentially possible that you're
 

00:11:27.989 --> 00:11:30.529
it's potentially possible that you're
not you haven't got enough data left to

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:30.539
not you haven't got enough data left to
 

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:33.319
not you haven't got enough data left to
fill a block in the buffer and therefore

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:33.329
fill a block in the buffer and therefore
 

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:35.119
fill a block in the buffer and therefore
the buffers not ready to read without

00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:35.129
the buffers not ready to read without
 

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:38.479
the buffers not ready to read without
blocking yeah but if I you see I'm using

00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:38.489
blocking yeah but if I you see I'm using
 

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:42.649
blocking yeah but if I you see I'm using
also ready ready total just to count the

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:42.659
also ready ready total just to count the
 

00:11:42.659 --> 00:11:46.369
also ready ready total just to count the
bytes I've read to see if I need to to

00:11:46.369 --> 00:11:46.379
bytes I've read to see if I need to to
 

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:50.389
bytes I've read to see if I need to to
read more and while comparing it I see I

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399
read more and while comparing it I see I
 

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:54.829
read more and while comparing it I see I
have 24 bytes left but if the buffer in

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839
have 24 bytes left but if the buffer in
 

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.899
have 24 bytes left but if the buffer in
the buffered reader is larger than 24

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:56.909
the buffered reader is larger than 24
 

00:11:56.909 --> 00:11:59.689
the buffered reader is larger than 24
bytes you may get false return from be

00:11:59.689 --> 00:11:59.699
bytes you may get false return from be
 

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:02.269
bytes you may get false return from be
read it already because it's not ready

blocking so if there's an implementation

00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:25.439

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:28.489

00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:28.499
that requires the buffer to be filled

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:10.980
sorry what I think the most pragmatic
way to approach that would be to suggest

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:10.990
 
 

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.850
 
yeah yeah we looked into it but I think

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:15.860
yeah yeah we looked into it but I think
 

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:25.110
yeah yeah we looked into it but I think
if will propose a test for the CTS suit

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120
if will propose a test for the CTS suit
 

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.140
if will propose a test for the CTS suit
it will be a problem for all devices out

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.150
it will be a problem for all devices out
 

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.890
it will be a problem for all devices out
there because we have a very vast list

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:32.900
there because we have a very vast list
 

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.170
there because we have a very vast list
of devices not implementing the whole

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:35.180
of devices not implementing the whole
 

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.610
of devices not implementing the whole
MPI or implementing the API noddings in

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:39.620
MPI or implementing the API noddings in
 

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.900
MPI or implementing the API noddings in
a way we can use them so what we'll know

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:43.910
a way we can use them so what we'll know
 

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.910
a way we can use them so what we'll know
exactly why we need to make the CTS

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:45.920
exactly why we need to make the CTS
 

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.030
exactly why we need to make the CTS
better yeah but what we will do what

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.040
better yeah but what we will do what
 

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.460
better yeah but what we will do what
will you suggest to do with devices out

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:51.470
will you suggest to do with devices out
 

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.740
will you suggest to do with devices out
there just to block them and say to

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:53.750
there just to block them and say to
 

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.550
there just to block them and say to
users

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:54.560
users
 

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.040
users
okay devices are not ready to work and

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.050
okay devices are not ready to work and
 

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.860
okay devices are not ready to work and
they will not work until the end of god

00:17:59.860 --> 00:17:59.870
they will not work until the end of god
 

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.650
they will not work until the end of god
I don't know one of the things you can

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:02.660
I don't know one of the things you can
 

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.240
I don't know one of the things you can
do within the Android Open Source

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.250
do within the Android Open Source
 

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.760
do within the Android Open Source
project which is where the compatibility

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:06.770
project which is where the compatibility
 

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.100
project which is where the compatibility
test suite lives there's the master

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.110
test suite lives there's the master
 

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.260
test suite lives there's the master
branch which is a development branch for

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:11.270
branch which is a development branch for
 

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.540
branch which is a development branch for
future versions so you can handle all

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:13.550
future versions so you can handle all
 

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.160
future versions so you can handle all
the current devices as you're currently

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.170
the current devices as you're currently
 

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.080
the current devices as you're currently
handling them and put your CTS tests

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.090
handling them and put your CTS tests
 

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.210
handling them and put your CTS tests
into the master branch so future

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:19.220
into the master branch so future
 

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.320
into the master branch so future
versions can benefit from it okay but

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:23.330
versions can benefit from it okay but
 

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.500
versions can benefit from it okay but
mainly the main issue is here that

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:26.510
mainly the main issue is here that
 

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.350
mainly the main issue is here that
people like I don't know HTC Samsung

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360
people like I don't know HTC Samsung
 

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.990
people like I don't know HTC Samsung
they take the the main branch and then

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000
they take the the main branch and then
 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.990
they take the the main branch and then
they work on their own brands but the

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000
they work on their own brands but the
 

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.650
they work on their own brands but the
thing is is held by Google they can work

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:38.660
thing is is held by Google they can work
 

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.630
thing is is held by Google they can work
on their own customizations but the CTS

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640
on their own customizations but the CTS
 

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.520
on their own customizations but the CTS
is the standard I mean the guys in

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:42.530
is the standard I mean the guys in
 

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.650
is the standard I mean the guys in
London and SPARQL to tell you they're

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:44.660
London and SPARQL to tell you they're
 

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.660
London and SPARQL to tell you they're
back me up on this the CTS is a standard

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:46.670
back me up on this the CTS is a standard
 

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.280
back me up on this the CTS is a standard
which Google set in order to give

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:48.290
which Google set in order to give
 

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.740

okay they can take the core of Android

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:53.510
okay they can take the core of Android
 

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.640
okay they can take the core of Android
and mess around with it but they still

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:54.650
and mess around with it but they still
 

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.370
and mess around with it but they still
have to pass the CTS and so if they

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:57.380
have to pass the CTS and so if they
 

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.560
have to pass the CTS and so if they
don't pass our tests for the camera

00:18:59.560 --> 00:18:59.570
don't pass our tests for the camera
 

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:06.310
don't pass our tests for the camera
there won't be certified to the that's

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320
there won't be certified to the that's
 

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.900
there won't be certified to the that's
better that's better yeah

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:07.910
better that's better yeah
 

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.990
better that's better yeah
that's a good one the strength of the

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000
that's a good one the strength of the
 

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.630
that's a good one the strength of the
platform is as good as the CTS makes it

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640
platform is as good as the CTS makes it
 

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.130
platform is as good as the CTS makes it
yeah devices out there and you may have

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:18.140
yeah devices out there and you may have
 

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.300
yeah devices out there and you may have
to do some specific stuff for women

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.310
to do some specific stuff for women
 

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.210
to do some specific stuff for women
strange strange things but it's a

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:25.220
strange strange things but it's a
 

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.380
strange strange things but it's a
pragmatic approach the only way to

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:26.390
pragmatic approach the only way to
 

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.270
pragmatic approach the only way to
improve the situation in the future is

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280
 
 

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.580
 
okay thanks a lot guys if you do that

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:33.590
okay thanks a lot guys if you do that
 

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.930
okay thanks a lot guys if you do that
for the camera you will be a bit of a

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:34.940
for the camera you will be a bit of a
 

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:35.980
for the camera you will be a bit of a
hero because I know you're not the only

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:35.990
hero because I know you're not the only
 

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.540
hero because I know you're not the only
person faced and they've kind of

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:37.550
person faced and they've kind of
 

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.240
person faced and they've kind of
problems yeah we have a lot of tests we

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.250
problems yeah we have a lot of tests we
 

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.560
problems yeah we have a lot of tests we
are doing to see a few devices of the

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:44.570
are doing to see a few devices of the
 

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.450
are doing to see a few devices of the
API we require and we do a lot of

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:48.460
API we require and we do a lot of
 

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.760
API we require and we do a lot of
testing to see if it works and it will

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:51.770
testing to see if it works and it will
 

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.360
testing to see if it works and it will
be much more it will be easier to trust

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:55.370
be much more it will be easier to trust
 

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.230
be much more it will be easier to trust

the way that we're looking at doing it
 

00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:38.900
the way that we're looking at doing it
now is seems like it would kind of

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:38.910
now is seems like it would kind of
 

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.730
now is seems like it would kind of

all in the whole up in one activity are
 

00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:58.850
all in the whole up in one activity are
it will be across multiple activities so

00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860
it will be across multiple activities so
 

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.080
it will be across multiple activities so
the way the way we've got those minion

so how that needs to be sort of pulled

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:18.690
so how that needs to be sort of pulled
 

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.619
so how that needs to be sort of pulled
out so that's not managed manually it

00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:21.629
out so that's not managed manually it
 

00:28:21.629 --> 00:28:23.149

doesn't seem like we need to do that in

been around this as well like a lot of

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:22.129
been around this as well like a lot of
 

00:30:22.129 --> 00:30:23.649

frameworks of dependency injection so

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:25.220
frameworks of dependency injection so
 

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.399
frameworks of dependency injection so
and you end up sacrificing now writing

00:30:27.399 --> 00:30:27.409
and you end up sacrificing now writing
 

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:29.560
and you end up sacrificing now writing
an application the Android way so you

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:29.570
an application the Android way so you
 

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.849
an application the Android way so you
take advantage of these things like in

00:30:30.849 --> 00:30:30.859
take advantage of these things like in
 

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:33.430
take advantage of these things like in

best advice a technical guess is to try

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:42.980

different disciplines then is you have a

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:52.340
different disciplines then is you have a
 

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.700
different disciplines then is you have a
different flow if your Android app that

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:54.710
different flow if your Android app that
 

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:55.599
different flow if your Android app that
you might have for other applications

00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:55.609
you might have for other applications
 

00:30:55.609 --> 00:30:57.609
you might have for other applications
where they'll almost inevitably end up

00:30:57.609 --> 00:30:57.619
where they'll almost inevitably end up
 

00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:00.519
where they'll almost inevitably end up
in a better application it might say yes

00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:00.529
in a better application it might say yes
 

00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:02.590
in a better application it might say yes
that's my opinion as far as I was hoping

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600
that's my opinion as far as I was hoping
 

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.590
that's my opinion as far as I was hoping

there's a couple of stack overflow

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:11.179
there's a couple of stack overflow

there's a couple of stack overflow
things which basically like well you

00:31:14.139 --> 00:31:14.149
things which basically like well you
 

00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:16.680
things which basically like well you
could probably do it like this sort of

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:16.690
could probably do it like this sort of
 

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.820

it seems to be kind of the route we're

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:18.830
it seems to be kind of the route we're
 

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.849
it seems to be kind of the route we're
heading down I don't want to do I think

you know the heck now the issue on the
 

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.759
you know the heck now the issue on the

head that you end up not taking
 

00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:27.460
head that you end up not taking
advantage of all the Android yeah like

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:27.470
advantage of all the Android yeah like
 

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.930

yeah you're gonna end up with the worst

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:33.350
yeah you're gonna end up with the worst
 

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.180
yeah you're gonna end up with the worst
up in many ways yeah cause I mean is a

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:36.190
up in many ways yeah cause I mean is a
 

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.330
up in many ways yeah cause I mean is a
possible concrete question if so we've

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:40.340
possible concrete question if so we've
 

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.409
possible concrete question if so we've
got our controller right which is

00:31:41.409 --> 00:31:41.419
got our controller right which is
 

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:42.729
got our controller right which is
apparently going to have a reference to

00:31:42.729 --> 00:31:42.739
apparently going to have a reference to
 

00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:45.249
apparently going to have a reference to
the activity if we move off that

00:31:45.249 --> 00:31:45.259
the activity if we move off that
 

00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:46.690
the activity if we move off that
activity to a new one

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:46.700

can you manually for this trillion hear

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:54.769
can you manually for this trillion hear
 

00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:56.889
can you manually for this trillion hear
you call finish on it if you want to

00:31:56.889 --> 00:31:56.899
you call finish on it if you want to
 

00:31:56.899 --> 00:31:59.560
you call finish on it if you want to
kill it up it should finish itself if

00:31:59.560 --> 00:31:59.570
kill it up it should finish itself if
 

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.779
kill it up it should finish itself if
you really need to finish on itself and

00:32:01.779 --> 00:32:01.789
you really need to finish on itself and
 

00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:02.889
you really need to finish on itself and
then it'll don't trigger stop on the

00:32:02.889 --> 00:32:02.899
then it'll don't trigger stop on the
 

00:32:02.899 --> 00:32:05.470
then it'll don't trigger stop on the
destroy okay you want to shortcut around

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480
destroy okay you want to shortcut around
 

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.860
destroy okay you want to shortcut around
that a good way of doing it is

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:06.870
that a good way of doing it is
 

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.140
that a good way of doing it is
using a broadcast intent or are directed

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.150
using a broadcast intent or are directed
 

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.120
using a broadcast intent or are directed
intent back to the first activity so you

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.130
intent back to the first activity so you
 

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.520
intent back to the first activity so you
register a broadcast intent listener in

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:13.530
register a broadcast intent listener in
 

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.920
register a broadcast intent listener in
your activity the waits for a specific

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:15.930
your activity the waits for a specific
 

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.630
your activity the waits for a specific
intent to be broadcast and then we'll

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640
intent to be broadcast and then we'll
 

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.280
intent to be broadcast and then we'll
finish itself once it receives that

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:19.290
finish itself once it receives that
 

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:28.850
finish itself once it receives that
broadcast okay I've got concerns about

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860
broadcast okay I've got concerns about
 

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.940
broadcast okay I've got concerns about
us trying to manually manage uh-huh you

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:31.950
us trying to manually manage uh-huh you
 

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.520
us trying to manually manage uh-huh you
know the activity history when that's

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:34.530
know the activity history when that's
 

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:39.040
know the activity history when that's
already being controlled by the OS yes

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.050
 
 

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.210
 
it's me to me it sounds like a terrible

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220
it's me to me it sounds like a terrible
 

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:41.690
it's me to me it sounds like a terrible
idea

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700
idea
 

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.240
idea
but you can also you can also get into

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:44.250
but you can also you can also get into
 

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.680
but you can also you can also get into
memory problems with trying to keep

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:45.690
memory problems with trying to keep
 

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.140
memory problems with trying to keep
references to other activities it's it's

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.150
references to other activities it's it's
 

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.320

it's a road to hell yeah the minute

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:51.330
it's a road to hell yeah the minute
 

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.930
it's a road to hell yeah the minute
we've got my an activity with some UI

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:53.940
we've got my an activity with some UI
 

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.910
we've got my an activity with some UI
and a controller it's like yeah this

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:55.920
and a controller it's like yeah this
 

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.840
and a controller it's like yeah this
kind of works I mean it sounds to me

00:32:59.840 --> 00:32:59.850
kind of works I mean it sounds to me
 

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.610
kind of works I mean it sounds to me
like you're maybe facing a little bit of

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620
like you're maybe facing a little bit of
 

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.490
like you're maybe facing a little bit of
a pitfall in trying to attach your your

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500
a pitfall in trying to attach your your
 

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.580
a pitfall in trying to attach your your
business objects and logic to activities

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:07.590
business objects and logic to activities
 

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.520
business objects and logic to activities
I mean it seems to me like maybe what

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:10.530
I mean it seems to me like maybe what
 

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.740
I mean it seems to me like maybe what
you want is you want an object with some

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:12.750
you want is you want an object with some
 

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.960
you want is you want an object with some
kind of a state flow diagram that that

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:14.970
kind of a state flow diagram that that
 

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.330
kind of a state flow diagram that that
controls the different the different

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340
controls the different the different
 

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.190
controls the different the different
phases the different states that you are

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200
phases the different states that you are
 

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.260
phases the different states that you are
that your object goes through as the

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:21.270
that your object goes through as the
 

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.480
that your object goes through as the
different activities manipulate it maybe

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:23.490
different activities manipulate it maybe
 

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.220
different activities manipulate it maybe
you want to attach that to a service and

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:25.230
you want to attach that to a service and
 

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.919
you want to attach that to a service and
then use you know have your activities

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:27.929
then use you know have your activities
 

00:33:27.929 --> 00:33:30.470
then use you know have your activities
present the user interface but have them

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480
present the user interface but have them
 

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.660
present the user interface but have them
use intense - sighs - just the service

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:32.670
use intense - sighs - just the service
 

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:36.890
use intense - sighs - just the service
now or a published API and and then you

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:36.900
now or a published API and and then you
 

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.240
now or a published API and and then you
know let the service control the

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.250
know let the service control the
 

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.610
know let the service control the
lifecycle of your actual sort of

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620
lifecycle of your actual sort of
 

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.490
lifecycle of your actual sort of
abstract business object yeah that's

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:45.500
abstract business object yeah that's
 

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.590
abstract business object yeah that's
that's more or less what I've done so I

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600
that's more or less what I've done so I
 

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.250
that's more or less what I've done so I
thought you know we look into some

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260
thought you know we look into some
 

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.960
thought you know we look into some
unified lot of stuff so the Android

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:53.970
unified lot of stuff so the Android
 

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.240
unified lot of stuff so the Android
stuff I've written he's basically runs

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.250
stuff I've written he's basically runs
 

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.650
stuff I've written he's basically runs
like that so the services of the brains

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:57.660
like that so the services of the brains
 

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.200
like that so the services of the brains
and they you know mostly I'm raising up

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.210
and they you know mostly I'm raising up
 

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.150
and they you know mostly I'm raising up
intents to say I wanted a pin and I need

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:02.160
intents to say I wanted a pin and I need
 

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.280
intents to say I wanted a pin and I need
to do this and the activities shown in

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:04.290
to do this and the activities shown in
 

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.600
to do this and the activities shown in
this you know so yeah he does that

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:05.610
this you know so yeah he does that
 

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.169
this you know so yeah he does that
basically but they think I'm getting a

00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179
basically but they think I'm getting a
 

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.000
basically but they think I'm getting a
rolled under the wheels across platforms

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.010
rolled under the wheels across platforms
 

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:14.150
rolled under the wheels across platforms
yeah I think I might love it

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:14.160
yeah I think I might love it
 

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.160
yeah I think I might love it
I would think that coding up a service

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:16.170
I would think that coding up a service
 

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:20.650
I would think that coding up a service
would actually be like the the most

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:20.660
would actually be like the the most
 

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.120
would actually be like the the most
translation that you could get of your

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.130
translation that you could get of your
 

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.610
translation that you could get of your

from other platforms anyway wouldn't it

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:27.380
from other platforms anyway wouldn't it
 

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.890

yeah I think so so I mean so the stuff

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:30.900
yeah I think so so I mean so the stuff
 

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.310
yeah I think so so I mean so the stuff
with currently porting is based on a

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320
with currently porting is based on a
 

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:39.460
with currently porting is based on a
blackberry implementation and so that's

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:39.470
blackberry implementation and so that's
 

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.860
blackberry implementation and so that's
really kind of what you bite it seems in

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:42.870
really kind of what you bite it seems in
 

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.480
really kind of what you bite it seems in

00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940
I use location in my application and I
 

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.150
I use location in my application and I
use different providers like GPS and

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160
use different providers like GPS and
 

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.190

complicated so I used a viewpager
on one of my fragment activities and

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.250
on one of my fragment activities and
 

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.630
on one of my fragment activities and
basically it have five fragments inside

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640
basically it have five fragments inside
 

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.000

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:09.140
something like that
so do you know what the life cycle of

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.150
so do you know what the life cycle of
 

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.519
so do you know what the life cycle of
your pager and how I can populate

00:39:10.519 --> 00:39:10.529
your pager and how I can populate
 

00:39:10.529 --> 00:39:13.759
your pager and how I can populate
dynamically with you know with fragments

00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:13.769
dynamically with you know with fragments
 

00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:16.370
dynamically with you know with fragments
adding them maybe or deleting completely

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380
adding them maybe or deleting completely
 

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:21.680
adding them maybe or deleting completely
before orientation changes so the thing

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:21.690
before orientation changes so the thing
 

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.970
before orientation changes so the thing
I would do to check it quickly as the

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980
I would do to check it quickly as the
 

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.920
I would do to check it quickly as the

the page so potentially the non estate

00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:02.789
the page so potentially the non estate
 

00:40:02.789 --> 00:40:04.220

rotation well there is a special adapter

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500
rotation well there is a special adapter
 

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.970

and there's two different adapters right

00:40:12.529 --> 00:40:12.539
and there's two different adapters right
 

00:40:12.539 --> 00:40:15.710
and there's two different adapters right
there's a you're looking at Doc's right

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720
there's a you're looking at Doc's right
 

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.450
there's a you're looking at Doc's right
now yeah what the two classes that

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460
now yeah what the two classes that
 

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.230
now yeah what the two classes that
extend let me just tell it one of the

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240
extend let me just tell it one of the
 

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.849
extend let me just tell it one of the
things i was looking at was was

00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859
things i was looking at was was
 

00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:23.630
things i was looking at was was
wondering whether you're in the

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640
wondering whether you're in the
 

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.160
wondering whether you're in the
fragments you've got any reference back

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:25.170
fragments you've got any reference back
 

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.779
fragments you've got any reference back
to the context are you storing the

00:40:26.779 --> 00:40:26.789
to the context are you storing the
 

00:40:26.789 --> 00:40:28.730
to the context are you storing the
context in the oklahoma you know maybe

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740
context in the oklahoma you know maybe
 

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.460
context in the oklahoma you know maybe
you should if you're storing a reference

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:31.470
you should if you're storing a reference
 

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:32.930
you should if you're storing a reference
to the context that will keep it in

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940
to the context that will keep it in
 

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.490
to the context that will keep it in
memory so that all look mean it won't

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500
memory so that all look mean it won't
 

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.370
memory so that all look mean it won't
get cleared out okay yeah which will

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380
get cleared out okay yeah which will
 

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.049
get cleared out okay yeah which will
probably be your problem I thought about

00:40:39.049 --> 00:40:39.059
probably be your problem I thought about
 

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:42.380
probably be your problem I thought about
it yeah so definitely I use this one and

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:42.390
it yeah so definitely I use this one and
 

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.799
it yeah so definitely I use this one and
yeah now I understand why everything not

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:45.809
yeah now I understand why everything not
 

00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:49.099
yeah now I understand why everything not
anything working yeah thank you thank

00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:49.109
anything working yeah thank you thank
 

00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:54.000
anything working yeah thank you thank
you very much for this yeah okay

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.010
 
 

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.360
 
with state pager adapter so so basically

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:57.370
with state pager adapter so so basically
 

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.910
with state pager adapter so so basically
what the difference between them like I

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920
what the difference between them like I
 

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.580
what the difference between them like I
know that you know though they are the

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:02.590
know that you know though they are the
 

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:06.120
know that you know though they are the
state adapter won't load the nearest

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:06.130
state adapter won't load the nearest
 

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:10.320
state adapter won't load the nearest
next adapter is a as I think yeah so

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.330
next adapter is a as I think yeah so
 

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.910
next adapter is a as I think yeah so
they built for two different things so

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920
they built for two different things so
 

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.460
they built for two different things so
basically view pager doesn't really do

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:14.470
basically view pager doesn't really do
 

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:18.330
basically view pager doesn't really do
lots of do you recycling so the non

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:18.340
lots of do you recycling so the non
 

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.240
lots of do you recycling so the non
stateful one so in stateful one if

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:21.250
stateful one so in stateful one if
 

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.680
stateful one so in stateful one if
you're going through a very very long

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:22.690
you're going through a very very long
 

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.470
you're going through a very very long
list of pages you know you're gonna end

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480
list of pages you know you're gonna end
 

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.350
list of pages you know you're gonna end
up with memory problems because it's not

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:28.360
up with memory problems because it's not
 

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.680
up with memory problems because it's not
redoing this for different different

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:31.690
redoing this for different different
 

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.630
redoing this for different different
circumstances so if let's say four tabs

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640
circumstances so if let's say four tabs
 

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.430
circumstances so if let's say four tabs
which you're taking between then you can

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440
which you're taking between then you can
 

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.870
which you're taking between then you can
use the stay for one if you want to be

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880
use the stay for one if you want to be
 

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.790
use the stay for one if you want to be
able to like you know go through and

this for security I would say probably

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000
this for security I would say probably
 

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.970
this for security I would say probably
not is probably more for extensibility

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:53.980
not is probably more for extensibility
 

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.270
not is probably more for extensibility
I'm I'm just sort of going out on a limb

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280
I'm I'm just sort of going out on a limb

in the first go-around of an API there's

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880
in the first go-around of an API there's
 

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.670
in the first go-around of an API there's
a tendency to to make a few things

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680
a tendency to to make a few things
 

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.710
a tendency to to make a few things
public and then as the

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720
public and then as the
 

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.260
public and then as the
see I grow as you realize that it's

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:09.270
see I grow as you realize that it's
 

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.670
see I grow as you realize that it's
going to be harder and harder to give

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680
going to be harder and harder to give
 

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.560
going to be harder and harder to give
people access to these public members

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:12.570
people access to these public members
 

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.060
people access to these public members
then you start creating methods to

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:14.070
then you start creating methods to
 

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.790
then you start creating methods to
access them that's my guess

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800
access them that's my guess
 

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.859

question one thing that I did once when

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:04.650
question one thing that I did once when
 

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:06.730
question one thing that I did once when
I was trying to test an app that use

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:06.740
I was trying to test an app that use
 

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:11.150
I was trying to test an app that use
photo intents was rather than uses the

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160
photo intents was rather than uses the
 

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.040
photo intents was rather than uses the
built-in camera app I wrote myself a

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.050
built-in camera app I wrote myself a
 

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.630
built-in camera app I wrote myself a
teeny teeny tiny little app that

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640
teeny teeny tiny little app that
 

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.820
teeny teeny tiny little app that
actually caught that intent and just

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:16.830
actually caught that intent and just
 

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.010
actually caught that intent and just
sanded back an image that I had stored

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020
sanded back an image that I had stored
 

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.749
sanded back an image that I had stored
on my file system

00:45:20.749 --> 00:45:20.759
on my file system
 

00:45:20.759 --> 00:45:22.099
on my file system
which was kind of an interesting

00:45:22.099 --> 00:45:22.109
which was kind of an interesting
 

00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:25.130
which was kind of an interesting
learning exercise I hope to I hope to

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140
learning exercise I hope to I hope to
 

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.109
learning exercise I hope to I hope to
put up that code as a sample code

00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119
put up that code as a sample code
 

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:29.779
put up that code as a sample code
sometime that's I thought that was sort

00:45:29.779 --> 00:45:29.789
sometime that's I thought that was sort
 

00:45:29.789 --> 00:45:31.759
sometime that's I thought that was sort
of an interesting alternative to you

00:45:31.759 --> 00:45:31.769
of an interesting alternative to you

of an interesting alternative to you
know rather rather than using any form

00:45:33.499 --> 00:45:33.509
know rather rather than using any form
 

00:45:33.509 --> 00:45:35.029
know rather rather than using any form
of built-in camera app I just wrote my

00:45:35.029 --> 00:45:35.039
of built-in camera app I just wrote my
 

00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:39.190
of built-in camera app I just wrote my
own and all it does is return a file

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200
 
 

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.759
 
would be good for testing yeah it was

00:45:43.759 --> 00:45:43.769
would be good for testing yeah it was
 

00:45:43.769 --> 00:45:45.709
would be good for testing yeah it was
also quite revealing to learn just

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:45.719
also quite revealing to learn just
 

00:45:45.719 --> 00:45:48.259
also quite revealing to learn just
exactly how to pack that data into the

00:45:48.259 --> 00:45:48.269
exactly how to pack that data into the
 

00:45:48.269 --> 00:45:50.329
exactly how to pack that data into the
intent for return it was you know I I

00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339
intent for return it was you know I I
 

00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:52.759
intent for return it was you know I I
never knew before I sort of couldn't

00:45:52.759 --> 00:45:52.769
never knew before I sort of couldn't
 

00:45:52.769 --> 00:45:54.680
never knew before I sort of couldn't
figure out how it was done and I it took

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:54.690
figure out how it was done and I it took
 

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.479
figure out how it was done and I it took
me a while to actually wrap my head

00:45:56.479 --> 00:45:56.489
me a while to actually wrap my head
 

00:45:56.489 --> 00:45:58.370
me a while to actually wrap my head
around exactly how that needed to be

00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380
around exactly how that needed to be
 

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.870
around exactly how that needed to be
sent back yeah I I hope to happen in the

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880
sent back yeah I I hope to happen in the
 

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.809
sent back yeah I I hope to happen in the

added a moderator question to but the

00:46:30.259 --> 00:46:30.269
added a moderator question to but the
 

00:46:30.269 --> 00:46:32.450
added a moderator question to but the
question has to do with the animation

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460
question has to do with the animation
 

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.370
question has to do with the animation
framework and basically I want to

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380
framework and basically I want to
 

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.559
framework and basically I want to
implement having a fragment ops tree

I can I can definitely move things

00:46:51.979 --> 00:46:51.989
I can I can definitely move things
 

00:46:51.989 --> 00:46:53.630
I can I can definitely move things
around but the question is how do I get

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640
around but the question is how do I get
 

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.529
around but the question is how do I get

like in the old launcher so basically

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960
like in the old launcher so basically
 

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.680
like in the old launcher so basically
you click a button and slide in and then

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:15.690
you click a button and slide in and then
 

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.349
you click a button and slide in and then
another button to slide out so it kind

00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359
another button to slide out so it kind
 

00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:20.599
another button to slide out so it kind

of the width okay and so I and then I
 

00:47:29.039 --> 00:47:30.559
of the width okay and so I and then I
went click the button that I would just

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:30.569
went click the button that I would just
 

00:47:30.569 --> 00:47:33.109
went click the button that I would just
adjust it to the enemy animated from

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119
adjust it to the enemy animated from
 

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:43.490

don't make that oh you lost you Adam oh
 

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.700
don't make that oh you lost you Adam oh
sorry sorry yeah I'm the other that make

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:53.710
sorry sorry yeah I'm the other that make
 

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:59.090
sorry sorry yeah I'm the other that make
sense I'll give that a try oh cool okay

00:47:59.090 --> 00:47:59.100
 
 

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.590
 
yeah yeah one of the issues a family if

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:01.600
yeah yeah one of the issues a family if
 

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.660
yeah yeah one of the issues a family if
you are using the view dot animate

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:03.670
you are using the view dot animate
 

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.520
you are using the view dot animate
object which returns your view property

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:05.530
object which returns your view property
 

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.400
object which returns your view property
animator right and it's really really

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:08.410
animator right and it's really really
 

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.920
animator right and it's really really
nice and this is a very clean code but I

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:10.930
nice and this is a very clean code but I
 

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.920
nice and this is a very clean code but I

I suggested is it might not just be a

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:25.030
I suggested is it might not just be a
 

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.460
I suggested is it might not just be a
throughput problem might be a latency

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:26.470
throughput problem might be a latency
 

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.580
throughput problem might be a latency
problem and that may be you could also

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:29.590
problem and that may be you could also
 

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:32.250
problem and that may be you could also
try changing the size of the of the

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:32.260
try changing the size of the of the
 

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.410
try changing the size of the of the
chunks of data that you're sending you

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:34.420
chunks of data that you're sending you
 

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.240
chunks of data that you're sending you
know if you're getting high pings maybe

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:36.250
know if you're getting high pings maybe
 

00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:38.160
know if you're getting high pings maybe
send data in bigger chunks at a time so

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.170
send data in bigger chunks at a time so
 

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.900
send data in bigger chunks at a time so
that the client can spend longer playing

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:39.910
that the client can spend longer playing
 

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.610
that the client can spend longer playing
while it waits for the new data to come

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:41.620
while it waits for the new data to come
 

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.100
while it waits for the new data to come
in it sounds like you basically want to

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:44.110
in it sounds like you basically want to
 

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:46.230
in it sounds like you basically want to
implement and adaptive bitrate streaming

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240
implement and adaptive bitrate streaming
 

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.680
implement and adaptive bitrate streaming
so you can look at a protocol which does

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:49.690
so you can look at a protocol which does
 

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:53.130
so you can look at a protocol which does
that for you natively like agents or you

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:53.140
that for you natively like agents or you
 

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.500
that for you natively like agents or you
can try and make similar yourself by

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:55.510
can try and make similar yourself by
 

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.810
can try and make similar yourself by
using the connectivity manager to check

00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:57.820
using the connectivity manager to check
 

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.460
using the connectivity manager to check
the connection type that you have and

00:52:59.460 --> 00:52:59.470
the connection type that you have and
 

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.460
the connection type that you have and
then use that information to perhaps

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:02.470
then use that information to perhaps
 

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:06.660
then use that information to perhaps
stream of different quality source so

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:06.670
stream of different quality source so
 

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.790
stream of different quality source so
you don't do an immediate check as well

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800
you don't do an immediate check as well
 

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.590
you don't do an immediate check as well
yeah if it were information ready

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:10.600
yeah if it were information ready
 

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.290
yeah if it were information ready
