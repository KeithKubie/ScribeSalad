00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
I was like I think an amalgamation of
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
I was like I think an amalgamation of
like<00:00:44.480><c> different</c><00:00:45.480><c> minerals</c><00:00:45.899><c> or</c><00:00:46.140><c> something</c><00:00:46.440><c> if</c>

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 align:start position:0%
like different minerals or something if
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
like different minerals or something if
you<00:00:46.620><c> ever</c><00:00:46.739><c> they're</c><00:00:47.670><c> different</c><00:00:47.969><c> colors</c><00:00:48.379><c> so</c><00:00:49.379><c> I</c>

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 align:start position:0%
you ever they're different colors so I
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.690 align:start position:0%
you ever they're different colors so I
guess<00:00:49.710><c> it's</c><00:00:49.920><c> what</c><00:00:50.100><c> I</c><00:00:50.219><c> don't</c><00:00:50.430><c> know</c><00:00:50.520><c> if</c><00:00:50.610><c> you</c>

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
guess it's what I don't know if you
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.340 align:start position:0%
guess it's what I don't know if you
could<00:00:50.820><c> do</c><00:00:50.910><c> with</c><00:00:51.090><c> a</c><00:00:51.120><c> pearl</c><00:00:51.480><c> and</c><00:00:51.690><c> amethyst</c>
