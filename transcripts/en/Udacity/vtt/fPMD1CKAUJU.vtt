00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.950
Hey Christian.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.550
&gt;&gt; Hey Chelsea.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; Your box is done.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.473
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:05.700
&gt;&gt; What's going on here?

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.800
&gt;&gt; Well I, I've gotten some feedback and I was just wondering.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.500
&gt;&gt; You want to try it?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.370
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure. Wow. Where do I start? Okay.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.010
&gt;&gt; You tell me.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.280
&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that stands out is

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.190
this guy here. And I immediately want to lift

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.570
it. Okay. I'm turning this around. Oh gosh, this

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.990
looks dangerous, but I still want to touch it.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.230
kind of turning this around here. There's some text here. It looks like it's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.760
telling a bit of a story. There was a little pig, he was

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.000
chasing a wolf. It makes me kind of want to turn the box, here. Oh,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.732
and sparkles. Who doesn't love sparkles? Of course I want to touch this. Hmm.

00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:45.080
&gt;&gt; Lots going on.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And as we saw, people did various things with it.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.280
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.280
&gt;&gt; Well, there was a few things that I did intentionally here. One is,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.180
that I made these finger holes. Just the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.970
right size, and you'd grab it, like a bowling

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.750
ball. Well that's, human size. And here, it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.269
a little tempting to kind of touch it. And

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.990
maybe somebody would, want to, flitter with those. And

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.490
the balls kind of feel nice and well somewhere, here's

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.910
the squishy thing that you play with and you can even pick the box up from that,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.640
and there's a tail. So why do we grab this? It's got an affordance for,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.530
for grabbing. And there's one more thing. I'm using the power of story

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.090
here, because it says once upon, and you turn it. Once upon a time, there was a

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.960
little pig, who was chasing a wolf down a rabbit hole. Yeah.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.371
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:42.260
&gt;&gt; There's my box.
