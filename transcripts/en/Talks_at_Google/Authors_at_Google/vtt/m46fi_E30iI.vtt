MALE SPEAKER 1: Thank you
all very much for coming.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.775
A very special
presentation for you

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.200
today jointly
sponsored by Authors

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.370
at Google and Mosaic, our
diversity organization.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.020
We're going to have a
special double presentation

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.066
by Michael Erard,
linguist and author

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.150
of "Babel No More," a
book on hyperpolyglots,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.905
and Nataly Kelly, a translator
and the author of "Found

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:30.262
in Translation," a book about
the business of translation.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:34.982
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:38.800
MICHAEL ERARD: Thank you and
thanks for having us here.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.769
This is my first time
actually meeting Nataly,

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.060
although we corresponded a lot.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.590
And this is our first time
talking together about these--

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.520
and we happened to have done
these two books about language.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.490
And the overarching conceit of
polyglots versus translators

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.610
is that, even though the news
about languages in the world

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.080
is that they are dying
off at an alarming rate,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.129
there are still thousands and
thousands of languages, which

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.870
poses several ways of
dealing with that diversity.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.070
Google Translate is one.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.130
And then there are two other
paradigmatic human approaches,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.020
one of which is
the polyglot --just

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.290
learn all of the languages,
learn as many as you can--

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.960
and the translator,
somebody who is involved

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.450
in import-export business
across a few language barriers.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.949
And so we've set it up
as a contest in a way.

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:40.887
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:40.887 --> 00:01:42.345
NATALY KELLY: Vote
for translators.

00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:45.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.130
MICHAEL ERARD: But I
think the goal over all

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.172
is to talk about differences
and ultimately similarities

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:54.380
between the two approaches.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.150
So Nataly is going start by
talking about translators

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.932
and where translators come from.

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:04.384
NATALY KELLY: Sure.

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:07.565
And we have a little picture
that I'd like to show you,

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:12.510
a collage of some translators.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.590
And anybody have a guess
as to who these guys are?

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.339
They're not translators,
but they're often

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.130
called translators.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.630
AUDIENCE: Interpreters
for the deaf.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.486
NATALY KELLY: Yes.

00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:23.986
Yes.

00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:26.842
So these three all happen to
be interpreters for the deaf.

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:28.470
And the reason
that I picked them

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.030
is because you can see
the language that they are

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.590
communicating in, whereas
there are also spoken language

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.990
interpreters, like at
the United Nations.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.820
And a lot of people
call them translators.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.378
So anyone know the
difference between the two,

00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:46.614
translators and interpreters.

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:48.478
AUDIENCE: Simultainious
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:48.478 --> 00:02:51.230
NATALY KELLY: Interpreters do
work in simultaneous mode, yes.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.643
Anything else?

00:02:52.643 --> 00:02:55.300
AUDIENCE: Translators work with
text primarily, don't they?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.216
NATALY KELLY: Exactly.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:59.410
So the output for
translators is usually text.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.770
And the output for interpreters
is usually speech or sign

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.768
language.

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:05.929
So that's the basic difference.

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.470
Now, if you had to guess, where
do you think most translators

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.569
and interpreters
live in the world?

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.501
AUDIENCE: Washington D.C.

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:14.467
NATALY KELLY: Where?

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:15.509
AUDIENCE: Washington D.C.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.383
NATALY KELLY: There are
a lot of interpreters

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:18.814
in Washington D.C.
and translators

00:03:18.814 --> 00:03:20.746
for governmental
institutions, yes.

00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:21.897
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:23.480
AUDIENCE: Brussels
would be the other.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.540
NATALY KELLY: Brussels, yes.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.030
For the European
Parliament, especially.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.110
Anywhere else?

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.601
AUDIENCE: Brigham
Young University.

00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.149
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:33.565
NATALY KELLY:
Actually, yes That's

00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:36.660
a really good place
to recruit translators

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.170
because the Mormons
tend to go on missions

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.830
and they learn languages
usually at a pretty young age.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.121
So when I used to recruit
interpreters and translators,

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:47.210
I found a lot of really
good ones in Utah.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.150
AUDIENCE: Monterey.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.050
NATALY KELLY: And Monterrey!

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.466
Oh, you're familiar with "the
language capital the world,"

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:52.056
so to speak.

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:52.556
Yes.

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:54.500
So that's where the
Monterrey Institute is.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.022
That's where most of the
conference interpreters

00:03:56.022 --> 00:03:56.712
get trained.

00:03:56.712 --> 00:03:58.920
And that is also where the
Defense Language Institute

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.890
is housed.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.900
So the answer to where most
where most interpreters

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.950
and translators are is really
in two main areas of the world.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.660
And that is in North America and
in Western and Northern Europe.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.540
So the market is worth
$33 billion globally.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.240
And about half of that revenue
is generated-- or I should say

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.360
is sent to companies
within Europe.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.330
And about 40% percent
goes to the United States.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.080
And the reason the
United States is so big

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.220
is actually not because
of domestic reasons

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.895
but because of
military linguists that

00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:36.900
have been sent into
Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.230
So as military
activity decreases,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.860
we'll start to see less
spending on those areas.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.560
So all of these little
frames or video stills,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.520
they come from a video.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.740
If you look on YouTube and
you put "Found in Translation

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.320
YouTube," you'll see a video
of translators and interpreters

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.763
from around the world.

00:04:55.763 --> 00:05:01.600
The answer to where they
are born is really anywhere.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.560
And we're going to talk later
about how they are made.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.783
And I think that's a more
important question when

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:09.772
it comes to translators
and interpreters.

00:05:09.772 --> 00:05:12.230
Before I hand to Michael to
talk about where hyperpolyglots

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.912
are born and how they're
born-- a lot people like

00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:18.328
to ask to ask me, well, how
did you become an interpreter?

00:05:18.328 --> 00:05:19.839
How did you become a translator?

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.047
I am, of course, a certified
interpreter for Spanish.

00:05:22.047 --> 00:05:27.020
And I am a translator
for Spanish into English.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.130
And I come from a very
small town in the Midwest.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.695
Has anyone ever heard
of Mason City, Iowa?

00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:37.236
AUDIENCE: It was the inspiration
for River City in the "Music

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:38.756
Man"

00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:40.130
NATALY KELLY: Yes.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.720
So Mason City, Iowa
is like a metropolis

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.392
compared to where I'm from.

00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:45.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:45.314 --> 00:05:48.965
I'm from Mason City,
Illinois, which

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:52.990
has-- it's about one square
mile and 2,500 people.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.687
So I think that's
good testament to fact

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.520
that translators and
interpreters can really

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.561
come from anywhere, even
where there's absolutely

00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:01.520
no linguistic diversity
and relatively

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.520
little need for translation
and interpreting. [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.110
So I will hand it to Michael
to talk about hyperpolygots.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.570
MICHAEL ERARD: So I wrote a
book about hyperpolyglots,

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.960
less of polyglots
than hyperpolyglots,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.370
who are talented language
learners and massive language

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.340
accumulators.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.560
The floor for this accumulation
is somewhere between 6 and 11

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.620
languages, depending on
who's doing the counting

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.890
and also what the languages are.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.420
My position is that
these are people

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.494
who have possess
a neurology that's

00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:43.910
unique or different in order
to be able to do this, that's

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.120
something apart just from
language learning aptitude

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.360
but that might have something to
with brain plasticity factors,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.140
with working memory and
executive function skills,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.150
with auditory
cortex, the ability

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.560
to hear and discriminate
among sounds

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.510
in one's own native language
or in non-native languages.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.100
My position is that these
are people who are not born.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.040
And they're not made.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.340
But they're born to be made.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.040
So really there
are-- there should

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.250
be larger numbers of people
who posses this neurology all

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.450
round us but who never encounter
the right sort of environments

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:33.030
or conditions to practice
and develop what they have.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.600
There are a couple of
interesting but mostly

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.980
conjectural theories
that are offered

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.230
for what the components of
this particular neurology are

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.910
and how often it might
arise and with what

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.400
other sorts of conditions.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.000
But those are probably so
broad that science will never

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.280
probably explain
really what those are.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.490
But what is
interesting to consider

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.880
is that there might
be some genetic link

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.730
to this sort of
language ability.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.670
And since the book came
out, I've certainly

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.610
heard a lot of people who say,
I have this language ability,

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.110
but it runs in my family.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.232
I can do this.

00:08:15.232 --> 00:08:16.440
And my grandfather can do it.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.670
And it goes pretty far back.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.380
I come to this topic because
I was working as a language

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.850
journalist looking
for stories to write.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.080
And there was a discussion
on the LINGUIST List, which

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.055
is an email listserv
for linguists.

00:08:32.055 --> 00:08:36.080
And the question
came up in 2004--

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.555
who is the world's
most lingual person?

00:08:39.555 --> 00:08:44.205
Which seems like a very-- It's
a very straightforward question.

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:45.830
There should be
straightforward answer.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.370
We know how many--- we know
the person who can eat the most

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.772
hot-dogs in a minute.

00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:52.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.510
We know the oldest
person in the world.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.560
Surely, someone has gone
out and met this person

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.590
and measured what they can do.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.870
The only organization that
had taken any interest

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.010
in massive multilinguals
of this type

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.470
is the Guiness Book of
World Records, which is not

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.700
the organization you want in
charge of validating claims

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.800
about multilingualism.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.740
So the fact that you have these
characters, these people who

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.640
are these massive
language learners,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.240
but who were totally
ignored by linguistics

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.280
or applied linguistics or
second language acquisition,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.040
even though there are
some characters, some very

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.990
famous hyperpolyglots
who were themselves

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.120
linguists, was just a huge
hole and a huge opportunity

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.270
for storytelling
and actually try

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.330
to apply a little bit of
social scientific rigor to it.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:46.640
So that's what I set
out to do in the book.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.410
Oh, I should have
put this slide up.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.228
These are some of the people
that I either write about and

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:59.890
or met in the book.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.020
This guy right here-- I
spend quite a bit of time.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.640
You know who he is?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.520
Anyone?

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.320
Cardinal Mezzofanti
this Italian cardinal

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.200
of the 18th 19th
century, who was

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.580
so to speak 72 languages,
which is a number that

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.030
has a religious
significance because it's

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.420
said to number of languages was
created when the Tower of Babel

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.930
fell.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:30.120
This guy is Elihu Burritt, who's
the American, Yankee polyglot,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.840
a guy who was made famous by
the governor of Massachusetts,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.890
actually, because he
would spend 12 hours a day

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.690
working as a blacksmith
and then spend

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.790
another eight hours
every day studying.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.240
He apparently taught
himself how to read

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.200
in 50 different languages,
although his biographer said

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.330
it was probably something
like 30 languages.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.670
And if you ever see the
number of languages,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.470
just the size of the
numbers that occur,

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.675
so some skepticism is certainly
warranted and welcome here.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.360
So the question,
how are they made?

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.646
Want to talk about how
translators are made?

00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:11.602
NATALY KELLY: Sure.

00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:13.992
So translators are
definitely made.

00:11:13.992 --> 00:11:16.860
And the reason I told
you about my background

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.011
because you might
wonder how did I

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.187
go from in a real
monolingual town to becoming

00:11:21.187 --> 00:11:22.650
an interpreter.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.900
And I learned Spanish in school.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.167
And there were lots of migrant
workers in the surrounding

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:29.667
towns.

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:32.125
And so every chance I had, I
would speak Spanish with them.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:36.180
So from about age 12 to 16,
I was speaking Spanish a lot.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.930
And I became very
passionate about it

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.280
and interested in Spanish.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.570
And maybe this is a
characteristic that a lot of us

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.250
language nerds have that the
first time I got my book,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.160
my Spanish textbook, I remember
devouring it and calling up

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.120
one of my friends
and saying, hey,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.370
do you want to come over and
practice Spanish with me?

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.680
And of course their answer
was, no, why would I want that?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.020
Don't call me anymore.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:06.041
So I realized that not everybody
has that love for language.

00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:09.900
By the time that I got to
college, my professor who

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.060
screened me said, I
just advise to take

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.460
all of your gen-ed courses
in Spanish in Latin America

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.556
because your levels is
already really high.

00:12:18.556 --> 00:12:20.055
This'll be the way
to challenge you.

00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:22.420
So I did what he said
and I went to Ecuador

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.610
and I took my gen-ed
classes in Spanish.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.782
And while I was there
one of my professors

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.490
noticed she speaks
Spanish perfectly.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.930
And she's a native
English speaker.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.394
So why don't we
have her interpret

00:12:35.394 --> 00:12:36.935
for this conference
that's coming up?

00:12:36.935 --> 00:12:38.810
And to me it sounded
like, yeah, I

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.274
can speak both
languages perfectly.

00:12:40.274 --> 00:12:44.180
So it should be
easy for me, right?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.790
So, I didn't know what
the conference was about,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.700
had know idea what the
subject matter was.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.500
And I get there, and
they tell me, oh, this

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.335
is petroleum conference.

00:12:54.335 --> 00:13:00.020
And so we'll be discussing
mining and technical terms.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.930
And I thought, hmm, OK, I
know a little bit about that.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.370
It shouldn't be too hard.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.480
So a lot of people think
I speak both languages,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.320
I should be able to handle it.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.280
So I get there-- and
anyone here bilingual?

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.080
OK.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.100
So I get there, and I
hear terms like-- I'll

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.990
give you a couple examples.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:25.650
OK, so a quick quiz-- All of you
who have said you're bilingual,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.319
I'm going to give you a term.

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:30.172
And you say it in your
other language, OK?

00:13:30.172 --> 00:13:30.672
Derrick.

00:13:34.025 --> 00:13:36.430
Babbit.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.567
Rapple rig.

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:39.067
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:39.067 --> 00:13:39.566
AUDIENCE: Are these in English?

00:13:39.566 --> 00:13:41.024
NATALY KELLY: These
are in English.

00:13:41.024 --> 00:13:45.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:47.720
So you can imagine,
when I started

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.070
to hear what they were saying.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.540
And I'm standing up there.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.040
And, of course,
they didn't know how

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.770
to organize simultaneous
interpreters,

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.062
so I was standing up next
to them, and I thought,

00:13:58.062 --> 00:13:59.020
will I have headphones?

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.680
Will I have a microphone?

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.596
And they said, oh no,
just he's going to talk,

00:14:01.596 --> 00:14:02.917
and you just speak louder.

00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:04.348
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:04.348 --> 00:14:10.072
So I was completely unprepared,
you know, 19 years old.

00:14:10.072 --> 00:14:13.640
And I realized I
am out my depth.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.840
I have no idea how to do this.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.800
And, in fairness,
I did give it try.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.947
But I kept coming across
words that I didn't know.

00:14:19.947 --> 00:14:23.450
So I would have to
paraphrase and clarify.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.172
And then I basically said,
I shouldn't be doing this.

00:14:26.172 --> 00:14:27.964
And they thankfully
found someone else

00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:29.630
in the audience who
was an engineer, who

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.870
was very familiar
with the terminology.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.262
And he took over and
stepped in for me.

00:14:34.262 --> 00:14:37.930
So that was my introduction
to the world of interpreting.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.259
So a lot of people when that
happens realize, oh, this

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:41.800
isn't for me.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.720
I'm giving up.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.339
And in my case, it
made me realize, wow,

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:46.630
I really have a long way to go.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.054
So I'm going to learn.

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:48.720
I'm going study.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.469
I"m going to really
devote myself to this.

00:14:50.469 --> 00:14:51.327
So I did.

00:14:51.327 --> 00:14:52.910
I studied a lot
technical terminology,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.350
legal terminology, medical
terminology in both languages.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.640
And I would assert that
interpreters and translators

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.820
are made.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.320
They're definitely made.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.757
In a sense, you could
say that some of them

00:15:06.757 --> 00:15:08.340
were born too because
there are skills

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.125
that you need that are very
difficult to acquire over time,

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:17.010
especially for interpreting,
that your cognitive load has

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.026
to be able to grow and grow,
especially if you're going

00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:21.645
to be listening
to a long segment

00:15:21.645 --> 00:15:22.978
and rendering it back perfectly.

00:15:22.978 --> 00:15:24.686
You have to really be
able to retain that

00:15:24.686 --> 00:15:27.898
and be able to convert that
information in your head

00:15:27.898 --> 00:15:29.000
and transfer it.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.240
I think, actually, that
consecutive interpreting

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.490
is a harder skill, for that
reason, than simultaneous.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.027
Once you're skilled
at simultaneous,

00:15:35.027 --> 00:15:36.860
listening and interpreting
at the same time,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.345
it actually becomes
like second nature.

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:43.740
Consecutive takes a
lot, a lot, of practice.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.440
So to all the
bilingual volunteers,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.025
thank you for feeling
some of the pain

00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:49.733
that I felt when
I was interpreting

00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:50.945
for the first time.

00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:53.320
How many of you know how many
words there are in English?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.890
Anyone have a guess?

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:56.780
AUDIENCE: Ulimited.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.290
AUDIENCE: 500,000.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.060
NATALY KELLY: More.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.282
AUDIENCE: A million!

00:16:01.282 --> 00:16:02.281
NATALY KELLY: A million!

00:16:02.281 --> 00:16:03.280
Yes, right on the money.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.550
At least that's an
estimate that's out there.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.210
About a million
words in English.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.900
And most people-- any idea how
many worlds most people use.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.927
AUDIENCE: 2 and 10,000.

00:16:12.927 --> 00:16:13.510
AUDIENCE: 100.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.394
NATALY KELLY: Less,
less than 10,000.

00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:16.811
AUDIENCE: I said
between 2 and 10.

00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:17.685
NATALY KELLY: Oh, OK.

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:19.015
Yeah, so you're actually good.

00:16:19.015 --> 00:16:21.077
4 to 5,000 words.

00:16:21.077 --> 00:16:21.660
So good guess.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.388
Or good-- I'm sure
you knew that.

00:16:24.388 --> 00:16:27.636
And then how many
word do you think

00:16:27.636 --> 00:16:29.500
an educated person
with a college degree

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.446
uses on a regular basis?

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:33.150
AUDIENCE: 14,000

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.300
AUDIENCE: 20,000

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.484
AUDIENCE: 5 to 6,000.

00:16:36.484 --> 00:16:37.858
NATALY KELLY: Between 8 and 10.

00:16:37.858 --> 00:16:40.220
Between 8 and 10,000.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.530
And for some professions,
like doctors, attorneys

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.165
who a lot specialized
knowledge, how many words do you

00:16:46.165 --> 00:16:48.400
think they use on
a regular basis?

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.069
AUDIENCE: Same number,
just different words?

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:52.235
NATALY KELLY: A little more.

00:16:52.235 --> 00:16:53.640
A little more.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.790
They use about 23,000 words.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.144
So whenever you're become
specialized in the area,

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.020
you learn jargon.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.990
You learn trade language.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.550
So they do use a lot
of technical language.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.055
So any interpreter who's
working in a technical field,

00:17:09.055 --> 00:17:11.485
like court interpreter
or medical interpreter,

00:17:11.485 --> 00:17:16.180
they're actually using 23,000
words on a regular basis but in

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.750
more than on language.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.550
So I think it's really
important to think

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.569
about when we think about
skills required for interpreters

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.139
and how long it
takes master that,

00:17:26.139 --> 00:17:27.400
and for translators as well.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.680
Interpreters have the
additional challenge

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.480
for having to have this
information in their head

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.400
when they're working.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.127
Translators have to have a lot
of information in their heads

00:17:37.127 --> 00:17:39.210
because they have to work
quickly and efficiently.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.668
But they are assisted
by computers.

00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:44.020
They're assisted by computer
assisted computer assisted

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.802
translation tools,
terminology databases.

00:17:45.802 --> 00:17:47.760
All of these kinds of
tools are a standard part

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.290
of translators' workflow.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.220
So that gives you
and idea of how

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.150
interpreters and
translators are made.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.360
It basically takes a lot of
dedication, practice, and time

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.620
to acquire the skills.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.140
MICHAEL ERARD: And that would
be same for hyperpolyglots.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.020
There's no way that you
can get around putting

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.616
all that language
stuff in your head

00:18:09.616 --> 00:18:12.110
without just spending
a lot of time doing it.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.510
A lot of people
have been interested

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.190
and have asked me, so is
there some sort of secret

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.980
or some sort of method
that the hyperpolyglots had

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.230
that I could use?

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.770
Outside of drinking
more Belgian beer.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.000
I don't know if
that necessarily--

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
AUDIENCE: Isn't helpful.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.539
No I tried.

00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:32.330
MICHAEL ERARD: It
doesn't help [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.897
Yeah, so these are people
who, because they've

00:18:37.897 --> 00:18:39.480
spent so much time
learning languages,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.680
they have learned how
they learn uniquely.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.210
So they've honed in on the
methods that work for them

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.620
and for them uniquely.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.691
So you wouldn't necessarily want
to use their recommendations

00:18:52.691 --> 00:18:56.399
because their recommendations
might actually be bad for you.

00:18:56.399 --> 00:18:57.690
They might not just be neutral.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.220
They might actually
be bad for you.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.806
But these people, some
of them are autodidacts.

00:19:03.806 --> 00:19:05.180
Some of them take
classes and are

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.820
very happy in groups of people.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.590
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
what's an autodidact.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.390
MICHAEL ERARD: Someone
who teaches themselves.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.848
AUDIENCE: Sounded
like 8,000 words.

00:19:11.848 --> 00:19:12.537
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:14.620
MICHAEL ERARD: Someone who
teaches him or herself.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.111
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:15.602
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah.

00:19:15.602 --> 00:19:16.584
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any examples

00:19:16.584 --> 00:19:18.584
of some of these language
acquisition techniques

00:19:18.584 --> 00:19:21.640
that might be good for one
of these hyperpolyglots

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.170
but very bad for somebody else?

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:23.390
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.889
So one of the guys
that I interview,

00:19:24.889 --> 00:19:28.110
Alexander Arguelles,
there's a YouTube video

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.750
of him talking about his daily
linguistic workout, which

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.920
involves studying like 20
languages in 20 minute chunks.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.855
Every day he gets up
at 3:00 in the morning

00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:38.786
and starts doing this.

00:19:38.786 --> 00:19:40.820
He does something
called shadowing.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.320
And I actually did it with him.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.580
And it worked for me too.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:48.414
But the idea is that you take
a recording in the language

00:19:48.414 --> 00:19:49.580
that you're trying to learn.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.594
And you put it on, listen to it.

00:19:52.594 --> 00:19:53.385
And you go outside.

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:58.050
And you walk with really
exaggerated gestures like that.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:02.160
And then you repeat
what you're hearing

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.440
at the same time
you're hearing it.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.890
So there's a couple-- so you're
just automatizing the sounds.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:16.980
And there's something about
link between the kinesthetics

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.937
and the acoustics in the brain.

00:20:20.937 --> 00:20:23.270
So and then you would go, and
you would look at the text

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.750
and actually look at
what is being said.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.250
It also has this
interesting effect

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.920
of inoculating you
or neutralizing

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.420
some of embarrassment that you
would feel when you are using

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.419
a foreign language, since
you're marching around

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:36.174
outside in public.

00:20:36.174 --> 00:20:39.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.860
AUDIENCE: No wonder he starts
at 3:00 in the morning.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.460
MICHAEL ERARD: Walking in this
Monty Python-esque sort of way.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.573
And a range of--
there was Emil Krebs.

00:20:50.573 --> 00:20:52.156
I didn't put a picture
of him up here.

00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:56.640
But he was a German
diplomat in China.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.560
And he used to favour
walking around this study,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.580
studying totally naked, drunk
on German beer, in his case,

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:14.540
and working on the refreshing
the language that he was

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.146
working on at a
particular moment.

00:21:17.146 --> 00:21:19.990
And he used to spend so much
time doing is during the night

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.710
that, when it came time to
actually do his translator job,

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.240
yeah, he was one cranky guy.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.844
And he was cranky guy anyway.

00:21:30.844 --> 00:21:32.320
He was not that
fun to be around.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:39.830
And there's lots of
idiosyncratic individuals

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.300
in a lot of ways.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:48.730
But made, or born to be made,
they need to make themselves--

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.310
and they face a lot of same
challenges everybody else does,

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.760
which is, where
you find the time?

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.430
How do you have a life
given this pursue as well?

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.310
And how do you keep the
languages in your brain?

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.740
One of them talked
about her having

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.740
a central set of
active languages

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.394
and set of languages
that were "on ice"

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:14.762
that they could activate
at any particular time.

00:22:14.762 --> 00:22:17.220
AUDIENCE: Why do say they do it?

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.290
MICHAEL ERARD: Why
they say they do it?

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.960
A lot of different reason.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.550
They're not raised in
bilingual environments.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.080
Some of them are just
clear-- they're clearly

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.830
to systems and to patterns
and pattern recognition.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:41.630
There's a way in
which some of them

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.720
have figured out that
there's this sort

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.235
of social behavior
called language.

00:22:46.235 --> 00:22:50.430
And maybe it doesn't
come quite as naturally

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.820
to them as to other people,
but if you figure out

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.185
the rules of this sort
of social behavior,

00:22:56.185 --> 00:22:58.800
you can actually fit in.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.900
There are lots of different
sets of rules to learn.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.400
When you learn those
different sets,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.040
you have lots of interactions
with lots of different people.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.770
They like to travel.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.470
They like to feel competent.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.160
I think there's also a way
in which a lot of people

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.540
that I met --outside of the
fact that they're just highly

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.920
verbal-- it's like
there's not enough

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.120
time to say everything they
want to say in English.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.710
But there's this
child-likeness, in a sense,

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.490
which you take a couple ways.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.300
One is, I want to explore.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.260
I want to be curious.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.630
But it's also like, I don't
want to be a competent adult.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.890
I don't want to be judged
as a competent adult.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.665
And someone who is marked
a non-native speaker

00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:47.455
and as a learner of a language,
hopefully, in most situations,

00:23:47.455 --> 00:23:50.030
or in a lot of
situations, not at all,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.030
will be accorded a certain
kind of accommodation,

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.760
so they don't have to
perform like adults do.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.330
And that's just
some of the people.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.290
There are other people who are--

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.250
AUDIENCE: You are
describing what

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.210
I feel are a lot who
successfully gotten

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.170
through the Google
review process.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.830
And I think that's an
interesting sort of question.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:18.950
At point where would
there be more interest

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.285
in natural languages and
actual human languages

00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:24.580
if there weren't computer
languages to soak up

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:30.577
a lot of that neurology and
systematizing intelligence.

00:24:30.577 --> 00:24:31.160
Somebody else?

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.743
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have one real quick.

00:24:32.743 --> 00:24:34.817
So here's a story I
read about years ago.

00:24:34.817 --> 00:24:36.816
And I was wondering if
you heard the same story.

00:24:36.816 --> 00:24:39.746
It's about this [INAUDIBLE]
in a prison cell.

00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:41.704
In the prison cell a
couple men in another cell

00:24:41.704 --> 00:24:43.117
were condemned to
die for some reason.

00:24:43.117 --> 00:24:44.783
And they were talking
amongst themselves

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:48.155
in a language that he had
heard before. [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:48.155 --> 00:24:50.321
He basically acquired the
knowledge of this language

00:24:50.321 --> 00:24:54.683
and was able to argue to the
captors about their situation

00:24:54.683 --> 00:24:55.609
as it applied to that.

00:24:55.609 --> 00:24:56.692
Have you heard this story.

00:24:56.692 --> 00:24:58.654
It was back ancient times.

00:24:58.654 --> 00:24:59.695
Well, not ancient times--

00:24:59.695 --> 00:25:02.635
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah, so I
have a different version

00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:03.437
of that anecdote.

00:25:03.437 --> 00:25:05.395
Let me do that anecdote
and then we'll move on.

00:25:05.395 --> 00:25:08.110
But I heard the
version of the anecdote

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.180
about Cardinal
Mezzofanti, this priest.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.957
So it wasn't about
overhearing a conversation.

00:25:13.957 --> 00:25:16.140
It was about two
prisoners who had

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.790
been condemned to
die in the morning.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.760
And that no one had heard
their confession yet.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.219
And no one could because
no one knew their language.

00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:27.260
So Mezzofanti went in and
learned their language.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.130
And then at dawn was able to
send them off to the gallows.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.370
AUDIENCE: From listening to them
talk, he'd somehow [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.220
That seems more
believable to me.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.780
MICHAEL ERARD: Oh
what, Mezzofanti?

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.150
AUDIENCE: Well, the
story that you told?

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.020
MICHAEL ERARD: Rather
than just overhearing it.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.519
Yeah.

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:50.400
AUDIENCE: But there's the
case of Kenneth Hale, who

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.570
was an MIT linguist who claimed
to have been able to pick up

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.350
languages just by
listening to people.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.918
I mean, really?

00:25:56.918 --> 00:25:58.834
I always wondered if
that was really the case.

00:25:58.834 --> 00:25:59.417
He's dead now.

00:25:59.417 --> 00:26:00.302
So we can't ask.

00:26:00.302 --> 00:26:00.802
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:00.802 --> 00:26:02.677
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah,
I've got a whole section

00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:06.840
in the book about Hale, who's a
really interesting case of what

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.860
happens to people when
certain number of languages

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.160
gets attached to their name.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.560
It becomes this oppressive thing
that they can quite escape.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.460
He, actually, himself, said I
can only speak three languages.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.750
He was also a modest
guy, so people

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:27.500
take that to mean that just as
the performance of his modesty.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.445
But if you take it
in a different way,

00:26:30.445 --> 00:26:32.690
he was actually making a
legitimate linguistic claim

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.440
about his ability.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.390
I can only speak
three languages.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.550
I can talk in many
more languages.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.770
And the ability to
talk in those languages

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.521
is actually much
easier to acquire.

00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:47.020
And he didn't do
it just by listing,

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:52.430
but did it through actively
eliciting stuff from people.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.100
So the next question
that we have

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:59.790
is how many languages
do they know?

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.660
And you have
something like that.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.890
NATALY KELLY: Yeah.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.530
Well, I guess my answer to
this question is-- define know.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.540
So it's kind of like what
Ken Hale struggled with.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.435
I can't really
claim that I'm fully

00:27:12.435 --> 00:27:13.815
fluent in these languages.

00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:16.593
But I do happen to know
a little bit of them.

00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:18.230
And I maybe can navigate.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.524
I said 4 to 5000 is what we
typically use in English.

00:27:21.524 --> 00:27:24.050
Or what people use in
English on a regular basis.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.980
4 to 5000 words is that much to
learn, when you think about it.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.950
So you could navigate
in most languages.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:36.840
But can you say the word
derrick in your other language.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.435
So when it comes to
translators and interpreters

00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:42.566
it's not the number of
languages that they know,

00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:45.810
it's the depth at
which they know them.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.548
Anybody have a guess as to
how many languages on average

00:27:48.548 --> 00:27:50.920
most translators and
interpreters know?

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.600
Or let me put it this way,
how many languages they

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.560
use for their work.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.976
In other words,
how many languages

00:27:55.976 --> 00:27:58.321
do they translate
into and out of?

00:27:58.321 --> 00:27:59.259
AUDIENCE: Two

00:27:59.259 --> 00:28:00.200
AUDIENCE: Two

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.130
AUDIENCE: Two or three.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.747
NATALY KELLY: I hear five, three
and, the correct answer, two.

00:28:06.747 --> 00:28:07.330
AUDIENCE: 1.5.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.080
NATALY KELLY: 1.5!

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:13.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.560
Yes, and [INAUDIBLE]
was that only goes way.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.630
So for translators,
for people who

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.895
are producing what
kind of output.

00:28:20.895 --> 00:28:21.520
AUDIENCE: Text.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:21.860
NATALY KELLY: Text.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.359
Written.

00:28:22.359 --> 00:28:23.350
Yes.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.735
So for translators,
they are generally

00:28:25.735 --> 00:28:28.870
going into their
native language.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.130
So generally, it's because
if you want written language,

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.570
you want it to sound
natural and native.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.540
There are some disadvantages
to that, actually,

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.210
though, because if they're going
into their stronger language

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:44.140
there's potential for
comprehension errors.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.496
But that's the standard.

00:28:45.496 --> 00:28:47.230
That's how most
translators work.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.180
So I worked from Spanish into
English most of the time.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.860
Now conference
interpreters-- anybody

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.260
have an idea how they go?

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.180
What direction they go in?

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.370
So they go from their
passive languages, languages

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:06.170
they can understand into
their active languages.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.492
So comprehension, as
a lot of us know--

00:29:08.492 --> 00:29:10.075
how many of you have
studied languages

00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:13.134
and can understand a lot
but I just can't speak.

00:29:13.134 --> 00:29:15.217
And some people are
uncomfortable speaking and not

00:29:15.217 --> 00:29:16.680
comprehending.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.100
And so you have
different types of skills

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.490
when you're learning a language.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.350
So conference
interpreters generally

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:28.429
do go into a couple-- they have
a couple of passive languages.

00:29:28.429 --> 00:29:30.650
And they go into
their native language.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:32.235
So like a United
Nations interpreter

00:29:32.235 --> 00:29:36.218
might be listening
in French and English

00:29:36.218 --> 00:29:41.508
and interpreting into
Arabic, for example.

00:29:41.508 --> 00:29:43.007
Community interpreters,
interpreters

00:29:43.007 --> 00:29:45.810
who work in courts and
hospitals and who are actually

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.820
the most popular type of
interpreter, the most common,

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.370
that you'll find in schools
and all around, all around us.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.507
They go in both directions.

00:29:54.507 --> 00:29:57.780
They have to interpret in
and out of both languages.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.852
So I gave you some examples
of technical terminology,

00:30:00.852 --> 00:30:05.860
but you can imagine a court
room anything can come up.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.222
In addition to having
to know all the law

00:30:08.222 --> 00:30:10.747
and all the legal terminology
that could come up,

00:30:10.747 --> 00:30:12.214
you also have to
know anything that

00:30:12.214 --> 00:30:14.660
could come in testimony,
given as evidence,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.647
and all those kinds
of technical test.

00:30:16.647 --> 00:30:18.480
They bring in a expert
witness, you suddenly

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.660
have to know all that
terminology that the expert

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.220
witness knows in both languages.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.688
So one of the big
skills that interpreters

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:29.040
have to have --because it's
kind of impossible to know

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.990
everything about a language,
and in fact, in some languages,

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.630
you don't even have exact
linguistic equivalents

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.230
for things-- is
one of the skills

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.550
is paraphrasing, being
able to explain something

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.425
quickly and convey the meaning.

00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:47.145
So one of the first tests that
I took as an interpreter--

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.200
I was being tested
over the phone

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.990
on telephone interpreting.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.479
And there was a sentence
that just tripped me up.

00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:54.270
It was in my brain.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.436
But I couldn't remember the
word for hardware store.

00:30:56.436 --> 00:30:59.310
And this was in the
midst of a long sentence.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.810
I went to the hardware store
and I bought, blah, blah, blah.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.879
So I know all the
other words, but I

00:31:03.879 --> 00:31:05.170
didn't remember hardware store.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.835
So I had to say, a place where
you buy tools and materials

00:31:08.835 --> 00:31:10.480
for building.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.670
But I had to come up
with that really quickly.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.910
And I felt so horrible
that I missed that term.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.157
But they said, no actually,
that's one of the skills

00:31:17.157 --> 00:31:18.740
that you need as an
interpreter, to be

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.470
able to do that in
real time, on the fly.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.883
So "Taboo" is an
excellent game to practice

00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:25.424
if you want to become
an interpreter.

00:31:25.424 --> 00:31:27.312
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:27.312 --> 00:31:29.647
So the answer to
this question-- there

00:31:29.647 --> 00:31:31.480
are, of course,
interpreters and translators

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.110
who do work in more than
just one combination.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.498
And, as I mentioned,
conference interpreters

00:31:36.498 --> 00:31:38.446
tend to go a couple
passive languages

00:31:38.446 --> 00:31:39.446
into an active language.

00:31:39.446 --> 00:31:44.049
But in general the average,
on the whole, is two.

00:31:44.049 --> 00:31:46.715
Yeah.

00:31:46.715 --> 00:31:48.715
AUDIENCE: If get all the
conference interpreters

00:31:48.715 --> 00:31:50.212
together and all
of the community

00:31:50.212 --> 00:31:52.545
interpreters together, do you
have all the interpreters?

00:31:52.545 --> 00:31:53.962
Or are there
categories left over?

00:31:53.962 --> 00:31:54.961
NATALY KELLY: There are.

00:31:54.961 --> 00:31:56.550
There's something
called --I don't

00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:00.580
like this term-- but escort
interpreter, who's basically

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.370
someone who accompanies
a business person.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.660
What happens is there's not
enough of that kind of contract

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.644
work to really keep an
interpreter in play.

00:32:09.644 --> 00:32:12.575
Most interpreters and
translators are freelancers.

00:32:12.575 --> 00:32:14.700
There are some, of course,
who have full time jobs,

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.955
like at hospitals and courts.

00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:18.981
But the majority
are freelancers.

00:32:18.981 --> 00:32:20.900
So you have other
types of interpreting,

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.725
but those are the
two biggest by far.

00:32:22.725 --> 00:32:24.890
And, of course, there's
telephone interpreting,

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.840
which that was my first
interpreting jobs, which

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:33.190
I interpreted for 991
calls, insurance agencies.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.650
Anything you can
do over the phone,

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.655
those calls get interpreted.

00:32:36.655 --> 00:32:38.280
I was working at the
time for a company

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.703
called AT&amp;T Language Line,
a division of AT&amp;T. So

00:32:42.703 --> 00:32:43.536
that's another type.

00:32:43.536 --> 00:32:46.440
And video interpreting
is becoming more popular.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.600
I will say, Sign Language,
because of the ADA,

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.830
there are interpreters who
work in many more settings

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.750
than for spoken
languages in the US.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.539
Under the American with
Disabilities Act, deaf and hard

00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:02.080
of hearing individuals
have the right

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.880
to an interpreter anywhere.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.690
So their rights cannot
be denied to them.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.220
Now under Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act,

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.820
individuals who are not
proficient in English, limited

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.436
English proficient,
LEP, individuals

00:33:16.436 --> 00:33:19.820
have the right to an interpreter
or translator or language

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.470
access, someone who
speaks their language,

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:27.260
anywhere, an institution
or a company that

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.712
receives any federal money.

00:33:29.712 --> 00:33:32.310
So that means that every state
agency, county agency, city

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:36.798
agency, is required to provide
language assistance to people

00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:37.798
who don't speak English.

00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:40.258
That's under Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act,

00:33:40.258 --> 00:33:43.702
to prevent discrimination on
the basis of national origin.

00:33:43.702 --> 00:33:46.270
AUDIENCE: And that's
federal grant, not

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.268
federal contract, as in
somebody selling something.

00:33:49.268 --> 00:33:51.986
NATALY KELLY: Actually, it
can be any federal money.

00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:56.030
So even if you a small
contact, you got a small grant

00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:00.110
for like ecofriendly
lighting or something,

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.450
you are required, if
someone comes to your door

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.755
and speaks another language, to
provide them with assistance.

00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:09.171
And usually the way that's
done, because not everybody can

00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:11.254
afford to employ interpreters
or bilingual people,

00:34:11.254 --> 00:34:13.830
is they simply sign
up for a service,

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.960
where they access an
interpreter over the phone.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.469
So that usually meets the
compliance requirements.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:24.071
So I've answered more than
how many languages I know.

00:34:24.071 --> 00:34:25.404
MICHAEL ERARD: You have a table.

00:34:25.404 --> 00:34:26.929
You have tracked it.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.770
NATALY KELLY: I do actually.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.270
Yeah.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.405
So this is basically
what I just covered.

00:34:31.405 --> 00:34:34.877
Translators-- the format is text
to text, non-native to native.

00:34:34.877 --> 00:34:38.349
Subtitle translators, which is
another form of translation--

00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:40.002
quite popular,
especially as video

00:34:40.002 --> 00:34:42.810
is becoming more important
on the web-- speech to text,

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.104
non-native into your
native language.

00:34:45.104 --> 00:34:47.630
Conference interpreters--
speech to speech.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.150
Generally, everybody uses
their native language.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.520
And community interpreters
sometimes do text to speech

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.516
because if I'm in hospital and
somebody brings in medication

00:34:56.516 --> 00:34:58.266
that they brought form
their home country,

00:34:58.266 --> 00:35:02.160
I have to read that information
and then render in speech,

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.360
so that the doctor
can understand.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.070
So that goes non-native into
native and back and forth.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:14.000
AUDIENCE: How do you classify
the subtitle translator who's

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.590
just going English to English.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.162
text.

00:35:16.162 --> 00:35:17.620
NATALY KELLY: Well,
they're usually

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.350
just doing subtitle
transcription.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.760
So they're not
usually not grouped

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.140
in the same category
as translators.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.265
Usually, not always,
but 99% of the time

00:35:29.265 --> 00:35:33.720
translators are going from
one language into another.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.510
There are cases where they go
from a variant into another.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:42.170
So I've been asked, for
example, to neutralize Spanish

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.550
from, let's say, Argentina and
make it appropriate for the US

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.950
market, which is largely Mexico
but also many, many other types

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:49.450
of Spanish.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.662
And, believe it or not,
there's a huge degree

00:35:51.662 --> 00:35:53.340
of linguistic variation.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:57.000
We have more than 40 words
for popcorn in Spanish.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.150
And there are lots of
words that mean something

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:02.409
harmless in one variety of
Spanish that means something

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:04.110
completely offensive in another.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.303
And, believe me,
that is a minefield.

00:36:07.303 --> 00:36:09.235
So, yeah.

00:36:09.235 --> 00:36:10.240
And you have?

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.740
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah, ask this
question of how many languages

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.750
hyperpolyglots know.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:24.770
This is the profile of a
European Commission translator,

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.902
his languages
arranged in the order

00:36:27.902 --> 00:36:31.720
that he learned them on
three different dimensions,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.220
his speaking ability,
his listening

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.100
ability, and his
reading ability.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.670
These are all self reports.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:47.770
I gave him a self report
version of the test

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.744
of functional abilities
that the US Government uses.

00:36:50.744 --> 00:36:54.940
And I don't have translating.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.747
And I don't have
writing [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:59.747 --> 00:37:03.190
that self assessment test
had not been adapted yet.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:08.476
But you see a lot of variation
across all of his abilities,

00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:11.395
even within languages.

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:15.030
And you can see some
biographical-- I mean,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.650
when you know some
n things pop out.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.630
One is that of
all the languages,

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.542
he spent a long time living
in a Spanish speaking country.

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.375
So even though he doesn't
use that language,

00:37:26.375 --> 00:37:29.820
his reported proficiencies
that were fairly high.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.215
And he's also
married to a Slovak.

00:37:33.215 --> 00:37:36.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.272
He speaks Slovakian at home.

00:37:38.272 --> 00:37:39.730
And interestingly,
even though this

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:44.730
is a guy who-- he says that he
translates from 13 languages

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.370
into English.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.670
So this is somebody's
who is linguistically

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.060
prodigious by one measure.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.910
He working on Chinese right now.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:57.100
And Chinese is kicking his butt.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.270
He's older.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.905
He's also not just
learning speaking,

00:37:59.905 --> 00:38:03.370
but he's trying become
literate as well.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.030
Given that sort of
work that he does,

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.742
that would be important to do.

00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:07.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was going to ask,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.050
how do have a proficiency
rating in speaking

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.687
but not in listening?

00:38:11.687 --> 00:38:12.520
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.496
AUDIENCE: And what
is the [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:14.496 --> 00:38:14.990
AUDIENCE: I think
it's interesting.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.978
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:15.978 --> 00:38:18.793
AUDIENCE: Well, that's my
experience with sign language.

00:38:18.793 --> 00:38:20.918
MICHAEL ERARD: I've know
a lot of people like that.

00:38:20.918 --> 00:38:21.543
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:21.543 --> 00:38:23.647
AUDIENCE: It's not
that hard to learn

00:38:23.647 --> 00:38:25.230
how to make some of
the sounds but not

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.402
be able to hear
them back at speed--

00:38:27.402 --> 00:38:28.860
AUDIENCE: That's
impossible for me.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.062
AUDIENCE: --and interpret
it in [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:30.062 --> 00:38:30.534
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:30.534 --> 00:38:31.480
MICHAEL ERARD:
That's interesting.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.646
AUDIENCE: You some phrases--

00:38:32.646 --> 00:38:35.741
AUDIENCE: So how does
Latin come into this?

00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:38.206
Because I think it's
the underlying language.

00:38:38.206 --> 00:38:41.164
It's called dead
language, unfortunately.

00:38:41.164 --> 00:38:42.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.800
But as medical translation, for
example, and medical students

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.190
really speak Latin a lot.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.640
So really saying, I'm
translating from English

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.380
to you actually knowing
another underlying language,

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.415
you have to, right?

00:38:56.415 --> 00:38:57.206
NATALY KELLY: Yeah.

00:38:57.206 --> 00:38:57.850
Yeah.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.326
AUDIENCE: I, mean is
it really that dead?

00:39:01.326 --> 00:39:04.728
NATALY KELLY: I can answer
on the translation side.

00:39:04.728 --> 00:39:07.160
And you probably have
something to say as well.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.030
Definitely.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:13.296
Languages with Latin roots often
do use the Latin terms or terms

00:39:13.296 --> 00:39:15.220
that are very closely related.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.190
So it's very common in
Spanish, for example,

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.670
the words, the roots sound very
technical if you translate them

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.160
directly, like the word for
ear nose and throat in Spanish

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.550
is [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.384
So you use the Latin roots.

00:39:30.384 --> 00:39:33.372
And also like
[SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:39:33.372 --> 00:39:36.835
You can say that in English
and it might confuse people

00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:39.223
but in Spanish it sort
of makes more sense

00:39:39.223 --> 00:39:40.639
because the roots
are still there.

00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:45.050
So translator actually have
to sometimes de-Latinize

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.840
when they're going from a Latin
language into medical English,

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.710
so that it doesn't sound
higher register than it

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:52.847
should in English.

00:39:52.847 --> 00:39:53.985
Yeah.

00:39:53.985 --> 00:39:56.040
MICHAEL ERARD: In the case
of the hyperpolyglots,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.990
Latin shows up in
a different way.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.520
So a lot of the
historical hyperpolyglots,

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.720
you see in their
repertoire, you see

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.510
a lot of Latin and
ancient Greek, which

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.670
was a matter of the
educational system.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.720
But it turns out that
those two languages

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.740
are pretty powerful because
you get access Indo-European

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.640
and very old Indo-European
roots and things like that.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.080
Latin-- certainly because
of the lexical stuff.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.190
But the grammar, dealing
with Latin grammar,

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.810
sets you up very nicely.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:33.650
To work with languages that
have also very rich case

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.726
system like Russian and other
Slavic languages, for instance.

00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:41.748
And so just as a matter of
developing the habits of mind

00:40:41.748 --> 00:40:44.164
for learning all of that stuff
and crunching through that,

00:40:44.164 --> 00:40:45.628
Latin turned out to
be really useful.

00:40:45.628 --> 00:40:46.294
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:46.294 --> 00:40:49.532
I'm from the Czech
Republic, speaking of.

00:40:49.532 --> 00:40:53.436
And I know that the
medical schools, when

00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:57.624
study medicine, one year
you have study Latin.

00:40:57.624 --> 00:40:58.540
MICHAEL ERARD: Uh huh.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.040
Yep.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:08.323
AUDIENCE: You hear-- I ask if
it's true that hyperpolyglots

00:41:08.323 --> 00:41:11.650
have next couple of
languages a wish list.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.920
Once you decide that this
is something you like to do,

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.180
it's like the next movie.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.456
I'm actually a program
language junkie.

00:41:19.456 --> 00:41:21.710
I probably don't have
enough skill to actually--

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.626
MICHAEL ERARD: Well the
URL hyperpolyglot.org,

00:41:23.626 --> 00:41:26.640
I was like, ah, this is cool--
it's for program languages.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.119
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:31.269
AUDIENCE: I will literally
buy a programming manual

00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:32.560
in the beginning of the summer.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.838
And read it until the
return of vacation.

00:41:34.838 --> 00:41:36.179
MICHAEL ERARD: Yep.

00:41:36.179 --> 00:41:39.560
AUDIENCE: And only a couple
people [INAUDIBLE] so--

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.129
But I have that in
my head, oh, that

00:41:44.129 --> 00:41:46.670
would be interesting to learn
that one and that and that one.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.590
Is it same thing?

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:48.390
Did you ask?

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.690
Did they say, oh, yeah.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.000
And is it for structural
reasons or cultural reasons?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.672
Are there languages that's like,
that one's really hard so it's

00:41:56.672 --> 00:41:59.005
really interesting challenge,
even though I never expect

00:41:59.005 --> 00:42:01.260
to travel there, or is it more--

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.120
MICHAEL ERARD: There's
all kinds of reasons.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.320
But I think what's important is
that hyperpolyglots are often

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.840
criticized or mocked for
having trophy languages--

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.669
that once you know
Italian, well,

00:42:13.669 --> 00:42:15.835
all of the other Romance
languages are jut a breeze.

00:42:15.835 --> 00:42:17.910
So they say that
they know those.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.940
But on the survey that I
did of about 300 people,

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.270
I asked people for all of
their languages in the order

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.560
that they learned them.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.640
And you actually find people
hopping back and forth

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.270
between language families.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.290
So they don't have the
kind of mop-up approach.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.740
They actually switch, which
is based on-- sometimes

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.340
they want to explore
historical roots.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.160
Sometimes it's about
access to materials.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.020
So one guy, whose
picture was there,

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:53.000
he wanted to study languages
with historical links

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.570
to Turkish.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:58.351
But all those languages were in
what was then Soviet control.

00:42:58.351 --> 00:43:00.517
So all the grammar and
dictionaries were in Russian.

00:43:00.517 --> 00:43:01.433
So he learned Russian.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.300
AUDIENCE: So it's funny.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.268
In programming, we also
use the term polyglot

00:43:07.268 --> 00:43:10.712
but to mean a program that is
valid in multiple languages.

00:43:10.712 --> 00:43:13.815
It's something that
is to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:13.815 --> 00:43:14.648
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah.

00:43:14.648 --> 00:43:16.140
Yeah.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.160
And you get similar
kinds of questions.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.310
And I've seen some of them.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:21.730
Is it possible to
really program?

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:24.620
What does it mean to know
a programing language.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.060
Is it really possible to know.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.770
And I see people bemoaning
the hyperpolyglot approach

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:33.660
because it means that nobody
knows one language really well.

00:43:36.512 --> 00:43:37.887
AUDIENCE: Would
you say that it's

00:43:37.887 --> 00:43:41.750
typical for a hyperpolyglot to
span so many different language

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.250
families?

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.223
Because I count at
least five up there.

00:43:45.223 --> 00:43:46.130
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.020
They have these repertoire
that are-- Mezzofanti

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.520
had something like 11 language
families in seven scripts,

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.880
assuming that he was
literate in all of them.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.490
And a lot of them have
that same kind of span.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:03.136
You're talking multiple writing
systems and multiple language

00:44:03.136 --> 00:44:04.090
families.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.416
AUDIENCE: What triggers that?

00:44:06.416 --> 00:44:08.692
MICHAEL ERARD: It's a big world.

00:44:08.692 --> 00:44:11.551
AUDIENCE: Also I think
term language family

00:44:11.551 --> 00:44:16.024
is a very [INAUDIBLE]
active formation.

00:44:16.024 --> 00:44:21.491
The difference between a
bunch of languages [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:21.491 --> 00:44:22.311
care to admit.

00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:23.727
There are language
is more defined

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:24.852
by geopolitical boundaries.

00:44:24.852 --> 00:44:27.460
And maybe it's similar
with language families.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.712
I know that in India
Indo-European and Dravidian

00:44:29.712 --> 00:44:31.462
languages share so
much common vocabulary.

00:44:31.462 --> 00:44:33.794
If someone was really to
slow down a Hindi speaker,

00:44:33.794 --> 00:44:35.544
I could probably
understand at least a bit

00:44:35.544 --> 00:44:37.544
of what they're saying
in terms of vocabularies.

00:44:37.544 --> 00:44:41.340
NATALY KELLY: But across
language families,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.992
sometimes you can
get nothing for free.

00:44:42.992 --> 00:44:43.413
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:43.413 --> 00:44:43.913
That's true.

00:44:43.913 --> 00:44:44.680
Yeah.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.850
MICHAEL ERARD: Oh,
even within families.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:46.390
NATALY KELLY: No,
across families.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.980
MICHAEL ERARD: Oh,
across families.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:47.875
Right.

00:44:47.875 --> 00:44:49.360
Yeah.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.690
AUDIENCE: I worked at a
speech company before.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.371
And the average
person on our team

00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:54.870
knew something like
seven languages.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:56.450
I felt terrible, right?

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:58.465
Like I knew one and a
smattering of Spanish.

00:44:58.465 --> 00:45:02.900
But a lot of it was honestly
driven by where the market was,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.692
like they had a
lot of excitement

00:45:04.692 --> 00:45:06.650
that-- I'll bring aboard
Indonesian opportunity

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:09.770
to really learn and do
Indonesian and go over

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.210
there and work with
people gather samples.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.210
And so they would get excited
and go to a new market.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.210
It was like, oh, we
can break into that.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.689
And really have a excuse to live
there for while collect data.

00:45:21.689 --> 00:45:23.358
It's kind of amazing.

00:45:23.358 --> 00:45:25.441
The guy's, yeah, a couple
of weeks got Indonesian.

00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:28.340
MICHAEL ERARD: And that would
be sort of the environment

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.211
where a hyperpolyglot
would do better.

00:45:31.211 --> 00:45:34.690
Someone who was a translator or
interpreter could go into that,

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.175
but they wouldn't necessarily
have gravitated towards that.

00:45:37.175 --> 00:45:37.672
NATALY KELLY: Not necessarily

00:45:37.672 --> 00:45:39.422
MICHAEL ERARD: --given
that their learning

00:45:39.422 --> 00:45:41.111
is much deeper in any language.

00:45:41.111 --> 00:45:43.236
NATALY KELLY: I think
another piece is availability

00:45:43.236 --> 00:45:45.805
of language resources
to learn because--

00:45:45.805 --> 00:45:46.680
MICHAEL ERARD: Right.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.305
NATALY KELLY: --I'm
not a hyperpolyglot

00:45:48.305 --> 00:45:51.682
but I maybe someday
will become one I hope.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:52.890
I've studied seven languages.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:57.692
And I remember looking at the
college course list in Ecuador.

00:45:57.692 --> 00:45:58.900
And they have five languages.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.400
And I thought, yes,
I want all of them.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.620
It was because they were
ones that were offered.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.900
That included
Japanese and German

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.060
and French and
Italian and Arabic.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.660
And so they were all
diverse but I thought,

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.005
I'll take whatever I can get.

00:46:13.005 --> 00:46:14.870
If they had offered
Quechua, I would

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.905
have taken that, probably
instead of Japanese.

00:46:16.905 --> 00:46:22.548
But I think that might be a
driving factor for some people.

00:46:22.548 --> 00:46:23.048
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:30.270
MICHAEL ERARD: Do want--
we have two topic areas.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.850
Yeah.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:37.920
We should pick one.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.476
Or ask them to pick one.

00:46:39.476 --> 00:46:42.760
Do you want hear about why they
matter from our perspective?

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.781
Or do you want to hear
about our assessment

00:46:44.781 --> 00:46:46.780
of the future of translators
and hyperpolyglots.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.268
AUDIENCE: I want
do to [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:47.268 --> 00:46:47.976
AUDIENCE: Future.

00:46:47.976 --> 00:46:49.762
AUDIENCE: Future.

00:46:49.762 --> 00:46:51.686
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:51.686 --> 00:46:53.591
AUDIENCE: I have
leave early anyway.

00:46:53.591 --> 00:46:54.091
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.496
MICHAEL ERARD:
[INAUDIBLE] future.

00:46:56.496 --> 00:46:58.901
AUDIENCE: Future.

00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:01.320
NATALY KELLY: What is the
future of translators?

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.981
I guess I really want to
answer the question of why

00:47:03.981 --> 00:47:04.480
they matter.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.308
But I will just tell you
that's answered in the book.

00:47:06.308 --> 00:47:06.807
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:06.807 --> 00:47:09.210
That's what the
whole book explains

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:11.845
is their importance
on our everyday lives.

00:47:11.845 --> 00:47:15.551
But as for what's the
future-- I have a chapter

00:47:15.551 --> 00:47:17.800
on that at the very end of
the book, in which-- anyone

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.340
know the name Franz Och?

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.670
The creator of Google Translate?

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:25.530
So I actually interviewed
him in Mountain View

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.294
and talked to him about
the future of translation.

00:47:28.294 --> 00:47:30.540
I also interviewed
Ray Kurzweil, who

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:35.140
is now a Googler as well--
has since become one.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.530
And I talked to them about
their view of the future

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.180
and what what's going to
happen with translation.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.240
So anyone think that
translators and interpreters

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.750
will be replaced?

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:45.540
Eventually?

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.641
Some day?

00:47:47.641 --> 00:47:48.266
It's OK.

00:47:48.266 --> 00:47:49.516
You can say if you believe it.

00:47:49.516 --> 00:47:50.278
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.278 --> 00:47:51.486
AUDIENCE: Translators, maybe.

00:47:51.486 --> 00:47:52.852
But I don't think interpreters.

00:47:52.852 --> 00:47:54.435
NATALY KELLY: That's
what a lot people

00:47:54.435 --> 00:47:56.630
say because of the
complexity of speech.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:00.340
And text as much
easier to automate.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.525
There are a few types
of machine translation.

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:05.780
Google Translate is called
statistical machine translation

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.050
based on lots of data.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.900
And there's is also something
called rules-based machine

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.010
translation, in which basically
you write the rules in detail

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:19.590
for who to treat different
verbs, subject-verb agreements,

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.006
gender, all of the
those kinds of things.

00:48:22.006 --> 00:48:23.872
And then there's
a hybrid approach

00:48:23.872 --> 00:48:24.830
to machine translation.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.980
And there are a lot of
efforts to automate speech,

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.470
and in fact Google has
been involved in some.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.126
And some of them
are quite successful

00:48:31.126 --> 00:48:35.120
but for very limited domains
and for very specific language

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.070
pairs.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.600
And also this whole thing
about speaking comprehension,

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.470
these different abilities,
look at computers.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:46.890
Computers can usually
produce spoken language

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.520
much more easily than they
can comprehend because

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.590
of all the different variations
in people's speech patterns.

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:54.674
And that might be why you
see some people evaluate

00:48:54.674 --> 00:48:56.298
their listening and
their comprehension

00:48:56.298 --> 00:48:58.490
lower than their speech
because in some cases

00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:59.900
it can be quite hard.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.240
There's a lot of
individual variation.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.690
So the future of translator,
I think, is quite bright.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.970
I follow the market
as a researcher.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.390
And the language services
market for translation

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:14.630
and interpreting has been
growing at double digit growth

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:20.080
rates, compound annual growth
rates, for the last 10 years.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.210
And as more people getting
access to information,

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.970
translation is
becoming more and more

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:29.520
and in the translation
community, a lot of people

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.780
absolutely hate
Google Translate,

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.430
because they think it leads
to really poor translations

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.090
that a human could
have done better.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.830
And so they absolutely
cannot stand Google Translate

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:43.022
because of the impact that they
see and people thinking, oh,

00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:43.980
well, that's just easy.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.202
You just drop it in
Google Translate.

00:49:46.202 --> 00:49:48.160
But I think that
Google Translate

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.960
and other such free
services are actually

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.150
creating a bigger
market for translation

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.920
because it's increasing the
awareness of, oh, it maybe

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.570
doesn't have to be so hard.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.560
So what's happening is a lot
of people are using that.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.590
Maybe they put the content
up on their website.

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:06.850
Customers can find them
because of SEO increases.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.010
But then, suddenly,
customers are complaining,

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.120
oh, you have a
mistranslation here.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.119
This doesn't make sense.

00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:14.650
So then they're actually paying
for professional post editing

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.500
is what it's called,
a human translator

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.090
cleans up the machine
translation output.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.530
Or they're simply
paying a human to do it.

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:23.360
So that actually
writing awareness,

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.730
driving market demand, for
professional human services.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:32.190
And Ray Kurzweil agreed with me.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:35.850
He believes that
there is definitely

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:39.120
a point where machine
translation of text

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.170
will equal human output,
because, remember,

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.680
human output isn't
perfect either.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.490
And a lot that is
very subjective.

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:51.140
But he does believe that
simultaneous interpretation

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.990
of speech across languages
will probably not

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:58.440
reach what humans can do.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.344
So that's an assessment
in the future.

00:51:02.344 --> 00:51:03.760
MICHAEL ERARD: I
think what's cool

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.625
listening to you talk about
the future of translators

00:51:08.625 --> 00:51:13.950
an translators is that there are
really no cliches or platitudes

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:17.610
that you touch on or have
to use to promise a future.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.990
But I think if you talk about
the future of hyperpolyglots,

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:24.425
you have to talk about the
world shrinking and access

00:51:24.425 --> 00:51:27.820
to information--
lots of cliches.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.620
I think it's a similarly
bright sort of future,

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:36.520
to the degree that people
have better access and faster

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:42.090
access to language resources
and to native speakers online.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:46.048
So you can actually do
more without getting up.

00:51:46.048 --> 00:51:50.570
And I think also the kinds
of organizational and

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:54.850
institutional environments
that use and develop

00:51:54.850 --> 00:52:00.070
the hyperpolyglots neurology
are increasing as well.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:05.310
So those people who might have
that aptitude who would just

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.180
be out there and never
get the opportunity

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:12.070
are actually going to
have to that increasingly.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:13.530
On the flip side
of that, though,

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.210
is the thing that came earlier
was the degree to which

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.530
interest in programming
languages soaks up---

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:24.880
and it would be interesting
to talk about why programming

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.590
languages are more attractive
than human languages.

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:32.880
And I think the boundedness
and the discrete of one

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.959
versus the other
is-- and we could

00:52:35.959 --> 00:52:41.240
talk about that-- is definitely
what makes one more attractive.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:41.740
Yes.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.090
AUDIENCE: Do many of
these hyperpolyglots

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.030
make a living at it?

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:48.320
Or is it an avocation?

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.060
MICHAEL ERARD: Yeah, so one
of the slides that we skipped

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.300
was where they work
or where do find them?

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.080
And I split them
into two groups.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.710
There are
institutionalized ones--

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:02.235 --> 00:53:04.130
--like Graham.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.630
So they work in an organization
that is multilingual,

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.810
where being multilingual
and learning languages

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.820
is an expected part of the job.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:15.120
He has two months
professional development

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.620
to go to another
country to learn either

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.358
on language that he has
or a language that he

00:53:20.358 --> 00:53:21.570
wants to learn.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:24.285
And he may never
actually ever translate

00:53:24.285 --> 00:53:25.500
with that language but--

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.506
AUDIENCE: What
organization is he?

00:53:26.506 --> 00:53:28.130
MICHAEL ERARD: The
European Commission.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:29.420
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.260
MICHAEL ERARD: And
that's just expected.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.208
So he's not a dilettante.

00:53:34.208 --> 00:53:36.860
He's not considered
in that environment.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:41.430
And there are
people who are d, So

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:46.030
the guy who did the shadowing,
that marching thing,

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.840
when I met him he was
unemployed, doing translation

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.210
in Korean.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:57.560
He's now employed as a
linguistics professor in Oman.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.970
A lot of them are academics.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.240
Some of them are translators.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.970
So one of the ways
in which is there's

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.470
a certain amount of similarity
between the translators

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:08.500
and the hyperpolyglots
is the hyperpolyglots,

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.880
for exactly that sort
of reason, end up

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.100
doing translation work of
various types-- translation

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.910
work and not interpretation.

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:21.886
I don't know that I met
anyone who is an interpreter.

00:54:21.886 --> 00:54:22.880
NATALY KELLY: Yeah.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.359
Translation if have enough
time and you're not--

00:54:26.359 --> 00:54:29.360
maybe if you're doing maybe
not on a professional level

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.730
for all languages.

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.280
A lot poets, for example,
will translate poetry

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.103
because they can basically
find other translations,

00:54:37.103 --> 00:54:39.067
compare them, use a
dictionary, use resources.

00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:41.522
They have the luxury of time
to really research things

00:54:41.522 --> 00:54:44.959
and understand them thoroughly
and introduce a translation.

00:54:44.959 --> 00:54:46.432
So it is possible.

00:54:46.432 --> 00:54:48.396
Most professional
translators, however,

00:54:48.396 --> 00:54:52.530
don't have that luxury because
they to reach a certain number

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:57.132
words per hour in
order to make a living.

00:54:57.132 --> 00:55:00.590
AUDIENCE: How many
words per hour is that?

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:04.032
MICHAEL ERARD: Well the average
is about 2,500 words per day.

00:55:04.032 --> 00:55:05.406
And that hasn't
changed much even

00:55:05.406 --> 00:55:08.030
with computer assisted
translation tools and machine

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:10.490
translation tools
that they're using.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:11.950
AUDIENCE: Has the
accuracy gone up,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:14.248
like is that metric
that's measured, right?

00:55:14.248 --> 00:55:15.987
NATALY KELLY: You
know there is lack

00:55:15.987 --> 00:55:18.070
of measurement of
these types of things.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:20.480
The market is very
fragmented, so there

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.646
aren't a lot of good studies
out there to show that.

00:55:22.646 --> 00:55:25.051
But one of the
benefits of using tools

00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:26.975
is precisely accuracy
and consistency

00:55:26.975 --> 00:55:30.750
of terminology, which is
really important, especially

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:34.619
when you've got your [INAUDIBLE]
guidelines that differ from one

00:55:34.619 --> 00:55:36.035
company to another,
companies that

00:55:36.035 --> 00:55:37.750
create their own terminology.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.690
And we have a lot of
examples in the book

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:42.650
of this kind of
thing-- translators

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:44.913
for Harlequin romance
novels, interpreters

00:55:44.913 --> 00:55:48.845
who interpret for
astronauts, interpreters

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:51.243
who interpret for celebrities.

00:55:51.243 --> 00:55:53.170
And translators and
interpreters work in

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.620
just so many different
technical areas

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:59.280
that that is an
ongoing challenge

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.680
to make sure they have
consistent terminology

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.640
and using other sources to make
sure they're, whatever they're

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.896
producing, is in alignment
with other information that's

00:56:08.896 --> 00:56:09.396
out there.

00:56:09.396 --> 00:56:10.872
AUDIENCE: How do they, like,
feed this back somewhere?

00:56:10.872 --> 00:56:13.004
Because that's
the important part

00:56:13.004 --> 00:56:15.300
to improving computer
aided translated, right?

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.290
NATALY KELLY: Yes.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.070
This is the thing.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.383
So most of the files
that they're creating

00:56:19.383 --> 00:56:21.070
are called translation
memory files,

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.480
so it's basically a
database of translation.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.657
So they have a column
with the source language

00:56:26.657 --> 00:56:28.240
and a column with
the target language.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.030
So the tools that
they use will show

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.540
them a fuzzy match
or a perfect match.

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.995
It will show, oh,
98% of this segment

00:56:34.995 --> 00:56:36.995
looks like something that
you translated before.

00:56:36.995 --> 00:56:38.960
And it will pop up
and will show that.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.420
And then they can just
simply correct or tweak it

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.260
to make it perfect.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:46.864
So translators amass these
transition memory files.

00:56:46.864 --> 00:56:49.435
Sometimes they delver
them back to the client.

00:56:49.435 --> 00:56:51.280
Sometimes they don't.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.720
So there's all this data
--I know you guys can see

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.690
the problem with this--

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:59.705
that isn't being
shared with anyone

00:56:59.705 --> 00:57:02.750
and is being stored, usually,
on individual personal computers

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:04.660
in people's homes.

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:07.180
And Google actually has
something called the translator

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.406
toolkit, which is
designed to help people

00:57:10.406 --> 00:57:13.610
be able to store
this and leverage it.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:16.060
But there are
entrenched providers

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.510
that have been
there for decades.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:21.980
And they tend to use those
tools that are installed locally

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.222
on their local computer.

00:57:24.222 --> 00:57:27.771
So there is a tendency to
move things toward the cloud.

00:57:27.771 --> 00:57:29.610
And I think then we
can harvest that.

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:30.350
Information.

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:32.510
But let's not forget--
one of the other reasons

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:35.370
that people like to preserve
that information is because

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:37.316
of confidentiality in
the a lot of the stuff

00:57:37.316 --> 00:57:38.410
that they're translating.

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:42.240
So there is this debate of how
much should go to the cloud

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.700
And how much do we we
want to keep secure.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.969
And there's a lot of
discussion about that.

00:57:46.969 --> 00:57:48.677
AUDIENCE: That would
be a really cool way

00:57:48.677 --> 00:57:49.907
to leak a nuclear secret.

00:57:49.907 --> 00:57:52.180
It's like a big secret--
oh, it turns out

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.980
we have a translation
for all things

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.296
nuclear between [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:55.296 --> 00:57:56.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:56.784 --> 00:57:58.344
NATALY KELLY: Oh and believe me.

00:57:58.344 --> 00:58:00.260
There are lots of
interpreters and translators

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.710
who are doing that work.

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:05.080
I used to get
recorded transcripts

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.810
from intelligence agencies.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:08.492
Or I would get the
recordings, and I

00:58:08.492 --> 00:58:09.465
would have to create
the transcripts.

00:58:09.465 --> 00:58:11.700
So this is another variant
that I didn't put there,

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.660
where you're listening
and you're transcribing

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.366
and you're translating
at the same time.

00:58:15.366 --> 00:58:16.990
So and I would hear
all kind of things.

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:18.656
Of course, I didn't
have the big picture

00:58:18.656 --> 00:58:22.510
to know what this was
related to-- if you

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:24.090
would harness all
that information.

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:26.370
And the CIA,
intelligence agencies,

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:28.358
have had a really hard
problem with this.

00:58:28.358 --> 00:58:29.849
They haven't been able to
recruit enough translators

00:58:29.849 --> 00:58:32.085
and interpreters, especially
for critical languages

00:58:32.085 --> 00:58:35.090
like [INAUDIBLE] and Pashto--
and even Arabic, which

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:37.130
is a pretty widely
spoken language.

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:39.970
But not everybody
wants to do that work.

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:42.880
So yeah.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.670
MICHAEL ERARD: Well,
thank you very much.

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:45.170
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:47.365
[APPLAUSE]
