TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.380
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.010
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.110
Happy birthday, TensorFlow.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.030
It's been a year since
your open sourcing,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.340
and you're the most popular
machine learning project

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.725
on GitHub.

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:17.100
Take a look at
this post to learn

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.580
more about where TensorFlow
has been and where it's going.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.440
Also on the ML
front, take a look

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.230
at this article for all the
updates to the Google Cloud

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.040
machine learning family,
including a new API, pricing,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.960
and GPUs.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.350
The post has all the details.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.475
And if you're new to machine
learning all together,

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.599
perhaps you'll want to
start by just playing around

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:38.520
with some experiments.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.630
Well, you're in luck.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.130
Our friends at The
Creative Lab have

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.660
released some really
fun experiments

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.740
with machine learning.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.590
You play with them
right away or go deeper

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.970
with the GitHub links.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.580
A video with the details
and links to the experiments

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.710
are on the post.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.110
Distributed denial of
service attacks are bad,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.670
but they're arguably worse
when they're self-inflicted.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.820
To avoid this common software
architecture design failure,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.459
take a look at this post
from our customer reliability

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.040
engineering team.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.280
There is now an officially
supported Firebase Unity SDK

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.430
that provides packages for
Firebase features on iOS

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.920
and Android, including
Firebase Analytics,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.500
the real-time database
and dynamic links.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.820
To get started today,
head on over to the post.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.480
And if you're new
to Firebase, you

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.610
may want to take a gander
at this new Udacity

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.775
course, "Firebase in a weekend.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.900
It'll help you understand
many of the core features

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.770
of Firebase by building
an app from the ground up.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.160
The slide's API V1 is
now generally available

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.070
and represents the first time
that developers have ever

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.310
been able to programmatically
access slides.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.470
To learn more about
what this API can

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.670
do with code and a video,
head on over to the post.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.690

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.936
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.928
Thanks for watching the show.

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:06.660
