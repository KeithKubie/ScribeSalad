00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video we're going to
talk about another way of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.860
visualizing data called the
histogram, which is a very

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.290
fancy word for a not
so fancy thing.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.140
I think it's probably fair to
say that the histogram is the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.840
most used way of representing
statistical data.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.390
Let me just show you how to
figure out a histogram for

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.800
some data, and I think you're
going to get the

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.520
point pretty easily.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.740
So I have some data
here and I want to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.530
represent it with a histogram.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.880
What we're going to see
is how frequent are

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.050
each of these numbers.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.570
And in order to figure that
out, let me just write the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.700
numbers down, let me just
categorize them in their

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.370
respective buckets.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.820
So I have a 1 here.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.010
I have a 4, so I want to leave
space for the 2, the 3, and

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.430
put a 4 there.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.820
I have a 2.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.220
I have a 1.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.280
Let me put that 1 on a stack
right above that 1.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.880
I have a 0-- let me put the
0 to the left of the 1.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.370
I want to put them in order.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.650
I have a 2, another 2.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.930
Let me stack that above
my first 2.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.100
I have another 1.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.750
Let me stack that above
my other two 1's.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.930
I have another 0.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.180
Let me stack it there.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.430
I have another 1.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.360
Then I have another 2.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.700
Another 1.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.020
I have two more 0's.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.910
0, 0.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.175
I have two more 2's.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.110
I have a 3.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.360
I have two more 1's.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.830
Another 3.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.510
And then I have a 6.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.050
So no 5's, and then
I have a 6.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.480
And that space right there
was unnecessary.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.670
But right here I've listed--
I've just rewritten those

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.620
numbers and I've essentially
categorized them.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.950
Now what I want to do is
calculate how many of each of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.660
these numbers we have. So
let me go down here.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.539
So I want to look at
the frequency of

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.789
each of these numbers.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.110
So I have one, two,
three, four 0's.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.660
I have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven 1's.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.250
I have one, two, three,
four, five 2's.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.740
I have one, two 3's.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.370
I have one 4, and one 6.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.520
So we could write it this way.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.200
We could write the number,
and then we

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.450
can have the frequency.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.060
So I have the numbers 0, 1, 2,
3, 4-- we could even throw 5

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.420
in there, although 5 has
a frequency of 0.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.780
And we have a 6.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.950
So the 0 showed up four times
in this data set.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.570
1 showed up seven times
in this data set.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.890
2 showed up five times, 3 showed
up to two times, 4

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.560
showed up one time, 5 didn't
show up, and 6

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.820
showed up one time.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.740
All I did is I counted this
data set, and I did this

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.760
first. But you could say how
many times do I see a 0?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.600
I see it one, two, three,
four times.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.940
How many times do I see a 1?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.290
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven times.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.690
That's what we mean
by frequency.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.260
Now a histogram is really just
a plot, kind of a bar graph,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.980
plotting the frequency of
each of these numbers.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.780
It's going to look a lot
like this original

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.400
thing that I drew.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.090
So let me draw some axes here.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.040
So the different buckets
here are the numbers.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.930
And that worked out because
we're dealing with very clean

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.570
integers that tend to repeat.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.520
If you're dealing with things
that the exact number doesn't

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.650
repeat, oftentimes people
will put the numbers

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.450
into buckets or ranges.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.190
But here they fit into
nice little buckets.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:08.540
You have the numbers 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.870
This is the actual numbers.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.505
And then on the vertical
axis we're

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:15.190
going to plot the frequency.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.430
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.690
So that's 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.370
So 0 shows up four times.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.860
So we'll draw a little
bar graph here.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.980
0 shows up four times.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.140
Draw it just like that.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.210
0 shows up four times.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.150
That is that information
right there.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.540
1 shows up seven times.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.680
So I'll do a little bar graph.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.520
1 shows up seven times.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.630
Just like that.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.740
I want to make it a little bit
straighter than that-- 1 shows

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.190
up seven times.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.335
2-- I'll do it in a different
color-- 2 shows up five times.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.260
Do a bar graph, go all
the way up to five.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.910
2 shows up five times.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.650
3 shows up two times.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.210
We have one 3, two 3's.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.240
4 shows up one time here.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.680
5 doesn't show up at all.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.100
So it doesn't even get
any height there.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.140
And then finally, 6
shows up one time.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.140
So I'll do 6 showing
up one time.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.460
What I just plotted here,
this is a histogram.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.850
This right here is
a histogram.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.890
Very fancy word, but I think you
will agree it's a fairly

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.100
simple idea.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.940
Figure out the frequency of each
of these numbers and then

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.840
plot the frequency of each of
these numbers and you get

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.090
yourself a histogram.
