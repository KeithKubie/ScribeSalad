00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.010
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Isuke so right now, my wife and I are actually building a house and

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.830
as part of that, we need to configure the basement for

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.500
the house. I've taken a list of some of the requirements for this basement and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.920
listed them over here on the left. And on the right, I have the variables that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.690
we need to assign values to, we have things like the width of the utility

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.880
closet, the length of the stairwell, we also had two additional rooms,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.590
each must have their own length and width. So try to configure our basement,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.790
such that we meet all the different requirements listed over here on the left,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.222
write a number in each of these blanks.
