00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:04.042
In the last video we saw why when we take any non-zero number

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.686
divided by zero why mathematicians have left that as being undefined.

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:12.355
But it might have raised a question in your brain. What about

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:16.534
zero divided by zero? Isn't there an argument

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:20.343
why that could be defined? So we're gonna think about zero

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:24.615
divided by zero. Well there's a couple of lines of reasoning here.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.033
One, you could start taking numbers closer and closer to zero

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.002
and dividing them by themselves.

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:34.600
So for example, you take 0.1 divided by 0.1.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.200
Well that's gonna be one. Let's get even closer to zero:

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.863
0.001 divided by 0.001. Well, that also equals one.

00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:54.197
Let's get super close to zero: 0.000001 divided by 0.000001.

00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:58.005
Well once again, that also equals one. And it didn't even matter whether

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.700
these were positive or negative. I could make these negative and I'd still get the same result.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.340
Negative this thing divided by negative this thing still gets me to one.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.005
So based on this logic you might say, "Hey, well this seems like a pretty reasonable argument for

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:18.532
zero divided by zero to be defined as being equal to one. "

00:01:18.532 --> 00:01:24.337
But someone could come along and say, "Well what happens if we divide zero by numbers closer and closer to zero;

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:29.367
not a number by itself, but zero by smaller and smaller numbers, or numbers closer and closer to zero."

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:41.194
And so they say, "For example, zero divided by 0.1, well that's just going to be zero. Zero divided by 0.001,

00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:50.668
well that's also going to be to zero. 0 divided by 0.000001 is also going to be equal to zero."

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:54.424
And it didn't matter whether we were dividing by a positive or negative number.

00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:57.489
Make all of these negatives, you still get the same answer.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:03.015
So this line of reasoning tells you that it's completely legitimate, to think at least that maybe

00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:09.842
zero divided by zero could be equal to zero. And these are equally valid arguments.

00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:15.415
And because they're equally valid, and frankly neither of them is consistent with the rest of mathematics,

00:02:15.415 --> 99:59:59.999
once again mathematicians have left zero divided by zero as undefined.
