00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.399
Starry night socks and a gun that shoots

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.319
ketchup onto your food.
It's episode 22 of LÜT.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.620
First, let's break the ice... or let the ice

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.359
do the breaking itself as a hammer.
Of course, this hammer lets you open bottles.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.550
When you pour out the contents, be sure
it's into a pint glass wearing a Batman

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.830
cape.
Pour some water into this fish tank, it's

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.269
cute and small and completely powered by your USB

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.430
port.
Hey look, pants. Scratch and sniff pants.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.910
The fabric literally has raspberry
perfume scent capsules baked

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.390
into it, which break when scratched
releasing the smell.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.550
Now if you hate pants, don't wear any.
Don't even wear a skin for that matter.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.660
These leggings look like your muscles.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.370
If you're going to be apart from you
love on Valentine's Day, send them a kiss

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.960
with Kissenger.
Two robots connected wirelessly,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.219
so that when you kiss one,
the other robot relays that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.260
kiss so the other person feels it,
wherever they are.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.619
ThisIsWhyImBroke.com features
amazing things. For instance,

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.700
brake light decal masks to make your
brake lights look like this.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.280
On Amazon, I also found a Superman,
tropical fish

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.920
hibiscus flowers, skulls, or this

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.360
really literal one.
They also have "Word as

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.970
Image," a fun book that uses the letters
and words to suggest what the word means.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.160
For instance: vampire, smile,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.640
clock.
You can see more words like that

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.060
and see them animated by following a link to
video in this video's description where

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.159
links to everything

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.180
can be found.
When your dog fetches

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.600
this ball, it'll look like he's got a big
old flappy tongue. They're

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.700
currently out of stock, but this one
isn't, which when held in a dog's mouth,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.030
gives it a moustache. If you're looking
for great gift ideas, try doing the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.280
opposite. The worst gift ever.
This fun little package literally contains

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.860
nothing

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.310
but socks and underwear.
More exciting is disney couture.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.820
An oversized castle ring or a double-ring

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.590
that puts all the dwarves on your hand.
If you like your accessories more practical,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.730
try out some working thermometer earrings,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.489
a compass necklace or some Phillips head screw

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.910
earrings.
Ouchie Wow Wow! Piranha Plant earrings are

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.860
always a good idea, but you can keep it
8-bit with Mr Dandy's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.390
pendants asteroids.
Or this one, he calls not Pac-man,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.750
but Pukeman. Have a ball while snuggling
with your soft plush

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.690
testicle or ovary or bladder

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.030
or brain or intestines or anatomical

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.050
heart. For more heart shaped items, let's
talk heart-shaped

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.930
umbrellas, paper clips,
a warm heart-shaped hot water bottle

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.950
or these measuring cups on FredFlare
who also carry a neat bed of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.460
tulips USB hub,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.680
a frog you add water to to get yourself
a prince, a map of the world

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.220
to scratch off where you've been,
a log to rest your head on -

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.050
don't worry it's a pillow - and the only
thing your hamburger phone

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.900
really needs...
French fries flavored lip balm

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.420
Oh, NeatoShop also has hearts stuff, like
an anatomical heart

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.470
pencil holder.
They'll also provide balloon animal

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.569
book ends. A zombie cupid figurine,

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.930
a devilish skin for your iPad or a snap
suit for your baby that says

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.310
"ipood." Before it was poo, it was cake
served on a high heel shoe,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.549
but if you want something darker,
check out Despair Inc's

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.769
BitterSweets - candy hearts that say things like

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.739
"So so alone," "Aging poorly"

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.739
or "Dog is cuter."
This special fabric dye

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.299
is sensitive to light,
so you can mix it up, paint it on a shirt

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.110
and then leave it in the Sun to develop
actual photographs from negatives.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.970
Oh, and that fashion hanky in your shirt pocket?
It can be

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.370
a notepad. 
Sushibooties let you wear sashimi

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.349
as slippers.
They also carry fortune cookie baby booties,

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.730
a nunchuck pillow and for the baby
a nunchuck rattle.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.989
This is Naomi Kyle's autograph.
You can't

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.280
have this one, but for more awesome
things you can buy online,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.799
check out her show on IGN's new channel, Start.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.859
The whole channel's great and she goes
in-depth into awesome things you can

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:22.440
actually

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.320
own. And unlike LÜT, they actually give
away some of the stuff they cover

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.520
to lucky viewers.
So go check that out...

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.440
And as always,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.320
thanks for watching.
