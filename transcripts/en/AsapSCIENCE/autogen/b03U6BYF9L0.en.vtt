00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.560
 The number of people who abstain from vaccinating themselves and their children has increased over the last few years 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.920
 Listening to their justifications may disappoint you 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.020
 In this section, we therefore want to list and respond to the most common points of argument, one by one 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.000
 So we can help you clarify the facts when you encounter someone next time 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.300
 Why do not I feed my children !? 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.700
 Point # 1: 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:28.180
 Because the vaccines contain MSG, Anti-freeze and formaldehyde as well as aluminum, lead and mercury 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.940
 True, vaccines contain chemicals 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.180
 Some vaccines contain mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde. All substances may cause poisoning 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.660
 But do you know what also causes poisoning? 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.640
 Water at high doses, even apples and coffee. And anything in fact if it was dealt with excessively 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.260
 The important thing is not the substance, but the important dose 

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:49.720
 The doses of these substances and minerals are very few, making them (non) toxic 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 For example, aluminum is added to make vaccination more effective 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.520
 Its dose in dose is about one part of 10 milligrams 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.540
 In contrast, the natural person takes the equivalent of 30 to 50 milligrams in food and drink daily !! 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.100
 This amount is equivalent to more than one dose every day !! 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 Although some warn of the presence of mercury 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.280
 Such as thymerasol, a preservative that is present so that vaccines do not contaminate harmful bacteria 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.360
 In fact, this substance has been eliminated in most vaccinations given to children since 2001 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 This was even reassuring parents of children (after rumors spread) and not because it is harmful to the dose in the vaccination 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.280
 Question # 2: I do not give my children anything but natural 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.335
 Natural quinoa is better than plant biscuits 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.840
 It is obvious that the natural thing is better than the factory, do not you agree with me? 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
 Therefore, the best immunity the child gets is natural, without vaccination and accompanying pain 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:52.560
 Vaccines enter weakened bacteria into the body, so that the immune system recognizes them and learns to deal with them in the future 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.340
 It is true that newborns have a natural protection against diseases, because they get antibodies through breast-feeding 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 And the thousands of germs they have been exposed to since they were born 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.100
 But vaccinations cover diseases, which children can not be immune to when they are born 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.720
 Vaccinations do not include all possible diseases 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.540
 But only diseases that are dangerous 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.320
 Children are vaccinated at a very young age because this is the most time they are exposed to serious complications of the disease 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.860
 Question # 3: What about allergies !? My relative tasted her son, and now he has an allergy to nuts! 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.680
 I do not want my son to be allergic 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.320
 Beginning in 1997, the question was whether there was a link between vaccines and allergies 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.480
 The study of 2100 children aged between 5-6 years. The researchers found that in fact vaccinations have the opposite effect, the proportion of people with allergies is lower in both restaurants 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.640
 Point 4: Originally these diseases are not that bad, why vaccination !? 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.400
 This is my strong child carrying my genes, not afraid of these diseases. What if measles hit him! What's the worst that can get !? 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.560
 Over the years, vaccinations have succeeded in our diets from many diseases, to the extent that we no longer realize the seriousness of these diseases because we may not have seen them beforehand 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.660
 But this is the picture of those diseases without vaccinations 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.140
 In 1967, smallpox caused millions of deaths 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.460
 In 1980, the number of smallpox deaths was zero 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.700
 Before polio vaccination 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.220
 Between 13 and 20 thousand cases in America alone were infected each year 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.640
 These children needed crutches or chairs to support them in their movement and in some cases of devices that help them to breathe! 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.720
 Between 1964 and 1965 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:36.320
 Before the presence of measles vaccination, received 2,100 fetal deaths and 11,250 abortions, in addition to 20,000 children infected with the disease, 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.660
 Half of them were tainted, more than 3,000 were blind, and 1,800 were mentally retarded 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.640
 As for measles, and prior to the vaccination, the disease was affecting almost all the population of the United States, because the disease has a tremendous ability to move and infection 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:58.300
 WHO estimates that because of vaccination against it, we have managed to avoid more than 20 million deaths from measles - around the world - in the last 16 years 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.080
 Point # 5: Well, but you have not touched on ... Autism !! 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.920
 Most groups that warn against vaccination are associated with this paper, published in the late 1990s that claimed a link between vaccination and autism 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.540
 The proposed link was that the MMR vaccine caused gastrointestinal dysfunction, which in turn caused the emergence of autism in children 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:25.100
 A few years later, it was discovered that the study was fabricated in the cases in which it was written. The results were denied by 25 large studies that tried to find this link and did not find it 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.940
 In addition, 10 out of 13 authors of the first study announced that they would like to withdraw their names, since they no longer supported the study result 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.640
 While parents' fear of their children can be understood, the link between vaccination and autism has no scientific basis !! 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.640
 Point # 6: There should be a common choice between parents and the state 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.660
 Question # 6: No one knows what benefits their children more than you (parents). This option will only affect you and your children 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.540
 In fact, this is not true. Vaccinations are not only about protecting your children, but also protecting other people. 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.100
 A child who is not ill does not transmit infection to those around him, and those who may be less able to cope with the disease, such as the elderly and newborn babies 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.000
 Or those who can not take the vaccination because of their health status. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.340
 Such as patients treated with chemotherapy 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.560
 The more people are vaccinated, the more difficult the bacteria will spread in society 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.980
 This concept is called "community immunity" or "herd immunity" 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.980
 For those who can not cope with the disease, community immunity is the only way to protect them 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:35.020
 Point 7: Intelligence agencies, pharmaceutical companies, factories .. They all conspire against us and we should not trust them! And witness how many drugs were withdrawn from the market. The goal won them! 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.660
 Confirmation Drug companies win the sale of vaccines 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.580
 The size of the vaccine market is estimated at $ 24 billion. Very large number! 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.900
 But if you want to talk about real profit! This is a study of the profits from the sale of vaccines in the United States between 1994 and 2013 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.240
 Vaccinations provided pharmaceutical companies $ 295 billion during these years. And provided the state and society $ 138,000 billion !! Of the cost of treating these diseases. 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.460
 True, there are medicines that have been withdrawn from the market after the emergence of side effects were not known before 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:12.260
 However, vaccinations remain among the most highly regulated and continuous pharmaceutical products. Because they are given to healthy people (as a preventive rather than therapeutic measure), most of them children 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.840
 Vaccinations undergo several stages of testing, to determine the most appropriate dose, to be the safest and most effective 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.760
 In Canada and the United States, the vaccine may take between 10 and 25 years of testing before obtaining a permit to issue 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.380
 Even after it has been released for use 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.520
 There is continued control over it. 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:39.240
 The incidence of severe side effects of vaccination, such as the MMR vaccine, is close to 1 in every million restaurants. Less than one of us gets hit by lightning from the sky
