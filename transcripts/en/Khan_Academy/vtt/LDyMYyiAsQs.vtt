00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.940
We're on problem 138.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.870
In a certain business production
index, p is

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.810
directly proportional to
efficiency index e.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.379
So we could say that p is equal
to some proportionality

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.560
constant times e.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.590
Because they say p is directly
proportional to e.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.280
Fair enough.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.130
Which is, in turn, directly
proportional to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.180
investment index i.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.470
So e is proportional to i.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.980
So we could say it's equal
to some proportionality

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.255
constant times i.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:35.510
And actually, we could go even
a step further and say, well,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.060
if p is proportional to e and
e is proportional to i, we

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.610
could also say that p is
proportional to i.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.610
Directly proportional to i.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.100
So it might be some other
constant times i.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.630
And you could prove that
mathematically, right?

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.010
You take this and substitute
it for e and you get p is

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.090
equal to k times e, e is equal
to some constant times i, and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.920
so p is equal to kn times i.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.129
But k and n were both arbitrary
constants, so we

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.810
could just call that m.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.310
So this is the information that
the problem gives us.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.370
p is proportional to e, e is
proportional to i, so p is

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.480
also proportional to i.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.170
So what are they asking us?

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.120
What is p if i is equal to 70?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.450
So if we knew this proportional

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.500
constent, we'd be all set.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.700
We could actually solve
this problem.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.280
Maybe they're going to go
through e or something, I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
don't know.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.520
So statement number one.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.380
e is equal to 0.5 when
e is equal to 60.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260
Well, we can definitely use
this information to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.690
figure out what n is.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.180
But that by itself isn't going
to help us, because we can

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.070
figure out what n is and then
once we know what n is, we can

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.970
figure out what e
is when i is 70.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.490
We'll put 70 here times whatever
we figure out n is.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.930
And we'll get e.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.750
But without knowing what k is,
that still won't help us.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.199
So statement one, by itself,
if I'm right, isn't right.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.979
That won't help us.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.180
And I'll show it to you.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.560
Oh, this would be waste
of time if you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.100
understood that logic.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.870
Because you can say 0.5 is equal
to n times 60-- this is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.090
so we can solve for n-- so n
is equal to 0.5 over 60.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.660
That's the same thing
as 1/120.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.740
So then that equation
boils down to e is

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.990
equal to i over 120.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.940
1/120 times i.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.470
So when i is equal to 70, e
would be equal to 70/120,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.270
which is equal to 7/12.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.220
But that still doesn't
help us.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.810
E is equal to 7/12, but we don't
know what k is, right?

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.640
When i is equal to 70, e is
7/12, so we still don't know

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.480
what k is based on just the
information in statement one.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.470
So as far as I can tell
right now, one by

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.380
itself-- not so useful.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.630
Statement two.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.850
p is equal to 2 when
i is equal to 50.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.090
Well, this is useful.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.300
Because we already said,
p is proportional to i.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.020
P is equal to some constant
m times i.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.930
So we could use this information
to solve for m.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.240
So p is equal to 2 when
i is equal to 50.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.230
Divide both sides by 50, you
get m is equal to 1/25.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.810
So the question was, what is
p when i is equal to 70?

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.430
So we could just say p is
equal to m times i.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.050
Well, i now is 70.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.760
And whatever 70 divided
by 25 is, that's p.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.530
So statement two alone
was sufficient

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.570
to solve this problem.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.670
And statement one didn't
help us much.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.450
Next problem.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.430
139.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.750
If x does not equal minus y--
that's interesting-- is x

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.300
minus y over x plus
y greater than 1.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.410
So why do they say x does
not equal minus 1?

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.090
I'm sorry. x does now
equal minus y.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.500
Well, if x were equal to minus
y, if this were minus y, then

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.870
you'd have minus y plus y, the
denominator would be 0, and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.700
you'd be undefined.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.260
So maybe that's why they
put that out there.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.400
Let's see, I think we can
simplify this statement.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.740
So we could multiply both
sides by x plus y.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.420
You get x minus y is greater
than x plus y.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.580
And so this holds
true if what?

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.300
Let's see, we could subtract
x from both sides.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.090
Subtracting x from both sides
you get-- just get rid of the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.140
x's-- you get minus y
is greater than y.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.710
Let's see, we could add y to
both sides of this equation.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.630
So the left side, if you
add y here, you get 0.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.370
If you add a y on this
side, you get 2y.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.870
And then you could divide both
sides of this equation by 2.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.430
And you get 0 is greater than
y, or y is less than 0.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.600
Either way.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.660
This statement is true
if, and only if, this

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.430
statement is true.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.950
So this is really all
we need to test for.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.810
Is y less than 0?

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.700
If we know that y is less than
0, we know that this is true.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.860
Or if we know that this
is false, then we

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.370
know this is false.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.770
So statement one.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.320
Statement one tells us
x is greater than 0.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.330
Well, this is useless.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.496
This actually has no bearing on
whether y is less than 0.

00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:33.450
x can be anything.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.630
It doesn't change this.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.020
So this by itself is useless.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.830
Statement two is-- well,
there you go.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.540
y is less than 0.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.390
So statement two tells us this
is true and this is true if,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.230
and only if, this is true.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.870
So therefore, statement two
alone is sufficient to answer

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.300
this question.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.260
Very seldom do you boil down the
statement to actually one

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.860
of the statements that
they provide you.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.330
But that was interesting.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.120
Next problem.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.560
140.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.840
In the rectangular coordinate
system, are the points r,s and

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.300
u,v equidistant from
the origin.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.930
OK, so they're essentially
saying, is the distance of the

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.510
point r,s-- distance from the
origin-- equal to the

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.150
distance-- I'll call it d sub
o-- equal to the distance of

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.430
the origin of point u,v.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.300
And here, just to get the
intuition of distance-- I

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.960
always find it silly that they
teach something called a

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.200
distance formula in high
schools, because it's really

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.410
just the Pythagorean theorem.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.290
And by calling it something
different and making you

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.370
memorize a different formula,
it'll just clutter your head.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.920
So this is the x-axis,
this is the y-axis.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.860
The point r,s will be here.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.460
This is r.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.030
This is s.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.510
This is the point r,s.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.230
What's its distance
from the origin?

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.550
Well, its distance from origin
is the length of this line

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.360
right there.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.300
What's the length of that?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.650
Well, we can use Pythagorean
theorem.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.810
The height right there is s.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.110
The base here is r.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.040
And if we call this distance,
we use Pythagorean theorum.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.610
r squared plus s squared is
equal to the distance squared.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.660
Or we can say that the distance
is equal to the

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.880
square root of r squared
plus s squared.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.530
The distance to the origin.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.280
So this statement up here boils
down to that the square

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.530
root of r squared plus s squared
needs to be equal to

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.950
the square root of u squared
plus v squared.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.260
Well, just to simplify things,
let's just square both sides

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.460
of this equation.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.630
The question they ask is, is r
squared plus s squared equal

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.880
to u squared plus v squared?

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.390
Is this true?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.210
That's what they ask us.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.610
And that kind of simplifies
things.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.670
Makes them more concrete.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.140
So let's see what the
statements give us.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.270
Statement one.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.290
r plus s is equal to 1.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.180
Just off the cuff, I don't see
where that's going to be

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.290
actually useful.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.400
It's not like you can just
square this. r plus s squared

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.880
is r squared plus 2rs
plus s squared.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.630
A lot of people make the mistake
that thinking, oh, r

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.950
plus s squared is r squared
plus s squared.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.410
No, that's not true.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.280
You have to distribute all the
terms and you end up with

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.080
three terms. So that's
not right.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.159
I don't see an r plus
s anywhere up here.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.980
Let's try statement
number two.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.960
Statement number two.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:48.620
u is equal to 1 minus r, and
v is equal to 1 minus s.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.790
So this seems like it could
be interesting.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.860
Because it allows us to,
essentially, reduce this

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.970
question, which is a question of
four variables, and turn it

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.050
into a question of two variables
by substituting u

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.530
and v with these things.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.940
So let's do that.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.520
Let's turn this statement into
a statement of two variables.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.450
I'll switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.840
So the left-hand side is r
squared plus s squared is

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.960
equal to u squared.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.480
Well, now they're telling us
that u squared is 1 minus r

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.725
squared-- plus v squared.

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.480
Well, v is 1 minus s.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.430
1 minus s squared.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.070
Let's just keep simplifying.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:33.080
r squared plus s squared is
equal to 1 minus 2, r plus r

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.935
squared plus 1 minus
2s plus s squared.

00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:43.530
Let's see, we could subtract
r squared from both sides.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.660
We can subtract s squared
from both sides.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:57.430
And we're left with 0 is equal
to 2 minus 2r minus 2s.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.100
And let's see, we can bring the
r and the s terms over to

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.610
the other side.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.000
So add 2r plus 2s
to both sides.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.210
So bring them over, you get
2r plus 2s is equal to 2.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.320
Divide the whole thing
by 2-- both sides.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.510
You get r plus s
is equal to 1.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.570
Interesting.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:24.340
So when you apply these two
constraints on our original

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.620
question, the question
gets reduced to this.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.870
If we know that statement two is
correct, the question that

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.570
the problem was asking gets
reduced to this: It's saying,

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.900
if we know that this happens,
then the question is true if

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.490
this is true.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.330
Well, just from statement
two alone, we don't know

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.130
that this is true.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.240
But, as you see, statement one
tells us that that is true.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.300
So if you use both statements
together, you know that this

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.290
question is correct.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.460
This question is true.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.520
And that was actually pretty
interesting and a little bit

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.270
hairier than normal.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.920
Normally, you can identify
immediately just

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.900
by eyeballing it.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.710
But anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
