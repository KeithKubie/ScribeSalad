00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:18.000
If there’s one thing everyone knows about
the mob it’s that they had an astonishing

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.650
number of ways to off the various wiseguys,
shysters and snitches who got in the way of

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.650
their business.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.760
The most famous of these methods is arguably
to send them to sleep with the fishes wearing

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.160
concrete shoes.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.690
But has any mobster ever been known to actually
do this?

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.370
Before we get into that, we would just like
to briefly point out that “cement shoes”

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.190
is sometimes used interchangeably with “concrete
shoes” when discussing this particular facet

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.260
of mafia murder.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.920
However, “cement shoes” is a misnomer
since cement is an ingredient in concrete-

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.280
the binder that holds everything together.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.400
Concrete, on the other hand, is a mixture
of materials like sand, gravel, and small

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.890
rocks combined with any type of cement and
water.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:30.229
Now with that bit of pedantry off our chest,
let’s get into it.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:02:00.899
To begin with, it’s important to explicitly
note the logistics of killing a person in

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.929
this way.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.679
The general method of making “concrete shoes”
is to simply place the feet of a person you

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.509
wish to make “disappear” into a bucket
filled with wet concrete and wait many hours

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.610
for it to set enough to throw the person in
the water without their feet coming out of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.610
the concrete…

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.000
For the mobster in a hurry, a quick setting
concrete is obviously preferred, though this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.400
still takes its sweet time to dry sufficiently
depending on exact variety.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.530
This is all something more than a little problematic
for the proper secure setting of the concrete

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.530
around the feet.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.240
However, once the concrete hardens sufficiently,
assuming it’s remained secure on their feet

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.340
and their squirming hasn’t given them literal
wiggle room, the person wearing the “shoes”

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.040
will be thrown into a nearby body of water,
the idea being that the weight of the concrete

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.700
will prevent the body from ever rising to
the surface.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.530
To doubly make sure of this, in some stories
the unfortunate victim is placed inside of

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.710
a much larger container like a barrel, which
is similarly filled with concrete.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.680
In these cases, the term concrete overcoat
is often used.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.040
As frightening as this all sounds, as you
might have guessed from that description,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.180
particularly given the latter’s incredible
weight and that there are much less elaborate

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.890
and time consuming ways to kill someone just
as effectively, there has never been a known

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.620
case of someone actually being killed in this
way.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.730
That said, if we detach ourselves from the
connection to the mafia- and just look at

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.400
murders in general- there has been one known
case of someone being made to wear concrete

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.020
shoes and then tossed in the water, just this
wasn’t how we was killed either.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.290
Further, there are numerous instances of others
having been found tied to heavy objects, like

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.710
concrete blocks, and then tossed into the
sea.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.500
In these instances, again, the people are
universally thought to have been killed before

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500
this was done.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.920
For example, two men known to be killed and
later disposed of in this manner include a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.310
hitman called Ernest Rupolo who was found
with concrete blocks tied to his ankles in

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.470
Jamaica Bay in 1964 and a racketeer called
Johnnie Goodman, the body of whom was dragged

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.640
from a river in 1941 wrapped in a heavy canvas
sheet and weighed down with a massive block

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.670
of concrete.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.650
When talking literal concrete shoes, you certainly
could wait around and let concrete dry, then

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.500
laboriously transport a struggling and noise
making already heavy adult person now made

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.920
much heavier to a dock somewhere and pitch
them into the water.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.060
But the logistics of it seemingly make it
something nobody ever really did.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.139
Rather, the nefarious of the world tended
to go with the easier route of just killing

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.449
them, then quickly transporting them to the
water and tying the heavy object on at the

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.930
last minute before plopping them in the drink.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.830
That said, this isn’t foolproof.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.020
For example- the aforementioned case of the
one and only definitively known instance of

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.919
someone made to sleep with the fishes wearing
concrete shoes- one Peter Martinez.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.669
Peter was a gang member whose body washed
ashore in 2016.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.789
As one Detective Robert Boyce noted, “This
individual was wrapped in plastic bags and

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.580
his arms were tied behind him and his feet
were submerged in concrete.”

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.379
At some point he was then tossed into the
water.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.599
It should be noted though that it wasn’t
drowning that killed him according to one

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.580
of the medical examiners in the case, Dr.
Barbara Sampson, who noted, he died of “asphyxia

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.389
caused by the covering of the mouth and nose
by duct tape”.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.550
While this doesn’t preclude this having
been done to him immediately before being

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.300
tossed into the water, it’s more likely
he was killed in this way many hours before

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.889
the actual dumping of the body.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.210
This hypothesis is supported by the fact Martinez
seemingly didn’t struggle when the concrete

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.080
was poured around his feet and left to harden,
at least, based on the way it set.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.729
So if there’s never been a definitively
known case of someone being killed in this

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.099
way and only one known very modern case of
someone made to wear concrete shoes and then

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.060
tossed in the water, where did the idea that
mobsters frequently sent people to “sleep

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.259
with the fishes” wearing concrete shoes
come from?

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.939
As mentioned, it is known that people, including
mobsters, occasionally do chuck bodies into

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.039
the sea as a means of disposal.

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.469
But as for the more elaborate literal “concrete
shoes” thing, one of the first known instances

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.280
of this being reported comes from a June 3,
1935 news article published by the Associated

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.659
Press discussing the disappearance of a bootlegger
called Danny Walsh.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.349
According to the report, after disappearing
under somewhat mysterious circumstances in

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:04.099
1933, a rumor had circulated in the criminal
underworld that, to quote the news report,

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.939
“[he] was stood in a tub of cement until
it hardened about his feet, and then thrown

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.539
alive into the sea…”

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.379
However, after extensive investigation neither
the police, nor any of their many informants,

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.520
could ever confirm the veracity of the tale,
nor ever locate Mr. Walsh’s body.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.090
It was after this widely reported rumor about
Walsh that the idea of mobsters giving people

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.949
the cement shoe treatment became relatively
common when discussing potential mob hits.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.210
But in the end, despite this being a common
trope for almost a century now, even something

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.219
mobsters have threatened from time to time,
there’s never been any known case of someone

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:37.659
being killed in this way.

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:42.400
On top of this, there has never been a case
of any police informant ever reporting such

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.449
had definitively happened.

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.110
Just as importantly, there is the impracticality
of it, and the fact that even with weighing

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.560
down a body significantly, they still sometimes
wash up on shore.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.129
We see this, among other instances with bodies
weighed down by concrete blocks and in the

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:00.909
one known case of someone actually tossed
in the water wearing two five gallon buckets

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:02.029
filled with concrete.

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:06.210
All this combined has most authorities firmly
putting the idea that mobsters used to give

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.469
people the concrete shoe treatment as a myth,
even if it is still possible there was an

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.669
exception or two at some point that was never
discovered.

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.969
Thus, while it is true that mobsters were
occasionally known to send people to “sleep

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.089
with the fishes”, seemingly for practicality’s
sake they don’t seem to have ever actually

00:07:22.089 --> 00:08:01.740
bothered to kill people using the concrete
shoe or overcoat method

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:30.610
and then tossing them

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.120
screaming into the water.
