00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.410
In this lesson we'll explore
the unique characteristics of the U.S.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.248
healthcare system, with a particular
emphasis on the mismatch between what

00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:14.180
it's good at and its structural issues
which contribute to poor management

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.380
of chronic disease, the problems that
account for most healthcare costs.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.730
Now it's time to meet Marla,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.090
a chronic disease patient who will
help us explore these issues.
